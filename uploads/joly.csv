There are exciting times ahead as we navigate through 2025. Australia’s hotel sector, whilst choppy, continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience with national occupancy rates at 71% and RevPAR up 3.8% to $171. Despite ongoing challenges, this growth creates a landscape ripe with both hurdles and opportunities.

Sydney leads the recovery charge with occupancy at 78% and RevPAR growing to an impressive $215, making this market our standout performer. Conversely, Melbourne and Hobart continue to face headwinds from supply increases and slightly softening domestic leisure demand.

In New Zealand, we see a similar dichotomy—Queenstown, Christchurch, and Rotorua benefit from returning international visitors. Auckland is grappling with increased room inventory, and Wellington is adjusting to reduced government spending.

Third-party management, stakeholder experiences, and technology integration are key trends reshaping our industry. Eco-certified properties are no longer niche but necessary, with major operators prioritising this. The premium/luxury segments continue to expand, particularly with branded residences attracting both domestic and international guests.

The premium and experiential hotel segments present compelling opportunities. Properties offering immersive experiences command premium rates as travellers increasingly value authenticity over standardisation. We’re also seeing strong performance in market mix diversity, where segments combine to offset the ups and downs of current economic and global conditions.

After subdued transaction activity in 2024 ($1.25 billion in transactions to October), we anticipate increased momentum in 2025 as interest rates plateau. While construction costs have tempered new developments, this has heightened the value of existing assets, particularly in supply-constrained markets. In addition, developers are also sourcing creative ways to deliver economically viable hotel projects.

Introducing 60 new international flight routes enhances Australia’s connectivity to key Asian markets, North America, and Europe, further strengthening investment fundamentals for strategically positioned assets.

For Trilogy Hotels, we are excited and optimistic about the future. We remain focused on markets demonstrating strong performance outcomes for owners while selectively exploring opportunities in emerging destinations where we can leverage these evolving consumer preferences and travel patterns.",https://www.hotelmanagement.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Novotel-Sydney-Parramatta-hm.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:35.467697

The potentially contaminated products were distributed nationwide and also shipped to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.
Symptoms may appear anywhere from a few hours to two months after consuming contaminated food and can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress.
While no adverse reactions have been linked to the recalled products, FSIS is encouraging anyone concerned about potential illness to seek medical attention.
This recall adds to growing concern over food safety after reports showed a spike in U.S. food recalls and hospitalizations linked to contaminated products in 2024.","Kraft Heinz has issued a massive recall of more than 367,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer turkey bacon over fears of Listeria contamination—a serious foodborne threat that can lead to hospitalization and even death.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the fully cooked turkey bacon was produced between April 24 and June 11, 2025. The potentially contaminated products were distributed nationwide and also shipped to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

The affected items include:

12-oz. vacuum-sealed packages with UPC ""071871548601,"" dated between July 18 and August 2 with lot code “RS40”

36-oz. packages (three 12-oz. packs) with UPC “071871548748,” dated July 23 to September 4 and lot codes “RS19,” “RS40,” or “RS42”

48-oz. packages (four 12-oz. packs) with UPC ""071871548793,” dated July 18 to September 4 and lot codes ""RS19,"" ""RS40,"" or ""RS42""

No illnesses have been reported to date, but FSIS warned that the products could still be sitting in home refrigerators or freezers. Consumers are urged not to eat the recalled turkey bacon and to either throw it away or return it to the store where it was purchased.

Listeria monocytogenes, the contaminant in question, is a resilient bacteria that can grow even at refrigerated temperatures.

Infections can cause serious illness, particularly for pregnant women, newborns, seniors, and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may appear anywhere from a few hours to two months after consuming contaminated food and can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress.

The contamination was discovered through routine internal testing by Kraft Heinz. While no adverse reactions have been linked to the recalled products, FSIS is encouraging anyone concerned about potential illness to seek medical attention.

This recall adds to growing concern over food safety after reports showed a spike in U.S. food recalls and hospitalizations linked to contaminated products in 2024. It also places renewed pressure on major brands like Kraft Heinz to strengthen safety protocols and maintain public trust as consumer scrutiny over labeling and contamination risks intensifies.",https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE2MTgzMDU5NDMzNjYxODA3/kraft-heinz-reportedly-considers-sale-of-oscar-mayer.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:40.442236

ID33,Ralph Lauren,2025-07-09 02:40:19+00:00,CNBC,VC behind '996' work culture debate says 5-day weeks won't build billion-dollar startups,"Sawdah Bhaimiya, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/08/vc-behind-996-work-culture-debate-defends-7-day-work-weeks-.html,"The post went viral, to Stebbings' surprise, and sparked a debate on whether China's brutal ""996"" work culture — which means working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week — is needed in Europe.
The U.S. is home to the biggest tech firms in the world, such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple.
Harry Stebbings Founder of 20VC Seven founders and VCs shared why they're resisting the 996 push with CNBC Make It at the time.
But European startups are struggling to access funding at the growth stage.
Harry Stebbings Founder of 20VC Husmus' Wernér said that the right level of capital is needed for European startups to work intensely without breaking themselves.","Venture capitalist Harry Stebbings faced a wave of backlash in June after urging European startup founders to increase their work hours — but he now admits there's some room for nuance when applying his mantra.

Stebbings, founder of 20VC, a firm managing $650 million in funds, advised founders on LinkedIn last month that ""7 days a week is the required velocity to win right now,"" to compete with startups in Silicon Valley and China.

The post went viral, to Stebbings' surprise, and sparked a debate on whether China's brutal ""996"" work culture — which means working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week — is needed in Europe.

The conversation is rooted in a persistent stereotype that Europe's tech and startup scene is lagging behind the U.S. and China, which have produced trillion-dollar tech giants and are known for implementing long working hours.

The U.S. is home to the biggest tech firms in the world, such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple. China meanwhile houses giants like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.

""If you want to be a $10 billion company in Europe, competing against them [Silicon Valley and China], you can't do it on a nine-to-five, Monday to Friday.""

Harry Stebbings

Founder of 20VC

Seven founders and VCs shared why they're resisting the 996 push with CNBC Make It at the time.

""What Europe really needs isn't more hustle-porn, it's more aggressive funding,"" Sarah Wernér, co-founder of Husmus, said back then.

Speaking to CNBC Make It about the fallout, Stebbings said that he wasn't prepared for the criticism he received, and that his original post didn't apply to the vast majority of people who responded.

""I think it's everything that's wrong with Europe, that backlash,"" Stebbings said. ""We are fighting against companies being built in Silicon Valley, and speed and the ability to move fast, really determines success, in AI especially.""

He added: ""When you go to the Valley now, and when you go to China now, they are working seven days a week in the fastest-growing companies. It's that simple. So, if you want to be a $10 billion company in Europe, competing against them, you can't do it on a nine-to-five, Monday to Friday.""

'We should be working harder than ever'

As companies build more important products, Stebbings said the bar is higher than it used to be.

""We should be working harder than ever because we're working to solve more important problems than ever,"" he said.

But European startups are struggling to access funding at the growth stage. Atomico's State of European Tech report of 2024 showed that, since 2015, Europe's tech startups have missed out on nearly $375 billion in growth-stage funding, with founders losing out on a potential $300 billion in European investments.

""There is nuance. I'm not saying miss dinner with friends or family or just sit at your desk all day.""

Harry Stebbings

Founder of 20VC

Husmus' Wernér said that the right level of capital is needed for European startups to work intensely without breaking themselves. ""If a team of 10 is burning out to keep up with a 50-person U.S. VC or Chinese government-backed startup, the problem isn't their stamina, it's their cap table.""

However, Stebbings pinned this down to poor marketing and said Europeans aren't great fundraisers compared to their American counterparts. ""I don't think it's a lack of access to cash at all, and in terms of the work ethic there, if you think that you can build a $10 billion business and work five days a week, then I'm sorry to say, you're deluding yourself.""

Some founders have even been ""badly"" advised to include exit slides in their pitches, he added. ""That makes me feel sick, like I'm planning my divorce when I get married.""

In stark contrast, Americans are much better at telling exciting stories when they promote their businesses. ""I think, often in the U.K., we downsize in ambitions.""

996 is 'ignorant'

Ultimately, Stebbings admitted that he jokes with the ""marketing facade"" of 996, but that it's a more nuanced picture than working all the time.

""I think that's [996] very ignorant to do,"" he said. ""if you don't allow people breaks in there and a gym workout, it's just moronic.""

Stebbings said that 100% dedication is essential in the first five years — but that doesn't mean abandoning health, wellness, and family.

""There is nuance. I'm not saying miss dinner with friends or family or just sit at your desk all day, and I'm some horrible person, absolutely not. It's really important to turn off and have a couple of hours away from your computer and just be with friends.""

Stebbings himself tries to spend as much time as possible with his sickly mother, who has multiple sclerosis (MS), including walking a marathon with her every Sunday. He jumps straight back to work after.

But it's unrealistic to expect employees to adopt the same attitude, he acknowledged.

""One of the hardest things about running a company is you will never find someone who cares about it as much as you do, the founder… I think it's unreasonable to ever expect that they will work as hard as you.""

Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, previously told CNBC Make It in June that the focus on hustle culture in the tech industry is about ""a fetishization of overwork rather than smart work…it's a myth.""

He said: ""California is very good at telling stories, and there's a lot of mythmaking around the concept of what startups look like.""

Stebbings now agrees with this view and said hustle culture is ""over-glamorized"" in the States.

""If you go into a WeWork in San Francisco at 7 p.m., they're not all working like we see on social media... they overly pronounce it when it's not really true, but for the 0.01% in the Valley, it's so true, and they are there and working harder than ever.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108166954-1751461509661-2024_10_02HARRYSTEBBINGS7781_4.png?v=1751899126&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-07-08 23:58:59.567023

MARD is a measurement that compares blood glucose readings from a CGM to reference measurements, such as blood glucose from a fingerstick.
Glucotrack is taking an implantable device approach to address some of the challenges that people experience with wearable CGMs, Goode said, such as the lag time in readings when blood glucose changes quickly and irritation from adhesives.
“That being said, there are still common problems.” Most continuous glucose monitors on the market today are worn on the skin and measure the concentration of glucose in the interstitial fluid surrounding cells, which is then used to calculate blood glucose values.","Glucotrack, a startup making an implantable glucose monitor, shared data from a first-in-human trial in June during the American Diabetes Association’s Scientific Sessions. The 10-person study, where patients were observed inpatient for four days and for a week after device removal, met safety and performance endpoints.

CEO Paul Goode said in an interview that the goal of the study was to show that the device and the procedure to implant it were safe.

No serious adverse events were reported during the study. For accuracy, the results showed a mean absolute relative difference of 7.7%, which would make the device competitive with CGMs on the market, although Goode cautioned that the data is very early and the results were not statistically significant. MARD is a measurement that compares blood glucose readings from a CGM to reference measurements, such as blood glucose from a fingerstick.

Glucotrack is taking an implantable device approach to address some of the challenges that people experience with wearable CGMs, Goode said, such as the lag time in readings when blood glucose changes quickly and irritation from adhesives.

“If you look at CGMs, they're wonderful products. Many of us in the company have worked on one or more of those generations of products, and they've done a lot of good for patients with diabetes,” said Goode, who has worked for Dexcom and MiniMed, the diabetes tech business that was later acquired by Medtronic. “That being said, there are still common problems.”

Most continuous glucose monitors on the market today are worn on the skin and measure the concentration of glucose in the interstitial fluid surrounding cells, which is then used to calculate blood glucose values. Glucotrack’s device is different in that it is implanted in the subclavian vein near the collarbone and measures glucose values directly from the blood. Goode said the approach to implantation is similar to a minimally invasive procedure for placing a pacemaker — the CGM is placed two inches into the vein instead of into the heart.

Glucotrack intends for its sensor to last for three years, although it will still need to prove that out in a study.

Senseonics, which currently has the only implantable CGM on the U.S. market, received Food and Drug Administration clearance last year for the device to be worn for a year. Goode said the development is good for patients, adding that he expects Glucotrack’s implant to last longer because of differences in the devices’ placement and chemistry.

Senseonics’ device sits in the upper arm, in the subcutaneous space, “which is the most difficult environment to get something to work,” Goode said, while Glucotrack’s device sits in the bloodstream.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/V_wQW40bpYCa9RLw584LKY1pLw67ElJcAVnaUG1sD1U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HbHVjb3RyYWNrX2ltcGxhbnQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:53.431193

Creditcorp Expands Inventory Finance to Informal Workers

Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia

In a bid to avail the informal sector operators of its services, the Nigerian Consumer Credit Corporation(CREDICORP) has entered into partnership with Sytiamo Technologies to provide affordable credit to 10,000 market women across Nigeria.

The beneficiaries would be spread across 224 markets selected in 28 states with Ariaria International Market, Aba as the starting point.

At the inauguration of the initiative at Aba, the Managing Director of CREDICORP, Mr. Uzoma Nwagba said that it was aimed at expanding financial access to informal sector workers, especially women, who are major drivers of local economies.

“Supporting women with credit is not just a social good; it’s good business,” he said.

Represented by the Executive Director, Credit and Portfolio Management, Mrs Aisha Abdullahi, Nwagba stated that the affordable loans would boost the quality of life and financial inclusion.

He explained the preponderance or women beneficiaries, saying that “women are proven to be better custodians of credit, with higher repayment rates than men”.

“With 66.7% of our executive team and 50% of our management being women, this partnership aligns with our belief that empowering women leads to stronger, more sustainable communities,” he added.

The Managing Director of Sytiamo Technologies, Mr. Michael Ogbaa, explained the rationale for the partnership with CREDICORP, saying that it is the vehicle for delivering affordable credits to market women.

“Through the partnership, we are giving market women quick access to the capital they need to scale up their businesses and improve their livelihoods,” he said.",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/AXAMansard.png,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:20.653324

As tariffs on imports from China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh soar—reaching 69.1%, 20-40%, and 35% respectively—retailers are scrambling to adapt. For companies like Nike (NKE), Ralph Lauren (RL), and Tapestry (TPR), the challenge is twofold: mitigate costs amid spiraling tariffs and preserve margins while competing in a price-sensitive market. This article dissects how these firms are faring, why geographic diversification and pricing power matter, and which stocks investors should prioritize.

The Tariff Tsunami: A Sector Under Siege

The Trump-era tariff regime has reshaped the apparel landscape. China's apparel exports to the U.S. fell 52% year-over-year in May 看不出. Vietnam's tariffs, initially set at 46%, were reduced to 20% after negotiations, while Bangladesh's 35% rate now sits atop existing baseline duties. These shifts have forced retailers to rethink sourcing, production, and pricing.

The stakes are high: U.S. apparel imports from China hit a historic low of 9.9% of market share in 2025, while Vietnam and Bangladesh's roles expanded—but not without costs. For companies reliant on Asian manufacturing, the path to resilience hinges on two pillars: geographic diversification and premium pricing power.

Nike: Pioneering Diversification, Testing Margin Limits

Exposure:

Nike sources 50% of footwear and 28% of apparel from Vietnam, with 18% footwear and 16% apparel from China. The company's $1 billion annual tariff bill underscores the urgency to shift production.

Strategy:

- Supply Chain Shifts: Nike aims to reduce Chinese footwear imports to the “high single-digit range” by 2026, while expanding into Indonesia and Cambodia. It's also exploring Africa, Central America, and Eastern Europe to avoid overconcentration in Southeast Asia.

- Pricing Power:

- Raised U.S. prices, particularly on premium products like Air Jordan sneakers (up to $10 increases).

- Focused on high-margin performance footwear (running, training) over less profitable classics like the Air Force 1.

Risk:

Despite these moves, tariffs outpace mitigation efforts, squeezing margins. Vietnam's labor strikes and infrastructure bottlenecks—echoes of pandemic-era disruptions—add volatility.

Ralph Lauren: The Agile Luxury Play

Exposure:

Ralph Lauren sources 19% of goods from Vietnam and 15% from China, with production spread across five continents. No single region exceeds 20% of its supply chain.

Strategy:

- Geographic Flexibility: Collaborates with global suppliers to reallocate production to low-cost regions while maintaining quality. Expanded facilities in Cambodia and Vietnam reduce China dependency.

- Pricing & Technology:

- Targets less price-sensitive customers, enabling selective price hikes and discount reductions.

- Leverages AI for inventory optimization, reducing waste and aligning production with demand.

Edge:

Ralph Lauren's diversification and tech-driven agility make it a standout. CFO Justin Picicci's emphasis on “real-time supply chain adjustments” positions the firm to weather tariff shocks better than peers.

Tapestry: Quiet Strength in Margin Expansion

Exposure:

70% of Tapestry's production comes from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines. The company has exited China but faces lingering tariff pressures on Asian imports.

Strategy:

- Operational Efficiency:

- Achieved a 280 basis point gross margin expansion in Q2 2025 via operational outperformance (+260 bps) and lower freight costs (+20 bps).

- The Coach brand's premium focus (e.g., higher Average Unit Retail for handbags) drives profitability.

- Tariff Mitigation:

- Anticipated a 10% China tariff as “immaterial,” suggesting supply chain adjustments (e.g., shifting production to tariff-friendly regions) and cost controls neutralize impacts.

Wild Card:

While Tapestry's financials are strong, its reliance on Southeast Asia mirrors Nike's risks. However, its luxury tilt (Coach, Kate Spade) grants pricing flexibility absent in mass-market peers.

Investment Thesis: Overweight Premium, Diversified Players

The tariff landscape favors firms with two traits:

1. Geographic Flexibility: Diversification beyond Vietnam and China (e.g., Nike's forays into Indonesia and Ralph Lauren's global supplier network) reduces overexposure.

2. Pricing Power: Luxury brands like Ralph Lauren and Tapestry's Coach division can pass costs to consumers without losing demand.

Avoid:

- Companies with heavy China reliance or low-margin product lines.

- Firms lacking agility (e.g., overreliance on transshipped goods or inflexible supply chains).

Conclusion: Bet on the Agiles and the Luxe

The apparel sector's winners will be those that turn tariffs into opportunities. Nike's bold diversification and premium pricing, Ralph Lauren's tech-driven adaptability, and Tapestry's margin resilience position them as top picks. Investors should overweight these names while staying cautious on companies lacking both geographic flexibility and pricing leverage.",,N,,2025-07-08 23:59:02.826714

Mozee’s road-legal, 12-passenger electric vehicles aim to close the first- and last-mile transit gap that’s dogged dense urban zones for decades.

Now, the Arlington-based mobility pioneer has partnered with Dallas-based 46 Labs—a 13-year-old global business communications firm that calls itself “the carrier’s carrier”—to provide the backbone that keeps its driverless shuttles connected in real time.

Founded in 2012, 46 Labs operates the Peeredge Orchestration Platform, which handles daily voice and messaging traffic for hundreds of global carriers and Fortune 500 companies. Its infrastructure helps large operators manage multi-vendor networks and maintain service reliability at scale.

46 Labs’ system can track each Mozee shuttle like a separate mobile point, giving the startup real-time visibility as it scales up its mobility operations, according to the announcement. The network could also allow the vehicles to double as roaming hotspots during major events, the companies said.

Modular mobility, assembled in Arlington

Mozee’s AI-powered approach to what it calls “modular agile transit” uses self-driving electric shuttles and real-time route adjustments. The fleet, with vehicles that can travel up to 45 miles per hour, can flex to different needs, so cities, campuses, airports, and venues can adapt to shifting crowds and conditions.

The company said it wants to help cities move beyond the “transportation trap” and rethink how people connect.

“Cities are asking the wrong question,” Mozee wrote in a recent post. “Instead of ‘How do we improve mass transit?’ they should be asking: ‘If 20th-century transit no longer works, how will cities move people in the 21st century?’”

Founded in 2021, Mozee announced its headquarters move from Dallas to Arlington last year, which includes plans for a final assembly plant. The 87,000-square-foot facility is intended to serve as an advanced manufacturing site using 3D printing for some parts before final assembly. The city backed the move with up to $4 million in incentives, and Mozee has pledged more than 100 new jobs with average salaries around $100,000.

Mozee’s first major test bed is Arlington’s Entertainment District, with crowds from Cowboys and Rangers games, concerts, IndyCar races, and, soon, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

“The Entertainment District, with its frequent, high-volume events, offers a real-world setting to demonstrate the convenience and efficiency of our autonomous vehicles,” co-founder Hoyt Fuller told UTA’s The Shorthorn last year. He also noted that Mozee was exploring a potential pilot partnership with UTA focused on V2X, or Vehicle-to-Everything technology.

Networking for scale

Reliable, secure connectivity will be key as Mozee expands its fleet in real-world settings, according to the companies.

“Mozee is reimagining what it means to move through modern cities, and we’re proud to deliver the network foundation that keeps their vehicles connected,” 46 Labs CEO Trevor Francis said in the partnership announcement.

“As mobility continues to evolve, partnerships like this highlight the growing need for reliable infrastructure—built not only for scalability, but to help reshape legacy systems with flexible, future-ready innovation.”

Mozee Co-Founder and CEO Shawn Taikratoke said the partnership helps the company “lead the shift toward smarter, more human-centered mobility.”

The dedicated communications backbone is designed to minimize risk and keep the system running even during broader outages.

“This partnership helps us deliver the power of modular agile transit to meet today’s transit challenges,” Taikratoke said. “We’re proud to find a partner who moves at our speed to ensure our autonomous system remains responsive, secure, and adaptable in a dynamic operating environment.”

For both companies, it’s an example of local tech talent building real-world solutions close to home, with larger ambitions on the horizon.

“As two fast-growing DFW companies, we’re excited to partner to shape the future of mobility right here in North Texas—and scale it globally,” Mozee wrote on LinkedIn.

Once a cornerstone of American banking, Wells Fargo has navigated dramatic highs and lows over its nearly 170-year history. Today, under the unwavering stewardship of CEO Charles Scharf, the $1.93 trillion-asset institution is not just rebuilding trust; it's meticulously modernizing its operations and aggressively refocusing on its core financial services to reclaim its formidable position in the industry.

Charles Scharf's Path to the Helm: The ""Chainsaw Charlie"" Era

Charles Scharf arrived at Wells Fargo in September 2019 with an urgent mandate: to meticulously repair a bank profoundly bruised by scandal. A Harvard College graduate with an MBA from NYU Stern, Scharf forged his executive acumen during pivotal stints at Visa – where he served as CEO from 2012 to 2016 – and at BNY Mellon. His reputation for disciplined cost-cutting, strategic restructuring, and rigorous risk management made him the compelling choice to lead the turnaround after the infamous cross-selling scandal, which had already seen two prior CEOs depart.

Within months, Scharf earned the evocative moniker “Chainsaw Charlie” for his decisive actions, which included eliminating underperforming units and aggressively slashing discretionary spending. This wasn't merely about cutting costs; it was about surgical precision to streamline operations and reallocate resources where they could be most effective. By the end of 2024, the bank’s board unequivocally signaled their confidence, rewarding his efforts with a $31.2 million compensation package – a 7.6 percent increase on the prior year – comprised of a $2.5 million base salary, a $7.2 million cash bonus, and $21.5 million in long-term equity awards. This substantial package underscored the perceived value of his transformative, albeit sometimes challenging, leadership.

Rebuilding Trust and Modernizing Infrastructure: A Cultural Overhaul

Scharf immediately prioritized a fundamental overhaul of core systems and a radical strengthening of internal controls – efforts directly necessitated by the bank’s devastating 2016 fake-accounts scandal. That episode, where employees secretly opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts to meet aggressive sales targets, led to over $3 billion in fines and, critically, a unique seven-year asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve.

Under Scharf, Wells Fargo has poured significant investment into its risk and compliance teams, onboarding thousands of new professionals. They have deployed sophisticated fraud-detection software and, most crucially, meticulously rebuilt its entire sales culture. This monumental shift moved away from purely product-sales metrics towards genuinely rewarding positive customer outcomes. While such sweeping changes inevitably present challenges to employee morale and can feel disruptive, the strategic intent has been to instill a deep-rooted culture of ethical conduct and accountability from the top down. Branch renovations, emphasizing collaborative spaces and digital integration, further signal a tangible commitment to a more customer-centric future.

Core Financial Services: A Strategic Recalibration

Wells Fargo steadfastly remains one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. banks alongside JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. Its primary lines of business continue to generate significant revenue, though a strategic recalibration is underway:

Consumer Banking and Lending: With over 4,100 branches and 13,000 ATMs, this segment remains a cornerstone, serving retail customers with checking, savings, mortgages, and auto loans. While previously a mortgage powerhouse, Wells Fargo is deliberately de-emphasizing home-loan origination in favor of more fee-based businesses, focusing lending more on existing, deep-rooted client relationships.

Wealth and Investment Management: Through Wells Fargo Advisors and Wealth & Investment Management, this segment provides critical financial planning, brokerage services, and trust administration. This capital-light, fee-generating business has been a key focus during the asset cap period and is poised for continued growth.

Commercial Banking: Corporate clients rely on Wells Fargo for comprehensive Treasury management, asset-based lending, and equipment financing. This area is a prime target for expanded deposit-taking and lending now that growth restrictions are lifted.

Wholesale and Investment Banking (Wells Fargo Securities): This division offers underwriting, M&A advisory, and debt capital markets solutions. Having been constrained by the asset cap, this segment is now positioned for significant expansion.

In 2024, the firm reported a robust $82.3 billion in revenue and $19.7 billion in net income, powerfully underscoring a decisive return to profitability and operational stability after years of stifling regulatory constraints. The strong growth in investment banking fees and wealth management income reflects Scharf's strategic pivot towards higher-margin, fee-based businesses.

Turning the Page on Asset Restrictions: A New Growth Trajectory

In a pivotal development in June 2025, the Federal Reserve officially lifted its asset cap, a resounding signal of confidence in Wells Fargo’s extensive reforms and transformed governance. This removal marks the culmination of a painstaking journey and liberates the bank to pursue new growth avenues.

With this significant barrier dissolved, Wells Fargo is now strategically poised to:

Aggressively expand commercial deposits: Attracting new corporate clients and leveraging its vast nationwide footprint.

Reinforce Trading & Capital Markets: Scaling up fixed-income and equity trading desks to regain market share and boost fee income.

Increase lending across core segments: While home lending shifts, the bank can now grow its loan portfolio more broadly, particularly in commercial and investment banking.

This renewed freedom to grow is expected to enhance competitiveness, optimize its balance sheet, and ultimately drive higher returns for shareholders. Investor reaction has been largely positive, with Wells Fargo's stock experiencing a noticeable uplift following the asset cap removal, as analysts now view the bank as ""more than a remediation story."" However, Scharf has cautioned that the bank remains vigilant, with ongoing regulatory consent orders requiring continued focus on risk management. The road ahead demands a delicate balance: seizing growth opportunities while steadfastly maintaining the rigorous controls painstakingly put in place.

What is Wells Fargo CEO’s salary? In 2024, Charles Scharf’s total compensation was $31.2 million, including base pay, cash bonuses, and long-term equity awards, reflecting the board's confidence in his transformative leadership during the bank's turnaround.

Who is the current CEO of Wells Fargo? The current CEO and President is Charles W. Scharf, appointed in September 2019 and specifically charged with leading the post-scandal transformation and rebuilding trust.

What is Wells Fargo known for? Wells Fargo is best known for its extensive branch network, its diversified financial services—ranging from consumer banking to investment management—and its historic role as a ""Big Four"" U.S. bank, now also for its rigorous journey of regulatory compliance and internal reform.

Why is Wells Fargo in trouble? The bank’s reputation suffered severely after the 2016 cross-selling scandal, where employees opened millions of unauthorized accounts to meet sales targets. This crisis led to billions in fines, significant leadership changes, and a Federal Reserve asset cap that lasted until June 2025, from which Charles Scharf has successfully guided the bank's emergence.

Under Charles Scharf’s leadership, Wells Fargo is balancing the pursuit of robust business growth with the disciplined governance and cultural transformation needed to definitively prevent past mistakes from repeating. As it capitalizes on its newfound regulatory freedom, the bank’s enduring success will hinge on maintaining this crucial equilibrium – a testament to its arduous journey from crisis to renewed potential.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:31.247376

With over a dozen items affected—including electronics, appliances, food, and automotive products—shoppers are urged to review their recent purchases.

Whether it’s a risk of fire, contamination, or mechanical malfunction, here’s a breakdown of the recalled items and what you need to know if you’ve purchased any of them.

Costco Items on Recall

Anker Power Bank (Model A1257)

Anker has voluntarily recalled certain batches of this power bank due to a potential issue with lithium-ion battery cells that could lead to overheating. Although the likelihood of malfunction is low, customers are advised to stop using the device. Affected customers can receive a free replacement by submitting a photo of the unit with specific details, including the model number and the word “recalled” written on the power bank.

Anker PowerCore 10000 (Model A1263)

This power bank is being recalled due to a risk of overheating, which poses a fire hazard. Anker advises customers to immediately stop using the device and check their website for details on how to receive a replacement or refund.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

Reports have surfaced of weight plates detaching from the handle during use, posing a serious injury risk. Customers should immediately stop using the dumbbells and follow recall procedures for a fix or replacement.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires (Size 235/40R19)

This tire model is missing the required Department of Transportation (DOT) certification marking. While the tires meet performance standards, the lack of a DOT stamp could lead to improper use. Customers are advised to return the product.

Fresh and Ready Prepared Sandwiches and Salads

These ready-to-eat items, sold at Costco Business Centers in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Washington, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is a serious health risk, especially for pregnant individuals, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler

The tow handle on this cooler may cause fingertip injuries, including pinching, crushing, or even amputation. Use of this product should be discontinued immediately until further notice.

Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu (Item #1729556)

A specific lot (P140082) of this over-the-counter medication may contain foreign material due to a manufacturing issue. Distributed to select stores in the Midwest and Southeast, this product should not be used and can be returned to Costco for a full refund.

Midea U-Shaped Window AC Units

Multiple item numbers are involved in this recall due to water pooling inside the unit, which can lead to mold and potentially cause infections or respiratory problems. If you own one of these units, discontinue use and check if your model is included in the recall.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate Tires (Size 185/60R15C)

Michelin is recalling this tire model due to a failure to meet federal safety standards for endurance. Sections of tread rubber may detach from the tire shoulder, increasing the risk of an accident. Drivers should stop using these tires and contact Michelin for replacement.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer

Certain models have been found to allow the pressure lid to open while the unit is still pressurized, potentially causing severe burns. Consumers should avoid using the pressure cooking function until a replacement lid is received.

Segway Ninebot Electric Kickscooter (Item #1567456)

This scooter model may suffer from a folding mechanism failure, which poses a risk of falling. Owners are instructed not to use the scooter until they have received and installed a free repair kit.

Sublue Underwater Scooter

Battery packs in Sublue Mix models manufactured between June 2018 and March 2024 have a risk of overheating and catching fire. Affected models include MIXAW01, MIXAB01, and MIXSB01. A free battery replacement program is in place, and users are advised to stop using the devices immediately.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass 18-Pack

Some lots sold in Texas and Louisiana may be contaminated with pseudomonas bacteria, which occur naturally in water but can pose a health risk to individuals with weakened immune systems. Affected customers should not consume the product.

What You Should Do

If you’ve purchased any of these items, check your receipts or order history to confirm. Visit Costco’s official recall page for instructions on how to return or replace affected products. In most cases, you’ll receive a full refund or free replacement. Taking quick action can help prevent safety issues for you and your household.

Publicis as a platform Gaming, per Tonelli, is emerging as another channel alongside creators and influencers that Publicis Groupe has identified as major audience reach alternatives to TV and legacy media.
Those companies are technology and data operations, and they own all of their media inventory,” said Gaines.","Super bowled

Publicis Groupe’s ambitions were clinical and clear during the Cannes Lions festival last month where it launched an all-out challenge to TV’s untouchable – the Super Bowl.

The French marketing services group, which is outperforming its global holding company peers in the equity markets, launched a real-time campaign during the Cannes Lions challenging the Super Bowl by showing it can build the audience reach of one $8m Superbowl TV ad – with 127 million viewers – in a 24 hour window for somewhere between 5-25 per cent of the cost using influencers and creators.

The holdco has outlaid an estimated $650m in the past 12 months acquiring creator-influencer platforms - Captiv8 and Influencer – which it is wiring up to its consumer identity and targeting engine, CoreID, housed in data unit Epsilon, which it acquired in 2019 for upwards of $4bn. Publicis Group also acquired Australian-founded global retail media ad platform, Citrus Ad, in 2021 for $205m and locally it paid an estimated $30-40m for independent media agency Atomic 212° last December, announcing the deal the following month.

Next on Publicis' agenda to build out its legacy media eating audience ecosystem and compete with the global tech-media giants, which dominated the sprawling beachfront showcase instalments in Cannes last month, is gaming.

Big names and games

Zenith ANZ CEO Jason Tonelli told a breakfast briefing in Cannes last month, put on by iion, a specialist programmatic gaming adtech player. The firm houses tier one titles such as Call of Duty, Minecraft, Fortnite, FIFA and GTA – used by brands like L’Oreal, KFC, Lego, Samsung, Ikea and Coca-Cola to target the 1.4bn global gamers on iion’s “unified” platform.

Advertisers have jumped into the tech-media platforms because of their enormous scale and ability to allow easy access and targeting of their users, who leave an abundant trail of personal data captured and monetised by the global players. Gaming, however, has been sidelined for a decade despite a huge, highly-engaged user base.

Community and connections

Citing Zenith’s Australian single source consumer research panel, Tonelli said 78 per cent of gamers were playing every week, 28 per cent daily. “When you think about that from an Australian perspective, 56 per cent of Australians are watching television every day, so you're starting to see where this reach shift is starting to play,"" Tonelli said. “It's a lean-in environment, and we're all advocates for the gaming industry here. You're not leaning back. You're engaged in it. So there's connection and community – all those things are really important when you think about community, when you think about fandom, when you think about engagement, and when you think about attention – gaming delivers that. So now, with some data behind it, it's got scale.”

Unified programmatic games

“We’ve been talking about insurance here [at the Cannes session], we've got insurance clients too. When I start to think about insurance, where are young people? 18-24 year-olds for health insurance, car insurance etc, where are they going? They're going to social right now to be educated about insurance, they are not going to their parents like we did. And in social they’re using influencers or ChatGPT. But there's a wonderful opportunity if you think creatively about gaming and how health insurance plays a role. So what we need to do is be creative about how that solves problems for the consumer that's using those things.”

Tonelli said iion was the first time a programmatic platform had properly unified the disparate gaming sector to launch campaigns across multiple publishers with the IAB measurement standards in viewability and attention – iion, for instance, incorporates attention metrics from Amplified Intelligence in its reporting.

Publicis as a platform

Gaming, per Tonelli, is emerging as another channel alongside creators and influencers that Publicis Groupe has identified as major audience reach alternatives to TV and legacy media.

“It's quite interesting. I think when you start to consider some of our strategic acquisitions … when you think about Influential, Captiv8 and Epsilon, you start to see how we're helping our clients really build reach, build scale, and really think about identity as a solution,” Tonelli said.

“Some of the big conversations you're getting out of Cannes at the moment are really around experiences and engagement as well as efficiencies. And when you start to put those things together, I think influencers and gaming have a massive role in delivering those three things.""

Building out those platforms affords holdco agencies a greater degree of protection from their platform rivals now openly telling brands they can hand over budgets and outcomes and let their algorithms do the rest.

Some ex-holdco global execs think becoming platforms in their own right is perhaps the major networks' only hope of long-term survival. Dave Gaines, a former GroupM and WPP global exec turned founder at independent agency Media by Mother, holds that view.,

“49 per cent of the money in the [advertising] world goes to Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. Those companies are technology and data operations, and they own all of their media inventory,” said Gaines.

“All of the big holding companies are effectively trying to replicate that model. They're just trying to mirror those three large companies in order that they can compete and big clients, certainly in the US when you pitch, they come looking for those kind of things ... Alphabet, Meta and Amazon have reshaped the way that media is delivered.""",http://www.mi-3.com.au/sites/default/files/2025-07/Jason%20Tonelli%20-%20Lead%20Image%204.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:08:23.478222

A NEW HORIZON: Monument Advocacy is merging with Horizon Government Affairs, gaining a major boost in health care lobbying firepower in the firm’s first big private equity-fueled acquisition.

— Horizon pulled in $1.7 million in lobbying revenues last year for work on behalf of clients including PhRMA and McKesson as well as industry coalitions including the Health Innovation Alliance. Horizon and its staff will be folded into Monument, which brought in $14.5 million in lobbying fees last year from clients including Amazon, Starbucks, Waymo, Netflix, Albertsons, Alaska Airlines, Zillow and the Consumer Brands Association.

— The merger will give the combined firm a larger platform with which it can capitalize on the growing overlap between the tech and health care sectors on issues like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, John Murray, Monument’s chief executive, said in an interview.

— “For me, in terms of our strategy at Monument, health care has always been number one on my list” of acquisition targets, he added. “It’s an important part of the business, and there’s so much opportunity to cross-pollinate with our tech practice and our public affairs practice in particular.”

— That’s especially true now, with sweeping change coming to the sector as part of Republicans’ megabill, which is now law. “All of the health care pieces that are in the reconciliation bill now have to be implemented,” said Murray. “There’s a long road still to make tweaks and advocate on behalf of clients who want to continue to be a part of that process.”

— The combined firm will also be well-positioned to work on issues related to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement by drawing on Monument’s active food and agriculture practice and Horizon’s health expertise. “We see that as a huge opportunity,” Murray told PI.

— Murray called the Horizon merger the “first piece of a multi-pronged business strategy” powered by an investment last year from Boston-based Everlane Equity Partners. For Monument’s next expansion, Murray said the firm is eyeing a presence in California, New York, Texas and Florida in addition to more financial services capabilities in D.C.

BUSTOS LOBBYING FOR OPENAI: Former Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) has registered to lobby for OpenAI as the ChatGPT maker continues to grow its lobbying footprint. Bustos, who’s now a partner at Mercury Public Affairs, began lobbying for the AI giant back in May on issues related to AI policy, along with her son Nick Bustos, who’s also at Mercury, according to a disclosure filing.

— OpenAI has quickly ramped up its advocacy operations in Washington, where the firm dropped more than $1.7 million on lobbying last year. OpenAI retains three other outside firms — Miller Strategies, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and DLA Piper — in addition to its team of in-house lobbyists, but Bustos is the only former member of Congress currently lobbying for the company as it presses for a light-handed approach to regulating AI.

FIRST IN PI — FETTERMAN CHIEF HANGS A SHINGLE: Krysta Juris, who most recently served as chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), has returned to K Street to launch Two Lights Strategies, a government relations and public affairs firm.

— Juris spent nearly a decade working for the late Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid before joining the lobbying firm Subject Matter (now Avoq). She then moved over to public policy roles at Meta and Stripe before heading back to the Hill in 2023 to serve as deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff to Fetterman.

— Juris said in an email that she struck out on her own for a “more focused, hands-on approach” to advocacy. “Starting my own firm allows me to work closely with a smaller group of clients across sectors and bring the full weight of my experience to each engagement,” she wrote.

LEADERSHIP SHAKEUP AT AVOQ: Nicole Cornish is stepping down as chief executive of Avoq after eight years with the lobbying and public affairs firm, per PRovoke Media’s Paul Holmes. During Cornish’s tenure as CEO, the firm (then Subject Matter) scored an investment from Los Angeles-based private equity firm Coral Tree Partners, which enabled its acquisition of the PR shop Kivvit a year later. The merged firm rebranded as Avoq not long after.

— Cornish, who will step down at the end of the year, plans to “remain on the board and actively support a seamless leadership transition and continue to provide ongoing strategic guidance as the firm moves forward,” according to the firm.

FLYING IN: Nearly three dozen retailers are in town today for the National Retail Federation’s latest fly-in on tariff issues. The delegation was set to meet with around 60 offices on the Hill in addition to meeting with majority and minority staff for the House Small Business Committee and Senate Finance Committee, senior officials at the Treasury Department and representatives from the Small Business Administration.

— This is NRF’s fourth fly-in in as many months focused on illustrating the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs — to say nothing of the uncertainty caused by the administration’s constantly shifting goalposts and deadlines — on the retail industry.

SPEAK NOW: “The I.R.S. said on Monday that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates to their congregations, carving out an exemption in a decades-old ban on political activity by tax-exempt nonprofits,” The New York Times’ David Farenthold reports.

— The statement, made in a court filing, “seemed to formalize what already seemed to be the agency’s unspoken policy,” but it follows a yearslong push by Trump to revoke the so-called Johnson Amendment. “The National Council of Nonprofits, which represents 30,000 such groups, warned that allowing tax-exempt groups to endorse candidates could lead to a future where political groups use nonprofits as a kind of legal disguise,” per the NYT.

— The IRS’ shift is “not about religion or free speech, but about radically altering campaign finance laws,” the council’s president, Diane Yentel, argued in a statement. “The decree could open the floodgates for political operatives to funnel money to their preferred candidates while receiving generous tax breaks at the expense of taxpayers who may not share those views.”

FIRST IN PI II – AUSTIN DODGES SPECIFICS ON CONSULTING FIRM: Former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is defending himself from charges of influence peddling lodged at him by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) but didn’t answer most of their specific questions about his new consulting firm in a response obtained by Daniel.

— He told them in a letter sent on Tuesday that he “will continue to uphold the highest ethical standards” and “will abide by all relevant post-government restrictions and ethics pledges.” He said in the letter that he doesn’t lobby and won’t lobby in the future. During his confirmation process, Austin had pledged to not lobby after his tenure as defense secretary but the senators believe that his new D.C. strategic advisory firm doesn’t live up to the spirit of his promise.

— He didn’t answer whether he would help clients in “making communications [to] or appearances” in front of the Defense Department, whether he would work for foreign governments or entities, whether he’d recuse himself from issues he worked with as defense secretary, which clients he is working for and if they’ve had contracts with the Pentagon, among other questions. “At our firm, we believe that there’s no substitute for integrity, honesty, candor, discretion, and the highest quality of work,” he told Warren and Scott.

— “It’s extremely disappointing that Secretary Austin has undermined the public trust and refused to answer simple questions about his lucrative new role,” Warren said in a statement to PI. “At the very least, Secretary Austin should stop dodging our questions and be transparent with the American people. I will continue fighting to close the revolving door and root out corruption.”

— A spokesperson for Austin declined to comment. A spokesperson for Scott didn’t immediately have a comment on how he planned to try to get the answers he and Warren want.

In the last few months alone, we’ve seen Unilever dedicate half of its ad budget to social channels in an “influencer first” push, Publicis Groupe acquired Captiv8, and WPP created an entire influencer function for L’Oreal.

These shifts in the industry aren’t coincidental. The influencer marketing sector is projected to reach a global market size of $32.55 billion by 2025. Spurred by a seismic change in how consumers interact with media, 92 percent of consumers trust influencer recommendations over traditional advertising, and influencer campaigns led to a 24 percent increase in brand credibility.

As a result of this, brands are finding that micro and nano creators (i.e., those with smaller but highly engaged audiences) are proving particularly effective in creating authentic connections. This allows brands of all sizes to access scalable, credible storytelling. And businesses of all sizes are looking to tap into this channel, earning $6.50 for every $1 spent on influencer marketing, with the top 13 percent earning $20 or more, according to a recent survey by Tomoson. Influencer marketing is proving not only influential but measurably impactful.

AI as a Transformative Force in Campaign Optimization

Artificial intelligence is redefining how brands approach influencer marketing, offering a salve to the industry’s biggest Achilles heel: poor scalability. Typically, influencer programs struggled to keep pace with budgets. Every extra dollar dedicated to influencer budgets meant an extra dollar needed on the headcount to service that budget. Cataloging posts, identifying trends, reporting, managing approvals … every step required human engagement.

AI solves this issue by analyzing millions of posts in seconds. It can recommend the most effective formats, posting times, caption lengths, and even aesthetic elements tailored to specific audiences. Perhaps most critically, AI enables more advanced performance measurement. Sentiment analysis tools now assess emotional resonance and track shifts in brand perception, offering brands a more nuanced understanding of campaign impact than surface-level metrics alone can provide.

Not All AI is Created Equal

So the answer is simple, use AI right? Not quite. Not all AI models are created equal, and this point is especially pertinent for retailers. AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. If you’re using ChatGPT or an off-the-shelf equivalent, you’ll just get generic outputs. With retailers relying more heavily on a blend of influencer sizes than other sectors, this tailored information is crucial to ensuring campaign success. Retailers typically have more activations throughout the year than other industries, which adds even more complications. More influencers, used more frequently, to activate more campaigns.

A Move Toward Long-Term Strategic Partnerships

Tied to this is the move from transactional, one-off campaigns to long-term, strategic partnerships. These ongoing relationships help build audience trust through repeated exposure to a consistent brand voice, making the content feel more authentic and less opportunistic. A familiar creator whose brand reinforces the values and message of your own is like gold dust.

Long-term collaborations are often more cost effective, with better rates negotiated across multiple activations. Plus, creators who understand a brand deeply can deliver more informed, compelling content. Strategically, these partnerships allow brands to develop ongoing narrative arcs, using a trusted voice to communicate different aspects of their value over time rather than relying on fragmented, one-off messages from multiple influencers.

As influencer marketing continues to evolve, brands that adopt AI-powered tools, spread their presence across platforms, and cultivate long-term creator partnerships will be best equipped to connect authentically with audiences and adapt to ongoing change in the space.",https://network.napco.com/total-retail/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2022/05/GettyImages-1153698496.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:02:02.647038

Those levies range roughly from 25% to 40%.

Here is a breakdown on the potential tariff exposure for U.S. consumer apparel and footwear companies, based on where their manufacturing operations are located.

RALPH LAUREN:

Ralph Lauren produces most of its goods outside the United States, with about 19% from Vietnam and 15% from China, according to an April Raymond James report. The company said in May that supply chain is diversified enough to allow it to deal with supply disruptions.

NIKE:

Nike imported about 43% of its goods into the United States, according to Raymond James. Its sports footwear manufacturing is 50% from Vietnam, 27% from Indonesia, and 18% from China, according to Bernstein analysts. Sports apparel production breaks down as follows: 28% from Vietnam, 16% from China, and 15% from Cambodia. The company in June said it would allocate production differently to try to deal with the tariffs.

SKECHERS:

Skechers sources about 40% of its products from both China and Vietnam, according to Raymond James. The company has been redirecting imports away from China and relocating some production.

CAPRI:

Capri’s Michael Kors line is mostly produced in Asia, while Italy is its primary production source for Jimmy Choo. The company has been expanding production in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cambodia.

TAPESTRY:

Tapestry’s sources primarily from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines, which combined represent about 70% of its production, the company noted in its May earnings release.

AMERICAN EAGLE:

American Eagle sources primarily in Asia, Raymond James wrote. The company is reducing its sourcing from China in 2025.

ABERCROMBIE & FITCH:

Abercrombie & Fitch’s sourcing was as follows: 35% from Vietnam, 22% from Cambodia, 12% from India, 7% from China, and 25% “other” in fiscal year 2024, according to Raymond James.

LULULEMON:

Lululemon fabric sourcing is 35% from Taiwan, 28% from China, 11% from South Korea, according to Raymond James analysts. Manufacturing is 40% Vietnam, 17% Cambodia, 11% Sri Lanka, 11% Indonesia, 7% Bangladesh.

WASHINGTON, July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Allegiant Air pilots represented by Teamsters Local 2118 are raising serious questions about Allegiant's leadership after the company this week sold its failed Sunseeker Resort while continuing to stall contract negotiations for 1,400 union pilots.

The airline claims the sale of its unsuccessful hotel project signals a renewed focus on its core airline operations, but their actions tell a different story.

""Allegiant's executives have wasted billions on failed side hustles while refusing to fairly pay the pilots who actually keep this carrier in the air,"" said Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien. ""Allegiant owes our members over $200 million in hard-earned retention bonuses. The Teamsters demand accountability and a fair contract now from this greedy, corruptible employer.""

Allegiant pilots have been stuck in negotiations for over four years. While others across the airline industry have secured pay increases and improved working conditions in recent years, Allegiant has refused to pay industry standard wages and is asking pilots to make concessions on quality of life and scheduling issues.

Since March 2021, Allegiant's market value has decreased by 78 percent, with a current market cap of $1.3 billion. The company lost $520 million on the sale of its ill-fated Sunseeker Resort, which is equal to over half of the company's current market value. The sale of the South Florida hotel follows a pattern of frivolous spending by the airline. With impractical ventures outside its core airline operations, from sports stadiums to luxury hotels and golf courses, Allegiant has burned millions of dollars on corporate pet projects.

Corporate financial mismanagement has left the company ill-equipped to resolve outstanding contract negotiations for pilots, but the Teamsters continue to call on Allegiant to return to the bargaining table.

""Management at Allegiant has no ability to lead this company. They have no allegiance to the hardworking, dedicated pilots,"" said Greg Unterseher, Teamsters Airline Division Director, Above-the-Wing. ""The Teamsters Union has zero confidence that Allegiant will bargain in good faith, but this company must be held to account. We demand they return to the table and end the disrespect of working people now.""

Test and learn fatigue While Amazon holds a strong foothold in the retail media space — with the likes of Walmart trailing not too far behind — other retail media networks are working to prove their own unique value propositions.","Either RMNs deliver or advertisers pull back spend.

“This year, you’re starting to see more streamlining, more material partnerships start to transpire because [RMNs] understand that having the data alone is not the full story,” said Deanna Mulkeen, head of media investment at Wpromote. The full story, she added, is “data, scaled inventory, reach and eyeballs all through to closed loop measurement.”

Media buyers are focused on total commerce strategies, full-funnel measurement and total transparency in the off-platform push. Amazon may still rule the roost with its data and ad ecosystem, but other players like Walmart and Instacart are working to close the gap, media buyers told Digiday.

Here’s a look at how the retail media landscape is shaping up in the second half of the year:

Amazon and the AMC ‘Holy Grail’

In the retail media network arms race, there seems to be Amazon and then everyone else. According to media buyers, that’s because of the tech giant’s sheer scale, first-party data, and its demand-side platform (DSP) that’s been catching the eye of non-endemic advertisers. More comparisons are being made between Amazon’s DSP to DSPs like Trade Desk or DV360, per Mulkeen.

Amazon Marketing Cloud, however, seems to be “the glue” connecting top and bottom of funnel media, said Damien Bianchi, group media director of retail media and commerce at VML. That full-funnel effect is what retail media networks have been vying for in the push to off-site media, taking RMNs beyond on-clicks and ROAS to deeper, long-term business goals, like household penetration and customer lifetime value, Bianchi added.

“If you’re taking advantage of it correctly, you’ll know exactly what type of Amazon media to serve specific cohorts at very specific times of the year,” he said.

But Walmart and Instacart are still making a play for their share of the full-funnel ad spend and were among the flurry of announcements during Cannes inking partnerships around measurement and off-platform ads.

Blurring budget lines

Internally, brand budget lines are also blurring as retailers push to become full-funnel media channels. Historically, dollars were siloed — either labeled shopper marketing spend or national media spend, per the three media buyers Digiday spoke with for this story. But the type of spend is changing as RMNs expand their capabilities beyond search and display ads on site to encompass video, streaming and social commerce.

It’s less that dollars are being shifted from one budget to another, and more that brands are unifying brand and performance budgets.

“We’re not seeing dollars being pulled out of existing brand building campaigns just yet,” said Anthony Costanzo, chief analytics officer at Mile Marker, an independent media agency.

Off-platform push

Retail media is seemingly hitting its maturation curve. Retailers inked partnerships with streaming services, social media platforms and other third-party partners to extend media capabilities beyond their owned-and-operated channels.

But as much as the space has grown up, buyers say there’s more to go and they’re still left with questions : Who controls access to the inventory? Who controls access to the audiences and delivery of the media strategies? Is the retailer to own that strategy and provide it as a managed service or is the advertiser in control of the off-platform media?

To help get advertisers over the hurdle, retailers are offering incentives, like co-funding (or dollar matching programs) off-platform investments, opportunities to test new ad formats, dedicated resourcing support and, perhaps most importantly, measurement, per Costanzo. The latter is especially true for larger players in the space who have droves of data and insights, he added.

“Measurement is being used as an incentive for a lot of these partnerships, because it’s something that’s in such high demand,” Costanzo said.

Test and learn fatigue

While Amazon holds a strong foothold in the retail media space — with the likes of Walmart trailing not too far behind — other retail media networks are working to prove their own unique value propositions.

Whether advertisers buy into it comes down to sales as the appetite for testing and learning — especially as economic uncertainty looms — is shrinking, said Bianchi.

He added, “If brands are able to effectively create awareness and move product, move SKUs at a very effective rate on the bigger retailers right now, there’s not what I would call a compelling reason to do test and learns on smaller retailers unless there’s some kind of incentive.”

Heading into the second half of the year, retail media’s trajectory is likely one of more investment, but also more scrutiny and pressure to deliver at parity with the broader digital media ecosystem — think Meta and Google.

“This industry loves to talk about measurement, but in reality, there’s so much more sophistication that can be realized,” said Wpromote’s Mulkeen.",https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/retail-network-digiday_b0a4ee.gif,N,,2025-07-08 19:08:02.140340

Mars has continued to use synthetic dyes in its candies after backing off a 2016 plan to remove all artificial colors from its food portfolio.

The company reversed course after it found that consumer attitudes varied by country, with Europeans largely opposed to synthetic dyes, while others preferred artificially colored treats, according to the Mars website.

Synthetic dyes have come under fire recently from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who wants them removed from the nation’s food supply over potential health risks.

Some research has linked the dyes to behavioral health issues in children and places like Australia, Canada and the European Union generally have tighter restrictions on their use.

Despite those concerns, synthetic dyes remain widespread, appearing in nearly 1 in 5 packaged foods and beverages on U.S. grocery shelves, according to a recent study.

That study, published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, found that confectionery companies had the most products containing synthetic dyes.

The National Confectioners Association, a candy industry trade group, criticized the study, accusing the authors of having “major gaps in their analysis.” The NCA argued that chocolate and candy differ from other foods because Americans eat them less frequently, only two to three times per week.

Both Skittles and M&M’s list several synthetic dyes on their ingredient labels, including common dyes like Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. Mars did not respond to NewsNation’s request for comment on Tuesday.

So far, Kennedy has favored the carrot over the stick, encouraging companies to voluntarily phase out synthetic dyes rather than pushing for major changes in federal regulation. Recent announcements suggest the approach is gaining traction.

Food giants like Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestle and ConAgra have all unveiled plans to move away from artificial colors in their U.S. products. The question is whether they’ll follow through.

Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has expressed skepticism, noting that many companies have failed to keep similar promises in the past.

“If the FDA were to require warning labels on synthetically dyed foods, similar to the rule in place since 2010 in the European Union, there would be a much stronger incentive for industry to reformulate,” Galligan said in a recent statement.

Several states have taken matters into their own hands, passing legislation restricting synthetic dyes. In West Virginia, most artificial food dyes will be banned starting in 2028. California and Virginia have banned six artificial dyes from school food.

Meanwhile, beginning in 2027, Texas will require warning labels on foods or beverages made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives.

“We follow and will continue to follow regulatory guidance from the authorities in this space because consumer safety is our chief responsibility and priority,” the National Confectioners Association said in an April statement responding to Kennedy’s push to phase out synthetic food dyes.

While several artificial dyes remain, Mars has removed another controversial additive, titanium dioxide, from Skittles.

The chemical, which helps make candy appear shiny, was removed from all Skittles production at the end of last year, the company confirmed to Bloomberg in May. The ingredient was already banned in the European Union in 2022 over possible health risks.

According to its website, Mars is still committed to avoiding synthetic colors in its dinnertime foods.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/07/GettyImages-911654750.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:49.693108

ID18,Elevance Health (Anthem),2025-07-08 21:38:59+00:00,National Health Law Program,"Voluntary Industry Prior Authorization Commitments: Empty Promises, Little Accountability","Brit Vanneman, Ash Bliss, Alexander Cross, Daniel Young, Ian Anderson, Abigail Coursolle, Alicia Emanuel, Shandra Hartly",,,,,https://healthlaw.org/voluntary-industry-prior-authorization-commitments-empty-promises-little-accountability/,"These commitments appear to put more guardrails on how insurers use prior authorization.
Any lack of broad stakeholder representation raises concerns about whether the commitments reflect the interests of the people most affected by prior authorization policies.
At the time, they vowed to reduce prior authorization and increase transparency.
But without any enforcement, those promises went nowhere and the volume of prior authorization increased.
The commitment to process 80% of prior authorization requests in “real time” by 2027 also raises concerns.","AHIP, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association recently announced a set of “voluntary commitments” to “streamline” prior authorization and “improve patient outcomes.” Major insurers including Aetna, Centene, Cigna, Elevance Health, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare have signed on.

These commitments appear to put more guardrails on how insurers use prior authorization. In reality, they largely repeat existing obligations and may simply be a strategic attempt to deflect growing public criticism of insurers’ abuse of prior authorization to deny or delay care.

These commitments were developed during a roundtable hosted by Dr. Mehmet Oz. Notably, it’s unclear whether any consumers, consumer groups, or provider associations participated in shaping them. Any lack of broad stakeholder representation raises concerns about whether the commitments reflect the interests of the people most affected by prior authorization policies.

AHIP also released a policy brief to accompany the announcement, reasserting the importance of prior authorization as a tool for reducing “unnecessary” health care spending and as a “critical safeguard in patient care.” Yet, a large and growing body of research shows that prior authorization is a primary way insurers control costs while tripping up beneficiaries in red tape. This misrepresentation of harm calls into question the credibility of the initiative as whole.

Against that backdrop, a closer look at the commitments reveals that several simply echo the existing requirements already baked into federal regulation, including in the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Rule (“Rule”) finalized in January 2024. For example, the pledge to adopt FHIR-based technology for electronic submission by January 1, 2027, is not new. That deadline is already mandated under the Rule for many plans. Likewise, the promise to improve transparency by explaining denials in plain language and providing appeal guidance simply restates baseline requirements found in the Rule and required by the Affordable Care Act.

While some commitments mirror existing requirements that lend a degree of accountability (if enforced), other so-called “new” commitments totally lack meaningful oversight or accountability, relying entirely on voluntary compliance. For example, the pledge to reduce prior authorization volume by 2026 only “as appropriate” for each plan’s local market lets insurers set their own goals without standards, oversight, or consequences. These kinds of statements may sound patient-centered, but are meaningless without regulatory oversight. Another commitment – to have clinicians review denials – is already described by AHIP as an industry-wide “existing norm.” Even if that is true, there is no standard requiring plans to disclose who is making decisions, leaving consumers in the dark and unable to know whether the promise is actually being followed.

These same corporations made similar promises in 2018 and again in 2023. At the time, they vowed to reduce prior authorization and increase transparency. But without any enforcement, those promises went nowhere and the volume of prior authorization increased.

Other commitments are more limited than they appear. The pledge to honor existing authorizations for 90 days when a member switches plans only applies if the person has already started the approved course of treatment and only if the benefit is covered and provider is in-network under the new plan. That’s far from a robust continuity of care guarantee.

The commitment to process 80% of prior authorization requests in “real time” by 2027 also raises concerns. It lacks a clear definition of “real time” and creates incentives for speed over careful, individualized review. In practice, efforts to accelerate processing often rely on overworked clinicians or algorithmic tools that cut corners. A former Cigna medical director, for example, said that she and other doctors were pressured to rush through claim reviews without fully examining patient records. Her superiors were “more concerned about being fast than being right.” We have already seen how automation and AI tools can contribute to opaque, inconsistent, and clinically inappropriate denials. AHIP claims AI isn’t used to deny care without clinician input, but mounting evidence shows otherwise. Without meaningful guardrails, transparency, or independent oversight, this pledge risks increased reliance on the very technologies that have undermined trust in prior authorization.",https://healthlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/prior-authorization.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:58:47.851107

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — If you’re a Costco shopper, you may want to check your home for a few items the company recently recalled. Affected products include tires, power banks and air conditioners.

Consumers should stop using some of the products immediately, Costco said.

The following products were recalled:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257

This Anker Power Bank recall concerns a “potential issue involving lithium-ion battery cells,” according to Anker. Though the company says the likelihood of a malfunction is “minimal,” consumers should stop using the device immediately.

Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank — Model A1263

The Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank recall was issued over concerns it may overheat and pose a potential fire risk. The product was sold between June 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022.

Danby 8,000 BTU U-Shaped Window Air Conditioner — Model DAC080B6IWB-6

This Danby air conditioner recall was issued after it was discovered that the units can fail to drain water quickly enough, allowing water to pool — and may potentially lead to mold growth. The air conditioner was sold between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022. If you have one, Danby said to stop using it immediately.

Midea U-Shape Window AC — Items 1572673, 1657921, 1677429, 1768985, 2677450 and/or 2677429

This Midea air conditioner recall is the same as the Danby recall above, as Midea supplies air conditioner models under different brand names. The product was also recalled over potential mold growth concerns. It was sold between June 2021 and May 2025.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires

Bridgestone said these tires “do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements.” The company explains these tires were only sold as replacement equipment. The tires were manufactured June 2-22, 2024. Bridgestone explains customers can examine tires for four particular markings to determine if their tires are under recall. Tires must have all four markings, says Bridgestone. These are: 1) “Bridgestone” brand marking 2) “Blizzak 6” marking on tire line 3) “235/40R19” tire size marking and tire identification numbers of 1VR100W122224, 1VR100W122324, or 1VR100W100W122424.

Tires should not bear a “DOT” marking, says Bridgestone. The company adds that any tires reading “Blizzak LM005” are not included in the Blizzak 6 tire recall. Bridgestone says the tires can be replaced for free through Nov. 12.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C

Michelin said these tires fail to meet a federal safety standard for tire endurance, and “chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block.” The Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires recall only includes tires in the 185/60R15C size. The affected tires can be identified by their DOT sidewall markings, which will include dimension information, ID numbers and DOT start/stop dates, which can all be found in the recall notice. Michelin says replacement tires will be offered through Jul 1, 2026.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

Illinois Tech Professor of Food Science and Nutrition Indika Edirisinghe says it was time for the food and beverage industry to reevaluate the use of artificial dyes in their products, but he also warns that switching over to natural food dye doesn’t come without challenges.
“One of the big challenges with the natural color is stability and consistency—they are not as stable as artificial colors,” says Edirisinghe.
In particular, Edirisinghe points to a 2021 study that linked synthetic food dyes to an increase in children and adolescents being diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as evidence that the industry needed to reassess those dyes.
Though the timeline before fully transitioning to natural dyes varies by company—ranging from summer 2026 to the end of 2027—Edirisinghe says he is confident that the industry has enough time to properly implement any changes.","The color of your morning bowl of Froot Loops is about to change.

Major manufacturers including Nestle, General Mills, and Kraft Heinz have announced that they will be removing artificial dyes from their products within the next two years.

Illinois Tech Professor of Food Science and Nutrition Indika Edirisinghe says it was time for the food and beverage industry to reevaluate the use of artificial dyes in their products, but he also warns that switching over to natural food dye doesn’t come without challenges.

“One of the big challenges with the natural color is stability and consistency—they are not as stable as artificial colors,” says Edirisinghe. “Their lifespan is maybe weeks or a few months. Over time, they may degrade when exposed to environmental factors such as heat and light, resulting in discoloration. That’s going to be a challenge.”

Though Nestle says more than 90 percent of its current product categories do not contain synthetic colors, most of the products in the food industry that still do use them are targeted toward children—think breakfast cereals and sweets.

With some safety regulations having taken effect decades ago, Edirisinghe says that he thinks it’s the right time for the industry to take another look at those standards.

In particular, Edirisinghe points to a 2021 study that linked synthetic food dyes to an increase in children and adolescents being diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as evidence that the industry needed to reassess those dyes.

“In the last 20 years, the rate [of children with ADHD] has increased from 6 percent to 10 percent,” says Edirisinghe. “That’s a big jump.”

Another concern that Edirisinghe expressed is the amount of time that the industry will need to establish new formulations and comply with existing or new regulations.

Though the timeline before fully transitioning to natural dyes varies by company—ranging from summer 2026 to the end of 2027—Edirisinghe says he is confident that the industry has enough time to properly implement any changes.

“I think that timeline is feasible given the robust structures the industry has,” says Edirisinghe. “We are talking about billion-dollar companies. They have resources, they have money, and they can execute their plan in a short-term period.”",https://www.iit.edu/sites/default/files/2021-06/indika-orange_pomace_1280x850.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 20:02:55.610031

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.
The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.
The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.
The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states.","CVS Health's Omnicare has been ordered to pay $948.8 million over invalid prescriptions. The company is a leading American supplier of health products and services, with net sales broken down into medical insurance plan management services, medical benefits management, retail distribution, and other activities.

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions. The ruling, made by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan, comes after a lengthy legal battle that began in 2015.

The lawsuit, filed by former Omnicare pharmacist Uri Bassan and joined by the federal government, accused Omnicare of improperly billing Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for prescriptions at long-term care facilities. The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

Judge McMahon imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018, and awarded $406.8 million in damages, representing three times the $135.6 million awarded by a jury in April 2025. The tripling of damages was required under the federal False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment. McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying the company in 2015.

CVS Health has announced plans to appeal the judgment. The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed,"" CVS said in a statement.

The ruling highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the healthcare industry in ensuring compliance with complex regulatory requirements. It also underscores the importance of robust internal controls and oversight mechanisms to prevent and detect fraudulent activities.

The jury ruled that CVS Health, which acquired Omnicare in 2015, incentivized the unit to submit more than 1 million of those claims after the merger closed.
Given the volume of claims in the mix, the government requested $542 million in penalties against the company.
In addition, Omnicare was hit with $406.8 million in damages, far higher than the $135.6 million set by the jury earlier this year.
The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 by a former Omnicare pharmacist, and the Department of Justice joined the whistleblower case in 2019.","A New York judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare subsidiary to pay $948.8 million in fees and damages as part of a False Claims Act whistleblower case.

In April, a federal jury determined that Omnicare submitted more than 3.3 million fraudulent claims for prescriptions between 2010 and 2018, which led to $135.6 million in overpayments from the government.

The jury ruled that CVS Health, which acquired Omnicare in 2015, incentivized the unit to submit more than 1 million of those claims after the merger closed. However, the jurors determined that there was no injury to the federal government related to those claims.

Given the volume of claims in the mix, the government requested $542 million in penalties against the company. In addition, Omnicare was hit with $406.8 million in damages, far higher than the $135.6 million set by the jury earlier this year.

The damages were tripled as per requirements under the False Claims Act, according to the order.

""Admittedly, that is a very big number,"" District Judge Colleen McMahon wrote in the order. ""But this is a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct.""

The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 by a former Omnicare pharmacist, and the Department of Justice joined the whistleblower case in 2019. Omnicare provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities.

In a statement to Fierce Healthcare, a spokesperson for CVS said the company intends to appeal the penalties as ""the decision on penalties is unconstitutional, especially given the fact that there is no evidence that a single patient suffered harm.""

""This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing record-keeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,"" the spokesperson said. ""The dispensing practices referenced were limited to Omnicare, ended in 2018, were used by many others in the industry at the time, and were accepted by CMS.""

""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn’t have or that any patient was harmed,"" they said.

In the order, McMahon pushed back on CVS's argument that the penalties are unlawful.

""The violations in this case were both deliberate and egregious,"" she wrote. ""Omnicare was aware of the problems posed by its dispensing practices; it was warned again and again, both by employees and by outside (State) regulators.""

""Of great significance, Omnicare actually developed fairly straightforward means of resolving those problems but declined to implement them for years,"" she said.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-2165663502.jpg?VersionId=bRHkAfJ2udDglZzvCMsyawk_HBwEbJyM,N,,2025-07-08 18:04:45.377825

As part of that effort, Starbucks is testing a version of its popular egg white and roasted red pepper bites made with avocado oil.
Starbucks also tested unsweetened protein powder as a customizable add-in to its cold foam lineup, offering more nutrition-oriented options.
For Starbucks, that could mean cutting back on sugar in key drinks, expanding nutritional add-ins, and offering more customizable options.
If executed well, this strategy could help Starbucks reassert its leadership in the premium coffee space.","The strategy: Starbucks is testing better-for-you products in a bid to win over more health-conscious consumers, per Bloomberg.

The examples:

The company is experimenting with ways to remove canola oil from its ingredient list in a nod to rising consumer skepticism of seed oils, despite a lack of conclusive evidence linking them to negative health outcomes. As part of that effort, Starbucks is testing a version of its popular egg white and roasted red pepper bites made with avocado oil.

It has removed sugar from its matcha powder and eliminated the upcharge for nondairy milk, addressing long-standing complaints from plant-based and sugar-sensitive customers.

Starbucks also tested unsweetened protein powder as a customizable add-in to its cold foam lineup, offering more nutrition-oriented options.

Why is this happening? Starbucks is repositioning its brand amid a sales slump and intensifying competition from Dutch Bros and Luckin Coffee, which are connecting with younger, value-conscious, and health-minded consumers. To stay competitive, Starbucks needs to find ways to adjust its product offerings and pricing strategies.

Our take: Starbucks is making some necessary changes—but there’s still plenty of work to do. Consumers want brands that meet them where they are, and that means prioritizing ingredient transparency and wellness without sacrificing flavor or convenience. For Starbucks, that could mean cutting back on sugar in key drinks, expanding nutritional add-ins, and offering more customizable options.

If executed well, this strategy could help Starbucks reassert its leadership in the premium coffee space.","https://www.emarketer.com/content/storage/socialsharingdefault/default-image-share.png?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=628",N,,2025-07-08 18:06:02.320690

The coffee giant is currently evaluating these proposals and creating a shortlist of potential investors for the next bidding round. Starbucks plans to share financial and operational information with these selected bidders to help them assess the value of its Chinese assets.

While Starbucks initially preferred to sell only a minority stake to a partner who could help revitalize growth in its Chinese market, the company is now considering selling a larger portion based on valuation and other factors.

Prospective partners, including industry players and private equity firms, submitted non-binding proposals in June. Most are seeking a controlling stake that would give them decision-making authority and better align with their investment strategies.

Previous Title: CFO, BIC

Medtronic has named Chad Spooner CFO of its diabetes business, beginning July 14. Medtronic plans to spin out the segment into a separate, publicly traded company called MiniMed, with the goal of completing the deal within 18 months.

Spooner has more than 25 years of experience in financial leadership, according to the Tuesday announcement. He was previously CFO of consumer goods company BIC for five years, where he played a key role in a strategy to drive innovation, growth and efficiency. He also was CFO of Slingshot Health, a startup offering a marketplace to connect patients to physicians, and held a senior finance role at GE Energy.

Que Dallara, who leads Medtronic’s diabetes business and will become CEO of MiniMed, said Spooner’s financial expertise and leadership “will be instrumental as we prepare for our next chapter as an independent company.”

Medtronic announced plans to spin out the diabetes unit in May, with the intent of giving the business the funding and focus it needs to reach its full potential in a competitive market. MiniMed would be the only diabetes tech firm to sell both continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps. However, other companies, including Dexcom, Abbott and Insulet, have strong product portfolios, with plans for dual-analyte sensors and patch pumps.

Mobileye, an Intel subsidiary, develops vision-based advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies for automotive manufacturers.","Volkswagen has formed a partnership with Uber to launch autonomous electric ID. Buzz taxis across European and American markets.

The collaboration will see Volkswagen’ s ID. Buzz minivan deployed as a robotaxi solution, combining the carmaker’s manufacturing capabilities with Uber’s global ride-hailing network.

Both companies aim to address urban mobility challenges through connected, electric and sustainable transport solutions.

What is an autonomous electric ID. Buzz taxi?

The ID. Buzz is Volkswagen’s modern interpretation of its Microbus, built on the company's Modular Electric Drive (MEB) platform.

MEB is Volkswagen’s dedicated electric vehicle architecture designed to underpin multiple battery-electric models across the group’s brands.

The vehicle incorporates a 91-kWh battery pack that provides up to 234 miles of range – and the minivan supports rapid DC charging, allowing the battery to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in 26 minutes.

Volkswagen offers both rear-wheel and all-wheel drive variants, with power outputs reaching up to 335 horsepower.

“Autonomous driving is no longer a dream of the future – by 2030, it will change the everyday lives of millions of people in Europe,” says Christian Senger, Member of the Board for Fully Autonomous Mobility and Transport at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and CEO of ADMT GmbH.

ADMT GmbH is Volkswagen’s subsidiary focused on autonomous driving technology development.

Christian adds: “At the same time, our solution opens up a new business area for the German automotive industry: physical AI applications used for the common good.”

The Hamburg deployment forms part of Volkswagen’s broader strategy to integrate self-driving vehicles into existing public and private transport networks.

The testing programme provides data and operational experience ahead of commercial launches in other markets.

In 2026, Volkswagen plans to launch the ID. Buzz AV in Los Angeles under Uber’s platform.

Unlike fixed-route services, this deployment will offer on-demand ride-pooling options, with passengers able to request individual rides when required.

Volkswagen also intends to remove safety drivers from Los Angeles operations by the end of 2026.

European cities are expected to follow this timeline by 2027, marking the transition to fully autonomous commercial operations.

How Mobileye’s platform powers the ID. Buzz autonomous technology

The ID. Buzz AV also incorporates Mobileye’s autonomous driving platform.

Mobileye, an Intel subsidiary, develops vision-based advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies for automotive manufacturers.

The vehicle’s sensor suite comprises 13 cameras, 9 LiDAR units and 5 radar systems. LiDAR technology uses laser pulses to create detailed three-dimensional maps of surrounding environments, whilst radar systems detect objects and measure their distance and speed using radio waves.

This sensor configuration generates five gigabytes of data per second, enabling real-time mapping and object detection capabilities.

Volkswagen employs proprietary mapping tools and reduces reliance on GPS systems to improve operational resilience in challenging environments.

What makes Volkswagen’s approach different from competitors who retrofit existing electric vehicles for autonomous operation – is that it manufactures the ID. Buzz AV on dedicated production lines – which the firm claims improves cost-efficiency and reduces environmental impact through streamlined manufacturing processes.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/177cad907fc4368b21dbde6a8109e56d:efa93d8474a4924e7db4d822bb10f4c1/uber-vw.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:20.685091

Porsche’s 1H sales numbers are a mixed bag, with an overall worldwide sales decline of 6% year over year. But they also include a huge increase in the proportion of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug in hybrids (PHEVs), with the brand selling a total of 36.1% plug-in models across the world – meaning EVs helped to keep the company afloat as combustion car sales dropped quite a lot.

Porsche sold more BEVs than PHEVs, with a 23.5% BEV share and 12.6% PHEV share. This represents a 14.5% increase from the previous year’s results – a big rise in EV sales alongside a drop in gas model sales (hm, where have we heard that before?).

Porsche’s strong electric performance is all the more impressive given that the brand only has two electric models so far – the Taycan and the Macan EV.

Taycan sales were down 6% year over year, which isn’t too unexpected given the model’s age at this point. Porsche has come out with new variants of the Taycan, but those are high-end ultra-performance models, which don’t generally make up the meat of any particular model’s sales numbers.

The big growth in Porsche’s EV sales came from the new electric Macan, which is going gangbusters soon after its release.

Macan is Porsche’s best-selling model, and sales were up 15% for the model overall. That number was buoyed by massive interest in the EV version, which accounted for “almost 60%” (actually 57%) of Porsche’s Macan sales – meaning the EV model sold ~134% as many units as the gas model. Totals were 25,884 for the EV, and 19,253 for combustion models.

Part of the reason for this is because Europe no longer sells the ICE Macan, but outside of Europe, it’s still available, and the EV is still popular (as far as we know, the EV isn’t quite a majority of Macan sales in the US, but it’s close to the gas model, and that’s still much higher than the national ~10% EV share, which the US is an international laggard at)

“The fully electric Macan is making a significant contribution to our proportion of electrified cars. Overall, we have succeeded in keeping sales volumes stable and balanced across the sales regions despite ongoing geopolitical challenges. Our customers continue to place great value on individualised vehicles and we will continue to expand our offerings in this area.”

-Matthias Becker, Board Member for Sales and Marketing, Porsche

We can expect, or at least hope for, similar strong EV sales performance from upcoming Porsche electric models. The next one to release will be the Cayenne EV, which we’ve seen recently setting a hillclimb record and towing lots of stuff in disguise. We expect a full release of that model within the next year.

Porsche also has both the Boxster and Cayman EVs in the pipeline for the future. The only model we’ve not yet heard real plans to electrify is the 911 (c’mon Porsche, why would you wait so long to upgrade your best model? isn’t it embarrassing to see a Macan beating a 911 off the line?)

Across regions, sales were down in Germany (primarily due to strong year-ago performance, says Porsche), China, and the rest of Europe, and up in North America and “rest of the world.” China is of particular note, where Porsche sales dropped 28%, the largest global decrease.

Western automakers have been having a really tough time in China, due to the strength of domestic competition and rapid rise in EV sales percentage there, which caught them by surprise. You can expect more of that to come as Chinese automakers will only get better, particularly as Western governments and automakers (yes, including you, Porsche) unwisely pull back on EV goals, leaving room for China to step up and become more prominent globally.

Electrek’s Take

I reviewed the Macan EV earlier this year and came away thinking that Porsche is great at making cars, but that it could still use some tweaking of its EV strategy. The car didn’t really feel like Porsche was “all-in” on EVs, and wasn’t utilizing the unique advantages of EVs to make a car that was fully focused on being electric, even though the bones of the model show the typical excellent driving dynamics that you would expect out of a Porsche.

So these numbers either show that I’m wrong about EV strategy, or show just how superior electric powertrains can be. Because even though I think there were some missteps in the design of Porsche’s electric model, it’s still just so much better than the gas model.

And, thankfully, the public and Porsche’s dealers seem to get it too. A lot of brands have a tough time selling EVs, often because their dealers refuse to. Porsche’s dealers seem to get it a lot more than a lot of companies, which is a credit to them and to Porsche as a whole for educating them properly about the strengths of their electric models.

So we’re looking forward to seeing how sales go with those future EV models… particularly the eventual and inevitable 911 (I recently drove an EV restomod 911, and it was maybe the best driving experience I’ve ever had in a car, so c’mon Porsche, if Everrati can do it then I know you can).

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corp., which also owns CVS Pharmacy.
As a pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark essentially acts as a negotiator between pharmacies, insurers and drug manufacturers within the prescription drug supply chain.
RUNNING LOW ON OZEMPIC OR ANOTHER WEIGHT LOSS DRUG?
This goes beyond CVS Caremark, according to McGowan, who is concerned that its decision with Zepbound ""underscores a troubling trend"" in which ""financial contracts between benefit managers and drug manufacturers are increasingly shaping clinical decisions.""","CVS Caremark, one of the three major pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S., stopped coverage for Eli Lilly's popular weight-loss drug Zepbound, blaming drugs like it for driving up overall plan costs.

GLP-1 products, originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, but are now FDA-approved specifically for obesity under brand names like Wegovy and Zepbound, are ""significantly contributing to overall plan costs"", CVS spokesperson Phillip Blando told FOX Business. Removing coverage of the drug will result in an estimated client savings of 10% to 15% year over year in the anti-obesity medication space for its clients who choose to cover these medications for weight loss, according to Blando.

Zepbound, the brand name for Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, was approved by the FDA in 2023 for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related medical problems. Tirzepatide was already approved to treat type 2 diabetes and was sold under the brand name Mounjaro.

TRUMP SAYS DRUG PRICES WILL BE CUT BY AS MUCH AS 90%: WHAT TO KNOW

Zepbound was widely viewed as a game-changer in the fight against obesity, after participants in a late-stage study lost up to a quarter of their body weight – making it more effective than Wegovy.

Blando said the ""egregiously high list prices"" for GLP-1 products that are set by drug manufacturers are ""the single biggest barrier to patient access.""

""Many payers, including Medicare and numerous state benefit plans, have declined to cover GLP-1s for weight loss because of the unsustainably high prices set by brand pharma,"" he said.

However, there will still be exceptions if the drug is deemed a ""medical necessity."" That exemption will be reviewed ""on a case-by-case basis,"" according to Blando.

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corp., which also owns CVS Pharmacy. As a pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark essentially acts as a negotiator between pharmacies, insurers and drug manufacturers within the prescription drug supply chain. PBMs negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies to decide how much medicines cost, which drugs people can get and which pharmacies are part of their network.

Pharmaceutical giants have been critical of PBMs, saying their role needs to change. Eli Lilly previously told FOX Business that the only way to lower prices for U.S. consumers is if ""intermediaries take less for themselves.""

Gastroenterologist and obesity medicine specialist Dr. Christopher McGowan told FOX Business that CVS Caremark’s decision to drop coverage of the drug is ""deeply disruptive for patients who are already stable and thriving on the medication.""

RUNNING LOW ON OZEMPIC OR ANOTHER WEIGHT LOSS DRUG? A NEW TRACKER CAN HELP

""We’re now seeing insurance policy override medical judgment – forcing patients to switch to an alternative that, while still effective, has been shown in head-to-head trials to produce less weight loss than Zepbound,"" McGowan said.

McGowan highlighted that GLP-1 medications ""are not interchangeable in practice, even if they appear similar on paper."" He said switching medications ""mid-journey can reverse hard-won progress.""

""For many, this isn’t just a simple substitution. It’s a high-stakes change that can affect long-term outcomes, trigger weight regain, or introduce new side effects,"" McGowan said.

This goes beyond CVS Caremark, according to McGowan, who is concerned that its decision with Zepbound ""underscores a troubling trend"" in which ""financial contracts between benefit managers and drug manufacturers are increasingly shaping clinical decisions.""

This means patients with fewer choices not because of what’s best for their health, but because of behind-the-scenes rebate deals, he continued.

""In obesity care, continuity matters. Once a patient finds a medication that works, preserving that success should be the priority,"" he said. ""Instead, we’re seeing progress disrupted and patients forced to navigate treatment changes they never asked for.""

Eli Lilly told FOX Business that the company is committed to ensuring patients have access to the treatment they need.

""While not all CVS Caremark plans are impacted, we’ve made robust efforts to proactively communicate with many of the patients who may be affected and provided clear next steps through our support programs,"" Lilly said in a statement, adding that the company is encouraging patients to speak with their healthcare providers about medical necessity exceptions or alternative coverage pathways. It has also added resources on its website.

If customers do lose coverage, Eli Lilly said it expanded access through LillyDirect’s Self Pay Pharmacy Solutions, which is the company's self-pay program, which removes some third-party supply chain entities, offering patients without coverage drugs at a discount.

Not John Deere.
John Deere will vigorously defend itself against this baseless lawsuit.” Which is what you would expect.
It’s likely John Deere lobbyists are working overtime to get lawmakers to put pressure on the Justice Department to drop the case.","The writing is on the wall.

Should John Deere choose to defend itself in court rather than attempt to reach a settlement, it very much may be handed a massive spanking by the Justice Department, which alleges the company’s repair restrictions violate federal and state antitrust laws. See here, here and here.

In a nutshell, the Justice Department claims Deere is scamming farmers by forcing them to exclusively use Deere dealers to repair their combines and tractors when they stop running. The feds have a case.

As it turns out, it takes proprietary diagnostic software to fix broken Deere tractors. Software that Deere refuses to sell to DIY farmers or independent repair shops. Deere likes it that way because it provides the company a significant after-market revenue stream.

The four-count Federal Trade Commission lawsuit isn’t playing around, alleging Deere monopolized the restricted repair services market, violated the FTC Act by using an unfair method of competition, and violated both Minnesota and Illinois antitrust laws.

John Deere lawyers threw spaghetti at the court walls, hoping something would stick and keep it from having to defend its software at trial.

Among the arguments Deere makes are that the feds’ claims of unfair competition and monopolization are factually and legally insufficient. And for good measure — just in case the unfair competition argument went south — Deere challenged the FTC’s constitutional structure, whether states that joined in the Justice Department’s case have standing, as well as the timeliness of the states’ claims.

The ruling by Judge Iain D. Johnson, of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois-Western Division, rejected all of Deere’s legal posturing.

Johnson writes that at this stage of the case — a motion for judgment on the pleadings — he has to accept the Justice Department allegations as factual:

“The Governments say there’s a throughline between Deere’s practices: farmers have no alternatives because of the system created by Deere, which charges supracompetitive prices because of the lack of any alternatives. In technologizing its equipment, Deere makes farmers reliant on Deere’s own ADVISOR software. And, in only licensing that software to its authorized Dealers, Deere forces farmers to visit those shops instead of using closer, cheaper options.”

Johnson also noted Deere reaps massive profits from its parts business, which relies on those authorized dealers’ repairs. And Johnson says “because only Deere can create and license the ADVISOR [repair] tool, it entirely controls who (and how many) Dealers may perform restricted repairs and, by extension, how much the Dealers can charge.”

Which suggests Deere might have a significant uphill climb to refute the Justice Department.

This isn’t Johnson’s first rodeo in handling Deere’s software litigation. In late 2023, he rejected Deere’s attempt to dismiss consolidated lawsuits filed by farmers alleging that Deere conspired to restrict services for repair.

In its most recent failed motion for judgment on the pleadings, Deere recycled some of the same arguments it made in 2023, to which Johnson responded:

“Sequels so rarely beat their originals that even the acclaimed Steve Martin couldn’t do it on three tries. See Cheaper by the Dozen II, Pink Panther II, Father of the Bride II. Rebooting its earlier production, Deere sought to defy the odds. To be sure, like nearly all sequels, Deere edited the dialogue and cast some new characters, giving cameos to veteran stars like Humphrey’s Executor. But ultimately the plot felt predictable, the script derivative. Deere I received a thumbs-down, and Deere II fares no better.”

In the immediate aftermath of Johnson’s ruling no one was talking publicly. Not John Deere. Not the Justice Department. Perhaps behind the scenes, the feds and Deere are talking to each other.

The Justice Department is seeking a permanent injunction against Deere, as well as an order to make the company’s full-function service ADVISOR software available to all owners of Deere large tractors and combines.

Back in January when the outgoing Biden administration filed suit against Deere, the company said publicly:

“The complaint is based on flagrant misrepresentations of the facts and fatally flawed legal theories and it punishes innovation and procompetitive-product design. John Deere will vigorously defend itself against this baseless lawsuit.”

Which is what you would expect. But I wonder if Deere higher-ups privately feel the same way. Are they willing to legally go to the mattresses, all the way to the Supreme Court? I feel as though this isn’t the type of case the Justice Department will drop if it loses at the district court.

That the Trump Justice Department hasn’t flat out dropped the case is telling. The feds appear squarely in the farmers’ camp. It’s likely John Deere lobbyists are working overtime to get lawmakers to put pressure on the Justice Department to drop the case. How might that play out?

Are Deere and the Justice Department exploring a settlement?

I imagine there are many moving pieces — many of which have nothing to do directly with the proceedings in Johnson’s court.

Right-to-repair advocates were applauding Johnson’s ruling that the antitrust law case can go forward, but whether farmers who own Deere rigs ultimately get access to the software they need to independently fix them is still far from settled.

By targeting corporations such as Albertsons, The Southern Company, and Merck, these groups are reshaping shareholder activism, forcing companies to confront the tension between social responsibility and profit-driven governance. For investors, the question is stark: Do anti-ESG campaigns represent a legitimate safeguard against corporate overreach, or a destabilizing force undermining long-term value creation?

The Bowyer Playbook: Targeting ESG's Soft Underbelly

Bowyer Research's strategy hinges on exploiting low shareholder ownership thresholds (as little as 1%) to convene special meetings and push proxy proposals. These proposals rarely win majority votes—most secure under 5% support—but their symbolic impact is profound. By framing ESG initiatives as “politicized” or financially risky, Bowyer seeks to delegitimize corporate commitments to diversity, environmental goals, and social justice.

Albertsons: Bowyer's 2024 proposal urged the supermarket giant to audit the costs of its partnerships with LGBTQ+ advocacy groups and its “diversity training” programs. The argument? Such initiatives risk alienating customers and employees with conservative values while offering no clear financial upside.

The Southern Company: A 2023 proposal demanded a cost-benefit analysis of its decarbonization plans, arguing that investments in renewables threaten shareholder returns in a fossil fuel-dependent economy.

Merck: In 2024, Bowyer called for an evaluation of how the pharmaceutical giant's DEI policies might expose it to legal risks under the Harvard affirmative action ruling, which tightened scrutiny of race-conscious practices.

The Risks of Activist Overreach

While Bowyer's proposals fail at the ballot box, their persistence creates tangible risks. First, legal and reputational costs: Companies must divert resources to respond to repeated challenges, even if they reject the proposals. Second, governance instability: Frequent special meetings may signal to investors that management is distracted from core priorities. Third, ESG devaluation: If anti-ESG groups succeed in framing ESG as a “niche” concern, companies may retreat from initiatives that could build long-term resilience (e.g., climate adaptation, inclusive workforces).

Consider Merck's case: Even if its DEI program survives, the threat of litigation could deter it from bold recruitment or supplier diversity goals. For The Southern Company, scaling back renewables might appease activists but leave it unprepared for a carbon-constrained future.

The Legal Battlefield: SEC Rules and Shareholder Democracy

Bowyer's success depends on exempt solicitations remaining a low-cost tool. However, the SEC's recent NCPPR v. SEC ruling—upholding its authority to exclude “ordinary business” proposals—could curb such campaigns. If upheld, this precedent might limit activists' ability to challenge ESG initiatives as non-pecuniary. Yet, anti-ESG groups are refining strategies, such as framing proposals as financial risk assessments (e.g., “evaluating the cost of DEI lawsuits”) to evade exclusion.

Investment Implications: Navigating the ESG-Fiduciary Tightrope

For investors, the key is to distinguish between strategic ESG integration (e.g., climate risk mitigation) and activist-driven theatrics (e.g., symbolic DEI pledges). Companies that align ESG with profitability—such as The Southern Company's balance of renewables and fossil fuels—may weather activism better than those seen as chasing “woke” reputational gains.

Actionable Insights:

1. Avoid Companies with Weak ESG-Performance Linkages: Firms using ESG as a marketing tool, not a risk management strategy, face higher reputational and financial risks from anti-ESG campaigns.

2. Monitor SEC Regulatory Shifts: A pro-ESG SEC could penalize exempt solicitations, while a deregulatory tilt might empower activists.

3. Favor Firms with Transparent ESG Cost-Benefit Analysis: Companies like Merck that publicly justify DEI investments (e.g., “diverse teams drive innovation”) are less vulnerable to Bowyer's “reckless spending” critiques.

Conclusion: The New Fiduciary Imperative

Bowyer Research's campaigns highlight a deeper truth: ESG is no longer optional but a core governance issue. Investors must demand that companies articulate how their ESG priorities align with shareholder value—whether through risk mitigation, talent retention, or market access. Those that cannot will face relentless pressure from activists and regulators alike. In this era of exempt solicitations and ideological warfare, the winners will be firms that treat ESG as a strategic asset, not a political football.",,N,,2025-07-08 19:07:30.296340

Why it matters: 3M was one of the last holdouts of major Twin Cities corporations calling their workers back and the move by the Maplewood-based company underscores a major shift happening this summer.

What they're saying: ""I believe our ability to engage, collaborate and innovate is stronger in person,"" Brown wrote to employees.

He referenced the company's progress with its ""Collaboration Days"" policy that started in 2024 and brought managers back three days a week.

Brown wrote in his email that some employees will return right away in September, while others will need to wait for office renovations, which could take until late 2026. The policy does not apply to existing remote employees who are working distantly.

State of play: Some surveys have shown that many employees say they will find a new job if they can't work from home, but the options for remote work are dwindling among Minnesota's largest employers.

Employees at Minnesota' largest corporation, UnitedHealth Group, were called back four days a week starting on Monday. Medtronic workers will need to be in office four days a week starting Sept. 2, up from three days a week.

This summer, Target began requiring multiple divisions to come back to its Minneapolis headquarters.

The state of Minnesota's June 1 mandate requires 50% in-office work.

Golden Valley-based General Mills called the bulk of its employees back Tuesday through Thursday in February.

By the numbers: More in-person work is starting to show up in office space leasing metrics.

Quarterly absorption in the Twin Cities — which measures how much space is leased against how much is vacated or constructed — was positive for the first time since 2020, according to a new report by commercial real estate firm JLL.

JLL says a hefty amount of demand for space will keep leasing strong for the foreseeable future.

The warehouse retailer flagged 10 items in recent months for recalls, produced by a variety of manufacturers but sold by Costco. Some were also sold through Costco Next, a program that lets customers buy directly from brands at Costco prices.

The products range from window air conditions to power banks to car tires.

Here's what's included in the recall list:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257 (Costco Next)

These power banks were included in a worldwide recall by Anker over reports that some of the items had caught fire or exploded.

Danby 8k U-Shape Window Air Conditioner (Item #1498424)

These air conditioners, sold on the Costco website between June 10, 2021, and Feb. 2, 2022, are being recalled because they could grow mold. The manufacturer says pooled water can't drain quickly enough from them, risking the growth of harmful molds.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C

These Michelin-brand tires are under a recall notice because they don't meet federal guidelines for tire endurance. Federal regulators warn that the tires could increase the risk of a crash. Information to identify your tires is located on the sidewall of each tire, directly above the bead.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires

These tires, sold only as replacements, don't meet federal safety regulations. Although they adhere to performance requirements, they lack certain markings identifying their use, increasing the risk of the tires being used in improper ways, and increasing the risk of a crash. They were manufactured between June 2 and June 22, 2024, and sold through Costco's automotive department.

Anker Powercore 1000 Power Bank (Costco Next)

These power banks were also part of Anker's nationwide recall over the risk of fire or explosion from the lithium-ion battery within them.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

These dumbbells are under a voluntary recall because the plates that add weight to them may get dislodged from the handle while being used, causing a safety hazard.

Midea U-Shape Window AC's (Item #'s 1572673, 1657921, 1677429, 1768985, 2677450, and 2677429)

These window-mounted AC units are also being recalled for mold, with the manufacturer warning that pooling water may fail to drain. Mold can cause respiratory issues or lead to infection, especially in the young or elderly.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass 18pk - Select Lot Code - Select Locations in Texas and Louisiana (Item #1439351)

Between May 20 and May 29, 2025, Costco sold Topo Chico Mineral Water at a number of locations in Texas and Louisiana. The recall was issued because the water may be contaminated with pseudomonas, a bacteria that is naturally found in some mineral waters. While the bacteria poses little health risk for healthy individuals, it could cause problems for those with compromised immune systems.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler (Item #1356922)

Costco is also warning customers about Igloo ice coolers as part of a nationwide recall, after numerous reports of the tow handles on the coolers pinching fingers while being used, sometimes causing amputation.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer (Item #2297950 and #3297950)

A number of Ninja-brand pressure cookers have been recalled after being sold at retailers across the U.S., including Costco, because they may cause severe burns. The recall was issued after reports that the lid on the device could be opened while the contents of the cooker were pressurized, causing severe burns and injuries from the hot contents. The pressure cookers were sold between May 2019 and May 2021.",https://media.kvue.com/assets/CCT/images/bcc3d0ab-0c55-4aef-9ba9-f36f7bb1b022/20250603T195933/bcc3d0ab-0c55-4aef-9ba9-f36f7bb1b022_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:08:51.054045

Starbucks has rolled out a new layered line of Frappuccino drinks for which the iced, blended beverages are topped with the coffeehouse chain’s signature cold foam.

The new Strato line of beverages, named for the Italian word for “layer,” is now available nationwide.

Although baristas could always add cold foam, made with flavored, aerated skim milk, to beverages upon request (at least since the cold foam was introduced in 2018), they can now be ordered that way via the chain’s app.

They’re available in three flavors, each priced at around $5.95 for a medium “Grande”:

Brown Sugar Strato Frappuccino: Frappuccino roast coffee syrup blended with ice and whole milk topped with brown sugar cold foam and a dusting of cinnamon powder

Strawberry Matcha Strato Frappuccino: Simple syrup and matcha powder blended with ice and whole milk topped with strawberry cold foam

Salted Caramel Mocha Strato Frappuccino: Mocha sauce and Frappuccino roast coffee syrup blended with ice and whole milk topped with salted caramel cold foam and a caramel syrup drizzle

These particular iterations of the Strato platform will be available while supplies last this summer, with new iterations likely to be introduced later in the year.

The first Strato Frappuccino was actually introduced last week, although it wasn’t called by that name, and was only available for that week.

The Firework Frappuccino used the chain’s Summer Berry Refresher as its base, blended with coconut milk, poured over raspberry-flavored popping pearls, swirled with strawberry purée and topped with vanilla cold foam. A Starbucks barista commenting on a TikTok post about the week-long special said that, while people seemed to enjoy it, “I hate making these,” because they require 13 steps.

Layered drinks such as the Strato offer texture and temperature contrasts that appear to appeal to younger consumers. Their color variations also play well on social media.

Earlier this year, Starbucks removed nine Frappuccino drinks from its regular menu as part of a planned 30% menu reduction, but it teased the Strato line during a June convention of Starbucks managers in Las Vegas, among other new food and beverage offerings, including a dark 1971 Roast, named for the year the chain was founded, that is slated to debut this winter, as well as the return of raspberry sauce, updated croissants, and a new cold foam with 15 grams of protein.

CVS DOWNFALL

CVS has confirmed that it will be shutting down 271 locations in 2025.

The struggling pharmacy chain has shut 900 spots over the past three years.

Between 2022 and 2024, CVS wiped out the 900 locations from its nationwide footprint.

The full list of the 271 CVS locations has not yet been released, but local news sources and Newsweek have locked in on about 39 spread across 17 states and Washington DC so far.

A spokesperson for the company said: ""We're focused on ensuring we have the right kinds of stores and the right number of stores in the right locations.

""We're closing locations strategically to better meet consumers'

""At the same time, big rivals like Walgreens health, wellness, and pharmacy care needs — as announced more than three years ago —not in reaction to industry pressures.""

During this, CVS has also pledged to lower prices on prescriptions, amid its many closures.

CEO David Joyner said: ""These entities remain the only part of the drug supply chain entirely focused on lowering costs.

""For more than three decades, PBMs have been a proven unequivocal mechanism to negotiate down the price of drugs for payers and consumers while promoting better adherence and better health.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/newspress-collage-52bm6nxtm-1751997828356.jpg?1751983447&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:36.844608

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat has taken a measured approach to AI implementation, keeping client experience, cost, and use case at the core of every project. In an interaction with TOI before the WNS deal was announced, he said India remains a strategic hub for Capgemini, which currently has 175,000 employees in the country and is planning a gross addition of 45,000 this year. Ezzat said that GenAI and Agentic AI represented more than 6% of its bookings in the March quarter. The group has forecast revenue growth of -2% to 2% in constant currency for the 2025 financial year.

To what extent has GenAI influenced your internal software development?

It had some impact—especially when it comes to generating new code, where it performs reasonably well. However, even in those cases, the output still requires review, debugging, and thorough testing. So, while there are productivity gains, they’re not as significant as many people assume. When working with existing codebases or complex environments, the benefits are more limited. We’ve used GenAI for enhancements, for example, but the productivity improvements weren’t as dramatic as some might expect. There’s also a common misconception: increased productivity doesn’t automatically translate to cost savings. For instance, a 30% productivity gain among lower-cost roles like testers doesn’t have the same financial impact as a similar gain in higher-cost roles such as project managers or functional analysts. That nuance often gets overlooked. Beyond productivity, we’re equally focused on quality—delivering faster, but with better, more reliable code. So it's not just about cutting costs; multiple factors are driving our approach.

There are discussions around cost overruns with AI implementations. While productivity gains are evident, the operational costs of running AI remain a challenge.

We halted one client’s chatbot project—it was going to cost $25 million per year due to data consumption. The financial return just wasn’t there. AI solutions need to be evaluated case-by-case. Not all implementations yield a positive ROI. That said, in many situations, we can find reasonable returns, whether from speed, quality, or other value drivers.

From a broader perspective—on a recent investor call, you mentioned a subdued demand environment. Has anything shifted since then?

Demand remained steady over the past few months. Some industries are seeing growth, while others continue to face pressure. Overall, it’s a flat environment. We’re not seeing a sharp uptick in activity, but there also haven’t been significant cutbacks due to tariffs or other factors. What remains consistent is the focus on efficiency—cost reduction, productivity gains, and operational optimisation—rather than growth. Given the uncertain economic outlook and muted growth, companies are prioritising savings over innovation. Most large-scale transformations today are centred around cost optimisation, supply chain improvements, and boosting productivity. When it comes to efficiency and cost focus, there's no major difference. But in AI adoption—the US typically moves faster and is more aggressive. American companies are often quick to embrace new tech to stay ahead, while European firms tend to be more measured and cautious. That said, it still varies by company, so it's hard to generalise too much.

There’s growing momentum around GCCs in India. What's Capgemini's playbook?

It’s a natural shift. Clients want more control over key talent areas like tech and shared services, and GCCs offer that. India is a major talent hub, and many clients rely on us to set up, scale, and manage their local operations. We see it as a partnership—GCCs don’t replace us; we continue to support clients even after the setup. That’s the good news—there’s broad recognition that part of global operations, including proprietary work, will be based in India. It shows how Indian talent is important for in-house roles, and that’s a positive shift for both India and firms looking at global partnerships.

In one example, the company is considering making its egg white and roasted red pepper bites without canola oil, a spokesperson said in response to an inquiry from Bloomberg News. The company will also add a new egg bite to its menu that is made with avocado oil.

The coffee chain is in the midst of a brand revamp as it seeks to reverse a sales slump, and one of its priorities is testing products that appeal to more health-conscious consumers. In June, Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol pledged in a meeting with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to further align the chain’s menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities, Kennedy said in a post on X.

Starbucks’ U.S. menu has a number of items that contain canola oil, including a bacon, Gouda and egg sandwich, as well as potato bakes. Starbucks didn’t provide a timeline for the changes to its food lineup.

Seed oils, such as soybean and canola, have become a target for Kennedy and his allies, though multiple meta-analyses have indicated they have no significant impact on inflammation or the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The health push is showing up in other places on Starbucks’ menu. The chain removed sugar from its matcha powder in a move that boosted sales, Niccol said during an April earnings call. It also nixed an upcharge for nondairy milk and a recent pilot involves unsweetened protein powder, which can be added to any cold foam flavor.

The chain’s latest U.S. beverage launch was a limited-time Fourth of July themed Frappuccino. The 16-ounce version contains 59 grams of sugar, according to the chain’s website. The American Heart Association recommends that men consume less than 36 grams of added sugar a day and women less than 25 grams.

However, it is understood Droga is not interested in the WPP CEO role.
There has been no word on whether internal candidates may have pitched for the WPP job.

WPP's flagship agency divisions include WPP Media, led by Brian Lesser and previously known as Group M; VML, led by Jon Cook; and Ogilvy, led by Devika Bulchandani, and a number of smaller subsidiaries, including specialist communications, led by Johnny Hornby.","LONDON: Two big industry names tipped as potential candidates to be the next chief executive of WPP are not in the running for the job.

Campaign understands that Matt Brittin, former EMEA president of Google, and David Droga, outgoing chief executive of Accenture Song, are not involved in the agency holding company's recruitment process. (Campaign is PRWeek's sister business media outlet at Haymarket Media).

WPP has given no update on its search since June 9, when the British agency group said Mark Read, chief executive since 2018, is planning to step down but will remain in the job until December 31, when he will retire from the board.

However, multiple sources said they believe WPP’s board, which is led by Philip Jansen, chair, is set make a decision soon. An appointment will come “sooner than expected,"" one person said.

When WPP last looked for a CEO in 2018, after Martin Sorrell abruptly exited, the search took four and a half months, but Read was widely seen as the internal favorite from the start of the process – unlike in 2025 when no frontrunner has yet emerged.

There have been rumours in industry circles since March that WPP has made overtures to Brittin, but it is understood he is not looking for an executive board role in the near term, after leaving Google this summer.

Brittin previously said in a LinkedIn post when he first announced his departure that he wanted to “take a break for the first time since leaving school – a ‘mini gap year’” – and he was looking forward to spending more time with his family “in the year ahead.""

Droga’s decision to step down as chief executive of Accenture Song in May and move to a new role as vice chair of parent company Accenture also fueled speculation that WPP has approached the Droga5 founder. However, it is understood Droga is not interested in the WPP CEO role.

Other external industry names who have been linked with the vacancy include Lord Carter, chief executive of Informa, the owner of Cannes Lions, who worked at WPP early in his career. Informa did not comment. A source said analysts would be surprised if Carter were to make a move given his expansion plans for Informa.

There has been no word on whether internal candidates may have pitched for the WPP job.

WPP declined to comment on the process.

Jansen, former chief executive of BT, started as WPP chair on January 1, having first been named to the job in July 2024.

Speaking at his first WPP annual shareholder meeting in May, Jansen told investors that the board was under no obligation to make immediate changes, but the nominations committee “continually takes a long-term view on board succession planning."" Read’s departure was announced a little over two weeks later.

WPP has been under pressure as it faces a third year of lackluster revenue growth, with a decline of between zero and 2% expected in 2025. It has lost some major media accounts, including Coca-Cola in North America and Mars globally, to Publicis Groupe.

WPP’s share price has fallen 37% since the start of 2025, reducing its stock market valuation from £8.9 billion to £5.6 billion.

Analysts at Barclays warned in a note last month that they expect WPP’s “underperformance to continue” in the short term, partly “because of the uncertainties created by a change in management.""

“On average, media stocks that have seen a change in management underperform by 10% between the announcement of a change in CEO and the strategy of the new CEO being unveiled,” Barclays said.

The investment bank added that “we do not believe, unlike others, that WPP is fundamentally impaired and we do believe that the new CEO can turn this ship around, but it is likely to come with higher investments and lower margins initially.""

WPP's flagship agency divisions include WPP Media, led by Brian Lesser and previously known as Group M; VML, led by Jon Cook; and Ogilvy, led by Devika Bulchandani, and a number of smaller subsidiaries, including specialist communications, led by Johnny Hornby.

""Their holistic approach to digital and clinical transformation focuses on improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare efficiency. We appreciate their commitment to driving meaningful impact across the entire care journey with generative AI, while preserving the human touch of clinicians and the integrity of healthcare operations.""

THE LARGER TREND

In June, Hippocratic AI and Universal Health Services (UHS) announced that genAI agents, which support clinicians by making phone follow-up outreach to patients after discharge, were deployed in two UHS subsidiaries: Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas and Texoma Medical Center in Denison, Texas.

The initiative aims to support clinicians in continuing to monitor their patients after discharge from the hospital, detecting and alerting UHS clinical staff to changes in patient conditions and addressing patients' questions.

In May, Hippocratic AI partnered with Eucalia, a clinical operations company, to launch the first Japanese-language genAI healthcare agent for non-diagnostic, patient-facing clinical tasks. The partnership marked Hippocratic AI's entry into the Japanese market.

Scheduled to be introduced this year, the Japanese generative AI healthcare agent aims to support clinicians by taking on time-consuming but important non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks, including appointment scheduling, follow-up outreach, chronic care check-ins and medication adherence support.

In April, Hippocratic AI partnered with Burjeel Holdings, a healthcare services provider based in the United Arab Emirates. Burjeel Holdings operates in parts of the Middle East and North Africa.

Through the alliance, Hippocratic AI's agents will be developed for ""patient-facing non-diagnostic clinical tasks,"" distributed across Burjeel Holdings' healthcare facilities and physiotherapy clinics in the UAE and Oman.

In January, Hippocratic AI closed a $141 million Series B round of funding, bringing its valuation to $1.64 billion.

As reciprocal restrictions disrupt traditional trade routes, investors are poised to capitalize on strategic arbitrage opportunities through cross-border mergers & acquisitions (M&A) and regional production diversification. This article outlines how companies are reconfiguring their supply chains—and which stocks to buy, avoid, or short—to profit from—or mitigate—the fallout.

The Trade War in Context: Reciprocal Barriers and Market Fragmentation

Since June 2025, the EU has banned Chinese medical device firms from bidding on public contracts exceeding €5 million, while capping Chinese component usage at 50%. In retaliation, China excluded EU-based companies from tenders above 45 million yuan ($6.3 million). These measures, rooted in accusations of unfair trade practices (e.g., China's “Made in China 2025” localization mandates), have split the $500 billion global medtech market into two walled gardens.

The stakes are high: China's medtech exports to the EU totaled €11.4 billion in 2024, while EU firms face exclusion from 87% of China's public tenders. Companies unable to adapt risk losing access to critical markets, while agile players can dominate niche segments.

Strategic Responses: M&A and Regional Diversification

1. European Firms Acquiring Chinese Partners

To bypass China's procurement bans, EU medtech companies are partnering with or acquiring local Chinese firms to qualify for domestic tenders. Philips (NYSE: PHG) exemplifies this strategy: 90% of its Chinese sales are generated through local manufacturing, shielding it from exclusion. Similarly, Siemens Healthineers (OTCPK: SHLGY) leverages its 15%-revenue-generating China business to navigate restrictions.

Investment Opportunity: Back firms with localized production in China, such as Philips or Becton Dickinson (NYSE: BDX), which already sources 70% of its Chinese devices domestically. These companies benefit from dual access: EU procurement (via non-Chinese components) and China's fast-growing market.

2. Shifting Production to ASEAN

The EU's restrictions have spurred a rush to ASEAN, where countries like Thailand and Malaysia offer cost-effective, geopolitically neutral manufacturing hubs. Stryker (NYSE: SYK) and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) are expanding production in Vietnam and Indonesia to avoid reliance on China. This strategy not only circumvents trade barriers but also taps into ASEAN's $35 billion medtech market.

Investment Opportunity: Invest in firms with flexible supply chains and ASEAN exposure, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) or Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), whose robotic surgery systems are in high demand across fragmented markets.

3. Chinese Firms Seeking EU Assets

While the research highlights limited Chinese acquisitions of EU assets to date, the potential remains. Chinese firms like Mindray Medical (SZSE: 300760) or United Imaging could target EU-based R&D firms or niche manufacturers to gain access to EU procurement tenders. Such deals would allow them to rebrand as “European” entities and bypass the IPI's restrictions.

Investment Opportunity: Monitor state-backed Chinese firms with strong balance sheets, such as Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), for opportunistic EU acquisitions.

Risks and Short Candidates

The trade war's escalation carries significant risks:

- Geopolitical Volatility: Escalating tariffs or WTO disputes could disrupt supply chains further.

- Overcapacity in ASEAN: Rapid manufacturing shifts may lead to oversupply and margin compression.

Avoid or Short:

- Pure-play exporters to China/EU, such as Smiths Group (LSE: SMIN) or Getinge (OMX: GETI), which lack localized production.

- Companies reliant on high-Chinese-component exports, such as Teleflex (NYSE: TLS), whose EU sales could collapse under the 50% threshold rule.

Conclusion: Bet on Flexibility and Diversification

The EU-China medtech trade war is a zero-sum game for traditional players but a goldmine for firms willing to reconfigure their supply chains. Investors should prioritize companies with localized manufacturing in China, ASEAN production hubs, or cross-border joint ventures. Meanwhile, shorting firms stuck in the trade crossfire offers asymmetric risk-reward. As the world's two largest medtech markets fracture, the winners will be those who master the art of arbitrage in this new reality.

Final Note: Monitor the EU-China summit in late July 2025 for de-escalation signals. If talks fail, expect accelerated M&A activity and deeper supply chain reconfiguration—a scenario favoring the strategies outlined above.",,N,,2025-07-08 18:05:32.627092

Analyst Take: The HP-Intel partnership on these AI PCs is a strong, data-backed push to shift business computing toward on-device AI. With 62% of enterprise IT leaders adopting AI PCs to futureproof their organizations, this launch gives the segment much-needed credibility backed by purpose-driven investment. The detailed performance data and use-case testing give HP a strong story to tell enterprise buyers while also helping Intel stay competitive against AMD and Qualcomm, who are rolling out their AI-focused chips.

Performance Improvements Backed by Data

Unlike some AI PC rollouts that have featured vague performance promises, HP and Intel are backing these with solid numbers. Compared to previous systems, Power BI saw up to 45% speed improvements, Tableau was 48% faster, and Adobe Lightroom ran 32% quicker. Canvid, the screen recording tool, was also up to 223% faster. Similarly, the local AI writing tool Writeup hit 165% better output speeds. These results came from over 500 hours of benchmarking by Intel’s software team, focused on real business tasks and not artificial tests. These real numbers give HP more concrete productivity and resource usage pitches to companies looking for clear value before upgrading their PCs and for guidance on which AI PCs to choose.

Intel’s Engineering Push Shows a Strategic Shift

Part of the reason for these improvements is that Intel did not just provide the chips. The company also helped optimize software for them: Engineers from Intel’s Client Computing Group worked hand-in-hand with HP’s commercial PC team to tune performance across CPU, GPU, and NPU, reflecting Intel’s more rounded approach to AI workload resource management in their PC systems. Unlike Qualcomm, which has so far prioritized energy-efficient NPUs for AI workloads, Intel has taken a less NPU-centric approach with a more balanced total system performance between NPU and GPU – a potentially less power-efficient but more flexible system design strategy.

By focusing on key AI apps that business users rely on and ensuring they run well locally, Intel is also carving out a space for itself against ARM-based rivals like Apple, who still lean more on cloud computing than on-device capabilities.

While this kind of collaboration between device OEMs and chipmakers isn’t unusual, the deep focus on how partnerships like this could drive more explicit differentiation between platforms and PC brands could become the new normal for silicon and PC OEM partnerships. (We saw a similar effort between Intel and Lenovo last year with Lenovo’s Aura Edition PCs.) Broadly, Intel’s move toward working with PC OEMs to build systems for specific workloads and help optimize PCs for critical use cases, especially in the commercial segment, suggests that Intel understands that it can’t just put out parts for PCs anymore and expect orders to roll in – even in the Enterprise. The introduction of AI PCs has changed the dynamics of the PC market about as much as the arrival of Windows-on-Arm systems, and Intel understands that to hold on to its slipping market share, it needs to give PC buyers – consumers, in the SMB space, and the Enterprise – a reason not to select another platform.

For HP, the equation is somewhat similar: If Intel is pursuing deep partnerships with other PC OEMs to deliver uniquely tuned AI PCs for critical user categories, HP needs to do the same. This announcement signals that HP is in Intel’s inner circle and that it has uniquely optimized PCs to offer discerning customers with specific performance demands.

On-Device AI Boosts Privacy and Builds Trust

Running LLMs and productivity tools locally can make systems faster and more responsive and also frees users from the constraints of cloud services, connectivity limitations, and bandwidth challenges. An additional advantage is that running workloads locally is also more secure, as data being processed locally is easier to protect from interception and snooping. Two of the most important advantages of AI PCs are that they boost data privacy and security. And while still under-indexed, these privacy and performance benefits could help drive adoption in areas like finance, government, and healthcare, where trust is critical and data security rules are more stringent.

The challenge for now is that many of today’s most important productivity tools are still cloud-based, making AI PCs (particularly Copilot+ PCs) far too reliant on cloud-based AI processing than they need to be. In short, the hardware is ready, but many software platforms remain, with their AI workloads primarily cloud and subscription-based. This doesn’t mean organizations shouldn’t buy AI PCs now as part of their PC refresh schedule. What it does mean, however, is that the security and productivity gains promised by AI PCs may not fully materialize for some time yet.

AI PCs Still Early in the Game

While Intel’s Core Ultra chips offer solid local performance, many companies are waiting for the Panther Lake processor refresh (late 2025) and the Nova Lake processor (2026), which promise considerable performance improvements (50-80 Trillion Operations Per Second / TOPS on the NPU, with total system TOPS reaching for the 200 range). Again, these performance improvements are mostly academic at this point, since most AI-intensive applications continue to be cloud-based by default. That being said, when we start seeing some of these AI workloads truly shift to being handled on-device, these systems will be ready to deliver.

The current gap between system capabilities and what is operationally possible at the moment is the primary reason why demand for AI PCs from commercial PC buyers hasn’t been more aggressive. But this HP-Intel effort makes a solid case for these systems, especially for companies thinking about buying PCs that will be AI-ready when critical AI-accelerated productivity software starts to expand from the cloud to devices.

With over 500 hours of joint testing, HP has a data-backed case to make as one of the first movers in this space – helping shift AI PCs from theory to practice.

What to Watch:

HP’s success hinges on translating benchmarking gains into repeatable outcomes across a wider portfolio of enterprise workflows.

Intel’s momentum in this space could be challenged by AMD’s Ryzen AI 300 Series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X platform, both of which are gaining OEM traction.

Enterprise customers may wait for higher TOPS performance from the upcoming Nova Lake and Panther Lake processors before scaling AI PC deployments.

The real-world gains showcased in HP’s testing will need to extend beyond launch partners to convince the broader enterprise market.

What is the new Spicy McMuffin from McDonald’s?

The Spicy McMuffin is McDonald’s latest offering to add heat to its morning lineup. The product maintains the core ingredients of the Egg McMuffin — an English muffin, egg, and cheese — but elevates the experience with a peppery hot sauce, perfect for those who like to kick off the day with bold flavor. It will also be available as a Spicy Sausage McMuffin and a Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

This isn’t McDonald’s first time flirting with heat. The brand previously won praise for its Spicy Chicken McNuggets, a limited-time item that became an instant hit. Now, McDonald’s continues its tradition of bold innovation, embracing spicy options that satisfy adventurous palates.

Snack Wrap: The Comeback Fans Never Gave Up On

The return of the Snack Wrap has generated genuine excitement among American customers. It’s a product that disappeared from the national menu in 2016 but never left the hearts of fans. Over the years, social media was flooded with nostalgic posts, memes, and even formal petitions begging McDonald’s to bring it back.

Now, finally, the Snack Wrap is back — and this time, it’s a permanent menu item. It features one of the brand-new McCrispy Strips, juicy all-white meat chicken, combined with shredded lettuce, cheese, and sauce, all wrapped in a soft flour tortilla.

Consumers can choose between two flavors:

Spicy Snack Wrap – with a habanero-inspired kick straight from the popular Spicy McCrispy sandwich.

Ranch Snack Wrap – with creamy garlic and onion notes that bring out that classic ranch flavor.

To make things even better, the Snack Wrap will be available à la carte or as part of a combo meal, including two Snack Wraps, medium fries, and a drink — all starting at just $2.99 USD.

McDonald’s openly acknowledged that consumer demand made the difference. In the company’s words: “They’re the ones who inspired us to make its return to the menu happen.” This initiative is part of McDonald’s broader effort to strengthen emotional connections with customers and respond more directly to their preferences.

McDonald’s by the Numbers: A Global Powerhouse

According to data from Statista, McDonald’s generated $25.92 billion USD in global revenue in 2024, with franchise restaurant sales reaching $120.93 billion. In its largest market, the United States, the company surpassed $10.4 billion in revenue that same year.

The company also continues to invest in its brand. In 2024, McDonald’s allocated $445 million USD to global advertising, and reported over 175 million active users in its loyalty program. This highlights a marketing strategy built on personalized experiences and deep emotional engagement with its global audience.

McDonald’s is also recognized as the most valuable restaurant brand in the world as of 2025, with an estimated brand value of $40.5 billion USD, surpassing Starbucks and KFC.

Why is this McDonald’s big announcement menu so important?

This important announcement is more than a publicity stunt — it marks a major milestone in how McDonald’s listens to and engages with its customers. By introducing the Spicy McMuffin and bringing back the beloved Snack Wrap, McDonald’s is showing that it’s in tune with modern tastes and nostalgia alike.

As consumer demand shapes menus more than ever, McDonald’s proves it’s ready to evolve without losing sight of its roots. This big announcement about the menu not only refreshes product offerings — it reinforces McDonald’s position as an industry leader that delivers what fans truly want.

While the recall itself is narrow in scope, its implications for supply chain management, consumer safety, and financial performance warrant scrutiny. For investors, the question is clear: Does this incident underscore Mondelez's agility in managing risks, or does it expose vulnerabilities that could undermine its long-term growth?

The Recall: A Contained Risk, but a Strategic Litmus Test

The recall, affecting only select carton sizes (8-, 20-, and 40-packs of peanut butter crackers and a variety pack) with “Best When Used By” dates between November 2025 and January 2026, stemmed from a supplier error in film packaging rolls. This defect could have led to peanut butter-filled crackers being labeled as cheese varieties, posing a severe risk to allergy-sensitive consumers. While no injuries were reported, the recall underscores the criticality of supplier quality control in Mondelez's global supply chain.

Mondelez's swift response—issuing a voluntary recall, establishing a 24/7 consumer hotline, and collaborating with the FDA—demonstrates a commitment to consumer safety. However, the incident raises questions about oversight of third-party suppliers, particularly in high-risk areas like allergen labeling. For a company whose brand equity relies heavily on trust (think Oreo, Cadbury, and belVita), such lapses could erode confidence among vulnerable customer segments.

Financial Performance: The Recall's Minimal Impact, but Bigger Storms Loom

The recall's financial consequences appear negligible. Analysts estimate the affected products represent a tiny fraction of Mondelez's $36.4 billion 2024 revenue, and the company has not disclosed recall-related costs in its Q1 2025 results. Instead, the quarter's struggles—organic revenue growth of 3.1% versus a 3.5% expectation, and a 23% year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS to $0.74—were driven by macroeconomic headwinds like cocoa cost inflation (up 70% year-on-year) and unfavorable currency impacts.

Mondelez's margin pressures are systemic, not recall-induced. Gross margins fell to 26.1% in Q1 2025, down 2,500 basis points year-on-year, as cocoa prices and transportation costs surged. The company is countering these challenges with pricing strategies (net pricing contributed 3.1% to organic revenue growth) and cost-cutting, including savings from its “Simplify to Grow” program. While the recall's impact is muted, investors must assess whether Mondelez can navigate broader inflationary pressures and sustain its 2025 outlook of a 10% adjusted EPS decline.

Analyst Optimism vs. Operational Realities: Where Does the Stock Stand?

Despite Q1's misses, analysts remain cautiously bullish. Institutions like BofA Securities and Stifel have raised price targets, citing Mondelez's ability to outperform consensus EPS estimates even amid margin contraction. The stock's beta of 0.49 signals lower volatility than the broader market, and its 19.7% six-month price return reflects investor confidence in its defensive snack business.

However, risks persist. Cocoa prices—Mondelez's largest raw material cost—remain volatile, and geopolitical tensions (e.g., Russia-Ukraine war) could further disrupt supply chains. The recall, while minor, highlights the need for Mondelez to invest in supplier audits and digital traceability systems to prevent future incidents.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, but Mind the Risks

Mondelez's stock (MDLZ) currently trades at 21.5x 2025 adjusted EPS estimates, a discount to its five-year average P/E of 24.3. With a 2.3% dividend yield and a history of shareholder returns ($2.1 billion in buybacks and dividends in Q1 alone), the stock offers defensive appeal.

Buy Signal:

- The recall's limited scope and proactive management suggest Mondelez's brand trust is intact.

- Analysts' upward revisions and the company's reaffirmed 2025 guidance reflect confidence in its cost-saving and pricing strategies.

Hold or Sell Signal:

- Cocoa inflation and margin pressures remain unresolved. If input costs persist beyond 2025, growth could stall.

- A repeat of supply chain errors, especially involving safety-critical issues, could damage brand equity.

Conclusion: A Test of Strategic Muscle

Mondelez's peanut butter cracker recall is less a red flag and more a litmus test of its operational and strategic agility. While the incident underscores the importance of supplier oversight, the company's swift action and broader financial resilience suggest it can weather this storm. For investors, the stock presents a compelling entry point—if they're willing to bet on Mondelez's ability to navigate inflation and maintain its premium snack market dominance.",,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:49.767448

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger.
- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.
However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.
- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.","The $949 million legal judgment against CVS Health for its subsidiary Omnicare's fraudulent prescription practices marks a seismic moment for the healthcare sector. This ruling, which could ultimately cost CVS over $400 million in penalties and treble damages, exposes systemic governance failures and compliance risks that investors must now factor into their valuation of healthcare giants. For CVS, the verdict is not just a liability on its balance sheet—it's a stark warning about the consequences of merging under regulatory scrutiny and failing to address legacy liabilities.

The Legal Judgment: A Blueprint for Corporate Accountability

In April 2025, a federal jury found Omnicare liable for dispensing medications to elderly patients in long-term care facilities without valid prescriptions, resulting in over 3 million false claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. The damages of $135.6 million could triple under the False Claims Act (FCA), while penalties of up to $28,619 per claim could push total costs toward $949 million. Critically, the jury held CVS liable as the parent company for “causing” these violations by failing to address compliance gaps it knew about for years.

CVS's defense—that state laws permitted the practices and that it lacked direct control—was rejected. The court emphasized that as a holding company, CVS was obligated to enforce compliance under a 2016 Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA), which required oversight of Omnicare's operations. This ruling underscores a seismic shift: parent companies can no longer shield themselves from subsidiary misconduct under federal programs.

Regulatory Gaps and Governance Failures

The case reveals two critical governance flaws at CVS:

1. Lax Oversight Post-Acquisition: CVS acquired Omnicare in 2015, but internal audits and compliance reviews from 2016–2018 identified systemic issues, including “roll-over” prescriptions (assigning new prescription numbers to expired ones). Despite these findings, CVS did not mandate corrective actions, violating its CIA obligations.

2. Strategic Ambiguity: In 2022, CVS briefly explored selling Omnicare, recognizing its non-strategic value, but reversed course in 2023. This indecision suggests a lack of clarity about Omnicare's risks versus rewards—a red flag for investors in a sector where regulatory missteps can metastasize.

The Omnicare case also highlights broader industry risks. The jury's focus on “speaker programs” and kickbacks (echoed in a parallel Gilead Sciences settlement) signals that the DOJ is targeting financial incentives influencing prescribing practices—a trend that could expose other healthcare firms to similar liabilities.

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations

The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger. CVS faces:

- Penalties and Litigation Costs: Beyond the $949 million estimate, ongoing appeals and settlements could drain cash reserves.

- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.

- Future Liabilities: Other subsidiaries or acquisitions may harbor similar risks, creating a “liability time bomb” for investors.

For investors, this demands a reevaluation of CVS's valuation multiples. The company trades at a P/E ratio of 12.5x, slightly above peers like UnitedHealth (11.8x) and Humana (14.2x). However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.

Investment Implications: Scrutinize Balance Sheet Resilience

Investors must ask two questions:

1. Can CVS absorb this hit without diluting shareholder value? Its $13 billion cash balance and $5 billion in annual free cash flow may cushion the blow, but sustained legal costs could strain its dividend (currently yielding 1.8%).

2. Is management accountable? CEO Karen S. Lynch has emphasized “operational discipline,” but the Omnicare verdict suggests governance gaps persist.

Actionable advice:

- Underweight CVS until management demonstrates a clear plan to address compliance risks and legacy liabilities.

- Compare to peers: Firms like AmerisourceBergen (ABC) or Cardinal Health (CAH), which face fewer regulatory headwinds, may offer safer exposure to healthcare distribution.

- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.

Conclusion: A New Era of Accountability

The Omnicare judgment is a watershed moment for healthcare giants. It signals that regulators and juries will hold parent companies directly responsible for subsidiary misconduct—a paradigm shift with far-reaching consequences. Investors must now treat corporate governance and compliance rigor as core valuation metrics, not afterthoughts. For CVS, the path to recovery hinges on transparency, proactive risk management, and a willingness to divest businesses with unsustainable liabilities. Until then, the stock remains a cautionary tale of how governance failures can unravel even the largest healthcare empires.

Final note: This case is not isolated. Investors should pressure all healthcare firms to disclose compliance frameworks and legacy risks, lest they face similar reckoning.",,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:40.141400

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages, in a whistleblower lawsuit claiming it fraudulently billed the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.

In a Monday evening order, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018.

McMahon also awarded $406.8 million of damages, representing three times the $135.6 million that a jury awarded on April 29.

The tripling was required under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

CVS plans to appeal the judgment. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager bought Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare has asked McMahon to throw out the case or grant a new trial.

""This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,"" CVS said in a statement on Tuesday. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed.""

The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by Uri Bassan, a former Omnicare pharmacist in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and joined by the federal government in 2019.

They said Omnicare improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, which serves military personnel, for prescriptions for tens of thousands of patients in assisted-living facilities, group homes for people with special needs, and other long-term care facilities.

Omnicare allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

McMahon rejected CVS' argument that a $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.

""This was a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct,"" the judge wrote.

McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying that company. CVS itself did not submit any claims.

The case is U.S. ex rel Bassan v. Omnicare Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-04179.

U.S. tariffs could pressure costs, though Levi’s management anticipates only a minimal impact on Q2 margins and is considering selective price increases. Organic revenue is expected to grow 3.5%–4.5% in Q2, with gross margin expanding by 80–100 basis points. For the full year, revenue is projected to decline by 1%–2% (excluding tariff effects), while gross margin is expected to rise by roughly 100 basis points to 61.6%.

The company has $7.8 Bil in current market capitalization. Revenue over the last twelve months was $6.3 Bil, and it was operationally profitable with $647 Mil in operating profits and net income of $356 Mil. While a lot will depend on how results stack up against consensus and expectations, understanding historical patterns might turn the odds in your favor if you are an event-driven trader.

There are two ways to do that: understand the historical odds and position yourself before the earnings release, or look at the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post-earnings and position yourself accordingly after the earnings are released. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

Levi’s Historical Odds Of Positive Post-Earnings Return

There are 17 earnings data points recorded over the last five years, with 9 positive and 8 negative one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns were seen about 53% of the time.

However, this percentage decreases to 33% if we consider data for the last 3 years instead of 5.

Median of the 9 positive returns = 4.2%, and median of the 8 negative returns = -7.7%

Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D), and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below.

Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns

A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if the correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns.

""We're likely to see higher multi-channel pricing dispersion if the Fair Pricing Policy weakens,"" predicted a portfolio manager tracking the e-commerce sector.","Court Order Signals Escalating Battle Over E-Commerce Giant's Market Power

The Competition Bureau of Canada has secured a Federal Court order compelling Amazon to turn over internal records related to its Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy, marking a significant escalation in the regulator's investigation into potential abuse of dominance by the e-commerce giant.

The court order, announced Tuesday, advances a probe examining whether Amazon's pricing policies effectively suppress competition and inflate prices for Canadian consumers. The investigation focuses specifically on rules that allow Amazon to penalize third-party sellers who offer lower prices on competing platforms.

""This is a watershed moment for Canadian antitrust enforcement,"" said a competition policy expert familiar with the case. ""It's the first major deployment of the Bureau's expanded investigative powers under the amended Competition Act, and signals a new willingness to confront dominant digital platforms.""

Inside Amazon's Pricing Vise

At the heart of the investigation is Amazon's Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy, implemented in 2017, which gives the company broad authority to suppress listings or remove the coveted ""Buy Box"" from sellers whose products are priced lower elsewhere online.

While Amazon frames the policy as consumer protection against price gouging, critics view it as a sophisticated mechanism to cement market dominance. When sellers cannot offer better deals on competing platforms without risking visibility on Amazon—where many generate the bulk of their revenue—rival marketplaces struggle to gain traction.

The timing aligns with sweeping changes to Canada's competition regime. Recent amendments dramatically increased potential penalties for abuse of dominance to the greater of C$25 million, three times the ill-gotten gains, or an eye-watering 3% of global annual revenue—which for Amazon could theoretically reach US$19 billion based on 2024 figures.

""The Competition Bureau is finally showing its teeth,"" remarked an industry analyst who requested anonymity. ""With the new penalty ceiling tied to global revenue rather than just Canadian operations, the stakes have fundamentally changed for multinational platforms.""

Policy Battlefield: Protection or Predation?

Amazon's fair pricing rules create a complex economic calculus for the thousands of Canadian businesses selling through its platform.

""Many sellers feel trapped in a paradox,"" explained a consultant who advises e-commerce businesses. ""Amazon's policy nominally promotes price consistency, but effectively functions as a most-favored-nation clause that prevents price competition across platforms.""

For consumers, the implications cut both ways. While Amazon's dominant position—estimated at 40% of Canada's US$66 billion e-commerce market—has delivered convenience and seemingly competitive prices, the Bureau is examining whether those prices could be artificially inflated by restricted competition.

The investigation presents Amazon with a delicate balancing act. The company must defend policies it considers fundamental to marketplace integrity while navigating an increasingly hostile regulatory landscape. Amazon has not yet commented on the court order, though the Bureau emphasized no conclusion of wrongdoing has been reached.

Trade Tensions Cast Long Shadow

The investigation unfolds against a backdrop of escalating U.S.-Canada trade frictions, particularly regarding Canada's Digital Services Tax that primarily affects American tech giants. With former President Trump returning to office and renewing tariff threats, the Amazon probe takes on additional geopolitical significance.

""There's undeniably a political dimension to this timing,"" observed a trade policy specialist. ""Canadian regulators are asserting sovereignty over their digital economy while facing pressure from Washington to tread carefully with American companies.""

This dynamic creates unusual investment considerations, as regulatory outcomes could be influenced by diplomatic calculations beyond the traditional antitrust framework.

Market Impact: Beyond the Headline Risk

For investors, the investigation presents both immediate concerns and longer-term strategic implications.

While the theoretical penalty ceiling is massive, precedent suggests a more modest outcome. ""The largest abuse-of-dominance administrative monetary penalty ever imposed in Canada is approximately C$100 million,"" noted a financial analyst specializing in regulatory risk. ""Even with political pressures, I'd handicap the cash impact between C$100-250 million, with an extreme scenario capped around C$1 billion.""

The more significant market impact may come from behavioral remedies rather than monetary penalties. If Amazon is forced to relax its pricing policy, the competitive landscape could shift substantially.

""We're likely to see higher multi-channel pricing dispersion if the Fair Pricing Policy weakens,"" predicted a portfolio manager tracking the e-commerce sector. ""That benefits multi-channel enablers like Shopify and potentially creates openings for traditional retailers with strong online operations—Walmart Canada, Canadian Tire, and Costco could all see margin improvements.""

The Road Ahead: Inflection Point for Digital Regulation

The Competition Bureau's next steps will be closely watched. Amazon has 30 days to comply with the document production order unless it seeks judicial review. Should the Bureau proceed to file an application with the Competition Tribunal, the case would move from investigation to litigation.

Critically, as of June 20, 2025, private parties can now file civil abuse-of-dominance claims under recent amendments—opening the door for competitors or affected sellers to pursue their own cases against Amazon.

""This could become a perfect storm of regulatory pressure,"" warned a corporate governance advisor. ""Public enforcement combined with private litigation creates unprecedented uncertainty for Amazon's Canadian operations.""

Investment Outlook: Positioning for Regulatory Outcomes

For traders navigating this regulatory uncertainty, several strategic approaches merit consideration.

A pairs trade going long Shopify while shorting Amazon could capitalize on Canadian sellers diversifying their channel strategy. Traditional retailers with established e-commerce operations may see relief rallies if Amazon voluntarily relaxes its pricing policies to avoid protracted litigation.

Paradoxically, any significant stock price decline in Amazon specifically tied to Canadian regulatory headlines likely presents a buying opportunity, as the financial impact—even in worst-case scenarios—represents only a fraction of the company's global operations and cash flow.

""The market consistently overreacts to headline regulatory risk,"" suggested an institutional investor. ""Smart money will focus on the structural remedies rather than the theoretical maximum penalties.""

Investors should recognize that this case potentially marks a turning point in how digital platforms are regulated globally. Canadian precedents could influence ongoing investigations in the EU and U.S., creating regulatory contagion that ultimately reshapes the competitive dynamics of online marketplaces.

Investment Thesis

SectionKey PointsWhat Happened- On 8 July 2025, the Competition Bureau forced Amazon to disclose records related to its Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy (MFPP).

- The Bureau is investigating if MFPP allows Amazon to (i) raise fees/prices, (ii) block rivals, or (iii) both.

- No wrongdoing found yet—this is an evidence-gathering step.Legal Changes- Abuse of dominance penalties now capped at C$25M, 3× benefit, or 3% global revenue (vs. C$10M pre-2022).

- Private lawsuits allowed from 20 June 2025 (AMP + damages).

- Compulsory disclosure now applies to market studies (used here).Financial Exposure- Global sales (2024): US$638B; 3P seller services: US$156B.

- Estimated Canadian GMV: ~US$26B.

- Potential AMP cap: Up to US$19.1B (3% global sales) or US$3.9B (3× benefit).

- Realistic penalty estimate: C$100-250M (70% chance), up to C$1B in extreme cases.Probability-Weighted Outcomes- 30%: Co-operative remedy (<C$50M + policy tweaks).

- 40%: Moderate AMP (C$100-250M) + conduct changes.

- 20%: Litigated loss (C$1-5B + algorithmic changes).

- 10%: Structural remedy (split 1P/3P—unlikely but high impact).Strategic Impacts- Sellers: More pricing flexibility if MFPP weakens (benefits Shopify).

- Competitors: Walmart, Costco, Best Buy may regain share.

- Regulatory risk: Could influence EU/FTC cases.

- Political risk: Potential U.S. tariff retaliation.Investment Angles- Long SHOP / Short AMZN: If sellers diversify.

- Long Canadian retailers (CTC-A, WMT): If Amazon relaxes MFPP.

- Buy AMZN dip: If penalty <US$1B (minor earnings impact).Next Steps- Amazon’s 30-day deadline to comply or appeal.

- Bureau’s decision to escalate to litigation.

- Private lawsuits possible after 20 June 2025.

- FTC timeline (Q4 2025) may sync with Canada’s case.

- U.S. election (Nov 2025) could trigger tariff risks.Bottom Line- Market underestimates risk due to new penalty scale (global revenue-based) and private lawsuits.

- Likely outcome: Conduct remedy (not huge fines), but long-term impact on Amazon’s pricing power.

- Opportunity: Buy AMZN dips; Shopify and multi-channel sellers may benefit.

Dive Brief:

Starbucks is offering performance-based compensation awards for executives tied to the Back to Starbucks plans, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29.

The awards, which have a target value of $6 million, consist of a grant of performance-based restricted stock units that vest after fiscal year 2027.

Executives will receive the stock grants if the company meets cost-reduction goals, and leaders can earn twice the money if Starbucks hits additional goals related to “(i) the rollout of the Company’s Green Apron Service program, (ii) coffeehouse uplifts, (iii) new food and beverage platforms, and (iv) a reimagined Starbucks Rewards program,” according to the 8-K.

Dive Insight:

The stock awards show that among Starbucks’ key goals for the next two years, reducing costs is its highest priority. The additional goals are part of CEO Brian Niccol’s effort to renovate the brand and return its focus to the shopfloor.

The Green Apron Service model, for instance, “combines and unifies new service standards and expectations, changes to partner plays and deployment, streamlined routines, and our order sequencing algorithm,” Niccol said on the brand’s fiscal Q2 2025 earnings call.

Starbucks is in the middle of a transition toward an on-premise, coffeehouse focus. The early steps of that plan included the return of ceramic mugs for in-store orders, the restoration of the condiment coffee bar, improved seating, and handwritten notes on cups, according to the earnings call.

But going forward, Starbucks will renovate large numbers of cafes to meet new, warmer design standards. Niccol said on the earnings call that the chain was balancing the need for renovations with cost: “uplifts feel premium, but keep renovation costs down and minimize closure days.”

Starbucks also has cut a large number of menu items, but the new incentives signal the brand has a long-range strategy to use new menu items to draw in consumers. This menu strategy is likely to include coffee-forward beverages, in keeping with Niccol’s narrowed idea of the brand’s identity. The relatively new ristretto beverage platform is a good example of what a coffeehouse-focused menu innovation move might look like.

The changes to the rewards program, meanwhile, likely mean a shift away from aggressive discounting, given Niccol’s comments on the most recent earnings call. Starbucks, he said, had been discounting too much through its rewards program and was trying to build up transactions through the program that are not based on discounting.

“This transaction will address our global clients’ needs for Agentic AI-driven process transformation to deliver efficiency and agility through hyper-automation, while achieving superior business outcomes,” Murugesh told businessline, adding that Capgemini and WNS will together create a leader in Intelligent Operations, a solution that helps organisations transform activities and processes from back to front office by leveraging intelligent automation, decision intelligence, backed by data, AI and technology.

Murugesh said this will uniquely position the companies to support organisations in their AI-powered business process transformation, blending the capabilities needed from consulting, technology and platforms, to deep process and industry expertise.

When asked about workforce rationalisation, WNS said it maintains a strong presence in New York, London, and India, and is fully committed to all its markets.

“Our geographies are largely complementary to Capgemini’s. Until closing, which we expect to occur by the end of the year, Capgemini and WNS will continue to operate as independent companies. There are no immediate operational changes,” said Murugesh.

In the past, companies like Infosys have acquired BPM companies like Progeon Ltd to offer their clients a complete cost-effective solution based on service and technology outsourcing.

However, Sanchit Vir Gogia, Chief Analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research, pointed out that the Capgemini-WNS merger implies tighter coupling between AI engines and process delivery.

“This may benefit enterprises looking to embed GenAI across operations — invoice scanning, underwriting, agent assistance. But it could also mean less flexibility to run those processes independently or plug them into third-party clouds and AI systems,” said Gogia.

In sectors like insurance and utilities, where WNS has deep traction, platform gravity is especially strong. If Capgemini folds those vertical solutions into its broader transformation narratives, clients may see more value — but also more lock-ins.

Who: Kraft Heinz Foods Company is recalling 367,812 pounds of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original.

Why: The recall is due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

Where: The recall is effective in the United States, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

Kraft Heinz Foods Company has initiated a recall of more than 367,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original, produced between April 24 and June 11, 2025, and distributed across the United States, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

Therecall was announced on July 2 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

The affected products include 12-ounce, 36-ounce and 48-ounce packages of Oscar Mayer Turkey BACON ORIGINAL, with specific universal product codes and “use by” dates ranging from July 18, 2025, to Sept. 4, 2025. The products also bear lot codes RS19, RS40 or RS42 and display the USDA mark of inspection on their labels.

Consumers urged to check refrigerators and not to consume products, recall states

The potential contamination was identified through laboratory testing conducted by Kraft Heinz, which indicated the presence of Listeria monocytogenes.

Kraft Heinz urges consumers to check their refrigerators and freezers for the recalled products and advises not to consume the affected items.

“Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection,” the recall notice states. Listeriosis can lead to severe health issues, particularly in older adults, individuals with weakened immune systems and pregnant women and their newborns.

Kraft Heinz is actively working to address the issue by notifying retailers and ensuring the recalled products are removed from shelves.

Consumers seeking more information can contact Kraft Heinz’s consumer hotline at 1-800-280-7185 or email consumerrelations@kraftheinz.com. Additionally, the FSIS website provides updates on the Kraft Heinz turkey bacon recall and retail distribution lists.

Kraft Heinz says it has not received any reports of illness or injury related to the recall so far. The company is not currently facing legal action over the recall, but Top Class Actions follows recalls closely as they sometimes lead to class action lawsuits.

Recently, Boar’s Head Provisions Co. agreed to a $3.1 million settlement to resolve class action claims that it sold recalled meat products contaminated with listeria.

But it can be hard to determine the skills employees will need to adapt to these new ways of working.
AI literacy training should focus on integrating job-specific knowledge with critical thinking, providing hands-on opportunities to engage with Gen AI.
Including AI and data in HR skills strategies HR leaders must embrace AI and data to inform skills strategies.
Don’t forget the human element To succeed in the age of AI, HR leaders must ensure AI adoption respects and enhances human judgement, empathy and creativity.","For the first time in history, we're witnessing up to five generations working side by side – the silent generation, baby boomers, Gen X, millennials and Gen Z – with Gen Alpha also about to enter employment age.

All these generations are currently facing a common challenge: learning how to use AI effectively in the workplace. As generative AI adoption accelerates across enterprises, upskilling a multigenerational workforce presents a unique opportunity for HR leaders to improve productivity and engagement. Perceptions of AI and approaches to learning differ across the generations, so how can organisations equip employees of different age groups with the right skills to succeed in the age of AI?

Changing perceptions

One of the first hurdles is shifting the perception that AI is intimidating or overly complex, which could impact adoption in groups who don't consider themselves 'digitally savvy’. To change these perceptions, HR leaders need to empower employees to lead this transformation.

Today’s workforce has successfully navigated multiple technological disruptions. The AI revolution is simply the latest development. The technology promises to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time to focus on strategic work. This makes experience and business insight valuable attributes for employees. At Capgemini, I've seen many older colleagues embrace this change and sign up for AI training.

Redesigning career pathways

More than half of business leaders (56 per cent) and employees (54 per cent) believe AI is transforming how they work, according to Capgemini research. This will require reshaping job functions and workflows across all organisational levels.

But it can be hard to determine the skills employees will need to adapt to these new ways of working. HR leaders must re-evaluate workforce planning, roles and career pathways in light of the changes AI might bring.

Success depends on how well employees across generations integrate AI into their daily work. Only 16 per cent of employees report receiving ample support to develop generative AI skills and 46 per cent of leaders have been through formal Gen AI training.

As modern businesses navigate a landscape defined by significant technological change, they must cultivate the right skills across all age groups to harness AI effectively.

Embracing continuous learning and inclusive upskilling

A blanket approach to upskilling risks overwhelming employees and widening inequalities. Instead, HR functions need to embed learning as a continuous part of work, not an additional burden.

Embedding AI training into everyday workflows normalises learning and ensures all employees can train at their own pace according to their career goals. AI literacy training should focus on integrating job-specific knowledge with critical thinking, providing hands-on opportunities to engage with Gen AI. These initiatives can empower employees of any age to take on more strategic roles and enhance their sense of purpose.

Moreover, AI itself can facilitate accessibility by simplifying complex processes and bridging skill gaps between generations. Contrary to stereotypes, older professionals often find AI to be a great equaliser. Many AI tools feature intuitive interfaces that are accessible for people from all age groups. This allows experienced employees to leverage their deep industry knowledge alongside AI, potentially giving them an advantage over more tech-savvy but less experienced colleagues. The key lies in recognising individual strengths rather than relying on generational labels and promoting cross-generational learning between younger and older employees.

Including AI and data in HR skills strategies

HR leaders must embrace AI and data to inform skills strategies. Age-inclusion efforts require regular audits of engagement, promotion, skills proficiency and performance data.

Continuous employee feedback is also important for understanding the effectiveness of AI training programmes. This enables HR professionals to identify skills gaps, areas of improvement and biases, which helps ensure equitable development opportunities for everyone.

AI tools can also create a level playing field in recruitment and performance evaluation by removing human bias. This shift benefits older professionals particularly, creating more opportunities for career progression and meaningful contribution to the workplace.

Another important factor to consider is enabling employees to share their experiences and learn from each other. Creating forums such as multigenerational internal networks enables employees to share experiences and demystify age-related stereotypes.

Reverse mentoring, where younger employees guide older colleagues on new technologies, is another way to encourage intergenerational collaboration.

Don’t forget the human element

To succeed in the age of AI, HR leaders must ensure AI adoption respects and enhances human judgement, empathy and creativity. This tandem approach creates a workforce that is technically skilled, resilient, adaptable and connected.

As organisations face an unpredictable future, HR's role in guiding inclusive adoption of AI becomes paramount. By fostering environments where multigenerational teams thrive through mutual respect, tailored development and continuous learning, businesses can unlock innovation and gain a competitive advantage in the age of AI.",https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/150/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/OMP/CarolynMillerCorpPhotoHeadshotholly.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:31.462288

The deal, which is subject to approval by the workers, includes higher pay, larger pension contributions, health benefit and welfare improvements, and other changes. Workers will vote on the proposal over a three-day period that begins Wednesday.

The unions reached the agreement following what they said were more than 40 hours of talks with the grocers. UFCW locals 135, 324, 770, 1167, 1428 and 1442 took part in the talks that led to the tentative agreement, which would cover workers for Kroger’s Ralphs banner and Albertsons’ namesake banner as well as its Vons and Pavilions supermarket chains.

The agreement comes just weeks after workers for the grocery chains voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike to protest what labor leaders from UFCW Locals 324 and 770 described as “labor violations throughout negotiations that have prevented workers from getting the fair contract they deserve.”

The alleged infractions by Kroger and Albertsons included “breaking the law by surveilling and interrogating employees in their stores, interfering with their discussions with union representatives, equating union support with disloyalty, and preventing them from wearing union insignia,” UFCW Local 770 said in a June 27 statement.

Albertsons said in a statement that the unfair labor practice allegations “are without merit,” adding that it remains ""committed to productive discussions with the UFCW.”

“We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and are negotiating in good faith to achieve a balanced agreement that rewards our associates, benefits our customers and is sustainable for our company in the competitive grocery industry,” the company said.

Significant unmet need in schizophrenia care: With up to 2.8 million US adults affected by schizophrenia and only 40% receiving adequate treatment, Caplyta may help fill a critical treatment gap.

Johnson & Johnson announced that it has submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA, seeking an expanded indication for Caplyta (lumateperone) to include relapse prevention in schizophrenia. According to the company, the sNDA is based on positive data from a Phase III randomized withdrawal trial, which demonstrated that Caplyta significantly prolonged time to relapse compared to placebo.1

How Effective is Caplyta in Preventing Schizophrenia Relapse?

“For people living with schizophrenia, relapses can be devastating as they disrupt lives, undo hard-earned treatment progress toward patients’ goals, and increase the risk of hospitalization with each episode,” said Christoph U. Correll, MD, clinical professor of psychiatry, Zucker School of Medicine, Hofstra/Northwell, New York, in a press release. “Caplyta substantially lowers the chance of relapse for patients compared to placebo, which is often a major source of anxiety and suffering for them and their families.”

Phase III Trial Results Support Expanded Indication

The double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of Caplyta compared to placebo.

The primary endpoint of the trial was time to relapse during the 26-week double-blind treatment phase. The key secondary endpoint was delayed time to all-cause discontinuation, including relapse.

Results show that time to relapse was significantly longer in patients receiving Caplyta compared to those receiving placebo (p=0.0002). Patients treated with Caplyta demonstrated a 63% reduction in risk of relapse compared to placebo (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.37, [0.22, 0.65]).

Caplyta also demonstrated a significantly delayed time to all-cause discontinuation compared to placebo during the double-blind phase (p=0.0007).

Headache was the most common adverse event, occurring in at least 5% of patients and at twice the rate seen with placebo.

The safety profile of Caplyta was consistent with previous studies and no new safety signals were identified.1

Global and US Schizophrenia Burden Underscores Unmet Need

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 24 million people are affected by schizophrenia globally, which is equal to approximately one in every 222 people. Those affected by schizophrenia are two to three times more likely to die prematurely than the general population, primarily due to physical illnesses such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases. Onset is most common between late adolescence and the twenties, with men typically experiencing earlier onset than women.

Currently, half of patients in mental health facilities are living with schizophrenia; however, only 31.3% of people with schizophrenia receive specialist mental health care. WHO suggests that mental health facilities are not currently providing effective care for patients with schizophrenia.2

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the prevalence of schizophrenia in the United States is estimated to be between 0.25% and 0.64%.3 According to Johnson & Johnson, this equates to 2.8 million adults, with around 40% receiving proper medical care. It is also estimated that patients with schizophrenia experience around nine relapses over the course of six years.1

Long-Term Data Reinforce Caplyta’s Role in Neuropsychiatric Care

“Relapse prevention is a critical goal for the long-term care and management of this debilitating disorder,” said Bill Martin, PhD, global therapeutic area head, neuroscience, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, in the press release. “These Phase III results provide compelling evidence of meaningful relapse prevention, which is critical in preserving long-term patient stability, breaking the cycle of hospitalization, and helping to control symptom progression. We’re committed to building on the decade of research reinforcing the robust efficacy, proven safety, and favorable tolerability of Caplyta and providing additional data to support the long-term use of this medicine in neuropsychiatric disorders.”

As the luxury automaker grapples with slowing demand in key markets, geopolitical tensions, and the costly shift to electrification, its ability to balance innovation with financial discipline will determine its future. Here's how Porsche is adapting—and whether investors should bet on its resilience.

Product Innovation: Electrification as a Double-Edged Sword

Porsche's push into electrification is both a strategic imperative and a financial burden. The all-electric Macan, launched in 2024, has become a critical growth driver, accounting for 14% of deliveries in early 2025. The model's success—14,185 units sold in Q1 alone—highlights consumer appetite for high-performance EVs. Porsche also plans an all-electric Cayenne, its best-selling model, by 2026, signaling its commitment to electrifying its core lineup.

However, this transition is costly. Special expenses for 2025 have surged to €1.3 billion, up from €800 million, due to battery tech investments and supply chain adjustments. The company acquired a majority stake in V4Smart GmbH & Co. KG to secure lithium-ion round cells, while its partnership with Varta AG aims to stabilize battery production. These moves underscore Porsche's resolve to control its supply chain—a necessity in an era of global competition for EV components.

Yet Porsche is hedging its bets. It has delayed plans to independently scale high-performance battery production via its subsidiary Cellforce Group, opting instead to focus on partnerships. This pragmatism reflects a recognition that electrification's ROI requires patience.

Market Challenges: Balancing Global Demand and Geopolitical Risks

Porsche's sales data reveal stark regional disparities. In Q1 2025, deliveries fell 7.9% globally to 71,470 units, driven by a 42% decline in China, its second-largest market. Intense competition in China's luxury EV segment—where local brands like NIO and Li Auto dominate—has forced Porsche to adopt a “value over volume” strategy. This means prioritizing brand prestige over mass sales, even as rivals undercut prices.

Meanwhile, North America saw a 37% surge in deliveries to 43,577 vehicles in H1 2025, partly offsetting losses elsewhere. Yet U.S. import tariffs imposed in April 2025 have strained margins, contributing to Porsche's revised 2025 forecasts.

The stock, down 12% year-to-date as of Q2 2025, reflects investor skepticism about near-term profitability. But Porsche's long-term focus on premium differentiation—via bespoke options like its Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur (offering over 1,000 customization choices)—could insulate it from price wars.

Financial Adjustments: Cost-Cutting to Offset Short-Term Pain

Porsche's financial adjustments are aggressive. The company aims to cut 3,900 jobs by 2029 through attrition and voluntary retirement programs, while halting fixed-term contracts for 2,000 roles. The “Road to 20” cost-reduction program targets a return to its long-term goal of >20% operating margins, down from 14.1% in 2024.

Revised 2025 forecasts reveal the trade-off: Sales revenue is now projected at €37–38 billion (vs. an earlier €39–40 billion), with operating margins dropping to 6.5–8.5% (from 10–12%). Yet Porsche is prioritizing structural health over short-term gains. CFO Dr. Jochen Breckner emphasized that these measures are “sustainably strengthening Porsche for the future.”

Investment Considerations: Is Now the Time to Bet on Porsche?

Porsche's strategy is clear: double down on EVs and exclusivity while cutting costs to preserve margins. But investors must weigh risks:

- Geopolitical Uncertainty: Supply chain disruptions, trade wars, and China's regulatory shifts could prolong headwinds.

- EV Adoption Speed: A slower-than-anticipated shift to electric vehicles could strain cash flows.

- Brand Dilution: Expanding EVs without sacrificing Porsche's “high-performance” identity is a tightrope walk.

The Bull Case: Porsche's brand equity, premium pricing power, and disciplined cost management could position it as a leader in luxury EVs. Its partnerships in battery tech and the delayed Cellforce expansion suggest a smarter use of capital.

The Bear Case: Near-term profitability is under pressure, and competition—especially from Tesla's Model X/Y and local EV players—is intensifying.

Final Analysis

Porsche's resilience hinges on executing a delicate balance: accelerate electrification without overextending financially, maintain exclusivity in oversaturated markets, and adapt to geopolitical shifts. For investors, this is a long-term play. While short-term volatility persists, Porsche's strategic moves suggest it's building a foundation for sustained premium growth.

Recommendation: Hold for long-term investors with a 5+ year horizon, but avoid if seeking quick gains. Monitor EV adoption rates and China's regulatory environment closely—these will be the ultimate tests of Porsche's resilience.

As such, IH failed to demonstrate — because it cannot do so — market power and the exercise of such power to harm competition.
Instead, it is well established that an injunction should issue to prevent ongoing or threatened violations of the antitrust laws.”","Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster subsidiary has asked a federal judge in Central California for a judgment as a matter of law to throw out a jury’s antitrust verdict.

Last month, U.S. District Judge James V. Selna tripled the damages in the case to $442 million, a practice enabled under federal antitrust law. In May, the jury had found in favor of Scottsdale, Arizona–based Innovative Health on all of the questions over whether J&J had violated sections of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and California’s Cartwright Act through tying and other anticompetitive practices, allegedly maintaining a monopoly on cardiac mapping catheters and squeezing out reprocessors such as Innovative.

In its motion for summary judgment filed on July 3, J&J argues that the jury failed to make a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence.

J&J’s lawyers said in the motion:

“The fundamental premise of IH’s tying theory was that Biosense possessed market power in a distinct market for clinical support services (a market that, as described below, was not shown). Biosense provided that service for free. This left IH to hang its case on the claim that Biosense used its market power to charge supracompetitive prices for its original equipment manufacturer … catheters in separate alleged single-brand catheter markets, thereby barring competition rather than simply competing with a competitor. But at trial, IH presented no evidence that Biosense was charging supracompetitive prices. As such, IH failed to demonstrate — because it cannot do so — market power and the exercise of such power to harm competition. In fact, the evidence showed that Biosense charged competitive prices, and the quality of these products continuously improved.”

In a motion replying to a separate motion seeking to prevent a permanent injunction, Innovative’s Health’s lawyers described Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster as a proven monopolist. “Requiring Innovative to play litigation whack-a-mole against Biosense would thwart the Sherman Act’s purpose to protect market competition. Instead, it is well established that an injunction should issue to prevent ongoing or threatened violations of the antitrust laws.”",https://www.massdevice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gavel-Medtech.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:13:31.320115

Kraft Heinz recalls 360,000 pounds of turkey bacon over scary concerns

Kraft Heinz (KHC) , a company behind popular brands such as Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and Oscar Mayer, is recalling around 367,812 pounds of fully cooked turkey bacon that might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

Listeria is a type of bacteria that thrives in cool and damp environments, even at temperatures as low as 31°F. When food comes into contact with Listeria, the bacteria spreads quickly. It is most commonly found in luncheon meats, such as dry sausages and hot dogs, but also in raw milk, ham, chicken salads, and more.

What happens if you eat food contaminated with Listeria?

You can get listeriosis, an infection that can be serious. Consumers especially vulnerable to listeriosis are pregnant women and their newborns, older people (65+), and those with weakened immune systems.

Infection during pregnancy is hazardous and can even lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn, according to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Pregnant women with listeriosis often only have fever and similar flu-like symptoms.

Those who are not pregnant might have headaches, stiff necks, fevers, muscle pain, loss of balance, and convulsions. While the first symptoms might appear in a few hours to three days after consuming contaminated food, sometimes they take up to 2 months to appear.

While healthy people can have mild symptoms when infected with Listeria, older people and those with weakened immune systems can die.

More than 90% of people with listeriosis end up hospitalized, often in intensive care units, according to data from the FDA.

FSIS urges shoppers not to consume these products

The recalled Oscar Mayer Turkey BACON ORIGINAL was produced from April 24, 2025, through June 11, 2025, and includes the following products:

12-oz. Vacuum-packed packages with universal product code (UPC) ""071871548601"" with dates ranging from July 18 to August 02 and lot code “RS40.”

36-oz. packages with three 12-oz vacuum-packed packages of turkey bacon and UPC “071871548748” with dates ranging from July 23 to September 04 and lot codes “RS19,” “RS40,” or “RS42.”

These products were shipped to retail stores across the country, and some even reached the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

No illnesses or adverse reaction to the consumption of these products have been reported, said FSIS, However, consumers concerned about an illness are advised to contact a health care provider.

FSIS fears some of these products might be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers, and it is urging buyers not to consume them, but to throw them away or return them to the place of purchase.

“His deep experience in snacks, beverages, M&A and innovation—combined with public company CEO and board roles—makes him well suited to lead Hershey into the future.”","Dive Brief:

Hershey on Tuesday named Wendy’s chief executive Kirk Tanner as its next CEO effective Aug. 18, according to a company statement.

The announcement brings Tanner back to the CPG industry, where he spent more than three decades at PepsiCo. Among other senior roles, he served as CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America, overseeing the growth of Pepsi, Gatorade and Mountain Dew.

Tanner replaces Michele Buck, who in January announced her intention to retire after eight years in Hershey’s top role. Buck will work closely with Tanner in a senior advisory capacity during the transition.

Dive Insight:

As CEO, Tanner will be responsible for building on Buck’s efforts to transform Hershey into a snacking powerhouse and diversify beyond sweets. Buck oversaw the company’s aggressive move into gummies and salty snacks and led some of the largest acquisitions in Hershey’s history, including a $1.6 billion purchase of SkinnyPop owner Amplify.

“Michele architected and championed Hershey’s Leading Snacking Powerhouse vision, guiding the company through multiple phases of transformational growth,” said Mary Kay Haben, lead independent director and chair of Hershey’s CEO Search Committee. “The impact of her courageous leadership, evolution of portfolio and capabilities, and authentic connection to people leave a legacy and a roadmap that positions Hershey well for the future.”

Still, Tanner joins at a precarious time for the snacking industry, which has experienced broad declines as consumers tighten their wallets and look for healthier alternatives. Hershey reported close to a 14% sales drop in the first quarter.

The candy giant also has struggled with higher cocoa costs amid fast-changing tariffs. The company expects tariffs to cost between $15 million and $20 million during the second quarter and asked the White House for an exemption for duties on cocoa.

At PepsiCo, Tanner led a transformation of the company's $28 billion beverage business, scaling brands, including Pure Leaf and bubly, and overseeing new innovation to address evolving consumer trends.

In addition to leading PepsiCo’s North American beverages business, Tanner also held several other senior leadership positions, including president of PepsiCo Global Foodservice and senior vice president of Frito-Lay North America’s West Division.

“Kirk is a proven, high-impact leader in the food and beverage industry with a great combination of customer and consumer passion, commercial acumen and operational scale,” Haben said. “His deep experience in snacks, beverages, M&A and innovation—combined with public company CEO and board roles—makes him well suited to lead Hershey into the future.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/orTfmCkfPC8KE1L8Cx1WZc6bLb8r3f249BI-ZXtaNEU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTUxMzI0Njk0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-08 14:12:53.207855

The products subject to recall bear the USDA mark of inspection on the front of the label. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide and some were exported to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

The problem was discovered after the establishment’s laboratory testing indicated the product may be contaminated with Lm.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

Fans can get them in two flavors:

Spicy: ""Bold, zesty and unapologetically fiery, our Spicy Snack Wrap brings the heat with a habanero kick that fans know and love from the Spicy McCrispy sandwich.""

Ranch: ""Smooth, rich and irresistibly savory, our Ranch Snack Wrap delivers a satisfying burst of cool ranch goodness, with hints of garlic and onion.""

And they are available as a meal, which will include two Snack Wraps, medium fries and a drink.

Known as “Instacart Shoppers,” these workers play a valuable role in the grocery technology company’s ongoing growth in retail vendor space, as evidenced by the ongoing release of new earnings opportunities and safety features for them.

In its latest shareholder letter, Instacart said that it began piloting several new initiatives to provide its gig workers with more ways to earn money, including taking videos of store shelves to improve inventory transparency, letting them deliver customer orders from a distributor’s warehouse and allowing an Instacart shopper in one store the chance to find out-of-stock items from an order handled by another worker at another store.

Relying on its workers to track on-shelf inventory is “much more real-time than what we get from retailers,” then-CEO Fidji Simo told investors in February.

Along with earnings, Instacart has also revamped how it scores its workers. In April, the company unveiled plans to roll out a new tool that ranks how well its workers shop for customers with a sliding scale from “Needs work” to “Standard” to “Good” based on the number and condition of items the worker selected for their orders completed in the last 90 days.

That new tool is factoring into new and updated reward tiers as part of the Cart Star shopper rewards programInstacart revealed at the end of last month.

At the epicenter of this transformation is Standard Chartered, whose recent strategic moves under leaders like Philippe Tabouis and Abbas Husain position it as a pivotal financier of the region's $2 trillion clean energy pipeline. For investors, this presents a rare convergence of policy tailwinds, scalable financing tools, and underserved infrastructure demand—arguing for immediate allocation to infrastructure funds or ETFs exposed to MENA's renewable transition.

Leadership Pivot: Tabouis and Husain's Dual Play

Standard Chartered's infrastructure strategy is being steered by two key figures:

- Abbas Husain, Global Head of Infrastructure and Development Finance, focuses on structuring deals in renewables, green hydrogen, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) across MENA and EMEA. His team has pioneered sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) and green bond frameworks to align financing with environmental metrics.

- Philippe Tabouis, Head of Infrastructure and Development Finance in Europe, brings Société Générale's expertise in cross-border project finance. His mandate includes bridging European capital markets with MENA's energy transition, exemplified by his role in the $8.5 billion Neom Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia.

Together, they are leveraging Standard Chartered's network to capture first-mover advantage in sectors like green hydrogen (a $13 billion market by 2030) and solar/wind energy, which now account for 40% of new MENA power capacity.

The Renewable Energy Gold Rush

MENA's energy transition is not merely theoretical—it is already financing billions in projects:

1. Neom Green Hydrogen: Tabouis' team acted as mandated lead arranger for this landmark project, which will produce 1.2 million tons of green hydrogen annually using solar and wind power. The deal's success underscores the viability of large-scale green loans, which now command premium pricing due to their ESG alignment.

2. Saudi Solar Dominance: Standard Chartered has underwritten over $5 billion in solar projects in Saudi Arabia, including the 1.5 GW Sakaka Solar Plant. These projects are structured as PPPs, with sovereign wealth funds like Public Investment Fund (PIF) sharing risk with international investors.

3. Qatar's Petrochemical Evolution: Even in hydrocarbons, the bank is pivoting toward sustainability—its role in the Ras Laffan Petrochemicals project included green financing terms requiring reduced carbon intensity.

PPPs and Policy Liberalization: The EMEA Catalyst

Governments in the region are accelerating PPP frameworks to attract private capital, particularly for water infrastructure and digital connectivity:

- Abu Dhabi's Noor II Street Lighting Loan: A $200 million PPP deal structured by Standard Chartered, demonstrating how even smaller-scale projects can attract institutional investors through risk-sharing mechanisms.

- Desalination Plants: The Rawabi desalination project in Saudi Arabia, financed via green loans, highlights the bank's ability to monetize water scarcity—a $23 billion opportunity in MENA by 2030.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) are critical partners, co-financing deals and mitigating geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, policy reforms—such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Authority (PIA) privatization roadmap—are unlocking trillions in dormant infrastructure assets.

Financing the Transition: DFIs, ECAs, and Capital Markets

Standard Chartered's edge lies in its hybrid financing toolkit:

- Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs): These instruments, now used in 60% of the bank's MENA deals, tie interest rates to green targets (e.g., carbon reduction).

- Capital Market Refinancing: “Soft-mini perm” loans (short-term debt used to bridge to long-term bonds) are enabling projects like Neom to access yield-hungry bond markets.

- Institutional Investor Appetite: Over $2 trillion in global infrastructure capital is chasing MENA's pipeline, with Standard Chartered acting as a gateway for pensions and sovereign funds.

Note: STAN's outperformance since 2023 reflects growing demand for its regional expertise in sustainable finance.

Investment Thesis: Allocate Now to MENA's Green Pipeline

The convergence of policy momentum, capital market innovation, and underserved infrastructure demand creates a multi-year opportunity. Investors should prioritize:

1. Sector-Specific ETFs: The iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IFRA) holds exposure to firms like Siemens Gamesa (wind) and Engie (utilities), while tracking projects in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

2. Green Infrastructure Funds: BlackRock Global Renewable Power Fund and Morgan Stanley Sustainable Infrastructure Fund directly target PPPs in solar/wind and green hydrogen.

3. Geographic Plays: Allocate to ETFs like iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (SAUD), which benefits from the kingdom's $1.3 trillion energy transition plan.

Risk Factors: Geopolitical instability, delayed policy reforms, and overvaluation in crowded renewable sectors. Mitigate these by focusing on debt instruments (e.g., green bonds) or funds with local partner expertise.

Conclusion: The Next Decade's Infrastructure Alpha Lies in MENA

Standard Chartered's dual focus on Abbas Husain's dealmaking and Philippe Tabouis' cross-border structuring positions it as the region's banker of choice for green infrastructure. With DFIs, ECAs, and institutional capital now aligned, the time to act is now. Investors who allocate to MENA's renewable pipeline and EMEA's digital infrastructure will capture the next wave of returns in a world hungry for sustainable growth.

Note: MENA's share of global clean energy investment rose from 12% to 21% between 2023 and 2024—a trend likely to accelerate.",,N,,2025-07-08 16:09:08.224359

AI and machine learning are transforming private equity exit strategies by accelerating due diligence, enhancing portfolio monitoring and enabling faster, data-driven buyer analysis.

Advanced tech tools, including predictive analytics and ESG dashboards, not only support smarter investment decisions but also boost exit attractiveness by showcasing long-term value creation.

The mid-market and small-cap private equity sector is facing turbulence, driven by inflation and political instability, fueling uncertainty and volatility.

Due to this, firms are prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, emerging markets and technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) for quick and accurate investment calls.

Fundraising remains a challenge, with over 70% of investors citing economic uncertainty and market volatility as top concerns.

Globally, private equity firms are sitting on $2.1 trillion, which can be used for new opportunities (“dry powder”). Most firms have allocated 30% of their capital to dry powder amid cautious optimism.

At least 80% of private equity workflows already rely heavily on technologies to source deals, conduct due diligence and manage portfolios; 95% of these firms are planning to multiply AI investments in the next 18 months.

This reliance has led to an evolution in exit strategies. Secondary buyouts and management/leveraged buyouts are making the most headway. To curb uncertainty in the market and challenges pertaining to liquidity, firms are exploring continuation funds and preferred equity options.

The private equity industry, despite sitting on a lot of dry powder, is encountering insurmountable pressure from Limited Partners (LPs) for efficient allocation of capital. General Partners (GPs) find themselves caught up with due diligence demands and allocation requirements amid market contraction risks.

Technological advancements have become enablers with AI, robotic process automation (RPA) and blockchain driving operational efficiencies. This encourages compliance and helps with decision-making. S&P Global found that 41% of private equity firms are in nascent adoption stages, 13% are at the advanced implementation stage and 7% have fully integrated technology.

In deal sourcing, AI can identify 195 relevant companies in the time it would take a junior analyst to evaluate one. Firms like Blackstone and EQT are investing in solely owned platforms like EQT’s Motherbrain, which consolidates 140,000+ data points for real-time M&A insights.

AI also assists with post-deal requirements like live portfolio monitoring and exit readiness by putting together information for a quicker turnaround on the buyer analysis for decision-making. Firms that delay tech adoption risk falling behind in fundraising and corporate governance and risk being left behind by competitors. Simultaneously, these advances have a real-world impact on the people in the industry, reducing the need for entry-level employees.

The investment projectile has evolved across four major phases: workflow automation and BPM services (before 2018); low-code/no-code platforms (2018-2020); early adoption of intelligent automation across the value curve (2021-2023); and a new era of intelligent automation powered by generative AI (2024-present).

Private equity firms are embracing the tech revolution to drive digital operations and unlock value across sectors.

The allied risks and limitations

AI has a significant impact on the private equity space, although there are reservations about its adoption and scope in the future. In light of the limited adoption rate, it is clear that only a fraction of private equity firms are exploring AI application use cases. These reservations are emanating from cybersecurity threats, opaque workflows and limited visibility on returns.

Having said that, it does contribute to operational efficiency and better portfolio performance. It also supports analysis, given its ability to skim through large and complex data sets, and is useful to entry-level employees as a learning and development tool.

These tools do enhance accurate decision making without negating human judgement, allowing organizations to act swiftly with precision. This has a cascading effect on revenue optimization, cost reduction and improved performance reporting and monitoring. For example, AI can help monitor KPIs across portfolios and processes in deal exits and capital distribution.

However, this shift brings significant risks. Kearney highlights seven key scenarios: rising ownership costs, unreliable data, questionable model outputs, cyber threats, IP disputes, AI-driven ESG platform concerns and negative socioeconomic impacts – all amid evolving regulatory pressures on governance.

It also emphasizes the importance of establishing robust governance frameworks and ethical guidelines to mitigate these risks. For example, some firms have created internal compliance forums to define acceptable AI use and ensure data protection. To successfully integrate AI, private equity firms must align AI initiatives with strategic goals, focus on high-impact use cases and ensure their technology infrastructure is ready. Standardizing and improving data quality across portfolios is also critical, as inconsistent data remains a major barrier to effective AI deployment. Firms that invest in preparing their data and tailoring AI models to their specific needs will gain a competitive edge.

Propelling the ESG engine forward

Private equity firms are leveraging state-of-the-art technologies of AI-driven predictive analytics and powering ESG data platforms to monitor and integrate metrics into their investment strategies. According to EY, private equity funds that have a well-integrated ESG framework have the potential to achieve an initial rate of return, which could be 8% higher than their competitors. This is mainly thanks to more accurate predictive models that provide organizations with the ability to assess value creation potential and sustainability risks over long periods at both deal and portfolio levels.

Bain and Company reports that, despite a low adoption rate of ESG initially, there has been an uptick in interest due to the consistency of data ESG operations provide and its potential long-term assurances. Firms now leverage AI/ML and natural language processing (NLP) to assess regulatory disclosures, sentiment analysis and supply chain data for ESG risks. This approach allows investors to pursue short-term value while staying aligned with long-term goals, supporting broader global efforts by businesses and governments to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_380dG0pxQ_6C-WjpawAW_RWRAy00C8-rSZ5EpzZN6-0.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:24:35.900647

Kennedy Jr.’s campaign to eliminate synthetic food dyes from the American food supply is facing stiff resistance from one of the country’s most iconic candy makers — Mars, the manufacturer of M&M’s and Skittles.
Among the companies that have voluntarily agreed to eliminate synthetic dyes from their portfolios by the end of 2027 are Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestlé and ConAgra Brands.

Utah and Virginia have both enacted bans on multiple artificial dyes in foods sold or served in public schools.
Texas has opted for mandatory warning labels — rather than outright bans — on foods containing over 40 additives, including synthetic dyes, starting Jan. 1, 2027.","Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign to eliminate synthetic food dyes from the American food supply is facing stiff resistance from one of the country’s most iconic candy makers — Mars, the manufacturer of M&M’s and Skittles.

Mars released a statement earlier this week saying that it will continue using the synthetic dyes in its candies, reversing a pledge the company made in 2016 to remove artificial colors from all foods and snacks in its portfolio.

The company insisted to the New York Times that its products are “safe to enjoy and meet the high standards and applicable regulations set by food safety authorities around the world.”

While Mars has made incremental changes — such as eliminating titanium dioxide from Skittles — it continues to rely on artificial colorings, citing challenges with cost, limited availability of natural alternatives and consumer preferences for brightly colored treats.

The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy makers, has echoed Mars’ position.

“People can freely buy cannabis, THC products, alcohol, and cigarettes – but vibrantly colored candy is an issue? Give me a break,” spokesman Christopher Gindlesperger told The Post.

Gindlesperger said that consumers “know that confectionery products are treats and that they contain sugar, food colors, and other FDA-approved ingredients, because candy is intrinsically transparent.”

“People have a unique mindset when they enjoy chocolate and candy that is not present when interacting with other foods. Chocolate and candy are safe to enjoy as they have been for generations,” he said.

Gindlesperger added that the industry is “in firm agreement that science-based evaluation of food additives will help eliminate consumer confusion and rebuild trust in our national food safety system.”

“We follow and will continue to follow regulatory guidance from the authorities in this space, because consumer safety is our chief responsibility and priority.”

He noted that alternatives to synthetic dyes are more expensive, harder to source, and could raise prices due to limited supply.

“Companies need time to find alternatives,” Gindlesperger said.

The Post has sought comment from Kennedy, Mars and the National Confectioners Association.

Several leading food manufacturers have recently committed to removing synthetic, petroleum-based food dyes from their products in response to mounting public health concerns and growing consumer demand for cleaner ingredients.

Among the companies that have voluntarily agreed to eliminate synthetic dyes from their portfolios by the end of 2027 are Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestlé and ConAgra Brands.

Their decision follows advocacy efforts by health officials and organizations warning about potential links between artificial dyes and behavioral issues in children, as well as broader concerns over the safety of food additives.

In contrast, the candy industry has yet to fully embrace this movement.

While federal regulators have so far declined to crack down on artifical dyes, lawmakers at the state level have either introduced legislation or are considering proposals that would restrict or outright ban foods that contain synthetic coloring.

West Virginia has passed one of the most sweeping laws on synthetic food dyes, banning seven dyes and two preservatives from school meals starting Aug. 1 and from all foods sold statewide by Jan. 1, 2028.

Aliko Dangote plans to scale up production at his Lagos-based fertilizer plant to meet Africa’s growing demand and reduce import reliance.

Dangote says Africa can become self-sufficient in fertilizer within 40 months, easing food production pressures and foreign exchange constraints.

A potential Nigerian Exchange listing could unlock new capital as the plant operates at just half its total production capacity.

Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, has announced plans to expand his $3 billion fertilizer plant — Dangote Fertilizer Limited — as part of a wider effort to help the continent become self-sufficient in fertilizer production and reduce the high costs of imports. He made the announcement during the annual Afreximbank meeting held in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.

Dangote plans major fertilizer expansion

Dangote, who heads the Dangote Group — Africa’s most diversified industrial and manufacturing conglomerate — and is worth $23.3 billion according to Forbes, said the expansion will help meet Africa’s growing demand for fertilizer over the next 40 months.

He noted that the continent currently imports more than six million metric tons of fertilizer each year, a burden that’s made it harder for many countries to grow enough food, especially given challenging farming conditions.

“In the next 40 months, Africa will not import fertilizer from anywhere,” he said. “We’re moving fast. I want Dangote to be the biggest producer of urea in the world — bigger than Qatar. Just give me 40 months.” He added that increasing local production would ease the pressure on foreign exchange, a persistent challenge in Nigeria due to the weak naira.

NGX listing may reshape sector

This announcement comes at a time when Dangote Fertilizer Limited is preparing for a potential listing on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), which could value the company at more than $3 billion. The plant, located on a 500-hectare site in Ibeju Lekki, Lagos, is already the largest of its kind in Africa. But for Dangote, it’s never just been about size or valuation. His goal has long been to rebuild domestic industries and reduce Africa’s dependence on imports.

The facility has the capacity to produce up to 3 million metric tonnes of urea each year, twice what Nigeria currently needs. That extra capacity is expected to lower prices for local farmers, allow for customized blends tailored to specific soil needs, and open up export opportunities across the region. In short, it’s about creating a more self-reliant agricultural sector — not just for Nigeria, but for Africa as a whole.

Starting July 8, the coffee giant will officially introduce the brand-new Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverage to menus nationwide.

Inspired by the Italian word “strato,” which means “layer,” the drinks layer the Frappuccino with different cold foam flavors and colors.

The new drinks come as the classic Frappuccino celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.

“It’s the perfect time for a beverage like this,” Susan Engdahl, who is part of the team at Starbucks that helped create the beverage, said in a statement. “Customers know and love the Frappuccino blended beverage drink, and this gives them a new way to enjoy it.”

“As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of Frappuccino, we’re excited to offer a modern take on a classic beverage, with layers of flavor and creamy texture that customers are craving right now.”

The three new Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverages include:

Brown Sugar Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverage: A blend of Frappuccino Roast coffee, milk and ice, layered with brown sugar-flavored cream cold foam and topped with cinnamon.

Strawberry Matcha Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverage: A blend of Starbucks reformulated unsweetened matcha, classic syrup, milk and ice, layered with juicy strawberry-flavored cream cold foam.

Strato Frappuccinos were one of the first beverages to be tested through Starbucks’ recent Starting 5 program, in which five coffeehouses test new menu items before they roll out nationwide.

Here’s what you need to know about the company’s Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches and the return of the Snack Wrap.

McDonald’s debuts new line of Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches

The McDonald’s Egg McMuffin breakfast sandwich is perhaps the most iconic fast food breakfast item in the world. As a matter of fact, it’s so iconic that McDonald’s has a page on its site dedicated to the history of the Egg McMuffin.

The delectable breakfast sandwich was first invented in 1971 by Herb Peterson, a McDonald’s owner in Santa Barbara, California. In 1972, the sandwich got its “Egg McMuffin” name and went on sale in test markets for just 63 cents apiece. And in 1975, McDonald’s rolled out the Egg McMuffin nationally.

Egg McMuffin 50th anniversary

Yes, it has now been 50 years since the Egg McMuffin’s national rollout, and in celebration of this milestone, McDonald’s is releasing a line of new Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches.

The Spicy McMuffin sandwich has the egg, cheese, and bacon we all love, with the addition of a Spicy Pepper Sauce. McDonald’s is also releasing the Spicy Sausage McMuffin and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg to complete the lineup.

The Spicy McMuffin sandwiches go on sale today, Tuesday, July 8, and will only be available for a limited time. According to McDonald’s, they will be available at participating locations across the United States.

The beloved Snack Wrap returns, too

But what McDonald’s fans seem most excited about is the return of the Snack Wrap. The wrap was originally introduced in the United States in 2006 and became a favorite among many due to its crispy chicken and burrito-like form factor, making it easy to eat on the go.

The Snack Wrap featured white meat chicken, cheese, lettuce, and a choice of sauces.

But in 2016, McDonald’s discontinued nationwide sales of the Snack Wrap in the United States due to declining sales. Some locations still sold the handheld menu item until 2020, before it disappeared for good.

But now the Snack Wrap is back. McDonald’s has confirmed it will go on sale on Thursday, July 10. According to Axios, it is expected to be a permanent menu item and will cost $2.99.

Will menu changes help McDonald’s sales?

McDonald’s is bringing back the Snack Wrap and introducing new versions of a beloved classic at a time when consumers are increasingly conscious of the prices they pay for fast food, which was once seen as a reliable, low-cost meal option.

In recent years, fast food prices have skyrocketed, causing consumers to question their value.

Many fast food places have been trying to lure price-conscious consumers back with time-limited deals and special menu items, hoping that these will help boost their bottom line.

As for McDonald’s most recent quarter, fiscal Q1 2025, the burger chain reported a global comparable sales decrease of 1%. Sales were even worse in the United States, where comparable sales decreased 3.6%.

Since the beginning of the year, shares of McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE: MCD) have been on a bumpy ride. After falling to a year-to-date low of below $277 per share in January, MCD stock bounced back to highs of over $321 in May. But since then, MCD shares have tumbled again to close at under $294 as of yesterday. Since the new year began, MCD shares are now up about 1.2%.

Over the past 12 months, MCD shares have increased nearly 17%.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91364517-mcdonalds-big-announcement-return-of-the-snack-wrap-spicy-mcmuffin-breakfast-sandwiches.jpg",N,,2025-07-08 12:23:50.352503

Pardon the Disruption is a column that looks at the forces shaping food retail.

In the more than two years they spent trying to combine, Kroger and Albertsons held off on making any deep cuts to their businesses as they looked to curry favor with regulators and consumers.

But now that the supermarket megamerger isn’t happening, the two chains have returned in a big way to the tough but necessary work of making their stores, supply chains and corporate operations run more efficiently.

Call it making up for lost time. Kroger announced in late June that it plans to close 60 stores over the next year and a half. It promptly got to work, with local media reporting impending closures of company-owned stores across several regions. Albertsons, meanwhile, has laid off around 800 employees and shuttered close to a dozen stores so far this year, The Wall Street Journal reported.

There’s much more to come. Both grocers say they are looking to wring unnecessary costs out of their businesses and better focus their efforts on high-performing products and services. Albertsons is in the process of cutting $1.5 billion over a three-year period, while Kroger is looking to bring more discipline to its investments and cost structure.

“We’re going to modernize operations and ways of working across the board, from corporate to our stores and supply chain, to work smarter and more efficiently,” Kroger CFO David Kennerly said during the company’s earnings call at the end of June.

Instead of popping champagne, the nation’s largest supermarket chains are cutting deep so that they can continue battling the very forces that spurred their attempted merger. They are also suing each other over who’s to blame for the deal going up in flames.

The belt-tightening that both companies have embraced this year comes as no surprise, and it will go a long way toward keeping prices down and staying competitive. But Kroger and Albertsons can’t just hack and slash their way to a more compelling grocery experience. That’s going to take innovation and risk-taking. How will these supermarket giants beat the growing threat that low-price and specialty retailers pose?

Here are three things I’ll be watching in the months ahead.

All eyes on the CEOs

Both Kroger and Albertsons will forge ahead with new leadership at the helm. For Kroger, that new leader has yet to be identified four months after former CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an ethics review. Ron Sargent, who became interim CEO in March, said Kroger’s board of directors has formed a search committee and is currently working with a nationally recognized search firm to identify candidates.

As I wrote earlier this year, Kroger’s next permanent CEO will have a lot of challenges to address, including labor unrest, mounting industry competition, an overly complex e-commerce network and a brand campaign that’s starting to feel stale. The role also offers an opportunity to transform the conventional grocery model, and Kroger would do well to name someone with an innovative spirit.

Albertsons, on the other hand, has its new leader in Susan Morris, the former operations chief who took over for Vivek Sankaran in May. She’s coming into the CEO role at a difficult time. During the merger trial, lawyers painted Albertsons as a company with a bleak future. Since then, speculation has swirled about Albertsons eventually finding another suitor.

But Morris told The Wall Street Journal the company has no plans to sell. She said she wants to make Albertsons leaner and negotiate more forcefully with suppliers. She also sees opportunities to expand its leading retail media network and improve key areas like produce, private label and its loyalty program.

Morris told the Journal that Albertsons’ specialty is one-stop shopping. That may be true, but a lot fewer consumers are shopping this way than when Morris joined the company nearly 40 years ago. Albertsons needs to figure out how to be an important stop for today’s shop-around consumers.

What is Kroger going to do about e-commerce?

Kroger’s online business has been growing at a healthy clip. During its first fiscal quarter this year, e-commerce sales increased 15%, with delivery driving a growing number of households to engage digitally with the grocer. That’s well ahead of the overall sales growth rate in digital across the industry.

But e-commerce remains an unprofitable business for Kroger — and that needs to change, Sargent said during the company’s first-quarter earnings call.

“Our customers are embracing the whole digital model of our business. We are seeing improvements in profitability at an increasing rate. But to be clear… we’re not profitable at this point,” he said.

That’s an understandable goal, and one that comes at a time when fierce competitor Walmart says its online business is now profitable. Trouble is, Kroger seems to be a long way off from achieving this, with Sargent noting: “We still have a lot of work to do.”

The 800-pound gorilla in the room is Kroger’s network of automated fulfillment centers and spoke facilities powering its delivery service. This network needs to build scale and serve high levels of demand to achieve its full value, but right now Kroger and its fulfillment technology partner, Ocado, seem to be stuck figuring out how to make these facilities work for shoppers and Kroger’s bottom line.

Will both grocers continue to innovate?

Kroger and Albertsons have had a strong track record of innovation over the past several years. Both companies ramped up retail media and embraced trends like quick delivery, ghost kitchens and online marketplaces. While some of these bets didn’t pan out, their nimbleness and willingness to learn have been encouraging at a time of rapid evolution across retail.

Will that spirit of innovation diminish as the companies push for greater efficiency? That already seems to be happening, with neither company making the sort of eye-grabbing announcements in recent months that it used to.

I understand pulling back on e-commerce innovation, given how demand has moderated in that channel over the past two years. But Kroger and Albertsons need to take bold steps in areas that are key to their associates and in-store shoppers, including meal solutions, loyalty programs and employee services.

I live in an area that’s packed with QFC, Fred Meyer and Safeway stores, and I can tell you that none of them come to mind when I think, “What’s for dinner?” All of these locations carry prepared meals, salad kits, packaged sushi and more, but the selections are usually uninspiring and merchandised in out-of-the-way areas that make it feel like the companies are checking boxes rather than trying to entice shoppers.

McDonald’s McMuffin turned 50 this year, but it's just getting hotter.

The global fast food chain is bringing out new varieties to help ""spice up"" its breakfast menu in honor of the anniversary, including a Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

The new muffin choices will feature their traditional ingredients — cheese, egg, Canadian bacon or sausage and a buttered English muffin, topped with Spicy Pepper Sauce, according to a McDonald's news release.

The Egg McMuffin debuted in 1975 when Herb Peterson, a McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California, wanted to create a take-out version of Eggs Benedict. Roy Kroc, the businessman who transformed McDonald's into what it is today, loved the idea.

When is McDonald's Spicy McMuffin available?

The items are available beginning July 8 for a limited time at participating locations, according to the company.

McDonald's adds Daily Double burger to menu

That's not the only new thing under the golden arches. McDonald's has also added a new double burger on its menu: the Daily Double.

The Daily Double, available now nationwide, is made with two beef patties, a slice of American cheese, shredded lettuce, slivered onions, mayo and two tomato slices. The burger had been available in limited markets including Miami, Chicago and Seattle, but will be available nationally through 2025, the company said.

On July 22, the Daily Double will join McDonald's McValue Meal Deal options, served with a 4-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, small fries and small soft drink ($6 or $7; pricing depends on your restaurant). That menu still includes the $5 Meal Deal.

The burger is now appearing in the McDonald's app, where you can also get deals including a free medium order of fries with a $1 purchase in the app every Friday through the end of 2025.

Coming soon: the Snack Wrap

After nearly a decade, McDonald's announced the return of the Snack Wrap, one of McDonald's new McCrispy Strips topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. They're available in either Spicy (with a habanero kick) or Ranch (with Ranch dressing and hints of garlic and onion).

The Snack Wrap will be available on its own or in a combo meal featuring two Snack Wraps, medium fries and a drink.

Snack Wraps will be coming back to store menus permanently beginning Thursday, July 10, the company said.

To celebrate the return of the item, McDonald's has launched snackwrapfiles.com, a website they're calling ""fans’ VIP entry to all things Snack Wrap.""

Not a McDonald's fan? Try these instead

If you're not a big McDonald's fan or you somehow don't have one nearby, you can find alternatives.

Chick-fil-A doesn't feature a spicy chicken muffin, but you can either ask to get spicy chicken on it instead or just grab some of their Sweet & Spicy Sriracha Sauce.

Wendy's among others, has offered a double cheeseburger for years,

In June, Popeye's debuted a limited time Chicken Wrap, featuring Popeyes hand-breaded and battered chicken tenders with crispy lettuce, shredded cheese and crunchy pickles, all in a warm tortilla inspired by the flavor of Popeyes biscuits.

Tanner, who served as the CEO of Wendy’s for nearly a year and a half, was with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) before that for three decades. He assumed several leadership roles during his time at the beverage maker, including CEO of PepsiCo North America, overseeing the growth of brands such as Pepsi, Gatorade, and Mountain Dew.

Hershey’s shares were down 2.5% in early trading. The stock has gained 2% year-to-date.

Tanner will succeed Michele Buck as president and CEO, effective August 18.

Buck led Hershey for seven years and is retiring in 2026. She will work closely with Tanner in a senior advisory capacity to ensure his successful transition.

In May, Hershey topped quarterly results driven by demand for its salty snacks business in North America. The company, which houses Dot’s Pretzels, had seen demand pick up after product prices were lowered following several rounds of price hikes over the last few years.

Retail sentiment on Hershey has been ‘bearish’ over the past month, according to data from Stocktwits.

Separately, Wendy’s said it has appointed Ken Cook, its chief financial officer, as interim CEO. Cook, who remains CFO, joined the company in December 2024 and was previously with United Parcel Service (NYSE: ) for 20 years, including serving as head of Financial Planning and Analysis.

Wendy’s said its board has launched a comprehensive search process to select a permanent CEO.

The fast-food chain’s sales have slowed in 2025, particularly in the U.S., where consumer demand has wavered and traffic declines have impacted performance.

Wendy’s shares were down marginally. Stocktwits data showed the retail sentiment on the stock was in the ‘bearish’ territory, compared to ‘neutral’ a week ago.

According to Sherlock’s research, employees in many companies waste up to 20 percent of their time navigating unclear roles and responsibilities. This finding is reinforced by McKinsey’s State of Organizations 2023 report, which identified unclear roles as a top contributor to organizational inefficiency.

Org.Works launches at a time when companies are under pressure to move quickly in response to rapidly changing technology and market conditions. Many attempt to adapt by adding C-suite roles, launching new departments, or undergoing constant reorganization—often without improving execution. Current client work includes advising on AI strategy and structure, IT department design, digital and marketing team structure, and leadership realignment to improve decision-making and delivery.

“Too many organizations prioritize speed and innovation but overlook whether their structure supports either,” said Dr. Sherlock, who previously served as Chief Digital and Technology Officer at Ralph Lauren and now leads Org.Works. “Innovation, decision-making, and execution need to move fast—but organization structure must be the foundation that enables that speed, not the shifting sands beneath it.”

Sherlock’s recent TEDx talk, “Clarity Before Chaos: Building Organizations That Work,” was recently selected as a TEDx Editor’s Pick, an honor awarded to fewer than one percent of all TEDx talks globally. TED described the talk as “a valuable and timely idea for our global audience.”

She is recognized as a leading voice in both corporate and academic communities on organizational design, executive structure, and technology leadership. Her work has been cited in academic literature and featured in Business Insider’s article, “Why the C-Suite Is Getting So Big,” where she highlighted the risks of executive role proliferation and structural misalignment.

The new menu items include the Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg — all featuring the restaurant's new Spicy Pepper Sauce, the company said in a press release.

The nationwide offering coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, the sandwich credited with ushering in the chain's now-famed breakfast service.

Why It Matters

Breakfast menus have become a crucial battleground for fast food brands, with U.S. consumers increasingly seeking novel flavors and limited-time options.

The new sandwich highlights McDonald's efforts to capitalize on the ""spicy"" food trend, which has seen increased popularity across American fast food menus.

Industry analysts have noted that menu additions can drive short-term sales and boost brand engagement during seasonal promotions.

What To Know

The new sandwiches maintain the core elements of a McMuffin — cheddar cheese, a freshly cracked egg, Canadian bacon or sausage, and a toasted English muffin — but incorporate McDonald's signature Spicy Pepper Sauce. This blend offers ""a fiery, delicious twist,"" the company said.

McDonald's also said that its U.S. eggs are now ""100% cage-free,"" which is part of its broader ingredients update that aims to align with consumer demand for animal welfare.

The menu change marks the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin's nationwide rollout. Herb Peterson, a former McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California, created the sandwich in 1971 with the aim to produce a portable version of eggs benedict.

The innovation eventually gained national attention, notably through the efforts of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc, and played a pivotal role in establishing breakfast as a major sales segment for the chain.

Spicy flavors have become a focal point for fast food innovation, with multiple chains introducing heat-centric menu items to appeal to evolving consumer palates. McDonald's expansion into spicier breakfast options reflects a broader industry movement and an effort to differentiate its morning menu.

What People Are Saying

McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said in a press release earlier this year: ""At McDonald's, breakfast isn't just a meal; it's a cherished tradition and cornerstone of our brand... Every morning when we open our doors, we are a breakfast restaurant. Whether it's my personal favorite, the Egg McMuffin, or our crispy Hash Browns, fluffy hotcakes, or sweet and savory McGriddles, we're all about giving our customers the best start to their day. Our fans know they can always count on us for a one-of-a-kind breakfast experience, anchored in great value and high-quality ingredients.""

David Peterson, son of Herb and a McDonald's owner/operator, said: ""When I watched my father introduce this idea to Ray Kroc, we could not have anticipated it would become the foundation for the renowned McDonald's breakfast menu... It's been remarkable to see people embrace this innovation over the last five decades, and now we get to share that heritage with a new generation of breakfast fans.""

What Happens Next

Availability of the new breakfast sandwich may vary by location depending on franchise participation.

McDonald's urged customers not to delay, saying: ""The Spicy McMuffin won't last forever.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2678782/mcmuffin.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:24:00.782426

Carrier revenue per parcel ticked down to $9.09 down from $9.10 in 2023, according to Pitney Bowes.
“Since Pitney Bowes began tracking shipments a decade ago, the parcel market has been dominated by FedEx, UPS and USPS.
“This disruption presents a unique opportunity for businesses to take advantage of competitive pricing.” The Pitney Bowes findings echo earlier research from parcel management and consulting firm ShipMatrix Inc.
It put domestic parcel revenue at $188 billion and average revenue per parcel at $8.","Revenue growth for U.S. parcel shipping lagged volumes last year as an influx of new last-mile delivery companies put downward pressure on prices in a market that is expected to grow 36% by 2030, according to an annual industry report from Pitney Bowes.

Smaller carriers are increasingly taking market share from legacy carriers FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, but their biggest threat is Amazon. The retailer’s logistics operation handled 6.3 billion parcels in 2024, up 7.3% year over year, and is expected to overtake the Postal Service by 2028, Pitney Bowes (NYSE: PBI) said in its recent Parcel Shipping Index.

The provider of mail and parcel shipping services, technology and equipment said U.S. parcel volume increased 3.4% to 22.4 billion shipments last year and estimated it will grow 5% per year to $30.5 billion in 2030. Revenue, however, grew 2.7% last year to $203.2 billion.

Carriers are increasingly offering competitive pricing to attract customers, leading to lower revenue. Carrier revenue per parcel ticked down to $9.09 down from $9.10 in 2023, according to Pitney Bowes. Independent couriers gaining market traction in recent years include OnTrac, Better Trucks, Jitsu, Veho, SpeedX, Speedy Delivery and UniUni. Many of them are startups or provide regional service with lower overhead than national carriers. The U.S. Postal Service’s new lost-cost shipping option, Ground Advantage, has also contributed to the pricing pressure.

“Since Pitney Bowes began tracking shipments a decade ago, the parcel market has been dominated by FedEx, UPS and USPS. We are witnessing a turning of the tide, evidenced by the nearly 40% volume growth in the five-year compound annual growth rate of [alternative] carriers,” said Pitney Bowes Executive Vice President Shemin Nurmohamed, in a news release. “This disruption presents a unique opportunity for businesses to take advantage of competitive pricing.”

The Pitney Bowes findings echo earlier research from parcel management and consulting firm ShipMatrix Inc. It put domestic parcel revenue at $188 billion and average revenue per parcel at $8. Domestic parcel volumes will grow at a compound annual rate of 4% over the next three years, with Amazon, Walmart and other carriers winning the lion’s share of new business. FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service will likely experience flat to negative growth, ShipMatrix said.

The U.S. Postal Service retained its hold as the largest parcel carrier by volume with 6.9 billion shipments in 2024, an increase of 3.4% from the prior year, per Pitney Bowes. UPS volume increased 1.7% to 4.7 billion pieces. FedEx was the only carrier to experience a year-over-year decline, with 3.9 billion parcels compared to 3.7 billion in 2023. The combined volume for other small couriers jumped 23% to 800 million pieces.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xOhqGdn.i95Y.Kdkkm9VsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/freightwaves_373/420679dba59cc31038cbad63f1bad928,N,,2025-07-08 16:09:48.736037

Broken Yolk Café is expanding into a major new market.

Brothers John, Bryant and Jason Corona have partnered with their father, Juan Corona, and uncle, Saul DeLa Rosa, to expand Broken Yolk’s presence in Southern California. Juan was the first-ever franchisee to join El Pollo Loco in 1981. The family also operates multiple Movita Juice Bar locations.

“Our family had the opportunity to dine in at one of Broken Yolk Cafe’s Las Vegas locations not too long ago, and the experience left a lasting impression,” said John Corona. “The food was incredible, the hospitality was infectious, and after getting to meet the brand’s president for ourselves, it was clear the leadership and direction of the franchise were second to none.”

Founded in 1979 in the San Diego area, Broken Yolk has expanded into Idaho, Nevada, Arizona and Texas. The chain operates a systemwide total of 41 locations.

Moms are very often the lead decision makers for family purchases – and product information plays a key role in what they decide to purchase.

A new survey from motherhood and pregnancy media outlet What to Expect reveals that more than three-quarters (77%) of mothers are primary decision-makers for family purchases, with more than half (55%) saying that managing family finances mostly falls to them.

More than half of moms (57%) surveyed said “proven safe” is a top priority when buying for their kids, and 52% say they’ve walked away from a product because of poor online reviews. A quarter of moms said they’ve skipped a purchase entirely because the product lacked enough photos or details that could address any safety factors or concerns.

Forty-three percent of moms said they want to choose products that make them feel like they’re doing the best they can for their family.

Product reviews are key to purchase decisions, especially with prices remaining high amid new tariffs on imported goods. What to Expect said that one mom in its survey said “I care about quality, ease of use and adaptability, but I also have a tight budget.” Another noted that she struggles with “having to choose between so many options, and price differences.”

The $3.3 billion all-cash deal brings together two complementary giants, enabling Capgemini to deepen its Digital Business Process Services (BPS) portfolio, especially as enterprises worldwide seek AI-powered operational transformation.

Why This Acquisition Matters

WNS’s strength lies in domain-centric digital services delivered through 25 Indian delivery centres. With 40000+ employees and a strong presence in verticals like banking, healthcare, logistics, and insurance, the acquisition adds scale and specialization to Capgemini’s already diverse global footprint.

The 28 percent premium reflects WNS’s strategic value, driven by long-standing relationships and deep domain knowledge. The integration also aligns well culturally and operationally, ensuring smoother post-acquisition synergy.

AI and Intelligent Operations Take Center Stage

Capgemini is betting big on AI. With over euro 900 million in Gen AI bookings in 2024 and partnerships with Google, AWS, Microsoft, and NVIDIA, this acquisition positions the company as a front-runner in intelligent operations. WNS’s expertise in domain-led, automation-first models complements Capgemini’s platform-driven vision of transforming businesses from digital to autonomous.

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat emphasized that the shift toward autonomy—where businesses embed AI across workflows—is the future. WNS CEO Keshav Murugesh echoed this, noting clients now seek deeper transformation rather than just efficiency through automation.

India at the Heart of It

India continues to play a pivotal role in global BPM, contributing over 50 percent of WNS’s revenue. The country offers both cost and talent advantages, and centres like Vizag and Hyderabad are now key nodes in the global delivery network. With WNS now part of Capgemini, this strategic presence will likely expand further, reinforcing India’s dominance in global service delivery.

What’s Next?

The transaction awaits regulatory and shareholder approvals, including from the Royal Court of Jersey. If completed as planned by year-end, the merged entity will become a formidable player with euro 23.3 billion in revenue and an expanded Digital BPS footprint—ready to lead in the AI-first era of business transformation.",https://trak.in/stories/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-08-at-7.13.28 AM-1024x572.png,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:13.735238

But now we're seeing shares sort of revert here as these, as these retailers sort of try to understand how exactly they can stock up accordingly from the holiday.
But what we saw there was we saw shares pull back on Monday morning, down roughly 4% there in after-hours trading, or rather at the close.
What we know there is that these Lululemon, a key source they have there is from Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and Thailand.","Brooke, I know you've been talking to a lot of retailers. I thought it was really interesting initially when that sort of Vietnam deal was announced, or the framework for a deal, the outline of a deal. We saw shares of companies like Lululemon go up. We saw them pull back a little bit yesterday, and I guess some of this is just reflecting the environment that these companies are navigating.

Certainly. What I'm hearing from my sources is that uncertainty here is really the name of the game as these retailers try to make way and stock up ahead of that key back-to-school shopping season, and really that key holiday season. And what we've seen over the past two days is that, take for example, Best Buy. We saw the company put out their updated guidance in late May of this year. And what they had said at the time was that this assumes that tariffs stay exactly the same as they are. Now what we know here is that Best Buy sources 40% of their electronics from Vietnam, India, South Korea, and Taiwan. Now, what we heard yesterday is now we have South Korea at 25%. We also heard last week that Vietnam is at 20%. And so now that updated guidance may be in question here. And that's what really led the stock to move lower on Monday, down roughly 2% according to our Yahoo Finance toolbox here. But now we're seeing shares sort of revert here as these, as these retailers sort of try to understand how exactly they can stock up accordingly from the holiday. Now, another company they want to take a look at is Lululemon. Of course, they're the apparel company. They make athletic gear. They make the shoes. But what we saw there was we saw shares pull back on Monday morning, down roughly 4% there in after-hours trading, or rather at the close. And now those shares are pulling back a bit. What we know there is that these Lululemon, a key source they have there is from Cambodia, China, Vietnam, and Thailand. Now we're hearing those rates, those tariff rates coming higher. And also, as you could see here, what we talked about last week is those sneaker giants key sourcing regions that they source from include Vietnam, Indonesia, and China. And now we're hearing of higher tariff rates from there as well. And so certainly it's creating a lot of uncertainty. That's still the key word when it comes to these retail stocks as they really did attempt to pull forward, but now, as we heard from Target, that somewhat led to excess inventory. And now what we're seeing this week, those mega deals from Amazon, Walmart, even Tractor Supply, and Home Depot, and Best Buy also getting in on this big deals week.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Y5Lj7gu9v0qQoQlwli3vFg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/64b28fd0-5bfe-11f0-9297-cc9b01d5caab,N,,2025-07-08 13:13:01.408042

This strategic move aims to enhance Capgemini’s technological capabilities, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), and to provide more comprehensive solutions to enterprises. With a significant portion of WNS’s workforce based in India, this acquisition highlights the country’s growing significance in Capgemini’s global operations.

Details of the Acquisition

Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS comes a decade after its purchase of Igate, another Indian IT firm, for $4 billion. The deal is particularly noteworthy as WNS, founded in 1996, has established itself as a key player in the BPM industry, serving major clients such as United Airlines, Aviva, and McCain Foods. With over 44,000 of its 65,000 employees located in India, WNS’s integration into Capgemini is expected to bolster the latter’s operational capabilities significantly. The acquisition price of $76.5 per share represents a 17% premium over WNS’s closing stock price on July 3, reflecting Capgemini’s confidence in the value of this strategic partnership.

Strategic Implications for Capgemini

Capgemini’s CEO, Aiman Ezzat, emphasized the importance of this acquisition in the context of the rapidly evolving technological landscape. He noted that enterprises are increasingly adopting generative AI and agentic AI to enhance their operations. The integration of WNS’s expertise into Capgemini’s offerings is expected to facilitate a shift from traditional business process services to AI-powered intelligent operations. This strategic move positions Capgemini to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the digital BPM space, allowing it to provide more innovative solutions to its clients.

WNS’s Growth and Future Prospects

WNS has demonstrated impressive growth, achieving an average constant currency revenue increase of over 9% over the past three fiscal years. The company reported revenues of $1.2 billion in the 2025 financial year, with an operating margin of 18.7%. This strong performance underscores WNS’s potential to contribute significantly to Capgemini’s overall revenue, which stood at approximately €22.1 billion last fiscal year. The acquisition is anticipated to enhance Capgemini’s business services footprint, enabling it to deliver next-generation, data-driven operations across various sectors.

Leadership Perspectives

Keshav R Murugesh, CEO of WNS, expressed optimism about the merger, stating that the combination of WNS’s domain expertise with Capgemini’s global reach and advanced technology platforms will create a compelling proposition for clients. He highlighted the potential for accelerated enterprise reinvention through this partnership, which aims to leverage cutting-edge AI capabilities. The collaboration is expected to enhance the service offerings of both companies, positioning them as leaders in the digital BPM market.

“We are always looking for different ways to offer great tasting, compelling choices for our consumers,” Nestle’s U.S. CEO Marty Thompson said in a statement. “As their diverse dietary preferences and nutritional needs evolve, we evolve with them.”

Nestle said 90% of its U.S. products already contain no synthetic dyes. The company has been removing them from its products for the past 10 years, it said in a statement.

Nestle’s announcement dovetails with those of other major U.S. food companies.

Kraft Heinz and General Mills previously announced plans to remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027.

General Mills said it plans to remove synthetic dyes from its U.S. cereals and all foods served in K-12 schools by mid-2026, and J.M Smucker Co. said it intends to remove artificial colors from its products by the end of 2027, according to media reports.

Petroleum-based food dyes have been linked to a variety of health concerns, including allergies, cancer and behavioral changes.

They are synthetic color additives derived from crude oil and include artificial dyes such as Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5 and Blue No. 1.

The recent moves follow decades of scrutiny.

In January, the U.S. government banned Red No. 3 from the nation’s food supply, nearly 35 years after the dye was banned from cosmetics due to potential cancer risks.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is among the strongest critics of these additives.

In April, he and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary announced that the FDA is asking food companies to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of next year and substitute petrochemical dyes with natural ingredients.

“We have a new epidemic of childhood diabetes, obesity, depression, and ADHD,” Makary said in a statement. “Given the growing concerns of doctors and parents about the potential role of petroleum-based food dyes, we should not be taking risks and do everything possible to safeguard the health of our children.”

About two-thirds of Americans support restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove added dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll cited by CBS News.

Many states are taking this matter into their own hands.

California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.

In late June, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill requiring a new safety label on foods made with synthetic dyes or additives. The label will state that the products contain ingredients “not recommended for human consumption.”

Why it matters: The contracts for 116,000 tons of CO2 removal between 2028 and 2030, for buyers working through the Frontier consortium, comprise Arbor's biggest deal yet.

It's one of the ""anchor agreements"" that will help the 3-year-old startup finance and build its first commercial-scale plant near Lake Charles, Louisiana, CEO Brad Hartwig tells me.

Driving the news: Buyers include Stripe, Google, Shopify, McKinsey, Autodesk, H&M and various others.

The new deal follows a much smaller agreement with Microsoft last year.

How it works: Arbor is a bioenergy with carbon capture (BECCS) startup, using waste biomass that will initially come from forest management.

But it's an evolution of BECCS, with 99% capture and high efficiency, a blog post states.

Its process first gasifies biomass, then burns that gas in a special furnace with pure oxygen (""oxy-combustion""), producing water but also ""supercritical"" CO2 that drives a turbine.

This simplifies and reduces CO2 capture costs, and the water can be used for irrigation or data center cooling, Arbor and Frontier said.

Reality check: First-of-a-kind hardware systems often don't survive the journey to commercial deployment or scale.

But Hartwig sees Arbor's system among the energy sources that stand to benefit from the AI boom.

""Demand for carbon-free energy is just accelerating at rates that are completely unprecedented, and we have a pretty unique technology stack that can deliver 24/7, carbon-free energy that is cheap and firm,"" he tells Axios.

What we're watching: ""We've gotten a lot of interest from a whole host of folks, from hyperscalers to regulated utilities looking to develop projects for matching supply with load for data centers,"" Hartwig said.

The intrigue: Asked whether Trump 2.0's reversal of climate policies creates headwinds, he argued the opposite, citing ""real interest in baseload power that can add to grid resilience.""

He also said behind-the-meter deployments are possible, avoiding the need for transmission or waiting in interconnection queues.

State of play: ""Its compact design features an 18 MW turbine about the size of a car engine, allowing for efficient scaling and cost reductions,"" the announcement states.

Its modular system and oxy-combustion tech don't produce exhaust or pollution, avoiding the cost of adding separate CO2 capture units.

Scaling the technology provides an eventual pathway toward getting under $100/ton of removal, the post states.

The tech also works using natural gas, which would provide power with CO2 capture, but it's not removal without the biomass.

The bottom line: ""The demand from AI is a big part of helping pull technologies like ours across the development valleys of death, to get a new technology into the world,"" Hartwig said.",https://images.axios.com/qrL0fG8lxmy16vSCUiwY4oIBqx8=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/07/07/1751929782005.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 10:07:01.512991

Plant-based nutrition brand Kate Farms has launched two high-protein shakes to tackle “critical nutrition gaps” from GLP-1 use, its first product since its acquisition by Danone.

Just a week after finalising its takeover by dairy giant Danone, US plant-based nutrition firm Kate Farms is taking on Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and the like with new shakes that target a major side effect.

These weight-loss drugs work by suppressing people’s appetite, and this can lead to muscle loss and “critical nutrition gaps”, the brand said. Research shows that GLP-1 use can lead to a 25-40% decrease in muscle mass over eight to 16 months, several times greater than non-medicated weight loss approaches and age-related muscle loss.

Kate Farms’s High-Protein Nutrition Shakes have been specifically formulated to address this “unmet health need”. Made from a base of pea protein, they’re designed to support muscle health, manage weight, and navigate GLP-1 treatment.

“We’ve heard clearly from healthcare professionals and GLP-1 users that appetite suppression often leads to unintentional muscle loss and nutrient gaps. That’s a serious concern,” Kate Farms CMO Catherine Hayden tells Green Queen.

“This product was developed with those insights in mind: 25g of protein, 6g of fibre for digestive health and satiety, and 27 essential vitamins and minerals,” she adds.

Built on input from health experts and GLP-1 users

The shakes are available in chocolate and strawberry flavours, and contain no sugar, instead relying on monk fruit and stevia leaf extracts for sweetening. They contain Spectra, a plant-based phytonutrient blend shown to stimulate antioxidant activity and inhibit free radical production.

The 325ml cartons contain all nine essential amino acids that our bodies can’t produce, making the shakes a complete protein. They’re available in a ready-to-drink format on its website and Amazon for $55 per 12-pack.

The nutrition shakes are the result of 18 months of R&D and hundreds of rounds of iteration, nutrient refinement, and quality assurance. Kate Farms studied the nutritional shortcomings of existing options on the market and consulted with leading healthcare experts and GLP-1 users.

“We conducted extensive taste testing at our Innovation and Quality Center, which is co-located with our headquarters. This included preference testing and sensory panels – particularly with GLP-1 users – who helped shape the final flavour and formula,” explains Hayden.

“GLP-1 users have expressed experiencing changes in their perception of flavour while taking these medications, particularly becoming more sensitive to sweetness,” she adds, nodding to a phenomenon dubbed ‘Ozempic tongue‘.

“Our sensory work included panellists currently taking GLP-1 medications, in addition to panellists not currently taking those medications, to ensure that we were able to delight consumers, regardless of what tools they are using on their health journeys. We didn’t launch until we had something people genuinely wanted to drink every day.”

Why Kate Farms is focusing on GLP-1 and protein

One in eight Americans has already used a GLP-1 medication, and forecasts suggest this could rise to up to 70 million people by 2028 – and by that year, they’ll likely have boosted the national GDP by 1%.

Ozempic and its counterparts have had a knock-on effect on the food industry, with GLP-1 users spending 11% less on most categories of food, and over half (56%) aiming to make healthier food choices. Foods high in sugar, fat and calories stand to lose, while protein and fibre are all the rage.

Food companies are already rethinking their offerings. Nestlé has a new brand dedicated to GLP-1 users, Coca-Cola has launched a prebiotic soda, while PepsiCo bought Poppi for nearly $2B. Conagra Brands has introduced ‘GLP-1 friendly’ labels on packaging for some of its Healthy Choice ready meals, and Daily Harvest (now owned by Chobani) now offers a line of high-protein, high-fibre smoothies.

“The rise of GLP-1s has reinforced that people need clinically precise, sustaining nutrition, and we’re proud to deliver it,” says Hayden, before adding: “This shake was purpose-built for anyone navigating health change – whether or not they’re using GLP-1 medications. We’re focused on people managing weight intentionally, supporting muscle health and seeking doctor-trusted, clean-label nutrition that works.”

The launch serves the growing demand for protein. A 3,000-person survey last year found that the two nutrients Americans are most interested in consuming were protein (71%) and fibre (64%). And polling by Chobani revealed that 85% of these consumers are looking to add more protein to their diet this year.

“Protein is more in demand than ever because people are focusing on strength, muscle health and long-term health – especially amid weight-loss journeys or GLP-1 treatment. But not all protein is created equal,” says Hayden, pointing to the complete amino acid profile of its shakes. “It’s clinically developed, allergen-free and designed without artificial sweeteners or preservatives – helping consumers feel the difference in both taste, quality and outcomes without compromising on ingredient selection of quality.”

She continues: “While plant protein may have had sensory hurdles in the past, we are seeing an increasing number of consumers who are seeking to add more plants to their diets. Plant-based protein options are currently outpacing growth in the ready-to-drink protein shake market. The opportunity that we see is to bring our wholesome ingredients with clinical precision to the growing plant-based segment.”

Danone acquisition will help Kate Farms expand nutrition access

The High-Protein Nutrition Shakes are the first products Kate Farms has launched as a Danone portfolio company. The two companies announced the acquisition in May, with the goal of expanding the firm’s nutrition formulas and shakes to hospitals and consumers across the US and beyond.

“This is a merger of missions. Danone shares our belief that good nutrition is essential to better health and that alignment is what makes this partnership so meaningful,” says Hayden.

While these new shakes were already in development before the acquisition, they represent “exactly why the partnership makes sense”: “It’s about scaling purposefully – meeting more people’s needs with science-based, high-integrity nutrition. We see this as the first of many innovations that reflect our shared mission.”

Founded in 2012, Kate Farms has raised $188M over several rounds to date, including a $75M Series C round led by Novo Holdings, the parent company of Ozempic and Wegovy manufacturer Novo Nordisk. It has a deep focus on the concept of food-as-medicine. According to a poll by the Rockefeller Foundation last month, nine in 10 patients would prefer to rely more on healthy eating than on medications to manage their condition.

“Kate Farms is staying focused on what we’ve always done best: providing clinically-developed, plant-based nutrition that’s trusted by doctors and loved by customers,” Hayden says when asked about the firm’s plan over the next 12 months.

“Being part of Danone allows us to bring that same high-integrity nutrition to more people across both medical and everyday wellness settings – while maintaining the standards, intention, and care Kate Farms is known for.”",https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/danone-kate-farms-ozempic-glp-1-high-protein-plant-based-nutrition-shakes-social.png,N,,2025-07-08 10:06:36.878405

In separate moves two months ago, Danone bought a majority interest in plant-based nutritional product provider Kate Farms and launched a line of ready-to-drink Oikos Protein Shakes targeting both fitness enthusiasts and the rapidly growing market of users of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.

Timed to leverage Amazon Prime Day, Kate Farms today launches its own High Protein Nutrition Shakes, designed specifically “for people managing weight intentionally, including those using GLP-1s,” Kate Farms CMO Catherine Hayden tells Marketing Daily.

Hayden stresses that both Kate Farms and Oikos “are focused on expanding access to high-quality nutrition and addressing evolving consumer health needs.”

And both are looking to make inroads in what Hayden cites as a nearly $2 billion U.S. protein shake market. Within that category, though, is “an outsized level of growth in the plant-based segment,” she says. “The opportunity we saw was to bring our wholesome ingredients with clinical precision to [that] segment.”

The clinical part is key as, unlike Oikos, Kate Farms comes to the CPG protein shake market not from selling yogurt but from a nine-year history of selling both nutritional shakes and tube-feeding formulas to the healthcare community.

Yet, while most of Kate Farms’ business comes from such B2B sales (it now supplies product to more than 1,400 hospitals), the marketer is not new to CPG. It began selling in natural food stores even before its B2B push began. Its line of Nutrition Shakes now represent Kate Farm’s fastest-growing product segment, Heyden says, with special appeal to people with food sensitivities.

The difference between Kate Farms’ High Protein Nutrition Shake and other products, she claims, is plant-based nutrition “with clinical precision…developed with the same rigor as our medical nutrition portfolio.”

The new product is launching on Amazon Prime Day “to reach highly engaged shoppers and drive early trial and awareness,” says Hayden. It's also available via KateFarms.com, to reach consumers “already searching for trusted, high-protein options.”

Retail expansion is then planned for later this year and 2026, she says.

“We’re also actively engaging healthcare professionals [HCPs] so they can confidently recommend [the shake] to patients who need clean-label, high-protein nutrition,” she adds.

Marketing of the High Protein Nutrition Shake is being targeted to both HCPs and consumers via a “multichannel approach… anchored in the idea of Protein with Purpose—the belief that protein should do more than just hit a number,” Hayden says. “This shake was created to help people stay nourished through real change, whether they’re managing weight, using GLP-1s, or being more intentional about their health.

“For consumers, we’re leading with that purpose, not just the product features, but why they matter,” she explains.

“In designing the product, we focused on consumers who were on a health journey that may benefit not just from more grams of protein, but an overall product that could help support their nutrition goals.

McDonald’s McMuffin turned 50 this year, but it's just getting hotter.

The global fast food chain is bringing out new varieties to help ""spice up"" its breakfast menu in honor of the anniversary, including a Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

The new muffin choices will feature their traditional ingredients — cheese, egg, Canadian bacon or sausage and a buttered English muffin, topped with Spicy Pepper Sauce, according to a McDonald's news release.

The Egg McMuffin debuted in 1975 when Herb Peterson, a McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California, wanted to create a take-out version of Eggs Benedict. Roy Kroc, the businessman who transformed McDonald's into what it is today, loved the idea.

McDonald's adds Daily Double burger to menu

That's not the only new thing under the golden arches. McDonald's has also added a new double burger on its menu: the Daily Double.

The Daily Double, available now nationwide, is made with two beef patties, a slice of American cheese, shredded lettuce, slivered onions, mayo and two tomato slices. The burger had been available in limited markets including Miami, Chicago and Seattle, but will be available nationally through 2025, the company said.

On July 22, the Daily Double will join McDonald's McValue Meal Deal options, served with a 4-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, small fries and small soft drink ($6 or $7; pricing depends on your restaurant). That menu still includes the $5 Meal Deal.

The burger is now appearing in the McDonald's app, where you can also get deals including a free medium order of fries with a $1 purchase in the app every Friday through the end of 2025.

Coming soon: the Snack Wrap

After nearly a decade, McDonald's announced the return of the Snack Wrap, one of McDonald's new McCrispy Strips topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. They're available in either Spicy (with a habanero kick) or Ranch (with Ranch dressing and hints of garlic and onion).

The Snack Wrap will be available on its own or in a combo meal featuring two Snack Wraps, medium fries and a drink.

Snack Wraps will be coming back to store menus permanently beginning Thursday, July 10, the company said.

To celebrate the return of the item, McDonald's has launched snackwrapfiles.com, a website they're calling ""fans’ VIP entry to all things Snack Wrap.""

S&P Global Ratings said it’s considering cutting Centene Corp.’s credit ratings to junk, citing the health insurer’s suspending its 2025 profit outlook. Centene said last week that it was withdrawing its previous forecast for its earnings for the year, because insurance market trends were veering from its assumptions, particularly in the plans it offers under the Affordable Care Act. Without that information, S&P has less confidence that the insurer will build the capital it needs quickly enough, the bond grader said in a statement on Monday. (Hall, 7/7)

Molina Healthcare became the latest health insurer to warn that higher medical costs will hit earnings this year, adding to Wall Street’s worries about an industry already facing the loss of millions of customers because of the newly passed Republican megabill. Last week, shares plunged across the industry after Molina’s larger competitor Centene withdrew its financial guidance for 2025, saying its profits would fall well short of what the company previously expected. In the wake of that, Molina’s announcement wasn’t a complete surprise, limiting the immediate downside to the shares of the California-based managed care company and its competitors.

The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) has granted conditional approval for a proposed commercial cooperation between Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines.

The approval comes after CCCS reviewed the airlines’ proposed collaboration, which involves coordination on pricing and capacity for their full-service operations — specifically on the highly trafficked Singapore-Kuala Lumpur (SIN-KUL) route.

The application was first submitted on 24 March 2023, and updated on 3 November 2023, to clarify that the cooperation applies only to the airlines’ full-service operations.

CCCS found that the cooperation could reduce competition due to coordination on pricing and seat capacity.

To address these concerns, the airlines submitted a set of commitments which include maintaining weekly seat capacity at pre-cooperation levels, proposing capacity increases only upon meeting certain performance targets, submitting annual operational data for their respective low-cost carriers on the SIN-KUL route, and appointing an independent auditor to monitor compliance with these commitments.

From February 11 to 4 March 2025, CCCS consulted industry stakeholders. No objections were raised.

CCCS also considered the upcoming exit of Jetstar Asia from the SIN-KUL route and concluded that the commitments were sufficient.

Based on this, CCCS has approved the cooperation with conditions.

Effective July 14, 2025, Chad will be responsible for overseeing the Finance function for Medtronic Diabetes and supporting initiatives aimed at accelerating profitable growth and delivering shareholder value as it prepares to become fully independent.

Chad brings over 25 years of financial leadership experience across healthcare, consumer, and industrial sectors. Most recently, he served as CFO at BIC (BB:PA), a publicly traded global consumer goods leader, where he played a pivotal role in the successful execution of the company's transformation to drive innovation, sustainable growth, operational efficiency, and shareholder value. He started his career at General Electric, where he spent a decade in management positions of increasing responsibility in corporate audit and financial planning, as well as in a senior finance role in GE Energy. Chad then assumed CFO roles at Raffaela Apparel Group (a Cerberus Capital Management portfolio company) and Slingshot Health, and held senior operational finance roles at Tenex Capital Management, a middle-market private equity firm he co-founded with over $1 billion in investments. He holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and serves on the board of directors at Stamford Hospital.

His appointment underscores our commitment to building a strong foundation for long-term success so we can continue to enhance the lives of individuals with diabetes we're privileged to serve.""

In June, Medtronic announced MiniMed as the name for the company following the intended separation. The name honors its 40-year legacy of being at the forefront of transforming diabetes care to make it simpler and more accessible to the millions of people around the world with intensively managed type 1 and type 2 diabetes (or those needing daily insulin injections to manage their blood sugar levels because their body doesn't produce enough insulin or isn't able to use it effectively). MiniMed's Mission is to make diabetes more predictable so everyone can embrace life to the fullest.

""I'm excited for the opportunity to help shape the future of a company with such a meaningful Mission, and I look forward to working with Que and the leadership team to build a strong, agile finance organization that supports innovation, drives sustainable growth, and creates long-term value for all stakeholders,"" said Chad Spooner.

Medtronic expects to complete the separation within 18 months of the initial announcement through a series of capital markets transactions, subject to customary conditions and legal requirements including consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies.

Starbucks UK is reopening applications for its Accelerated Leadership Programme, a 13-month fast-track scheme aimed at turning entry-level hires into store managers.

The initiative, which coincides with the UK’s Youth Employment Week, will accept over 20 new participants this year. No previous work or hospitality experience is required.

Applications open on 7 July and close on 21 July.

Training for each participant is free, with Starbucks investing £5,000 (£100,000 in total) in their professional development.

Delivered in partnership with training provider Corndel, the programme combines hands-on experience in stores and ends with a Level 3 apprenticeship qualification, roughly equivalent to an A Level.

Graduates will also receive accreditation from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI).

This is the second intake for the newly formed Accelerated Leadership Programme, with 14 partners currently progressing through the scheme after the first round of applications opened earlier this year in April.

In total, Starbucks will invest more than £170,000 across the two cohorts.

The initiative is part of Starbucks UK’s ongoing commitment to providing young people with career opportunities.

It runs alongside a year-round apprenticeship scheme offering 150 new roles across the business, from entry-level baristas to degree-level positions in the support centre.

Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).
We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities law.","CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 8, 2025 – Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced plans to evaluate strategic alternatives for its Productivity Solutions and Services (“PSS”) and Warehouse and Workflow Solutions (“WWS”) businesses, which serve the transportation, warehouse and logistics markets. This enables Honeywell to further simplify its portfolio in order to accelerate value creation ahead of its planned separation into three independent, industry-leading companies, which is expected to be complete in the second half of 2026.

“Today’s announcement marks an important milestone in positioning Honeywell for success as a pure-play automation business following our planned Honeywell Aerospace separation next year,” said Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO of Honeywell. “With a simpler and more cohesive portfolio that serves the end markets of buildings, process and industrials, Honeywell will focus on our core areas of automation expertise, each of which is exposed to long-term secular growth drivers that position us as a powerful, global automation leader.”

PSS, with 2024 revenue of more than $1 billion, is a leading provider of mobile computers, barcode scanners, and printing solutions serving the warehouse and logistics market. WWS, which generated nearly $1 billion in revenue in 2024, is a leading provider of supply chain and warehouse automation projects, services and products – including automated sortation systems, palletizers, conveyors and robotics solutions as well as aftermarket services and software. WWS operates commercially under the brand names Intelligrated and Transnorm.

Kapur added: “Both leaders in their respective markets, PSS and WWS have deep customer and channel relationships, broad product offerings and innovative technologies that help improve efficiency, safety and productivity across the transportation, warehouse and logistics markets. We are encouraged by the recent performance of PSS and WWS and intend to seek opportunities to build on their unique strengths as we determine the best path forward that maximizes value for all our stakeholders.”

As Honeywell continues shaping its portfolio ahead of the planned separation, it has also appointed industry veteran Jim Masso to lead its process automation business. Masso will serve as President and CEO of Honeywell Process Automation, effective July 14, 2025. He brings 20 years of experience in energy services, engineering, operations and management, most recently as President & CEO of Allied Power Group. Prior to that, he held several senior leadership roles at General Electric and delivered transformative solutions across GE's energy portfolio.

Kapur concluded: “We are pleased to welcome Jim Masso to Honeywell to lead our process automation business. Having dedicated his career to leading complex, large-scale projects across the industry, he brings a deep understanding of the energy sector and an extensive background in driving customer-centric innovation that make him well-suited to lead this business into its next chapter of growth and innovation.”

Honeywell’s evaluation of strategic alternatives for its PSS and WWS businesses will run in parallel with ongoing portfolio workstreams and will not impact previously announced timelines for the separations of Solstice Advanced Materials by the end of 2025 or early 2026, and Honeywell Aerospace in the second half of 2026. There can be no assurance that pursuing strategic alternatives will result in any transaction or other outcome.

Since June 2023, Honeywell has announced a number of strategic actions to drive organic growth and simplify its portfolio, including $14 billion of accretive acquisitions: Compressor Controls Corporation, SCADAfence, the Access Solutions business from Carrier Global, Civitanavi Systems, CAES Systems, the LNG business from Air Products, Sundyne, Johnson Matthey's Catalyst Technologies Business and Li-ion Tamer. Honeywell also completed the sale of its Personal Protective Equipment business to Protective Industrial Products in May 2025.

Honeywell has retained Centerview Partners as the company’s financial advisor to assist in assessing strategic alternatives.

Capgemini plans to acquire WNS for $3.3 billion to strengthen its business process outsourcing. The deal awaits shareholder and regulatory approvals, expected by the end of 2025. Capgemini anticipates revenue and margin growth from the acquisition. The combined entity aims to compete with major consulting firms. Concerns exist about AI's impact on the BPO sector and the acquisition's financial burden.

French IT services major Capgemini is keen on building its business process outsourcing (BPO) muscle with its latest acquisition: domain leader WNS. The deal, announced on Monday, will see the two companies pool their capabilities to address the growing enterprise demand for advanced, automated services.

Concerns, however, remain over the prospects. Analysts and investors are worried about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the BPO sector, and the subsequent hit on revenue from the vertical. Capgemini shares reflected these worries during yesterday’s trade.

We take a look at the bones of the deal, and it's likely implications:

Capgemini-WNS deal: Key details

Capgemini had agreed to pay $76.5 for each WNS share, which amounts to $3.3 billion (about Rs 28,280 crore) in cash. This is 17% higher than the closing price of the shares on July 3. They rallied 14% on Monday.

The IT major has secured bridge financing of €4 billion to pay this sum, as well as meet some other obligations. It will refinance the bridge with €1 billion cash and the rest through debt issuance.

The boards of both companies have consented to the deal, which now awaits approval from WNS shareholders and regulators. It is expected to be closed by the end of 2025.

Capgemini expects the acquisition to immediately boost its revenue and margins, projecting a 4% rise in earnings per share (EPS) in 2026 and 7% the year after. It has projected revenue synergies between €100–140 million ($117.8–164.9 million), and an annual pretax run rate for cost and operating model synergies of between 50 million and 70 million euros by the end of 2027.

Acquiring WNS’s $1.3 billion in revenue will be a drop in Capgemini’s $25.5 billion business. It will, however, raise the headcount of the combined entity by a whopping 19%—an indication of the manual nature of WNS’s work.

Paradigm shift

The deal comes at a time when enterprises are looking to replace people-intensive business operations with AI-driven solutions for lower costs and efficient execution. Pure-play BPO companies lack the technical knowhow to address this demand, according to HFS Research founder Phil Fersht. That is a gap the Capgemini-WNS combine can capitalise on.

“By combining consulting, technology, and domain-driven BPO, Capgemini + WNS has the potential to lead AI-powered business transformation, with a robust incumbent WNS client base hungry to replace full-time equivalents (FTEs) with technology solutions,” he wrote.

The combined entity could compete on an equal footing with Accenture, and outcompete the Big 4 of consulting — PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte, Fersht noted.

""From a competitive perspective, another potential big win for Capgemini is its new positioning against the Big 4, which have traditionally dominated consulting and technology services. With WNS’s operational expertise integrated into its offerings, Capgemini could deliver end-to-end transformation services that the Big 4 cannot – and at lower price points,"" the analyst wrote.

The flip side

Some analysts, and investors, are worried about the impact generative AI could have on the BPO sector, which Capgemini is looking to tap, noted brokerage house Morgan Stanley.

The bear case is that AI would transform BPO from a people-intensive business to one that is much more highly automated and managed by software, the brokerage noted. This could lead to a fall in BPO revenues and expose incumbent vendors to competition from new entrants, it said.

Disrupting BPO space with generative AI is an opportunity that investors might favour, but there needs to be evidence that WNS is the right vehicle for such a change, Morgan Stanley said.

Also, while WNS is unlikely to prove transformational for Capgemini’s business, the acquisition cost will weigh on the IT major’s balance sheet for a couple of years.

WNS, at a glance

Started by British Airways in 1996 as a captive unit, WNS offers BPO and data analytics services to blue-chip clients, including Coca-Cola, T-Mobile, United Airlines, Aviva, British Gas, Virgin Atlantic Airways, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods.

It serves over 700 clients with a 64,000-strong workforce operating in 13 countries through 64 delivery centres.

WNS reported a better-than-expected but marginal 0.6% drop in revenue at $1.31 billion for fiscal year 2025, with an 18.7% operating margin. Profit increased slightly to $170.1 million, from $147.5 million the previous year. Revenue has grown by around 9% in constant currency terms, on average, over the last three fiscal years. It also acquired Kipi.ai for $63.4 million in the March quarter to expand its capabilities in data, analytics, and AI.

While AI and automation will enhance network efficiency and security, they also introduce risks related to algorithmic bias, compliance complexity, and increased energy consumption.

Market Update

As a result of the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has come down from frothy levels post-pandemic. The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/cisco-cover-image-f37435420cb6_2025-03-04-183054_lflh.jpeg,N,,2025-07-08 09:08:04.707985

In June, Niccol met with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to discuss the potential for aligning Starbucks’ menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities. The HHS has specifically opposed the increasing use of seed oils in foods, including canola and soybean oil. However, there is no proven theory that prolonged consumption of these oils leads to inflammation or increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The company has also made other health-related menu changes at its outlets, such as removing sugar from its matcha powder, a move that has, in fact, boosted sales. Similarly, the chain stopped charging extra for non-dairy milk and is testing unsweetened protein powder that can be added to any cold foam flavor.

Starbucks earns roughly 74% of its revenue from the U.S. market, making it the company’s largest contributor. Additionally, 19% of its revenue comes from Food sales. Therefore, it is important for the coffee chain to keep modifying and aligning its menu with American consumers’ shifting food preferences.

Is SBUX a Good Stock to Buy?

Analysts remain divided on Starbucks’ long-term stock trajectory. On TipRanks, SBUX stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and 11 Hold ratings. Also, the average Starbucks price target of $95.52 implies 2% upside potential from current levels. Year-to-date, SBUX stock has gained 3.9%.

How Kroger, Albertsons are moving forward following failed merger

After two years of work on a deal that would have had extraordinary scale in the grocery industry, the attempted merger of The Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. was ultimately blocked by regulators and terminated in December 2024. How has each company's operations fared following their falling-out?

On March 3, Kroger revealed the resignation of CEO Rodney McMullen after an internal investigation into his personal conduct. A company statement emphasized that McMullen's alleged breach of corporate ethics was not related to the business, including its financial performance, operations, reporting or talent.

While not quite as dramatic as the Kroger CEO departure, Albertsons also made news with its own leadership change. On May 1, Susan Morris, EVP and COO, assumed the role of CEO following the planned retirement of Vivek Sankaran. Morris also joined Albertsons' board of directors, succeeding Sankaran.

Spain: Spar wins the fight for tourists in southern Gran Canaria

More than 4,8 million tourists visit Gran Canaria each year, and nearly 70% of them are concentrated in the south of the island, especially in the municipalities of San Bartolomé de Tirajana and Mogán. In this context, Spar Gran Canaria has consolidated its leadership in sales penetration and adaptation to the tourist customer, surpassing national chains that operate with more homogeneous formulas. HiperDino is not even present in this battle.

While national retailers focus on large formats and rigid opening hours, Spar has increased its presence in tourist areas, achieving coverage that allows it to capture a large share of the market, which represents more than 60% of tourist spending on food outside hotels. This strategy has led more than 40% of foreign tourists to choose Spar for their regular shopping.

UK: Amazon expands UK grocery presence with new Gopuff partnership

From this week, Amazon customers nationwide will be able to order a wide range of groceries, snacks, drinks and household essentials from Gopuff via the Amazon website, with deliveries arriving in under 60 minutes, and as fast as 15 minutes in some areas. The launch follows a trial in Birmingham and Salford earlier this year, and marks a significant expansion in Amazon's third-party grocery proposition, with Gopuff joining existing UK partners including Morrisons, Iceland and Co-op.

To support the new launch, Gopuff is offering 50 core grocery lines price-matched to Aldi, along with promotions such as 3-for-2 on selected fresh produce, while Amazon Prime members are also being incentivised to try the service with free delivery on their first order over £20 and a 15% discount on their first six Gopuff orders.

Ireland: ""Supermarket price probe must lead to decisive action to ease costs for families""

The latest consumer watchdog probe into grocery prices must have teeth, according to Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore. Speaking ahead of the party's motion on supermarket transparency this Wednesday, Deputy Whitmore said:

""The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has re-opened a probe into grocery prices, but the government has failed to give it requisite powers to do its job. A box-ticking exercise serves no purpose for the families around the country who are struggling to make ends meet. The rise in grocery prices, in recent years, has been astronomical. Many families are now spending €3,000 more a year to put food on the table than they were in 2021.""

South Korea: Vouchers leave Korean supermarket franchise owners in the cold again

As the government prepares to distribute up to 550,000 won ($400) per person in consumer vouchers starting July 21 to spur spending and aid small businesses, supermarket franchise owners find themselves left out — again. While mom-and-pop stores and convenience store franchises will accept the vouchers, large corporate supermarkets known as Super Supermarkets (SSMs) have been excluded, a decision fueling anger among hundreds of small business owners who run these stores under big-name banners. Owners argue the policy is unfair. Unlike big-box supermarkets or company-run outlets, nearly half of all SSM branches nationwide are individually owned franchises.

South Africa: Major threat to Pick n Pay and other retailers in South Africa

Pick n Pay has warned that South African retailers face the growing threat of increased competition from the rapid expansion of the informal economy and its retail sector. In its latest annual results, the retailer outlined the country's difficult operating conditions, including low economic growth, high unemployment, inflationary pressure, and persistent infrastructure challenges.

""Consumers are increasingly price-sensitive, demanding better value and lower prices,"" Pick n Pay said, adding that the entire retail market is undergoing a ""structural shift."" This shift is being shaped by rising demand for discount and value-driven retail formats. ""Cash-strapped consumers are increasingly turning to retailers that offer low prices, trusted quality, and convenience,"" the group said.

Perfect timing Contextual advertising technology has enabled creative formats that traditional media could never achieve.
AI algorithms monitored Fortnite gameplay to detect when characters’ energy levels dropped, triggering brand messaging at the perfect contextual moment.
But when advertising becomes indistinguishable from content, through perfect contextual timing, creative work finally achieves its intended impact.
They’ll be those who understand perfect timing beats perfect creative every single time.","Traditional advertising operates on a simple premise: create compelling content, then interrupt audiences to show it. This approach built empires in television and print. But gaming audiences have systematically rejected this model.

The numbers tell the story. Sixty-six percent of gen Z actively use ad blockers. Gaming streams see 89% ad-skip rates when pre-roll interrupts gameplay. Meanwhile, the gaming market represents over £2.8bn in advertising spend annually – money largely wasted on creative that audiences actively avoid.

The problem isn’t the quality of creative work. Agencies produce brilliant campaigns daily. The problem is timing. A beautifully crafted 30-second spot becomes worthless noise when it interrupts a crucial gaming moment.

This disconnect forced our industry to confront an uncomfortable truth: context determines creative success more than content quality ever could.

Perfect timing

Contextual advertising technology has enabled creative formats that traditional media could never achieve. These aren’t minor optimizations – they’re entirely new creative possibilities that have been evolving over years of innovation.

Early experiments, such as Danone’s ‘Small Hunger’ campaign, demonstrated the potential. AI algorithms monitored Fortnite gameplay to detect when characters’ energy levels dropped, triggering brand messaging at the perfect contextual moment. This 2021 campaign generated over 650,000 views and proved that audiences would engage with advertising that felt genuinely integrated with content.

But recent campaigns have taken contextual creativity to unprecedented levels.

Take T-Mobile’s breakthrough voice recognition campaign in Poland. Instead of interrupting streams with traditional ads, the technology monitored stream audio for the phrase “the fastest network.” When streamers naturally mentioned these words during gameplay, the system automatically triggered T-Mobile-branded animations on screen.

The results defied traditional advertising metrics. Across 275 streamers, “the fastest network” became the most frequently spoken phrase in Polish gaming streams in Q4 2024, mentioned over 10,000 times organically. Brand recall increased by 11 percentage points, top-of-mind awareness grew by six points, and brand affinity jumped by 16 points – metrics that surpass most traditional TV campaigns.

The creative breakthrough wasn’t the messaging itself. The revolution was perfect timing.

Cheetos pushed contextual creativity even further with their groundbreaking ‘Chepard Game’ – the first branded game integrated directly with Twitch streams. Rather than showing standard video ads, the brand created custom software that enabled viewers to care for a virtual cheetah through chat commands during streams. This Tamagotchi-inspired experience turned advertising into collaborative entertainment.

Executed across 220 streamers, the campaign generated over 3.2m views and 50,000 viewer interactions. More importantly, it achieved a six-point brand awareness increase and an 11-point boost in perception as a brand supporting gamers. The creative content was a simple virtual pet game – the genius was contextual deployment that made advertising feel native to the streaming experience.

Memorable moments

These successes reveal three fundamental shifts marketers must understand.

Firstly, invisibility requires more creativity, not less. When audiences can’t tell they’re seeing advertising, brands must work harder to create memorable moments. Contextual campaigns demand creative thinking that goes beyond traditional formats.

Secondly, technology enables new creative formats. AI monitoring opens possibilities that human media buyers could never execute. Real-time content analysis creates opportunities for creative integration that simply didn’t exist before.

Measurement changes everything. When campaigns integrate naturally with content, traditional metrics become irrelevant. Success means tracking organic mentions, sentiment shifts, and genuine engagement rather than impressions and click-through rates.

The most forward-thinking brands now approach creativity as a timing problem rather than a content challenge. They ask: ‘When is our audience most receptive?’ instead of: ‘What should we say?’

Intended impact

Gaming represents just the beginning of contextual advertising’s creative potential. As AI technology improves, brands will soon execute contextual campaigns across podcasts, social media, and even traditional television.

The fundamental lesson transcends gaming: audiences will always choose content over advertising. But when advertising becomes indistinguishable from content, through perfect contextual timing, creative work finally achieves its intended impact.

Brands investing in contextual technology today aren’t just optimizing campaigns – they’re preparing for an advertising future where context determines creative success. In this future, the most creative brands won’t be those with the biggest budgets or flashiest executions. They’ll be those who understand perfect timing beats perfect creative every single time.

The gaming industry taught us this lesson first. Smart marketers will apply it everywhere else.",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/opinion/356431/gaming.jpg?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-07-08 10:06:46.044934

With 76% of healthcare providers reporting feeling overwhelmed by the pace of innovation, the index offers critical insights into the barriers physicians face when translating breakthroughs into clinical practice. Naumovic outlined how J&J is using these findings to drive meaningful support for oncologists—through enhanced research access, community-based care models, responsible integration of AI, and targeted efforts to reduce cognitive burden across the care continuum.

Pharmaceutical Executive: If the Oncology Care Index were revisited two years from now, what progress would you hope to see—and how is J&J working to help realize that vision?

Biljana Naumovic: Fast forward a few years, and I’d really like to see measurable progress in the key areas we've identified. First and foremost, I hope to see a decrease in the levels of overwhelm reported—particularly by supporting community oncologists with earlier access to information and research engagement.

We're also focused on improving care transitions for patients across institutions, wherever Johnson & Johnson can play a supportive role. Another important goal is increasing the involvement of advanced practice providers and nurses in care delivery—whether in oncology, urology, or other community settings.

These are all areas we’re actively working on. In the disease areas where Johnson & Johnson is directly involved, I’m optimistic that we’ll see meaningful improvements in how care is delivered—making the process more seamless and straightforward for both physicians and patients.

Full Interview Summary: Johnson & Johnson (J&J) launched the Oncology Care Index to better understand the mounting pressures oncologists face amid rapid innovation—highlighting that 76% of healthcare providers feel overwhelmed. In 2024 alone, the FDA approved 50 new indications and 11 new molecular entities, underscoring the urgent need to translate breakthroughs into practical care. J&J uses the index not as a self-promotional tool but as a catalyst for industry-wide dialogue around care delivery, implementation of innovation, and systemic barriers.

Two insights from the index stood out: the difficulty community oncologists face in accessing clinical research and the fragmentation in the continuum of care as patients transition between treatment centers. To address these, J&J is expanding access to community-based clinical trials and co-developing protocols with community providers, particularly in areas like multiple myeloma and lung cancer. They're also pushing for policy changes that support non-academic trial sites. At the same time, the company is investing in training and infrastructure to ensure continuity of care and appropriate treatment closer to patients’ homes.

J&J sees artificial intelligence (AI) as a major opportunity to alleviate provider burden but acknowledges that true adoption requires collaboration across the ecosystem. The company is leveraging AI to improve trial recruitment and streamline decision-making but stresses the need for open, connected databases and industry-wide alignment.

To combat burnout and cognitive overload, J&J is focused on delivering timely, contextualized education and CME programs, supporting advanced practice providers and nurses, and enhancing patient support services.

Looking ahead, J&J hopes to see decreased provider overwhelm and more seamless integration of innovation into care, driven by empowered community oncologists, improved transitions of care, and greater engagement of frontline healthcare workers in both research and treatment delivery.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/pharmexec/80ee8398991bb2a0ac850aea6706537b131c5eae-1280x720.png?rect=0,30,645,606&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-08 08:01:29.987262

As the national reproductive health legal landscape shifts, including contraception and abortion access, some state and federal lawmakers have pressed for strengthened consumer protection laws surrounding reproductive health data.
Surovell said the U.S. Congress’ “My Body, My Data Act,” a measure to protect menstrual health data introduced by Democratic lawmakers, inspired him to bring a similar effort to Virginia.
He then worried about how law enforcement and government officials could use consumer data in the private sector.
The law protects reproductive health data, often collected in period tracking digital apps, and allows consumers to sue if their data is sold or released without their consent.","Disclosure pop-ups about the “cookies,” or other aggregate bits of data websites collect and store aren’t an uncommon experience while shopping online. What’s less common: when a pop-up indicates that your potential purchase of condoms, birth control medication or menstrual hygiene products is being noted digitally, a message Virginians have started seeing when they shop virtually for such products.

Since July 1, a new state law outlines that people’s personally identifiable reproductive or sexual health information cannot be obtained, disclosed, disseminated or sold without consumer consent. As new laws took effect in Virginia on July 1, Walmart has begun alerting customers about certain product or service searches and purchases.

“By viewing, searching for, or buying these products or services on our site, or using related features such as the Baby Registry, you consent to our use of this information to complete your purchase, provide the requested feature, and for general analytics, operations and fraud prevention,” a pop-up disclaimer now notifies people who visit Walmart’s website from within Virginia.

If consumers don’t want their data connected to their sexual or reproductive health to be stored, the disclaimer suggests they “avoid viewing, searching for, using or purchasing these products, services, or features.”

But not all pop-ups are new or specifically focused on reproductive-related information. Other retailers like CVS have more broad disclaimers about data collection. Its site explains that information collected about consumer behaviors is used “to provide our products and services recommendations, understand how you engage with our site, and improve the services we offer you.”

It also warns that it may share data with “trusted third parties” that include marketing, analytics and research “partners.”

This sort of data collection is a common practice in e-commerce and is a catalyst for targeted advertisements that people experience elsewhere on the internet, like their social media feeds or when using search engines.

As the national reproductive health legal landscape shifts, including contraception and abortion access, some state and federal lawmakers have pressed for strengthened consumer protection laws surrounding reproductive health data.

Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax and Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, have introduced and supported legislation to shore up these protections.

Surovell said the U.S. Congress’ “My Body, My Data Act,” a measure to protect menstrual health data introduced by Democratic lawmakers, inspired him to bring a similar effort to Virginia.

“I don’t think a lot of people realize the information that private industry buys and sells about them,” he said in a recent call.

He then worried about how law enforcement and government officials could use consumer data in the private sector.

“I was concerned that attorneys generals in some other states who want to be more aggressive about prosecuting women or other people for helping women cross state lines to obtain either contraception or abortion services might use information that the private sector has in order to reverse engineer women and other people to prosecute,” Surovell said.

Surrovell and Favola also worked on bills to prevent menstrual data from being subject to search warrants, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed into law. Last year, Youngkin was lambasted by many, including former President Joe Biden and talk show host Stephen Colbert, for opposing the same bill in a previous legislative session.

“It should go without saying that when a woman has her period or visits a doctor, it is nobody’s business but her own,” Favola said earlier this year.

As more pregnant people travel to get abortions outside states where the medical procedure is banned or restricted, some states — including Alabama and Texas — have threatened legal repercussions for people who leave the state for an abortion, and for those who aid them.

This year Favola’s Senate Bill 754 passed the Democrat-controlled legislature and Youngkin signed it. The law protects reproductive health data, often collected in period tracking digital apps, and allows consumers to sue if their data is sold or released without their consent.

Walmart’s interpretation of the law prompted the pop-up disclaimer, and other companies will find their own way to follow suit.

“The companies are trying to figure out how to implement the bill,” Favola said in a text message.

Next, Favola wants to explore how to further refine the bill to ensure people’s identifiable information is protected.

“I made it clear that the law is focused on individually-identifiable data — not aggregate data,” she explained. “I expect to make some revisions next session.”

Further details will be discussed in a workgroup later this summer, she said.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-07-at-11.59.26-AM.png,N,,2025-07-08 09:08:00.416292

Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Julie Creswell report for The New York Times.

In short:

Companies including Kraft Heinz, Nestlé, and PepsiCo have agreed to remove petroleum-based dyes from processed foods by 2026, but Mars, which makes M&M’s, has not joined the initiative.

Industry advocates cite technical and economic hurdles to replacing synthetic dyes, including cost, supply limitations, and consumer preference for bright colors in candy.

Some states are stepping in with policies to ban or label products with artificial dyes, with West Virginia and Texas introducing regulations starting in 2027 and 2028.

Key quote:

“If people are celebrating and eating treats, they don’t want to be tasting beets.”

— Kirk Vashaw, CEO of Spangler Candy

Why this matters:

Synthetic food dyes, found in many brightly colored candies and cereals, have long been controversial. A growing body of research, including reviews by California health agencies, links some of these dyes to behavioral issues in children, especially those with ADHD. Red Dye No. 3 has already been flagged as a potential carcinogen. While Europe has restricted or banned many of these additives, U.S. regulations have lagged behind, leaving American consumers — especially children — more exposed. The stakes are high: Nearly one in five processed foods contain synthetic dyes. As federal efforts rely on voluntary compliance, states may play a larger role in shaping the food supply and protecting public health.",https://assets.rbl.ms/61170826/origin.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 10:07:16.033957

In parallel, Nike also expects a slight price increase in the United States starting next fall season.
One of the first companies to react was Hermès, which in mid-April announced price increases for its products starting in May.
This increase, however, will be on the company’s sales in the United States, precisely to compensate for the extra cost of bringing the merchandise into the country.
The conglomerate, in the hands of French businessman Bernard Arnaud, explained in mid-April its plans to move part of its production to the United States, where it already operates up to three plants.","The reciprocal tariffs announced by Donald Trump in April have hit fashion, which has its largest consumer market in the world in the United States and the largest concentration of its value chain in Asia. Three months later, the president of the American power has announced a new zero day for the entry into force of these levies, and that they will not catch fashion off guard on August 1. What have luxury, footwear and large retailers done so far to prepare for the tariff wave?

In 2024, the United States imported finished fashion, textiles and leather goods worth $147.488 billion, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Administration. Of all the goods purchased by the U.S. from the rest of the world, fashion accounted for 4.5% of the total last year.

A large part of these imports, moreover, come from textile hubs in Asia, where fashion accounts for a large part of the supply chain: China alone exported fashion to the United States for a value of $31,861 billion. From the reorganization of the supply chain announced by giants such as Nike to the price hikes proposed by Hermès, the fashion industry has had 90 days to prepare for an impact on fashion purchases abroad of almost 150 billion dollars, and the companies in the sector have not wasted the room for maneuver.

The United States imported fashion for almost 150 billion dollars in 2024

Large-scale distribution and footwear

The first companies to react were the large chains, which accumulate in the United States a significant weight of their income statements, and especially those of U.S. origin, which are more exposed to an increase in tariffs on trade with Asia. The latest was Nike, the U.S. footwear giant, which during the presentation of its annual results for 2024 estimated an impact of 1 billion on its gross costs.

During the conference with analysts, the company already announced the first measures planned to avoid the impact of the escalation, including reducing its sourcing from China from the current 16% to a single digit figure. In parallel, Nike also expects a slight price increase in the United States starting next fall season.

If the latest announcement has come from Nike, the shoe company Steve Madden or the Kontoor Brands group, both American, were among the first to announce their strategy to the possible new trade order. The path differs between the two companies: while Steve Madden announced back in February a price increase planned also for part of the fall-winter catalog and relocation of part of the value chain, Kontoor, owner of brands such as Lee, opted to maintain its production in Mexico, already with an eye on a possible compensation of the impact in 2026.

Nike was the last company to implement a strategic plan to avoid the tariff impact

Also in the group of U.S. companies, Ralph Lauren, Gap and Victoria’s Secret have estimated an impact on the companies’ financial results for this year. Although the three companies expect the tariff policy to have an impact of between $50 million and $150 million, only Ralph Lauren has commented on a possible strategy, whereby it plans to reduce its sourcing from any country, including China, to less than 20%.

Gap, on the other hand, which in the worst-case scenario could suffer an added gross cost of up to $300 million (or 150 million less in operating income), not only did not announce possible containment measures, but assured that it would maintain its repositioning strategy in Old Navy, Banana Republic and Gap.

On the other side of the ocean, the second-largest retailer H&M was another company to announce a sourcing strategy in the face of rising tariffs. At the end of March, on the occasion of the analyst conference following the first quarter results, the group’s chief financial officer, Adam Karlsson, already announced some relocation of sourcing to markets with “less tariff impact”. The company has also announced “price positioning”.

Puma, for its part, the second largest German group in the fashion and sports equipment sector, has also anticipated a tariff hit on its business. In the last results presentation, in fact, the company had already reduced to 10% its items exported to the United States directly from China, a figure it plans to reduce further. In their place, however, other hubs such as Vietnam and Cambodia, which also face a possible high tariff from the United States, have been gaining weight, which has led the company not to rule out a possible price increase.

The luxury sector has opted to raise prices rather than redistribute the chain

Luxury

This repositioning, which in practice translates into an increase in the final price of products, is the strategy that has dominated among luxury companies in particular. One of the first companies to react was Hermès, which in mid-April announced price increases for its products starting in May.

This increase, however, will be on the company’s sales in the United States, precisely to compensate for the extra cost of bringing the merchandise into the country. The decision of H&M or Nike to relocate their supply chain to other countries with less impact is even more complicated in the luxury sector, which often depends on the know-how of small textile hubs and artisans.

It was under this premise that Kering defended its 2025 strategy, whereby it ruled out moving part of the chain to the country North America. We are selling parts of our culture, of the Italian or French culture,“ explained the group’s CEO, François-Henri Pinault, “so we have no intention of responding to the measure”.

Different has been the strategy of LVMH, the other major competing luxury group with brands such as Dior in its portfolio. The conglomerate, in the hands of French businessman Bernard Arnaud, explained in mid-April its plans to move part of its production to the United States, where it already operates up to three plants. This strategy is not new within the group, which during Trump’s first term consolidated part of these factories in the country, specifically, a factory in Texas, which involved an investment of $50 million.",https://www.modaes.com/global/thumb/eyJ0IjoiZCIsInciOjEyMDAsImgiOjY3NSwibSI6MSwidiI6ImRldjE3NTE5ODAxNTMifQ/files/2025/redaccion-personas/donald-trump/trump-bandera-julio25-1200.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 09:09:15.750944

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday adjusted an earlier tariff hike announced in April, lowering it slightly from 37 percent to 35 percent on Bangladeshi textile and garment imports. While still steep, it marks a slight reprieve from what industry leaders describe as a looming crisis.

“We are hopeful of a reduction,” said Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman, confirming that the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has sent a new draft for review. “Our national security adviser and commerce adviser are working on the issue in Washington,” he added.

Garment sector on edge

Bangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the US in 2024—primarily clothing—while importing just $2.21 billion. President Trump has repeatedly cited this trade imbalance as justification for imposing tariffs that are more than double the existing 16 percent levied on cotton products.

The proposed tariffs have rattled an industry still recovering from last year’s student-led revolution that toppled the previous government. Interim Prime Minister Muhammad Yunus is expected to raise the matter directly with US officials.

“This is a big challenge for the garment sector,” said Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). “We had expected something closer to 10-20 percent.”

Economic fallout looms

Leading US brands such as Fruit of the Loom, Levi Strauss, and VF Corp (which owns Vans, Timberland, and The North Face) rely heavily on Bangladeshi suppliers. Industry stakeholders worry the tariff increase could make Bangladesh less competitive globally and trigger job losses.

Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel warned that the impact could be severe. “The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,” he said. “Bangladesh needs to act quickly by engaging US importers to push for policy changes, resuming high-level trade talks, and highlighting the importance of its products.”

In a bid to ease trade tensions, Dhaka has proposed to purchase Boeing aircraft and increase imports of US wheat, cotton, and oil.

As the August 1 deadline set by the Trump administration nears, all eyes in Bangladesh’s export-driven economy remain fixed on Washington—hoping that diplomacy and trade ties can prevent a major blow to one of the world’s largest garment-producing nations.",https://d2udx5iz3h7s4h.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/1751971708688-1zrlf9-1c5eb77f02926ea8dcd19e260b1e77dc19c1b4d0c5a3e8084a56cb88cc487ad0.jpeg?width=512&format=jpg&quality=80,N,,2025-07-08 12:23:11.011628

Automation's Rise: While automated liquid handling systems dominate labs, the manual method segment is growing at a blistering 8.75% CAGR, driven by smaller labs and emerging markets seeking cost-effective solutions. Companies like Agilent and Eppendorf are now offering hybrid systems that bridge the gap—think semi-automated pipettes or cloud-enabled manual dispensers.

2. Genomics' Explosion: Next-Gen Sequencing (NGS) and gene-editing tools like CRISPR demand ultra-precise liquid handling for sample prep. The genomics sector alone accounts for $1.2 billion in annual demand, with North America's pharma/biotech giants (e.g., Pfizer, Moderna) fueling this fire.

Why North America is the Engine, and Asia-Pacific is the Accelerator

North America: Already commands ~30-40% of the global market, thanks to $126 billion+ in annual biotech/pharma R&D spending and initiatives like the NIH's Precision Medicine Program. Labs here are early adopters of cutting-edge tools like Agilent's BioTek MultiFlo FX or Eppendorf's epMotion 5077p.

Asia-Pacific: Set to grow at the fastest regional CAGR (9.82%), driven by India's Genome India Project, China's $200 billion “Healthy China 2030” plan, and Japan's $1.2 trillion investment in life sciences. This is where Agilent's and Eppendorf's partnerships with local labs will pay dividends.

Agilent vs. Eppendorf: Who's Leading the Charge?

Both companies are category kings, but their strategies differ in critical ways:

Agilent Technologies (A): The Automation Titan

Strengths:

Owns BioTek Instruments, a leader in microplate dispensers used in NGS workflows.

Launched the 406 FX Washer Dispenser (2023), a game-changer for labs needing high-throughput plate washing.

Leverages AI-driven software like OpenLab Enterprise for lab automation workflows.

Growth Levers:

Drug Discovery Dominance: Captures 60% of the market in systems for ADME/Tox studies.

Global Footprint: 45% of revenue comes from Asia-Pacific, where it's expanding partnerships with contract research organizations (CROs).

Eppendorf AG (EPP.DE): The Precision Specialist

Strengths:

epMotion Series: Automated liquid handlers with error rates below 0.1%, critical for genomics.

Semi-Automated Innovations: Products like the Lambda EliteMax make automation accessible to smaller labs, addressing the $100k+ price barrier of full systems.

Growth Levers:

Emerging Markets Play: Secured exclusive distribution rights in India and Southeast Asia via partnerships like SLS.

Cost Efficiency: Offers modular systems that scale with lab budgets, ideal for Asia-Pacific's growing biotech hubs.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Leaders—Now

The data is clear: Agilent and Eppendorf are the only pure-play liquid handling giants with R&D pipelines, global scale, and genomics expertise to capture this boom. Here's why investors should act:

Valuation Edge:

Agilent trades at 14.5x forward earnings, below its 5-year average of 18x, despite a 25% CAGR in biotech sales.

Eppendorf's stock has underperformed in 2023 (down 12%) due to macroeconomic jitters, creating a buying opportunity ahead of its Asia-Pacific ramp-up.

Moats and Momentum:

Agilent's $200M/year in R&D ensures it stays ahead in AI-integrated systems.

Eppendorf's 500+ patents (including dispensing tech) shield it from generic competitors.

Risk-Adjusted Upside:

Even if growth slows to 6% CAGR, Agilent's biotech division alone could deliver $2B in revenue by 2030.

Eppendorf's niche focus on cost-effective automation gives it a 15% market share target in Asia-Pacific by 2026.

Final Call: A Portfolio Must-Have

The liquid handling systems market isn't just growing—it's evolving into a $7 billion+ tech ecosystem where precision and automation are non-negotiable. Agilent and Eppendorf are the only two names with the scale, innovation, and geographic reach to dominate this space.

Action Items for Investors:

- Aggressive Buy: Agilent (A) at current valuations.

- Accumulate: Eppendorf (EPP.DE) ahead of its Q3 2025 Asia-Pacific sales report.

- Avoid: Smaller players without genomics-specific pipelines (e.g., Tecan) or those overexposed to manual systems alone.

The next five years will separate the lab equipment suppliers from the genomics-era winners. Don't miss the boat.

The acquisition creates a €23.3 billion entity targeting what both companies call “intelligent operations”: business processes managed by AI systems that can make decisions and adapt without human oversight.

The death of traditional outsourcing

“Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end,” says Aiman Ezzat, CEO of Capgemini. “Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI. Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly-emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations.”

The deal reflects a shift in how companies approach business process outsourcing. Traditional labour-intensive services are being replaced by AI-driven automation that promises not just cost savings but transformational business outcomes. Companies that once sought cheap offshore labour now demand intelligent systems that can adapt, learn and operate with minimal human oversight.

WNS, which generated US$1.266 billion in revenue last year serving clients including United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods, has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation, maintaining constant currency revenue growth of 9% annually over three years and projecting growth of 7% to 11% for fiscal year 2026.

“As a recognised leader in the Digital Business Process Services space, we see the next wave of transformation being driven by intelligent, domain-centric operations that unlock strategic value for our clients,” says Keshav Murugesh, CEO of WNS. “Organisations that have already digitised are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core – shifting from automation to autonomy.”

Capgemini’s AI ambitions

The acquisition addresses Capgemini’s need for scale in the US market while providing access to WNS's industry-specific platforms and domain expertise. Aiman has invested heavily in AI capabilities, establishing 25 strategic partnerships with technology providers including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and Nvidia. The company says it reported over €900 million in generative AI bookings during 2024.

Market analysts including Forrester, IDC and ISG have recognised Capgemini’s position in the AI services market. Aiman has developed training programmes and AI-focused service offerings to meet enterprise demand for AI-powered business transformation.

Capgemini expects the transaction to generate revenue synergies of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027, alongside cost synergies of €50 million to €70 million annually. Aiman anticipates 4% accretion to normalised earnings per share before synergies in 2026, rising to 7% post-synergies in 2027.

Enabling next-generation, data-driven operations

The transaction requires approval from the Royal Court of Jersey and WNS shareholders, alongside regulatory clearances. Both companies’ boards have unanimously approved the acquisition, with closing expected by the end of 2025.

“By combining our deep domain and process expertise with Capgemini’s global reach, cutting-edge Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, a robust partner ecosystem and advanced technology platforms, we are creating a powerful proposition that accelerates enterprise reinvention,” says Keshav. “WNS’ complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini’s rapidly-growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors.”

The companies expect immediate cross-selling opportunities through the integration of complementary client bases and service offerings, supported by what they describe as natural cultural alignment and shared values.

“Just as importantly, our shared values, cultural alignment and complementary client relationships ensure a seamless integration – unlocking exciting opportunities for innovation, co-creation and growth across all stakeholder groups,” says Keshav.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0666516a6ed09917e8760a14652a3e8c:05a15ea78f107ef709c56890dfad46d7/handshake-blue-line.webp.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:21:24.924896

Here's what to expect: Amazon expanded Prime Day this year because shoppers “wanted more time to shop and save,” Amazon Prime Vice President Jamil Ghani recently told The Associated Press.
Amazon doesn’t disclose Prime Day sales figures but said last year that the event achieved record global sales.
For the big event, Amazon said it would have special discounts on Alexa-enabled products like Echo, Fire TV and Fire tablets.
Some third-party sellers are expected to sit out Prime Day and not offer discounts to preserve their profit margins during the ongoing tariff uncertainty, analysts said.","NEW YORK -- Amazon is extending its annual Prime Day sales and offering new membership perks to Generation Z shoppers amid tariff-related price worries and possibly some consumer boredom with an event marking its 11th year.

The e-commerce giant's promised blitz of summer deals for Prime members starts at 3:01 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday. For the first time, Seattle-based Amazon is holding the now-misnamed Prime Day over four days; the company launched the event in 2015 and expanded it to two days in 2019.

Before wrapping up Prime Day 2025 early Friday, Amazon said it would have deals dropping as often as every 5 minutes during certain periods. Prime members ages 18-24, who pay $7.49 per month instead of the $14.99 that older customers not eligible for discounted rates pay for free shipping and other benefits, will receive 5% cash back on their purchases for a limited time.

Amazon executives declined to comment on the potential impact of tariffs on Prime Day deals. The event is taking place two and a half months after an online news report sparked speculation that Amazon planned to display added tariff costs next to product prices on its website.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denounced the purported change as a “hostile and political act” before Amazon clarified the idea had been floated for its low-cost Haul storefront but never approved.

Amazon's past success with using Prime Day to drive sales and attract new members spurred other major retail chains to schedule competing sales in July. Best Buy, Target and Walmart are repeating the practice this year.

Like Amazon, Walmart is adding two more days to its promotional period, which starts Tuesday and runs through July 13. The nation's largest retailer is making its summer deals available in stores as well as online for the first time.

Here's what to expect:

Amazon expanded Prime Day this year because shoppers “wanted more time to shop and save,” Amazon Prime Vice President Jamil Ghani recently told The Associated Press.

Analysts are unsure the extra days will translate into more purchases given that renewed inflation worries and potential price increases from tariffs may make consumers less willing to spend. Amazon doesn’t disclose Prime Day sales figures but said last year that the event achieved record global sales.

Adobe Digital Insights predicts that the sales event will drive $23.8 billion in overall online spending from July 8 to July 11, 28.4% more than the similar period last year. In 2024 and 2023, online sales increased 11% and 6.1% during the comparable four days of July.

Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, noted that Amazon's move to stretch the sales event to four days is a big opportunity to “really amplify and accelerate the spending velocity.”

Caila Schwartz, director of consumer insights and strategy at software company Salesforce, noted that July sales in general have lost some momentum in recent years. Amazon is not a Salesforce customer, so the business software company is not privy to Prime Day figures.

“What we saw last year was that (shoppers) bought and then they were done, ” Schwartz said. “We know that the consumer is still really cautious. So it’s likely we could see a similar pattern where they come out early, they’re ready to buy and then they take a step back.”

Amazon executives reported in May that the company and many of its third-party sellers tried to beat big import tax bills by stocking up on foreign goods before President Donald Trump’s tariffs took effect. And because of that move, a fair number of third-party sellers hadn't changed their pricing at that time, Amazon said.

Adobe Digital Insights' Pandya expects discounts to remain on par with last year and for other U.S. retail companies to mark 10% to 24% off the manufacturers' suggested retail price between Tuesday and Friday.

Salesforce's Schwartz said she's noticed retailers becoming more precise with their discounts, such as offering promotion codes that apply to selected products instead of their entire websites.

Amazon Prime and other July sales have historically helped jump-start back-to-school spending and encouraged advance planners to buy other seasonal merchandise earlier. Analysts said they expected U.S. consumers to make purchases this week out of fear that tariffs will make items more expensive later.

Brett Rose, CEO of United National Consumer Supplies, a wholesale distributor of overstocked goods like toys and beauty products, thinks shoppers will go for items like beauty essentials.

“They're going to buy more everyday items,” he said.

As in past years, Amazon offered early deals leading up to Prime Day. For the big event, Amazon said it would have special discounts on Alexa-enabled products like Echo, Fire TV and Fire tablets.

Walmart said its July sale would include a 32-inch Samsung smart monitor priced at $199 instead of $299.99; and $50 off a 50-Inch Vizio Smart TV with a standard retail price of $298.00. Target said it was maintaining its 2024 prices on key back-to-school items, including a $5 backpack and a selection of 20 school supplies totaling less than $20.

Independent businesses that sell goods through Amazon account for more than 60% of the company's retail sales. Some third-party sellers are expected to sit out Prime Day and not offer discounts to preserve their profit margins during the ongoing tariff uncertainty, analysts said.

Rose, of United National Consumer Supplies, said he spoke with third-party sellers who said they would rather take a sales hit this week than use up a lot of their pre-tariffs inventory now and risk seeing their profit margins suffer later.

However, some independent businesses that market their products on Amazon are looking to Prime Day to make a dent in the inventory they built up earlier in the year to avoid tariffs.

Home fragrance company Outdoor Fellow, which makes about 30% of its sales through Amazon's marketplace, gets most of its candle lids, labels, jars, reed diffusers and other items from China, founder Patrick Jones said. Fearing high costs from tariffs, Jones stocked up at the beginning of the year, roughly doubling his inventory.

For Prime Day, he plans to offer bigger discounts, such as 32% off the price of a candle normally priced at $34, Jones said.

“All the product that we have on Amazon right now is still from the inventory that we got before the tariffs went into effect,” he said. “So we’re still able to offer the discount that we’re planning on doing.”

Jones said he was waiting to find out if the order he placed in June will incur large customs duties when the goods arrive from China in a few weeks.

Havas has not struck a direct enterprise deal either, due to existing access to GPT models through Azure and its preference to stay within its current Microsoft-based infrastructure, including tools like Teams.
“Training programs tend to be the second thing they think about.” Dallas-based independent agency LERMA, however, is about to sign a direct ChatGPT Enterprise deal with OpenAI to support client-facing work and internal tooling.
These include ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team, and ChatGPT Edu.
In a recent investor note, Morgan Stanley raised its Azure revenue forecast, citing OpenAI as a key growth driver.","OpenAI is everywhere, but that might be a problem for the AI startup’s revenue expansion plans.

As it seeks to diversify its income, OpenAI has been courting ad agencies over the last two months, sometimes requesting sizable upfront commitments in exchange for deeper partnerships, as well as inking direct corporate enterprise deals.

But, agencies’ existing relationships with Microsoft, which has an exclusive deal with OpenAI, could undermine the AI startup’s ability to cut those deals.

“The convergence of OpenAI’s advanced generative AI capabilities with Microsoft’s expansive and integrated Azure ecosystem poses potential challenges for OpenAI in attracting direct enterprise deals with specific segments, including ad agencies,” Gartner vp analyst Nicole Greene told ADWEEK.

In at least one recent negotiation, OpenAI sought a $1 million upfront commitment in exchange for annual joint projects and expanded tool licenses, according to a holding company executive who requested anonymity to protect industry ties.

“OpenAI is trying to find the right commercial model,” the executive said. “[But asking for $1 million upfront], that’s not how you build relationships.”

The price tag prevented the agency from formalizing any direct partnership, especially since their existing agreement with Microsoft already provides access to the same models with fewer legal hurdles. Ultimately, the agency rejected the deal because it felt out of step with how other tech platforms, such as Google and Meta, can bundle in free media to longer-term deals, thereby offsetting the costs of AI tools.

OpenAI did not respond to a media request.

Havas has not struck a direct enterprise deal either, due to existing access to GPT models through Azure and its preference to stay within its current Microsoft-based infrastructure, including tools like Teams.

To scale AI use internally, the agency is talking with training companies like Section AI to teach employees model-specific best practices and prompt engineering across multiple AI models.

“With big [AI] providers, their number one goal is the sale of licenses,” Dan Hagen, global chief data and technology officer, Havas, told ADWEEK. “Training programs tend to be the second thing they think about.”

Dallas-based independent agency LERMA, however, is about to sign a direct ChatGPT Enterprise deal with OpenAI to support client-facing work and internal tooling. In return, the independent shop gets access to OpenAI’s tools, including Sora and Dall-E, data security, and the ability to build and white-label bots for client use. The financial details of the deal were not disclosed, but it is structured as an annual agreement, paid monthly. LERMA is also evaluating Azure, weighing features and costs before finalizing its decision.

Laurie Evans, media technology principal at LERMA, notes that other AI providers, including Microsoft’s Copilot, are offering similar enterprise-level packages.

“As an independent agency, we don’t have the resources of big holding companies that can throw a lot of money at innovation,” said Pedro Lerma, founder and CEO, LERMA. “We’re building bots for our workflow on a daily basis—that’s what’s standing out to me about OpenAI,” she added.

OpenAI’s changing revenue structure

To keep revenue growing—and amid its push for profitability under an unorthodox corporate structure—OpenAI began promoting its enterprise offerings in August 2023. These include ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Team, and ChatGPT Edu.

As of June, OpenAI said it was signing about nine enterprise contracts per week and had reached 3 million business users across those tiers. OpenAI is reportedly charging at least $10 million, offering AI customization and consulting services.

OpenAI has doubled its annual recurring revenue, from roughly $5.5 billion last year to $10 billion in June. Yet the San Francisco‑based firm still lost nearly $5 billion in 2024, underscoring the high infrastructure and operational costs of powering generative AI. For now, its revenues come largely from premium ChatGPT subscriptions, like ChatGPT Pro, priced at $200 a month, and API usage (ads may be coming to ChatGPT).

Even so, chief executive Sam Altman recently posted on X that OpenAI is “losing money” on ChatGPT Pro subscriptions, adding that he personally set the price assuming “we would make some money.”

Now, OpenAI is turning its attention to ad agencies, striking enterprise deals and deeper partnerships.

Agencies’ relationship with Microsoft

Through Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI, which integrates OpenAI’s IP, including models and infrastructure, into products like Copilot (Microsoft’s AI assistant) and Azure (its cloud computing platform), certain agencies can already access OpenAI’s tools without signing up and paying for a direct enterprise deal. That access lets them use OpenAI for image and video generation or call the API to build agents, according to sources, all within Microsoft’s ecosystem.

Without a direct relationship with OpenAI, agencies do miss out on enterprise-level perks, like 24/7 support, live training, custom bot deployments, or immediate access to OpenAI’s latest tools, which reportedly takes weeks before showing up in Microsoft software.

Gartner estimates ChatGPT Enterprise costs between $40 and $60 per user per month, higher than Microsoft 365 Copilot, which is typically priced at $30 and often bundled with other Microsoft products. These estimates are based on Gartner’s Digital Workplace Maturity Assessment Tool, which surveyed IT leaders on their digital transformation priorities. OpenAI did not respond to comments on competitive pricing.

“The pricing structures, security assurances, and integrations provided by Microsoft, such as Azure AI Studio and Microsoft 365 Copilot, align with enterprise operational requirements and risk management protocols,” Greene said. “[These are] compelling reasons for ad agencies to work with Microsoft instead of making a direct enterprise deal with OpenAI.”

Meanwhile, OpenAI announced last month that it would shift its ChatGPT Enterprise plan from a pricing-based model to a credit-based system where companies can purchase usage credits based on demand rather than paying fixed per-seat pricing.

Microsoft, for its part, is seeing clear returns from its integration with OpenAI. In a recent investor note, Morgan Stanley raised its Azure revenue forecast, citing OpenAI as a key growth driver. Analysts now expect Azure to grow at a 33% compound annual rate through 2028, up from an earlier 27% estimate.

“Contribution from OpenAI is significant and understated in our original framework,” the note read, pointing to Microsoft’s 20% revenue share from OpenAI, along with additional income from fine-tuning and post-training services.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/openai-microsoft-ambitions-2025.jpg?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 09:08:14.275151

Spicy twist on a breakfast classic

Starting on Tuesday, July 8, the fast food chain will roll out three spicy Egg McMuffin options: Egg McMuffin with Spicy Pepper Sauce, Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

The Egg McMuffin was first introduced in 1972 and by 1975 had become a breakfast staple for those choosing to eat out first thing in the morning. 50 years later, it’s still going strong.

Why spice up the anniversary with McDonald’s new Spicy Pepper Sauce, the key ingredient to the three new options? McDonald’s says it’s responding to demand, with surveys showing that 78% of Gen Z loves spicy flavors and 74% of Americans add hot sauce to meals.

The return of the Snack Wrap

Additionally, the company has also brought back its Snack Wrap, which was a customer favorite up until 2016, when it was dropped from the menu because of equipment and preparation constraints.

The Snack Wrap comes in two flavors: Ranch and Spicy, both of which use McCrispy chicken strips, lettuce and shredded cheese wrapped in a soft tortilla.

How long will they be available?

McDonald’s has stated the new Egg McMuffins will be on the menu for a limited time, so act fast if you’d like to give it a try.

Unlike the Egg McMuffin, the Snack Wrap will stay on the menu for as long as it’s selling well and customer interest is there. Judging by its first run, it’s unlikely to be going anywhere anytime soon.

ID3,Albertsons,2025-07-08 10:03:31+00:00,Modern Retail,What Albertsons is looking to learn from its test run of in-store digital displays in two markets,Mitchell Parton,,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/marketing/what-albertsons-is-looking-to-learn-from-its-test-run-of-in-store-digital-displays-in-two-markets/,"Albertsons is among a growing number of retailers experimenting with in-store signage as an element of their growing advertising businesses.
“This is all-new, bleeding-edge, I would say, hot-off-the-press types of technology,” Roche said.
At the end of last year, Iowa-based regional grocer Hy-Vee added 10,000-plus in-store screens across more than 400 locations.
“2025 is the tipping-point year of in-store RMN pilots,” said Sean Cheyney, head of retail media at Vistar Media, an out-of-home advertising firm.
He expects to see more widespread adoption of in-store digital signage within the next year and a half.","Albertsons is among a growing number of retailers experimenting with in-store signage as an element of their growing advertising businesses. And, given Albertsons reach — more than 2,200 stores in 35 states — it’s an important validation point. Still, like many other retailers doing pilot programs this year, Albertsons has yet to determine how quickly to scale up the program and how it will measure the efficacy of the technology in generating revenue and profits moving forward.

“We’re taking this pilot as an amazing opportunity to learn. When it comes to in-store, digital screen networks, there really isn’t a playbook,” Roche said, referring to the fact that while there are many case studies about other formats like search ads, there hasn’t yet been a widespread rollout of digital screens at U.S. retailers. “It’s not like we can say, ‘OK, let’s just rip the page out of the textbook. We’ll rinse and repeat and we’ll apply it.’ … We’re really taking this pilot as an incredible opportunity to learn, to tweak, to optimize and to continue rapid expansion.”

Not just ads, but also informational content

The company is adding television screens to key areas of each store such as the entrance, the produce department, the meat department and the center of the store. The screens will display both advertiser content and informational content. For example, in the produce department, a customer could spot a 15-second video on what to do with radishes. Roche said a playlist of ads alone wouldn’t be an ideal shopping experience, so the company is looking at how to optimize content to both enhance the shopper experience and drive growth for suppliers.

“We have a tremendous amount of people who are coming to a store every week. Bringing them excellent content and maybe helping them think outside the box and giving them that inspiration really enables a full-funnel experience for both our advertisers and for our shoppers,” Roche said. “[Brand marketers] are excited to have some space to play to build that affinity. … Learning how to make a seven-layer dip and what chips to use for such a substantial dip is a really great brand moment where brand marketers can build affinity.”

The first brand partners include snack and beverage company Mondelēz, as well as non-endemic brands such as PayPal.

“I think the level of attention you have from a shopper when they’re in store is high. People are alert. They’re looking at the shelves. They’re making real-time decisions,” Roche said. “In such an attention economy that we’re working in, our non-endemic brands are really leaned into trying to add to that journey, whether that’s in the [fintech] space or elsewhere.”

Roche said the genesis of the program was the retailer’s large amount of store traffic, having 36 million people in its stores every week and 45 million loyalty members.

“That traffic is really valuable,” Roche said. “Our shoppers love being in the store, so by enhancing their in-store experience and enhancing their shopper experience, but also helping to get our supplier partners ingrained in that shopping experience and giving brand marketers opportunities to really tell big stories in store, it’s really an incredible canvas.”

The quest for measurement

Ultimately, Roche said the goal of the test is to figure out how to close the loop through measurement technology.

“By introducing more technology, we can start to understand things like, ‘Is this individual ad working?'” Roche said. “We’re able to get a lot more granular and move more into causation and move away from correlated results. That’s what we’re aiming to do, and frankly, that’s what our suppliers want … They want attributed impressions. They want to understand exactly how every impression is driving their business forward, and we want to be able to deliver that.”

Roche said that could include sensor technology to understand exact efficacy of each screen, dwell time and served impressions while maintaining privacy, though the company declined to share exactly how it would accomplish that.

“This is all-new, bleeding-edge, I would say, hot-off-the-press types of technology,” Roche said. “It takes some calibration. It takes partners who want to say, ‘Hey, I’m willing to learn with you all,’ which makes us really lucky in this space, because we have those partners.”

The year of digital signage pilots

Several other major grocers have recently launched digital signage pilot programs in the same vein. Kroger announced in June that Barrows Connected Stores was building a new platform for the retailer to deliver animated content in its stores, integrated onto shelves, endcaps or other locations throughout each store. At the end of last year, Iowa-based regional grocer Hy-Vee added 10,000-plus in-store screens across more than 400 locations.

“2025 is the tipping-point year of in-store RMN pilots,” said Sean Cheyney, head of retail media at Vistar Media, an out-of-home advertising firm. “Everybody’s realizing that this is something they need to do. … The retail media teams are really driving this, because they’re running out of inventory on their owned-and-operated [online] assets.”

Like Albertsons, retailers are generally looking at the best play to manage and expand the screens, how many to put in and how it fits into the broader store strategy, he said. Measurability is a big component to these tests: Most commonly, screens have had little to no way of measuring success of ads. Now, he said, grocers are using platforms like Circana, Inmar or LiveRamp that they’ve been using elsewhere in the store for measurement to determine the ROAS of what’s happening on the screen. Like what Albertsons is experimenting with, sensors can also be used to measure impressions.

He expects to see more widespread adoption of in-store digital signage within the next year and a half.

“It always drives me nuts when [retailers] look at it in a silo, which is the way [in-store] has been for a long time,” he said. “Now they’re looking at it and saying, ‘How can this fold into the greater retail media ecosystem?’”

Still awaiting ‘the killer campaign’

Sean Turner, CTO of retail media tech platform Swiftly — which has worked on retail media platforms for California-based grocery chain Save Mart, as well as Oklahoma-based chain Homeland — also admitted the technology is still in early days.

“I don’t think, as of yet, we’ve really seen the ‘killer campaign,’ or the killer setup where all of the necessary elements come together and just blow away what we’ve been doing in the paper world,” Turner said.

That campaign, Turner said, would ideally start long before a shopper gets to the store, making sure they know about the brand through platforms such as web ads, connected TV or linear TV, as well as on-platform retail media like video in retailer apps. The video could link to recipe ideas that use the product or nutritional information, as well as a coupon. That would get a customer in the store, where they would see in-store videos with quick clips that remind customers of what the product is and how to use it. That would draw attention to the product in the store, where the customer would find something like a QR code driving them back to that offer they saw earlier online.

“The shopper is going to make up their mind as to whether or not they’re going to buy the product, or at least get most of the way there, before they get in the stores,” Turner said. “You have to do that work before they get in.”

He said once retailers and CPG brands figure out how to best use the medium, he expects more rapid adoption, going from the pilots of a few stores or a few markets to every store within a grocery banner. Still, he said such programs can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per store, so it could be a few years before the technology is affordable enough for grocers to make the plunge, as well.",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/0.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 09:07:54.602805

This move is in response to the European Commission’s decision in June 2025 to exclude Chinese companies from EU government purchases of medical devices exceeding 5 million EUR.
For non-EU enterprises participating in government procurement projects, the proportion of medical devices imported from the EU that they provide should not exceed 50% of the procurement’s total contract amount.

China’s Ministry of Finance has announced that it will take ‘relevant measures’ against medical devices imported from the European Union (EU) through government procurement projects. This move is in response to the European Commission’s decision in June 2025 to exclude Chinese companies from EU government purchases of medical devices exceeding 5 million EUR.

With the new restrictions imposed in China, when a purchaser buys medical devices with a budget of over 45 million CNY (about 5.34 million EUR at the time of writing) if it is indeed necessary to purchase imported products — after going through relevant legal procedures — the participation of EU enterprises (excluding EU-funded enterprises in China) should be excluded, the ministry said.

For non-EU enterprises participating in government procurement projects, the proportion of medical devices imported from the EU that they provide should not exceed 50% of the procurement’s total contract amount.

The above measures do not apply to procurement projects that can only be met by medical devices imported from the EU, according to the ministry.

This notice came into effect on July 6, 2025. For procurement projects that have already announced winning bids or transaction results before July 6, the above measures don’t apply and government procurement contracts may continue to be signed.

With regards to the EU ban announced in June, a spokesperson from the ministry claimed that China had repeatedly expressed through bilateral dialogue its willingness to resolve differences with the EU via such dialogue, and through consultation and bilateral government procurement arrangements.

The spokesperson for the ministry said that despite China’s ‘goodwill and sincerity,’ the EU has insisted on taking ‘restrictive measures’ to build new ‘protectionist barriers.’

“Therefore, China has no choice but to take reciprocal restrictive measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and maintain a fair competition environment,” said the spokesperson.

The ministry emphasised that China’s measures only apply to medical device products imported from the EU, and those produced by EU-funded enterprises in China are unaffected.",https://med-techinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/china-and-eu-8th-july-1024x536.png,N,,2025-07-08 10:07:36.864368

While McDonald’s expands their offerings and updates their menu, Burger King hasn't replied with similar innovations in their morning menu.
Meanwhile, Burger King will have to rethink their strategy in order not to fall behind in the breakfast battle in the United States.","In the competitive world of fast food, chains are constantly seeking to innovate in order to attract customers. It's not common for McDonald’s to make major changes to their breakfast menu, since their classic products are usually well received. However, this time the situation has changed and the company has decided to take a step that could mark a turning point.

McDonald’s has just launched three new versions of their iconic McMuffin, adding a spicy touch that hasn't been seen before in their morning offerings. This new development comes at a time when the competition, especially Burger King, is facing a tough blow in the United States.

McDonald’s spicy bet revolutionizes breakfast in the United States

McDonald’s has added three new varieties to their breakfast menu, which until now had remained quite stable. The new Spicy McMuffins include the Spicy Egg McMuffin, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with egg. The key is the special spicy sauce that's added to these sandwiches, an exclusive blend that delivers an intense flavor and an extra spicy kick.

This spicy sauce is already used in other menu items, such as the Spicy McCrispy and, soon, in the Spicy Snack Wrap that's returning on July 10, according to All Recipes. With this addition, McDonald’s expands their range of products with a bold flavor, designed to attract spice lovers and those seeking new breakfast experiences.

Previously, McDonald’s had experimented with jalapeños in their breakfasts, but they'd never included their own spicy sauce in a product as classic as the McMuffin. This innovation not only refreshes the menu, but also attracts a younger and more dynamic audience.

Impact and consequences for Burger King

This strategic move comes at a complicated time for Burger King in the United States. While McDonald’s expands their offerings and updates their menu, Burger King hasn't replied with similar innovations in their morning menu. The introduction of these Spicy McMuffins has caused a considerable increase in consumer interest toward McDonald’s, leaving their rival with fewer options to compete.

In addition, the launch campaign has been supported by the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the McMuffin. This has given a special context to this update. This combination of tradition and innovation strengthens McDonald’s's position in a market where breakfast is one of the most important time slots.

Although the new sandwiches will be available only for a limited time, the expectation and demand have been very high. Customers are taking advantage of the opportunity before these products disappear from the menu, which is causing long lines in many locations.

McDonald’s has managed to leverage their legacy and add a bold twist that allows them to keep their leadership strong. Meanwhile, Burger King will have to rethink their strategy in order not to fall behind in the breakfast battle in the United States.",https://catalunyadiari.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-de-mcdonalds-burger-king-y-hombre-sorprendido_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-07-08 07:05:26.292221

The company says this milestone signals a ‘significant leap forward’ in delivering seamless, life-saving support to the most fragile patients. With the CE Mark secured, Medtronic now offers a ‘simple, fully integrated’ ECMO portfolio in Europe, which it says is purpose-built to meet the complex and evolving demands of modern intensive care units.

Medtronic says the VitalFlow ECMO technology is the most innovative technology to-date from its acquisition of MC3 Cardiopulmonary, originally founded in 1991 by Dr. Robert Bartlett. The acquisition marked the culmination of an eight-year partnership and distribution agreement with the Medtronic Cardiac Surgery business resulting in the introduction of seven new ECMO products in seven years.

MC3 Cardiopulmonary developed and manufactured differentiated, high-quality ECMO products, which were exclusively distributed by Medtronic prior to the acquisition. These products, including catheters and oxygenators, are distinguished by their ability to simplify therapy and enhance ease of use says the company.

Additionally, the partnership has reliably supplied these long-term indicated products throughout the COVID pandemic and beyond. With the CE Mark for VitalFlow achieved June 2025, Medtronic claims it is now “poised to redefine ECMO care across Europe.”

“The CE Mark for the VitalFlow ECMO System is a powerful reflection of how we bring the Medtronic Mission to life — by engineering technologies that restore health and extend life,” said Giuseppe Savoja, Western Europe senior business director for the Cardiac Surgery business, part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. “VitalFlow ECMO is more than a system; it’s a step toward transforming how ECMO is delivered across Europe. By simplifying complexity and expanding access, we’re helping care teams focus on what matters most – saving lives and improving outcomes for critically ill patients.”

Pieter Kappetein, Ph.D., M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Cardiac Surgery, Medtronic said: “Clinicians in the ECMO space have evolving needs. With patients’ diseases becoming more complex, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions such as the VitalFlow ECMO system.

U.S. comparable sales fell 3.6% at McDonald's during its first quarter, the chain said in May, which was company's worst showing since the pandemic.

The big picture: Reviving fan-favorite items or adding limited-time offerings can help restaurants drive sales and bring consumers back.

Starbucks announced Monday that its new Strato Frappuccino blended beverages debut nationwide Tuesday.

Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches out Tuesday

The intrigue: McDonald's Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches debut Tuesday at participating restaurants nationwide.

There are three varieties with the chain's Spicy Pepper Sauce — Spicy Sausage, Spicy Egg Cheese and the Spicy Sausage Egg Cheese McMuffin.

The new breakfast addition comes after McDonald's and Krispy Kreme ended their doughnut partnership effective July 2.

When does the McDonald's Snack Wrap come back

Zoom in: McDonald's Snack Wrap will come back starting Thursday, July 10 as a permanent menu item. It uses the new McCrispy Strips that rolled out to restaurants in early May.

McDonald's CEO Christopher Kempczinski has said the launch of new chicken strips and the return of snack wraps should help the company's sales improve.

The Snack Wrap will be available in two flavors — spicy and ranch.

Popeyes and other restaurants have also launched their own chicken wraps, which appears to be the next battle in the Chicken Sandwich Wars.

How much does Snack Wrap cost

By the numbers: McDonald's said the Snack Wrap is priced at $2.99 and is available to order from 10:30 a.m. through late night at participating restaurants.

The wraps can be ordered on the app, restaurant and drive-thru.

The original McDonald's Snack Wrap debuted in 2006 and was discontinued in 2016.

Daily Double joining McDonald's McValue menu

What's next: Starting July 22, the Daily Double will be a new entree option in McDonald's McValue Meal Deal bundle.

It will be priced at $6 or $7 depending on location, the company said.

McDonald's rolled out its McValue menu in January after it introduced the $5 meal deal last summer, which has been extended multiple times.

Zoom out: The Daily Double is a more premium burger than the basic McDouble double cheeseburger, which is also on the McValue menu.

The Daily Double has two patties, cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato, slivered onions and mayo.

The McDouble and McChicken will continue to be on the McValue menu, McDonald's said on its new menu item spotter website.

Hazy IPA has added £1.4m by filling a gap in an alcohol-free beer segment currently dominated by lager.","Low & no-alcohol remains a growing opportunity that major drinks companies can ill afford to ignore.

That much is clear from the latest supermarket data, which shows low & no beer growing 22% year on year, while the total beer category remains near-flat [Circana 12 we 14 June 2025]. Some 76% of UK adults are actively moderating their alcohol consumption and low & no products are one of the main ways they are choosing to do it.

This trend – which has been in motion for at least a decade – prompted an early flurry of M&A from major spirits companies keen to protect themselves against declining booze consumption. Diageo was an early advocate, backing Seedlip and Everleaf through its Distill Ventures incubator. Meanwhile, Pernod Ricard worked with the founders of Ceder’s to bring the non-alcoholic gin alternative to market in 2018, before taking a majority stake in the business in 2021.

Fast-forward to 2025, however, and the landscape looks very different. Multinational drinks companies have developed and launched 0.0% abv versions of their best-selling brands, backing them with major focus and investment. Meanwhile, brands like Seedlip, Ceder’s and Everleaf have seen off-trade sales slump as the major mults delist them in favour of more recognisable alcohol-free versions of household names.

So, why are standalone low & no brands no longer seen as a growth opportunity for drinks majors, and what does that mean for the future of challenger brands in the segment?

How drinks brands hedged their bets

When the low & no category was in its infancy, multinationals understandably wanted to ‘test the water’ with low-risk investments while waiting to see how sustained the moderation trend was likely to be.

By backing early-stage startups, Diageo and Pernod were able to hedge their bets by ensuring they had a stake in the nascent but growing low & no segment, while also protecting their reputation if the products didn’t meet consumers’ expectations. Seedlip was marketed as a non-alcoholic alternative to gin, but nobody bought it expecting it to taste like a Gordon’s or a Tanqueray.

Then – once they were confident they had the formula right – Diageo launched Gordon’s 0.0% in 2020, followed by Tanqueray 0.0% in 2021, and Captain Morgan Spiced Gold 0.0% in 2023. Pernod is now preparing to do the same with Beefeater 0.0%.

It was a similar story in beer – Budweiser Brewing Group initially dipped its toes with Budweiser Prohibition in 2017, while Asahi added Peroni Libera in 2018. Both were axed and replaced by Budweiser Zero and Peroni Nastro Azzurro 0.0% once alcohol-free brewing technology had sufficiently advanced, and low & no sales had shown little sign of slowing down.

What has happened to Seedlip?

These alcohol-free versions of well-known brands have been backed with large-scale marketing investment – Peroni 0.0%, for example, is the alcohol-free beer partner of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula 1 team, while Captain Morgan 0.0% and Gordon’s 0.0% have both appeared in TV advertising.

Predictably, therefore, they’ve come to dominate supermarkets’ low & no aisles and driven much of the growth of the category. Just 12 of the 75 low & no-alcohol products on sale in Sainsbury’s are made by dedicated alcohol-free drinks brands. Meanwhile, just one of the top 10 fastest-growing low & no products – Lucky Saint’s Hazy IPA – is from a brand that doesn’t also operate in booze [NIQ 52 we 17 May 2025].

By contrast, the dedicated low & no brands backed by major multinationals have been left on – or in some cases knocked off – the shelf. Seedlip was last seen in Sainsbury’s in May 2024, and Tesco in 2023 [Assosia]. It remains stocked by Waitrose and Ocado, but sales have declined by 37.6% to £758k in the last year [NIQ 52 we 19 April 2025].

Everleaf and Ceder’s – the latter of which appears destined for the Pernod Ricard scrapheap – have mustered less than £50k between them.

Why 0.0% variants are taking off

Diageo and Pernod Ricard remained tight-lipped when The Grocer asked about their plans for Seedlip and Ceder’s, but it makes sense they would want to shift focus towards 0.0% versions of their big-name brands.

While health and wellbeing are major drivers for moderation, consumers report not wanting to feel left out at social occasions as a reason for choosing alcohol-free beers and spirits over soft drinks. By offering consumers brands they know and trust, drinks companies like Diageo and Pernod can keep moderating drinkers in their portfolio.

As one senior drinks industry executive put it when quizzed last week: “It’s a much easier sell-in if they already know the brand and the product – you don’t need to explain it to them.”

Despite the dominance of 0.0% abv variants, there are still several challenger brands making headway in the alcohol-free segment. For example, Lucky Saint has added £2.3m and is now worth £8.9m [NIQ]. Meanwhile Botivo, which only made its grocery debut in January, had amassed £180k in sales by April.

In the case of Lucky Saint, success has been driven by the launch of new variants like Hazy IPA and Lemon Lager. Hazy IPA has added £1.4m by filling a gap in an alcohol-free beer segment currently dominated by lager. Similarly Botivo’s botanical non-alcoholic aperitif offers a point of difference in a low & no spirits category stacked with gin alternatives. Both brands have also made a point of emphasising the positive case for choosing alcohol-free in their marketing, rather than framing not drinking as a compromise.

If challengers are to survive in a competitive landscape increasingly dominated by major players, this looks like the blueprint for how to do it.",https://dmrqkbkq8el9i.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/9/7/363797_gordonszeropercent_78967_crop.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 07:04:49.918131

WATKINS GLEN, NY (607NewsNow) – Work is underway to replace a 117-year-old structure in Watkins Glen State Park

On July 7, crews began the lengthy replacement of the park’s iconic Sentry Bridge, which has been closed since 2022 due to weathering and unstable rock conditions.

The state announced the $7.5 million replacement project last October. The new bridge will be fully constructed off-site and lowered into place to minimize the impact the project will have on day-to-day operations.

The tunnel entrance and access to the South Rim Trail will be closed at the main entrance but will remain accessible from the park’s other entry points.

The Gorge Trail and waterfalls will be accessible from the North Rim Trail at the main entrance, the South Entrance, or the North Entrance throughout the process. A shuttle service is also available.

This strategic partnership positions Firestorm as the only provider of HP’s high-performance 3D printers designed for mobile and field-deployable environments, creating new possibilities for on-demand production in remote locations.

The collaboration represents a fundamental shift in how commercial, humanitarian, and medical sectors can respond to urgent needs in challenging environments. By combining HP’s established 3D printing expertise with Firestorm’s mobile manufacturing platform, organisations can now produce critical components precisely where and when they’re needed, without relying on traditional supply chains that may be disrupted or unavailable.

The xCell Expeditionary Manufacturing System

At the heart of this partnership is Firestorm’s xCell system, an expeditionary manufacturing platform housed within two expandable 20-foot containers that can be transported and deployed worldwide. The system is designed with versatility in mind, capable of operating on various power sources including standard generators, battery backup systems, or conventional power networks. This flexibility makes the xCell particularly valuable in remote settings such as forward operating bases, disaster zones, or areas with limited infrastructure.

The integration of HP’s Multi Jet Fusion technology into the xCell system significantly enhances its capabilities. MJF is a powder-based 3D printing technology that creates highly durable parts with consistent mechanical properties. Unlike traditional manufacturing that requires extensive tooling and setup time, MJF can produce complex components on demand. This technology enables the xCell to manufacture mission-critical parts and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in real-time at the point of need, dramatically reducing response times in critical situations.

Creating Resilient Global Production Networks

Firestorm’s approach aims to establish a distributed and resilient global production network that fundamentally changes how manufacturing responds to logistical challenges. By deploying xCell units strategically around the world, customers can access regional and localised supply chains that adapt quickly to shortages, reduce delivery times, and allow for rapid modifications to products that would otherwise have lengthy lead times.

The concept addresses a persistent problem in global logistics: the vulnerability of centralised manufacturing and extended supply chains. When political instability, natural disasters, or other disruptions affect traditional supply routes, expeditionary manufacturing provides an alternative production method. The system’s ability to operate in contested logistics environments—areas where traditional supply routes are compromised or unavailable—makes it particularly valuable for defence, disaster response, and humanitarian operations.

The partnership between HP and Firestorm extends beyond technology to include significant workforce development opportunities. As the demand for mobile manufacturing solutions grows, the collaboration will create new high-tech jobs across multiple fields, including system operations, maintenance, field deployment, and drone manufacturing.

These positions will require skilled technicians, engineers, and logistics experts who understand both 3D printing technology and field operations.

Next week, McDonald's is launching three spicy breakfast menu items: the Spicy McMuffin, Spicy Sausage McMuffin and Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The McMuffins will feature their traditional ingredients – cheese, egg, Canadian bacon or sausage, and a buttered English muffin, topped with Spicy Pepper Sauce, a news release states.

McDonald's launched the Egg McMuffin in 1975. The breakfast item was the brainchild of Herb Peterson, a McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California. Herb, according to previous USA TODAY reporting, presented the sandwich as a to-go version of a diner classic: Eggs Benedict. Roy Kroc, the businessman who transformed McDonald's into what it is today, loved the idea.

For its part, Capgemini said it plans to use the WNS acquisition to transition into an “agentic AI-powered intelligent” operation.
The company’s services “will be the showcase for agentic AI,” Capgemini Chief Executive Officer Aiman Ezzat said in the firm’s statement on Monday.
WNS shares jumped 14% to $74.62 a share in New York trading, more than a dollar below the offer price.
IT services firms from Capgemini to Accenture Plc are spending heavily on artificial intelligence, which companies around the world are racing to adopt.","The French consulting company Capgemini SE has agreed to buy IT outsourcing firm WNS Holdings Ltd. for $3.3 billion (€2.8 billion) in cash in a push to expand its presence in artificial intelligence, a technology investors fear could undermine the group’s business.

The French group said it will take over the US-listed firm for $76.50 per share, a premium of about 28% to WNS’s average price over the past 90 days. Capgemini expects the deal to close by the end of the year, pending approvals, and to boost its earnings per share by about 4% on a normalized basis in 2026, it said in a statement on Monday.

Capgemini shares fell 5.6% in Paris on Monday. The acquisition reignited investor concerns that AI tools will reduce the need for IT and system-integration services and give rise to rivals that use the technology to deliver at much lower costs, Morgan Stanley said in a note on Monday. There are already signs that AI is bringing down the costs of consulting — and in some cases, the prices that consultants charge, too.

For its part, Capgemini said it plans to use the WNS acquisition to transition into an “agentic AI-powered intelligent” operation. The company’s services “will be the showcase for agentic AI,” Capgemini Chief Executive Officer Aiman Ezzat said in the firm’s statement on Monday.

The acquisition will also increase Capgemini’s exposure to the US market, and Ezzat said in an interview that it expands the company’s “expertise and technology.”

WNS’s products help businesses perform data analysis, manage shipping and routing, automate travel booking and predict how customers will behave. The company serves more than 600 clients and operates in 13 countries, according to its website. In April, it reported better-than-anticipated quarterly earnings, though revenue declined slightly.

Capgemini’s $3.3 billion bid for WNS Holdings looks like a strategic bet on enterprises leaning on low-cost implementers to design and run AI agents, yet business-process-service disruption means expected revenue and profit synergies might not materialize, said Tamlin Bason, industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Yet Capgemini could boost US exposure and end-to-end transformation project competitiveness.

WNS shares jumped 14% to $74.62 a share in New York trading, more than a dollar below the offer price. The shares have gained 57% this year.

Talks about a combination earlier this year were interrupted due to uncertainties around tariffs, Bloomberg had reported.

IT services firms from Capgemini to Accenture Plc are spending heavily on artificial intelligence, which companies around the world are racing to adopt. Capgemini said in the statement that the biggest opportunity for its customers to get value from AI is the “fundamental redesign of their operations and business practices.”

“If enterprises turn to services firms to design and run agentic solutions, this could be the first of many such deals in the space,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tamlin Bason said in a note.",https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/yj8o5v-capgemini-headquarters-near-paris-shutterstock-2078930629.jpg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/Capgemini_headquarters_near_Paris_shutterstock_2078930629.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:21:35.440646

Johnson & Johnson MedTech, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment, has launched VARIPULSE™ Platform in Asia-Pacific to perform Cardiovascular Solutions.

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is Johnson & Johnson MedTech's Pulsed Field ablation system. The VARIPULSE™ Platform is the first Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) system fully integrated with the CARTO™ 3 electroanatomical mapping system, designed to drive efficiency, reproducibility, and procedural accuracy. The VARIPULSE™ Platform is approved in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Taiwan and Korea in Asia Pacific. With this Platform is now approved for use in the United States, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada.

Catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular and often rapid heartbeat caused by extra, uncoordinated electrical signals in the atria will be performed by using this platform. AFib is associated with structural changes in the heart due to underlying conditions and lifestyle factors. It significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality.

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is the first PFA technology designed to streamline ablation and mapping through a single integrated workflow with the CARTO™ 3 System. This 3D electroanatomical cardiac mapping technology enables real-time visualization and supports precision, efficiency, reproducibility, and procedural accuracy for physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib). It enables safe and efficient patient-centric therapy with minimal to no fluoroscopy exposurex and is compatible with deep and/or conscious sedation.

Philip McDaniel, CEO and co-founder of the award-winning St. Augustine Distillery, has retired.

Well known for his advocacy for sustainable production and modernizing antiquated distillery regulation laws, the 30-year St. Augustine resident is passing the torch his co-founders to spend more time with his family.

McDaniel told the St. Augustine Record that as retirement feels surreal, he remains “blown away” by the cool idea ― the distillery ― that became one of Florida’s top attractions and the state's largest craft spirit's brand.

“I feel good about it all,” he said. ""We poured our time, energy and heart to achieve becoming respected and engaged. We didn’t just seek profits — we sought to create purpose. We built something that helps take care of people, both in the company and throughout our community.""

Known for his mentorship, advocacy and community give-back, McDaniel said that despite stepping back from the daily operations, he remains a “passionate” supporter of the craft spirits movement and the future of St. Augustine Distillery.

Over the past 12 years, McDaniel and his team have acquired a long list of accolades. Last year, the distillery received USA Today's Reader's Choice Award for the 2024 Best Craft Specialty Spirits.

Additional awards include:

“#1 Whiskey Tour in North America” by the Drammie Awards.

A gold medal for its Florida Double Cask Bourbon.

A platinum medal for its Port Finished Bourbon from the Spirits International Prestige Awards.

A 2014 Award for Excellence for Reuse and Repurpose by the Urban Land Institute of North Florida for the renovation of the Ice Plant.

And the 2014 Adelaide Sanchez Award for Historic Preservation, Restoration, Education and Interpretation.

The distillery treats more than 175,000 annual guests to award-winning whiskey, bourbon, rum, gin, vodka and moonshine. McDaniel and his team spearheaded the renovation of the St. Augustine Distillery, which is nestled in Florida's oldest FP&L Ice Plant. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the evolution of the 1917 ice plant to become a distillery took more than three years.

""Finding a home with lots of soulful character that would be big enough to house a working distillery ― while also being convenient to visit – was no small task,"" McDaniel told the St. Augustine Record in December. ""We lovingly restored this piece of history so it could serve the community for the next century.""

The distillery boasts a culture for community give-back with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, The St. Johns County Cultural Counsel, the Lincolnville Museum and Cultural Center, the St. Augustine Amphitheatre, the Ponte Vedra Concert Hall, and music festivals such as Sing Out Loud and Fort Mose Jazz and Blues Concert Series.

As a well-respected voice in the industry, McDaniel served on the board of directors for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Visit Florida's board and multiple terms — including as chairman — on the St. Augustine, Ponte Vedra & The Beaches Visitors & Convention Bureau, promoting regional tourism and entrepreneurship.

“I’m grateful to our shareholders, our incredible team, our industry partners, and the 1.5 million guests who’ve visited and supported us,” he said in a public statement.” I’m excited to support our leadership team — Mike Diaz (CFO) and Will Hensler (COO) and Rick DeMontmollin — in my new role as Founder Emeritus.”

The facility—now the largest iron ore concentrator in West Africa—is expected to quadruple Liberia’s iron ore output.
Lakshmi Mittal remarked that the concentrator “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” solidifying the country’s role as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.
“This brings great relief to our economy noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” said President Boakai.
ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and has created more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs during its two decades in the country.","ArcelorMittal Liberia has officially inaugurated a state-of-the-art iron ore concentrator at its Tokadeh mine in Nimba County, marking a major milestone in Liberia’s mining sector and broader post-war economic transformation.

The facility—now the largest iron ore concentrator in West Africa—is expected to quadruple Liberia’s iron ore output. It represents the centerpiece of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II Expansion Project, a $1.8 billion investment that brings the company’s total stake in Liberia to approximately $3.5 billion.

The inauguration ceremony, attended by Liberia’s President Joseph Nyuma Boakai and ArcelorMittal Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal, highlighted the project as one of the most significant private-sector investments in Liberia since the civil war. President Boakai hailed the development as a “turning point” in Liberia’s industrial future and a testament to the country’s stability and resilience.

The new concentrator is designed to transform Liberia’s abundant but lower-grade hematite ore (~35% Fe content) into premium 66% Fe magnetite concentrate using advanced beneficiation technology. The upgrade adds significant value before export, aligning with Africa’s broader push toward value addition and industrialization. “The iron ore that leaves Liberia should not just be raw material—we must add value, create jobs, and build an industrial base for our future,” President Boakai stated.

Echoing the African Union’s vision for mineral-led development, ArcelorMittal’s investment demonstrates how resource-rich African nations like Liberia, and by extension Ghana and others, can leverage natural wealth to drive homegrown industrial transformation. Lakshmi Mittal remarked that the concentrator “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” solidifying the country’s role as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.

In parallel with boosting output, ArcelorMittal’s expansion also emphasizes infrastructure development. The company has modernized the 243-kilometer railway linking Tokadeh to the port of Buchanan, laying hundreds of thousands of new sleepers, enhancing track geometry, and installing new passing loops to accommodate long, heavy trains. These upgrades elevate Liberia’s mining corridor to meet international standards and lay the foundation for regional integration.

Crucially, ArcelorMittal supports an open-access policy for the railway, collaborating with the Liberian government to develop a framework allowing other mining companies to utilize the infrastructure under fair agreements. This creates the potential for Liberia to serve as a regional mineral hub, with iron ore from neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone possibly routed through Liberia’s enhanced logistics network in the future.

President Boakai emphasized the strategic importance of these projects, stating they are “essential to deepening Liberia’s integration into global value chains and unlocking long-term benefits for our people.”

The Phase II expansion has already delivered significant socioeconomic impact. During the construction phase, over 5,000 jobs were created—most of them filled by Liberians. Now operational, the concentrator is expected to support around 1,000 permanent roles in mining, rail, processing, and port operations. “This brings great relief to our economy noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” said President Boakai.

ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and has created more than 10,000 direct and indirect jobs during its two decades in the country. To ensure lasting benefits, the company has expanded its Training Academy in Yekepa, offering a fully funded, multi-year technical training program. Dozens of young Liberians are being trained in mechanical, electrical, and processing disciplines to run the new concentrator. “They are the true face of Liberia’s tomorrow,” President Boakai noted.

Local businesses have also benefitted, with Liberian contractors engaged in civil works, transportation, and support services—stimulating local economies across Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties.

With future expansion in mind, ArcelorMittal has built infrastructure capable of handling up to 30 million tonnes of iron ore annually, beyond the initial 20 Mt target. Officials have hinted at a phased ramp-up and plans for a pelletizing plant, potentially adding more in-country processing and helping West Africa gain a stronger foothold in the global steel supply chain.

On the community front, ArcelorMittal contributes around $3 million annually to a Community Development Fund, which has financed schools, clinics, water systems, and livelihoods in host communities. President Boakai underscored the importance of corporate responsibility: “Large investments must enrich the corporate social responsibility envelope… so that communities feel the benefits not just in employment, but in schools, clinics, and markets.”

The successful commissioning of the Tokadeh concentrator underscores what’s possible when stable policy, infrastructure investment, and community engagement align. “We would not have invested this scale of capital—nearly $3 billion—if we didn’t believe in Liberia and its people,” said Lakshmi Mittal, signaling ArcelorMittal’s long-term confidence in the nation.

Beyond Liberia, the project holds regional significance. Its alignment with continental initiatives such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) showcases how integrated infrastructure corridors can drive industrialization and trade across borders. The emphasis on beneficiation and skills development reflects Agenda 2063’s goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development.

For other resource-rich African nations—including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Ghana—Liberia’s model offers valuable lessons: local processing and infrastructure investment can multiply the economic impact of natural resources and position Africa not only as a source of raw materials, but as a leader in global value chains.

In conclusion, the newly inaugurated Tokadeh concentrator stands as a landmark of African industrial progress—symbolizing resilience, ambition, and meaningful partnership. As Liberia prepares to export its first high-grade iron ore from the facility later this year, a powerful message resonates across the continent: Africa is open for business—and ready to transform its natural wealth into lasting prosperity.",https://www.adomonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PHOTO-2025-07-07-07-47-26-Copy.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 03:58:03.857981

This decision has sparked controversy and raised concerns among patients and healthcare providers.
This trend raises questions about the long-term sustainability of obesity treatment and the need for more data on the long-term effectiveness and value of GLP-1 medications [1].
In conclusion, CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound from coverage has sparked debate and concern among patients and healthcare providers.","CVS' anti-theft measures may be alienating customers and harming profits more than the theft itself, according to liberal columnist Matt Bai. The drugstore chain has experienced a rise in organized theft in recent years, prompting the implementation of barriers to protect merchandise. Bai argues that these barriers have altered his relaxing shopping experience and may be driving customers away.

CVS Caremark, a major pharmacy benefit manager, has announced significant changes to its prescription drug plans, including the exclusion of Eli Lilly's Zepbound from coverage for chronic weight management, effective July 1, 2025 [1]. This decision has sparked controversy and raised concerns among patients and healthcare providers.

Zepbound, a GLP-1 drug approved for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or who are overweight, will no longer be covered under CVS Caremark's most common formulary template, which represents between 25 and 30 million individuals [1]. The change is aimed at encouraging competition among drug manufacturers to lower prices and improve patient access to more affordable alternatives, such as Wegovy from Novo Nordisk [1]. However, the exclusion of Zepbound has been met with criticism from patients and healthcare professionals who argue that the medication is more effective and better tolerated than Wegovy for many individuals [1].

The trial-and-error process required to find the right medication for each patient can be disrupted by insurance coverage changes, leading to potential setbacks in weight loss progress and increased stress for patients [1]. Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, has expressed frustration with the impact of insurance coverage changes on patient care and the time burden it places on healthcare providers [1].

Moreover, the exclusion of Zepbound from coverage may have unintended consequences for patients' mental health, as weight stigma and bias can contribute to feelings of depression and anxiety [1]. Tara Eacobacci, a patient who has benefited from Zepbound, has described feeling validated by the medication and concerned about the potential impact of losing coverage on her physical and mental well-being [1].

In response to the coverage change, Eli Lilly has expanded access to Zepbound through its LillyDirect platform, offering single-dose vials at $499 per month for patients who pay out-of-pocket [1]. However, the appeals process for coverage exceptions can be time-consuming and frustrating for patients [1].

The insurance coverage changes are part of a broader trend of exclusions and restrictions on GLP-1 medications for obesity treatment, with BCBS Massachusetts planning to exclude all GLP-1s from coverage for obesity treatment in January 2026, except when indicated for type 2 diabetes [1]. This trend raises questions about the long-term sustainability of obesity treatment and the need for more data on the long-term effectiveness and value of GLP-1 medications [1].

In conclusion, CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound from coverage has sparked debate and concern among patients and healthcare providers. While the goal of encouraging competition and lowering drug prices is commendable, the impact on patient care and well-being must be carefully considered. As the obesity crisis continues to be a significant public health challenge, it is essential to ensure that patients have access to effective and affordable treatment options.

Washington Post contributing columnist Matt Bai argued Monday that the drugstore chain’s efforts to prevent rising theft may be killing profits more than theft itself.

""As you might have read, CVS and other pharmacies have been struggling to contain a rise in thefts by gangs of fast-moving thieves. Unfortunately for CVS, the solution might be worse for business than the organized shoplifting,"" he wrote.

In recent years, CVS and other similar drug stores have experienced a rise in frequent, organized theft, especially in major U.S. cities where crime has risen.

CREW OF ARMED GUNMEN ROB ARMORED TRUCK OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO-AREA BANK IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

For example, a group of dozens of school-age kids routinely ransacked and looted a CVS in Washington, D.C.’s Columbia Heights neighborhood throughout 2023.

""A big group of kids, like 45 or more, walk in before school, after school and late at night to steal chips and drinks,"" Fox 5 reported in October that year. ""They even throw the food and beverages on the ground and stomp on them, leaving behind a big mess.""

A recent survey by the National Retail Federation found that 70% of retailers believe organized retail theft has become a more prevalent issue in recent years. As a result of these and similar crimes, big chain stores like CVS and others have been forced to lock up merchandise behind glass and plastic barriers to keep it from being stolen off the shelves.

But the Washington Post columnist complained that these barriers have altered his ""relaxing"" CVS shopping experience.

""I come back not just because it’s convenient but because it’s relaxing. I like to roam the deserted aisles at night and consider the myriad ways in which the bounty of 21st-century pharmacology might improve my life. What if my hands could truly be moist? Which combination of vitamins might heighten my chances of grasping string theory?"" Bai asked.

""Except now I’m standing in front of the oral care aisle, and something has changed,"" he continued. ""Virtually all of those mysterious products are now encased in glass. It’s like someone has turned the CVS I knew into a Museum of the American Pharmacy; the only thing missing from the lifelike diorama is a wax employee with a pricing gun.""

He mentioned feeling the ""pressure"" of having a store clerk open an enclosure just so he could look at a product he hadn’t decided on buying while she stood there next to him. He also mentioned how when he had to return products later, he was asked if he had opened them. When he said no, he noted the cashier ""cheekily"" asked, ""Are you lying?""

""I should probably be offended by this, but I’m not. If body lotion is so valuable that it has to be kept in a glass vault, then I guess it’s reasonable to wonder what kind of game I’m running. Plus, I seem suspiciously well hydrated,"" he remarked, before delving into what has caused this new atmosphere in CVS.

""A little research tells us what’s going on here. As you might have read, CVS and other pharmacies have been struggling to contain a rise in thefts by gangs of fast-moving thieves. Unfortunately for CVS, the solution might be worse for business than the organized shoplifting,"" he said, adding, ""According to a recent survey, less than 1 in 3 shoppers at CVS are willing to hang around once they realize that the item they want is behind glass.""

Bai noted that this is hard for the store combined with the fact that ""plenty of online sites"" are offering the same products ""more cheaply and just as reliably,"" and stated that the chain should lean into what makes it unique.

""What your neighborhood chain can offer is the chance to wander down an aisle and suddenly find some new, cucumber-scented solution to a problem you didn’t even know you had. It’s the possibility store.""

The columnist then offered his advice to the store.

""If I were running CVS, I’d think a bit longer-term — maybe invest in security guards and sales clerks, people who could help preserve that experience of retail discovery.

The company achieved a compound annual revenue growth of 9% (constant currency) over the past three fiscal years, reaching $1.27 billion in FY2025 with an 18.7% operating margin.

Its robust operating model, including non-linear pricing and recurring revenue streams, positions it well to benefit from the global shift to Intelligent Operations.

Unlocking Cross-Selling and Revenue Synergies

The combination will yield €1.9 billion in 2024 revenue in Digital BPS alone. Capgemini expects €100–140 million in annual revenue synergies and €50–70 million in operating model efficiencies by end-2027. Normalised EPS is projected to increase by 4% in 2026 and by 7% in 2027 post-synergies.

Agentic AI: A Paradigm Shift in Process Transformation

Intelligent Operations, driven by Agentic AI and Generative AI, is expected to dominate enterprise AI investments. Capgemini and WNS together offer consulting-led transformation of both horizontal and vertical processes, using hyper-automation, AI, and data integration to deliver speed, agility, and improved outcomes.

This shift from labour-intensive models to tech-led, outcome-driven services opens significant growth opportunities in a rapidly evolving market.

Combined Strengths to Lead in Intelligent Operations

Capgemini brings consulting, technology, and platform integration at scale, while WNS contributes industry-specific solutions, a proven delivery model, and recent AI advancements (including its acquisition of Kipi.ai). Capgemini’s 25 strategic AI partnerships—including Microsoft, AWS, Google, NVIDIA, and Mistral—further enhance the combined capabilities.

Together, the companies aim to lead the emerging Intelligent Operations space and become transformation partners to enterprises seeking AI-powered reinvention.

Transaction Structure and Financing

The acquisition will be implemented via a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Jersey law. Capgemini has secured €4 billion in bridge financing to fund the purchase price, existing debt, and a recently redeemed €0.8 billion bond. The bridge will be refinanced using a mix of available cash and new debt.

Q2 and H1 2025 Guidance Unchanged

Capgemini expects Q2 2025 constant-currency revenue growth to slightly exceed Q1’s -0.4% and maintains its H1 operating margin at 12.4%. Full H1 results will be announced on July 30, 2025.

2025 Outlook (Excluding Acquisition Impact):

Revenue growth: –2.0% to +2.0% (constant currency)

Operating margin: 13.3% to 13.5%

Organic free cash flow: ~€1.9 billion

Integration Path and Cultural Alignment

The two organisations share common values and a compatible culture, ensuring a smooth integration into Capgemini’s Global Business Services unit. Capgemini has a strong track record in successful post-merger integrations, ensuring continuity for clients and employees.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/ciol/media/media_files/2025/07/08/capgemini-2025-07-08-08-06-49.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:21:45.870706

For long-time customers, the spicy Egg McMuffin and returning Snack Wrap offer a mix of familiarity and novelty.","McDonald's has announced two major menu changes in the US, marking the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin. Starting in July, the chain will introduce a spicy version of the breakfast classic for the first time and reintroduce its long-discontinued Snack Wrap.

The updates reflect shifting customer preferences and come amid wider efforts to attract younger diners and boost footfall.

Spicy McMuffin: A New Take on a Classic

From 8 July, McDonald's will roll out three spicy Egg McMuffin options in the US. The new range will feature a Spicy Pepper Sauce developed to appeal to younger customers and fans of stronger flavours. Menu additions include the Egg McMuffin with Spicy Pepper Sauce, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

According to a recent consumer trends report, 74 per cent of Americans regularly use hot sauce, and nearly four in five Gen Z diners prefer spicier food. The move to spice up one of McDonald's most iconic breakfast items signals a shift in how the company is responding to changing tastes and evolving expectations around fast food.

Snack Wrap Returns: A Cult Favourite Revived

​​On 10 July, McDonald's will also bring back its Snack Wrap, a customer favourite that was removed from the menu in 2016 due to equipment and preparation constraints. It will return in two flavours: Ranch and Spicy, both using McCrispy chicken strips, lettuce and shredded cheese wrapped in a soft tortilla. While McDonald's has not officially confirmed whether the grilled version will return, reports suggest that only the crispy chicken option will be available at launch.

The wrap's revival follows years of customer demand and persistent online campaigns. On platforms like TikTok and Reddit, users have frequently called for its return, with some even attempting to recreate the item at home. McDonald's has said the wrap will remain on the menu as long as customer interest remains strong. While this announcement applies only to the US, the company has suggested it may consider broader availability if the product performs well.

Strategic Context: Why Now, and Why It Matters

The Egg McMuffin, first introduced in 1972 by Californian franchisee Herb Peterson, became a national breakfast staple by 1975. Its enduring popularity has helped define McDonald's breakfast offering for half a century. By launching new versions during its anniversary year, the company is leveraging nostalgia while modernising its image.

The limited-time offerings are designed to encourage app downloads, reward programme enrolments and in-store traffic. The reintroduction of familiar items in new formats also plays into McDonald's wider digital strategy, which includes dynamic menu changes and user-customised ordering through mobile platforms.

For long-time customers, the spicy Egg McMuffin and returning Snack Wrap offer a mix of familiarity and novelty. These additions provide more variety during breakfast and lunch hours and are aimed at consumers seeking flavour-forward, convenient food options.

Although the company has not confirmed whether these items will be introduced in the UK or other markets, the announcement marks a broader shift in how McDonald's responds to consumer demand and market trends. The decision to refresh one of its most iconic products, while reviving a cult favourite, reflects a more adaptive and customer-led approach to menu development.",https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1730687/mcdonalds-logo.png,N,,2025-07-08 04:59:35.149506

Why it matters: Billions of dollars are projected to be spent at Amazon and other retailers that are running competing sales.

The summer sales period kicks off back-to-school shopping, and some bargain-conscious consumers are expected to get a jump on holiday shopping.

""Value and essentials will outperform premium as shoppers focus on deals for everyday items, especially back-to-school and replenishment,"" Mike Feldman, senior vice president of commerce at Flywheel, told Axios.

State of play: Retailers have warned that some seasonal events could be affected by tariffs, with shortages and higher prices possible.

""I think people are just being a bit more conservative in general, but then splurging where they can,"" Coresight Research CEO Deborah Weinswig told Axios. ""The consumer is being very intentional.""

Jacob Bennett, CEO and co-founder of small business banking platform Crux Analytics, tells Axios that some Amazon sellers pulled out of Prime Day because of tariffs.

""Small businesses importing goods are getting hit twice, first by tariff costs, then by Prime Day debt on top,"" Bennett said.

What time does Amazon Prime Day start?

Amazon's 11th Prime Day starts 12:01am PDT Tuesday and goes through Friday, July 11.

ID24,Levi Strauss,2025-07-08 05:30:40+00:00,France 24,Major garment producer Bangladesh seeks deal after 35% US tariff - France 24,"France 24, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250708-major-garment-producer-bangladesh-seeks-deal-after-35-us-tariff,"Rahman said the South Asia nation's national security adviser and commerce adviser were ""working on the issue"" in the United States.
Trump hit Bangladesh with 37 percent tariffs in an April 2 announcement, but in a letter issued Tuesday, the US leader said it would now be 35 percent.
Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), called it ""a big challenge for the garment sector"".
""We had expected the tariff imposed on us to be between 10 to 20 percent,"" he said, adding he expected Dhaka's interim leader Muhammad Yunus to ""raise the issue with the United States"".
""The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,"" he said.","Textile and garment production accounts for about 80 percent of exports in Bangladesh and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hit hard in a student-led revolution that toppled the government last year.

""There is a hope for getting a reduced rate of tariffs as USTR (Office of the United States Trade Representative) sent another draft document for review,"" Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman told AFP.

Rahman said the South Asia nation's national security adviser and commerce adviser were ""working on the issue"" in the United States.

Bangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the United States in 2024, while imports from there amounted to $2.21 billion, according to the Bangladesh Bank and the National Board of Revenue.

US clothing companies that source products from Bangladesh range from Fruit of the Loom to Levi Strauss to VF Corp -- whose brands include Vans, Timberland and The North Face.

Trump hit Bangladesh with 37 percent tariffs in an April 2 announcement, but in a letter issued Tuesday, the US leader said it would now be 35 percent.

That is more than double the 16 percent already placed on cotton products.

Dhaka has proposed to buy Boeing planes and boost imports of US wheat, cotton and oil in a bid to reduce the trade deficit, which Trump has used as justification for imposing painful levies.

Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), called it ""a big challenge for the garment sector"".

""We had expected the tariff imposed on us to be between 10 to 20 percent,"" he said, adding he expected Dhaka's interim leader Muhammad Yunus to ""raise the issue with the United States"".

Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel warned the impact as tariffs stand would be dire.

""The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,"" he said.

""Bangladesh needs to act quickly by engaging US importers to push for policy changes, resuming high-level trade talks, and highlighting the importance of its products.""

In one example, the company is considering making its egg white and roasted red pepper bites without canola oil, a spokesman said in response to an inquiry from Bloomberg News.

The company will also add a new egg bite to its menu that is made with avocado oil.

The coffee chain is in the midst of a brand revamp as it seeks to reverse

a sales slump

, and one of its priorities is testing products that appeal to more health-conscious consumers.

In June, Starbucks chief executive Brian Niccol pledged in a meeting with US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr to further align the chain’s menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities.

Starbucks’ US menu has a number of items that contain canola oil, including a bacon, gouda and egg sandwich, as well as potato bakes. Starbucks did not provide a timeline for the changes to its food lineup.

Seed oils, such as soybean and canola, have become a target for Mr Kennedy and his allies, though multiple meta-analyses have indicated they have no significant impact on inflammation or the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The health push is showing up in other places on Starbucks’ menu.

The chain removed sugar from its matcha powder in a move that boosted sales, Mr Niccol said during an April earnings call. It also nixed an upcharge for non-dairy milk, and a recent pilot involves unsweetened protein powder, which can be added to any cold foam flavour.

The chain’s latest US beverage launch was a limited-time Fourth of July themed Frappuccino. The 16-ounce version contains 59 grams of sugar, according to the chain’s website. The American Heart Association recommends that men consume less than 36 grams of added sugar a day and women less than 25 grams.

In a sector ripe for consolidation, BNP Paribas is staking its claim as Europe's financial services champion.","BNP Paribas, Europe's second-largest bank by assets, has embarked on a sweeping reorganization that reshapes its corporate structure, leadership, and strategic priorities. The moves—consolidating Eurozone commercial and personal banking under Yannick Jung, overhauling governance at its Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) division, and leveraging the AXA IM acquisition to amplify its asset management footprint—signal an audacious bid to dominate the fragmented European financial landscape. For investors, the question is clear: Can these moves turn BNP Paribas into a growth-driven, tech-enabled titan, or will they expose vulnerabilities in a sector still grappling with low rates and regulatory headwinds?

The Eurozone Play: Yannick Jung's Unified Banking Ambition

At the heart of BNP Paribas' overhaul is the consolidation of its Eurozone commercial and personal banking operations under Yannick Jung, a veteran of its Corporate & Institutional Banking division. Jung's new role as Deputy Chief Operating Officer and head of the newly formed Commercial, Personal Banking & Services (CPBS) unit merges France, Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg into a single entity. The goal? To unify technological investments, cross-sell products across divisions, and streamline operations for small and midsize enterprises (SMEs)—a segment that accounts for over 70% of European employment but remains underserved by digital tools.

The strategy hinges on a “shared technology backbone” to reduce costs and enhance customer experience. For instance, Jung's unit will collaborate with CIB to offer SMEs end-to-end solutions—from transaction banking to capital markets access—while leveraging the IPS division's wealth management and insurance products. This integration could be a game-changer in the Savings and Investment Union (SIU), the EU's plan to harmonize pensions and savings products across borders.

The CIB Governance Overhaul: A New Model for European Investment Banking

The CIB division, which generates nearly half of BNP Paribas' revenue, has undergone its own seismic shift. Yann Gérardin, the Group's Chief Operating Officer, now serves as Executive Chairman of CIB, while Olivier Osty—a former head of CIB's Global Markets—becomes its CEO. This dual-leadership structure aims to balance strategic vision with operational execution.

The reorganization splits CIB into two coverage arms (Institutional and Corporate), five business lines (Transaction Banking, Capital Markets, Equities, FICC, and Securities Services), and three geographic regions. The move is a clear nod to CIB's “Originate & Distribute” strategy, which has doubled its revenue over the past decade. But the stakes are high: CIB must now compete with rivals like JPMorgan Chase's European arm while navigating regulatory scrutiny and the shift to digital-first client engagement.

The AXA IM Acquisition: Building an Asset Management Goliath

Perhaps the most transformative move is the €5.4 billion acquisition of AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM), finalized in July 2025. This deal, which boosts BNP Paribas' assets under management (AUM) to over €1.5 trillion, positions the bank as Europe's leader in long-term savings and private asset management. The integration of AXA IM's expertise into BNP's existing asset management divisions—BNP Paribas Asset Management and BNP Paribas REIM—creates a platform with global scale and a focus on ESG-driven investing.

The financial upside is compelling: BNP projects a compound annual revenue growth rate of over 5% through 2026, with returns on invested capital (ROIC) exceeding 14% by 2028 and 20% by 2029. Yet risks loom. The transaction temporarily reduces BNP's CET1 capital ratio—a key prudential metric—by 35 basis points, and employee consultations over merging legal entities remain unresolved.

Why Investors Should Take Note

BNP Paribas' reorganization is a bet on three interconnected trends:

1. Synergies in Digital Banking: Unifying Eurozone operations could cut costs by 10-15% and fuel cross-selling opportunities.

2. SME Financing Growth: With the SIU's push to standardize savings products, BNP's integrated model could capture a disproportionate share of SME lending and advisory fees.

3. Asset Management Dominance: The AXA IM acquisition positions BNP to capitalize on Europe's aging population and demand for long-term savings products.

The bank's stock, trading at a 15% discount to its pre-pandemic peak, offers a potential entry point if execution delivers on its ROIC targets. Competitors like Société Générale and UniCredit face similar challenges in cost-cutting and digital transformation, but BNP's scale and geographic focus give it an edge.

Risks to the Play

Regulatory Pushback: The European Central Bank's scrutiny of bank capital adequacy and cross-border operations could delay synergies.

Integration Hurdles: Merging AXA IM's culture and systems with BNP's divisions is no small task.

Economic Downturn: A recession could pressure SME loan portfolios and asset management AUM.

Investment Takeaway

BNP Paribas' reorganization is a high-stakes gamble—but one with a clear path to success. For investors seeking exposure to European financials, the bank's focus on synergies, tech-driven integration, and long-term asset management growth makes it a compelling pick, provided execution stays on track. Monitor ROIC improvements and CET1 recovery closely; patience could be rewarded.

In a sector ripe for consolidation, BNP Paribas is staking its claim as Europe's financial services champion. The question now is whether its strategic overhaul can deliver the returns its shareholders—and the continent's economy—desperately need.",,N,,2025-07-08 02:58:54.543026

WNS is a leading and trusted business transformation and services partner that uniquely blends deep industry knowledge with business process management, technology, analytics and AI expertise to create market differentiation for clients. With digital-led transformation solutions deployed to clients across 8 industries where it deploys its highly automated platforms to deliver stronger business outcomes, WNS is a leader in Digital Business Process Services (BPS).

This operating model enables strategic engagements that are critical to clients’ daily operations materialized in long-term contracts with recurring revenues streams. Through an expanded ecosystem of partners and network of delivery centers, WNS serves a large portfolio of blue-chip clients, such as United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods.

The high-quality business model of WNS, supported by non-linear pricing models and superior profitability has driven a c.+9% constant currency revenue growth on average over the last 3 fiscal years, to reach $1,266 million of revenue in fiscal year 2025 with an 18.7% operating margin.

Global organizations are in constant need of strategic partners to support their transformation to enhance efficiency and accelerate growth. This continues to be a key driver of the Digital BPS market and WNS targets revenue growth of +7% to +11% for FY2026.

This transaction will position Capgemini as a leader in Digital BPS blending horizontal and vertical process expertise, with a global footprint. With combined revenues of €1.9 billion in 2024 in Digital BPS, this will strengthen Capgemini’s ability to accompany clients on their business and technology transformation journeys.

The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities. It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.

The largest opportunity for global organizations to create value with Gen AI and Agentic AI lies in the fundamental redesign of their operations and business processes. It will attract a significant share of their AI investments as they seek to become AI-powered companies to lead their market. This is creating demand for a new type of business process services: Intelligent Operations.

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI. It addresses clients’ goal of efficiency, speed and agility through process hyper-automation, while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI and digital.

AI technologies trigger a paradigm shift in delivering business process services: from labor-intensive services to being consulting-led and tech-driven. In parallel, client focus has shifted from efficiency gains toward end-to-end value creation and business outcomes, opening opportunities to add non-linear revenues (i.e. transaction-based, subscription-based or outcome-based models). This is creating a rapidly growing market opportunity.

Both Capgemini and WNS are already pioneering Intelligent Operations. Capgemini with its consulting-led end-to-end transformation of processes, advanced AI tools and technology stacks, and BPS platforms, while WNS has developed a set of sector-specific AI-led solutions recently augmented by the acquisition of Kipi.ai to strengthen its data, analytics and AI capabilities.

The combination of Capgemini and WNS will act as a catalyst to lead in Intelligent Operations providing the required scale and unique set of capabilities from Strategy & Transformation consulting, to horizontal and sector expertise, platform offerings to deep AI and technology capabilities.

This combination will also leverage the significant investments made by Capgemini in AI through training, offers and its 25 strategic partnerships, including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and NVIDIA. The Group’s leadership is recognized by its clients, with over €900 million of Gen AI bookings in 2024, and by market analysts such as Forrester, IDC and ISG.

This transaction will reinforce Capgemini as a business and transformation partner to those enterprises who want to become AI-powered businesses.

Based on calendar year 2024 published information, the combined entities would have generated a revenue of €23.3 billion at a 13.6% operating margin in 2024.

The Group expects accretion to normalized EPS, before synergies from the combination, of 4% in 2026.

Capgemini expects revenue synergies run-rate of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027. Costs and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach an annual pretax run-rate of between €50 million and €70 million by the end of 2027.

With the benefits of these synergies, the accretion on normalized earnings per share should reach 7% in 2027.

WNS and Capgemini have a natural cultural fit and share common values that will facilitate a smooth integration of the teams, helped by the Group’s track record of successful integrations. Furthermore, the integration will be straightforward into Capgemini’s Global Business Services activities.

The contemplated transaction will be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under the laws of Jersey. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Capgemini’s and WNS’ Boards of Directors.

The transaction is subject to approval by the Royal Court of Jersey and WNS’ shareholders, as well as to receipt of customary regulatory approvals and other conditions. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur by the end of the year.

Capgemini has secured a bridge financing of €4.0 billion, covering the purchase of securities ($3.3 billion), as well as the gross debt and similar obligations of around $0.4 billion and the €0.8 billion Capgemini bond redeemed in June 2025.

The Group plans to refinance the bridge with available cash for around €1.0 billion and the balance by debt issuance.

The Group expects Q2 2025 year-on-year growth at constant currency to be slightly better than the -0.4% reported in Q1 2025. The Group also expects for H1 2025 the operating margin to be stable year-on-year at 12.4%.

Due to the nature and timing of this announcement, the actual Q2 and H1 2025 performance may slightly differ from the above-mentioned expectations. H1 2025 publication will take place as planned on July 30, 2025.

Capgemini’s financial targets for 2025 do not take into account this transaction and are therefore unchanged:

To accelerate progress, Nike is implementing a new strategy called “Sport Offense,” which aims to align its teams more closely around sport.
The Sport Offense initiative will refine Nike’s brand positioning in core categories, simplify its product offerings, strengthen its storytelling, and reshape its market approach to drive growth.
In China, Nike supported local basketball culture through the Chinese High School Basketball League and grassroots platform “Next Stop Dongdan.” It also introduced the Nike ST Flare “Blaze,” a basketball shoe tailored for outdoor play.
This year, Nike’s women’s basketball business grew by more than 50%.","Nike has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025, which ended on May 31. The company reported USD 46.3 billion in annual revenue, with USD 11.1 billion generated in the final quarter. Greater China contributed USD 6.585 billion for the year and USD 1.476 billion in the fourth quarter, exceeding market expectations in both cases. On the day the report was published, Nike’s stock rose 15.25%, marking its largest single-day gain in nearly four years and pushing its market capitalization to USD 106.4 billion.

This was the first full-year report since Heidi O’Neill became CEO. While transformation takes time, Nike’s “Win Now” strategy is beginning to yield results. As O’Neill acknowledged, the company’s financial performance met expectations, but not the internal benchmarks it had set. To accelerate progress, Nike is implementing a new strategy called “Sport Offense,” which aims to align its teams more closely around sport.

The Sport Offense initiative will refine Nike’s brand positioning in core categories, simplify its product offerings, strengthen its storytelling, and reshape its market approach to drive growth.

Meanwhile, the numbers suggest that Nike, still one of the most storied names in global sportswear, is leaning into a period of change. Even in a challenging market, it is building momentum for long-term gains.

A difficult challenge, and a meaningful outcome

Just two hours before Nike’s earnings report went live, Faith Kipyegon crossed the finish line at Stade Charlety in Paris. The Kenyan middle distance runner clocked a personal best of 4:06.42, beating her previous record by more than a second. It was her first attempt at the “Breaking4,” a joint initiative with Nike to break the four-minute mile barrier—a feat no woman has ever achieved.

Back in April, Kipyegon and Nike jointly announced an ambitious goal: to break the four-minute mile barrier, a feat no woman has ever accomplished.

Although she did not reach the target, the attempt marked a significant moment. Kipyegon emphasized that no woman had tried before, and she believes it is only a matter of time until the barrier is broken. Her aim is to encourage more women to pursue bold goals without self-imposed limits.

This is not Nike’s first time supporting efforts to test the boundaries of human performance. At the 1984 Summer Olympics, Joan Benoit won the first women’s marathon gold medal. In 2019, Eliud Kipchoge, with Nike’s backing, became the first person to complete a marathon in under two hours. These events reflect Nike’s brand ethos and are backed by dedicated R&D and product design.

Turning the corner

Breaking4 also connects directly to Nike’s broader Win Now strategy. According to O’Neill, the plan emphasizes quick execution to enhance competitiveness by focusing on core categories, simplifying operations, and reigniting growth amid intense competition and changing consumer behavior.

In this fiscal year, Nike has ramped up its focus on running, combining product innovation with storytelling. It revamped its road running shoe lineup to emphasize cushioning, releasing models like the ultra-cushioned Vomero, the support-oriented Structure, and the responsive Pegasus. The Vomero 18 alone generated over USD 100 million in sales within 90 days, suggesting consumers are responding well to the simplified lineup.

On the athlete engagement front, Nike brought Kipchoge to Beijing and Guangzhou as part of a China tour aimed at boosting local marathon participation. At the Tokyo Marathon in March, Chinese runner Zhang Deshun, wearing Nike’s Alphafly 3, recorded a time of 2:20:53, marking the best performance by a Chinese female marathoner since 2007. The result reinforced Nike’s presence in elite running.

Nike’s emphasis on sport isn’t limited to running. It also maintained leadership in basketball. The company launched new signature shoes including Kevin Durant’s KD18 and Ja Morant’s Nike JA3. In China, Nike supported local basketball culture through the Chinese High School Basketball League and grassroots platform “Next Stop Dongdan.” It also introduced the Nike ST Flare “Blaze,” a basketball shoe tailored for outdoor play.

These product and athlete-focused efforts have been matched by backend improvements. Amid a market where brand fatigue is setting in, Nike is leaning on its foundational strengths: innovation and cultural engagement. It also made progress in managing inventory and strengthening retail partnerships.

O’Neill credited these partnerships as essential to Nike’s progress. Retailers reported stronger holiday season orders in North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and APLA (Asia Pacific and Latin America). Inventory levels showed improvement as well, with Nike reducing its lineup of legacy footwear by over 20% for the year and more than 30% in Q4. In Greater China, inventory dropped 11% compared to the previous year.

Nike aims to clear remaining excess inventory through select channels over the next two quarters, with a goal of restoring full channel health by the first half of fiscal 2026.

Targeting new segments and emotional engagement

Nike is investing in emerging growth areas too. Industry observers widely agree that women, children, and outdoor activities remain rare pockets of untapped potential for sportswear brands. The Breaking4 represents Nike’s latest bid to claim leadership in the women’s category.

Historically, women’s distance running has lagged in commercial interest and investment. With this initiative, Nike has placed a world-class female athlete at the center of both its brand storytelling and product innovation, unlocking momentum in a category with vast potential.

In April, Nike also launched the global women’s night run series, the “After Dark Tour,” in Shanghai. Over 3,500 women took part, turning the night into a celebration of performance and empowerment.

Nike continued to build a female-focused narrative during Shanghai Fashion Week in April with the “Victory Lap,” a runway event where athletes, designers, and emerging idols reinterpreted sport through a female lens, fusing function with fashion.

The brand also brought Sabrina Ionescu to China for the first time, where her personal story reportedly resonated with younger female fans. This year, Nike’s women’s basketball business grew by more than 50%.

At the same time, Nike is also tapping into youth culture in China, where emotional resonance often guides purchasing decisions. This quarter, a collaboration with Lego introduced a co-branded collection and interactive retail elements. During the 618 shopping festival, Nike Kids led Tmall’s children’s sneaker and sports categories.

Even before the earnings release, analysts had highlighted Nike’s strong appeal among younger consumers as a potential sign of recovery.

In addition to its focus on women and children, Nike is capitalizing on the growing interest in outdoor apparel. The company recently became the title sponsor of the Chongli 168 Ultra Trail and launched a Nike ACG (All Conditions Gear) training camp to offer runners technical guidance and immersive experiences. The ACG line is gaining traction both globally and in China.

As Nike expands beyond its traditional core, its long-term approach—grounded in innovation, storytelling, and local investment—is paving new paths for growth.

And if the current trajectory holds, Nike may once again defy its doubters. Its legacy, and its spirit of pushing limits, remains central to its strategy. Just as Breaking4 reminds us: dare to dream, no matter how distant the goal.",https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Nike-Run.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 05:58:34.219632

The U.S. Sun reached out to Starbucks for comment on the Employee Benefits & Retention fee.
CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS A LinkedIn post about the coffee giant's new 3% Employee Benefits & Retention fee sparked a debate among Starbucks customers, many of which were disapproving of the charge.
They ""are allowed to set their own prices, establish their own pay and benefits, and are completely separate from Starbucks,"" according to a former Starbucks employee of eight years.","STARBUCKS fans have begun noticing that the coffee giant is tacking on an extra charge to receipts, labeling it an ""Employee Benefits & Retention"" fee.

The 3% fee, bumping up customers' bill totals, has many fans up in arms and complaining about the coffee giant's operations.

High inflation, interest rates, and cost-of-living have all placed pressure on businesses, many of which have raised their prices to increase their profit margin.

Consumers have been forced to shell out more cash over the years for the same goods and services, and many establishments have begun rolling out additional fees to help make ends meet.

Starbucks, for example, has started implementing a ""Employee Benefits & Retention"" fee at select locations.

Customers at the location in the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, for example, are subject to the 3% fee.

The fee is not a corporate-wide charge but rather a localized surcharge implemented by businesses at certain airports.

The extra charge stems from a policy approved by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, permitting airport vendors to add a surcharge of up to 3% on pre-tax sales.

Following the expansion of a minimum wage policy to include automatic annual pay increases, the new Starbucks fee was rolled out to help offset the costs of increased minimum wages and benefits for airport workers.

The new regulations also permit businesses at the airport to hike their prices up to 15% more than at traditional locations, up from the previous 10% cap.

The U.S. Sun reached out to Starbucks for comment on the Employee Benefits & Retention fee.

CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS

A LinkedIn post about the coffee giant's new 3% Employee Benefits & Retention fee sparked a debate among Starbucks customers, many of which were disapproving of the charge.

""This is so dumb. Just list your price. I'll pay it if I want to. Stop being dumb, Starbucks,"" cried one user.

Another Starbucks customer called the 3% charge a ""forced tip,"" complaining that they ""can live without the coffee"" and would rather spend their money elsewhere in the terminal for water or at McDonald's for a cheap coffee.

""I yearn for the European non-tipping and non-customer responsibility for paying the wages of their employees,"" they wrote.

""Oh, hell no!!! This just shows that Starbucks is focused strictly on their profit margin,"" fumed a third shopper.

""Constant turnover already speaks to an employer's priorities, but expecting customers to pay for Starbucks' failure to invest in and retain employees is beyond ridiculous.""

Other fans defended Starbucks itself, arguing that franchised locations such as the one at the airport are not technically owned by the company.

They ""are allowed to set their own prices, establish their own pay and benefits, and are completely separate from Starbucks,"" according to a former Starbucks employee of eight years.

Another LinkedIn user and HR expert delved into the financial implications of the 3% charge, revealing that it would generate a significant profit to be used on worker benefits.

Based on the John F. Kennedy Terminal 5 traffic and industry estimates, they calculated that the 3% fee could bring in approximately $334,880 per year for Starbucks to spend on employee benefits and retention.

""To put that in context: it’s enough to FULLY fund industry-average benefits for 30+ baristas,"" they wrote.

Other establishments have similarly begun tacking on extra fees in an effort to generate a customer-funded pot that can go towards employees.

For example, diners vowed to never eat at a restaurant again after a man checked his receipt to find he was charged an extra ""living wage fee.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/SC-Sbux-Charge-Off-Plat-copy.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 03:58:35.590334

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is approved in Japan, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Taiwan and Korea.

IRVINE, Calif., July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson MedTech, a global leader in cardiac arrhythmia treatment, today announced the launch of the VARIPULSE™ Platform in Asia-Pacific. The platform is used to perform catheter ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular and often rapid heartbeat caused by extra, uncoordinated electrical signals in the atria.x AFib is associated with structural changes in the heart due to underlying conditions and lifestyle factors.x,xi It significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality.

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is the first PFA technology designed to streamline ablation and mapping through a single integrated workflow with the CARTO™ 3 System. This 3D electroanatomical cardiac mapping technology enables real-time visualization and supports precision, efficiency, reproducibility, and procedural accuracy for physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AFib)xii. It enables safe and efficienti,ii,iii,iv,v,vi,vii, patient-centric therapy with minimal to no fluoroscopy exposurexiii,xiv,xv and is compatible with deep and/or conscious sedation.2,xvi,xvii

This innovation is backed by compelling clinical evidence. Both the inspIRE and admIRE clinical trials demonstrated strong safety and effectiveness of the VARIPULSE™ Platform:

In inspIRE, 80% of patients achieved freedom from recurrence with zero primary adverse events.xviii

In admIRE, results showed a 75% overall primary effectiveness success rate3, a 2.9% primary adverse event rate4,xix, 100% of patients achieved acute procedural success5, 43% had same-day discharge, and 25% of procedures were performed without fluoroscopy6.

In the ongoing VARIPURE registry, which included first-time users, there were no serious adverse events and no complications linked to the platform, including zero neurovascular events or coronary spasmsxx.

""The introduction of the VARIPULSE™ Platform in the Asia-Pacific region marks a significant advancement towards our goal of transforming atrial fibrillation care,"" stated Jing Li, Vice President, Electrophysiology & Neurovascular, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, Asia Pacific. ""The adoption of the VARIPULSE™ Platform could demonstrate the unique value of integration with CARTO™ 3D to enhance efficiencies in the workflow of AFib treatment and improve patient outcomes.""

Atrial Fibrillation affects over 16 million people in Asia-Pacificxxi. Symptoms and clinical consequences of AFib disrupt patient's quality of life. The most common symptoms are heart palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, and dizzinessxxii. As a progressive condition, early intervention is critical to reducing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular mortalityxxiii.

Unlike traditional ablation methods that use heat or cold, PFA uses short bursts of energy to affect heart tissue, potentially reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue such as the esophagus, pulmonary veins, and phrenic nerve.

""PFA, as a new type of energy, has the potential to further enhance the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation treatment, which is desirable for patients"" said Dr. Yasuo Okumura7, Professor and Department Head, Vice Hospital Director, Nihon University School of Medicine, Itabashi Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. ""PFA is a relatively new medical technology, and therefore it is important to continue to assess its effectiveness and efficacy in Asia while ensuring proper use. But so far, we know that the integration of PFA technology with 3D mapping enables physicians to review their procedure in detail, and this contributes to quality of healthcare for patients.""

About the VARIPULSE™ Platform

The VARIPULSE™ Platform is Johnson & Johnson MedTech's Pulsed Field ablation system. The fully integrated platform includes the VARIPULSE™ Catheter, TRUPULSE™ Generator, and CARTO™ 3 Mapping System VARIPULSE™ Software.

Jimmy John’s wouldn’t comment on whether more Manitoba shops are coming.","Turkey Tom is prepping for his move to Winnipeg.

Until last year, sandwich chain Jimmy John’s franchises were found solely in the United States. It’s since been expanding within Canada — and at least two locations could open in Winnipeg this fall.

Posters displaying sandwiches — perhaps not the Turkey Tom, but meaty options — plaster 1740 Pembina Hwy. and 1430 Ellice Ave. Both sites were construction zones Monday.

Jimmy John’s stayed mum on details but confirmed “several” eateries are planned. Autumn could bring opening dates, the company shared. It will release more information nationally in upcoming weeks.

Last year, the chain’s parent company, Inspire Brands LLC, announced it would use a franchise model for a Canadian expansion. Just one Canadian location has launched thus far, in Toronto.

“I think this is a good fit for our local community looking for more restaurants,” said Sijie Sun, a University of Manitoba marketing professor.

He asks his students to choose brands they’d like to bring to Winnipeg for a class project; Jimmy John’s is often mentioned, Sun said.

The Illinois-based company started in 1983 with four sandwich types. It now counts more than 2,000 stores and a slate of choices, including “unwiches,” where buns are swapped for lettuce exteriors.

The Winnipeg market will be competitive, Sun noted: Subway, Firehouse Subs and Tim Hortons are among the big sandwich-selling chains already in town.

“If there’s more options, definitely people try the new one,” Sun said, adding brands create loyal customers.

He’s noticed American-born chains advertising local leadership at their Winnipeg hubs as a U.S.-Canada trade war persists. Grocery stores are labelling Canadian products as shoppers turn from U.S. imports.

Jimmy John’s will likely highlight its own connection with Canada, Sun said.

“I think this is a good fit for our local community looking for more restaurants.”–Sijie Sun

“You almost wonder, is this a good time (to come)?” added Wenlong Yuan, the Stu Clark chair in entrepreneurship and innovation at the U of M. “Are they going to be damaged because of this political issue?”

Arby’s and Freddy’s Frozen Custard & Steakburgers locations opened within the past four months, amid a ‘Buy Canadian’ push. Arby’s ran out of meat on its first day due to demand; Freddy’s was met with great anticipation.

It’s “really hard to tell” whether companies are being stunted by a Canada-first sentiment, Yuan stated.

U.S. chains including Krispy Kreme and Firehouse Subs have arrived in Winnipeg over the past 1.5 years. Winnipeg’s size and diverse population can be a draw for businesses wanting to try operating in Canada, Yuan said.

Franchisees may be locals wanting to bring the brand home or they may have experienced Winnipeg via family and friends.

Inspire Brands tapped Foodtastic Inc., a Canadian franchisor, to expand Jimmy John’s across Canada. Inspire Brands houses labels like Arby’s, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings and Dunkin’.

Foodtastic counted more than 1,100 restaurants in January 2024 — the month of the deal’s announcement — and $1.1 billion in sales. The Montreal-based company umbrellas Freshii, Second Cup Café and Pita Pit, among others.

Jimmy John’s Toronto location opened in November 2024. In September and October, the chain unrolled in El Salvador and South Korea.

In Winnipeg, it’s taking a former Urban Barn space off Ellice Avenue.

“I think another restaurant always brings in more people to the area,” said Desiree Rafael, an employee at neighbouring Acuity Vision Care. “If they see that there is an optometry practice by where they’re eating, then maybe they’ll be inclined to come get their eyes checked.”

The Jimmy John’s off Pembina Highway replaces a Macao Imperial Tea.

Jimmy John’s wouldn’t comment on whether more Manitoba shops are coming.

Redberry Restaurants, parent company of sandwich brand Jersey Mike’s Subs, said in January 2024 it aimed to open 300 Canadian locations by 2034. Redberry Restaurants didn’t respond to questions about Winnipeg plans by print deadline.

About The New Terminal One

The New Terminal One at John F. Kennedy International Airport is a bold and exciting project to develop a best-in-class international terminal that will serve as an anchor terminal in the Port Authority's $19 billion transformation of JFK into a global gateway to the New York metropolitan area and the United States. The New Terminal One will set a new standard for design and service, aspiring to obtain a Top 5 Skytrax ranking.

The New Terminal One is being built on sites now occupied by Terminal 1 and the former Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, where it will anchor JFK's south side. Construction is taking place in phases with full completion in 2030. The first phase, including the new arrivals and departures halls and first set of 14 new gates, is expected to open in 2026. At completion in 2030, the New Terminal One, with a total of 23 gates, will be 2.6 million square feet, making it the largest terminal at JFK and nearly the same size as LaGuardia Airport's two new terminals combined.

The New Terminal One consortium of labor, operating, and financial partners is led by Ferrovial, JLC Infrastructure, Ullico, and Carlyle. The New Terminal One is being built by union labor and is committed to local inclusion and labor participation, focusing on diversity and capacity-building opportunities, including a commitment to target participation goals of 20% for minority-owned business enterprises, 10% for women-owned business enterprises, 10% for local business enterprises and 3% for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.

The purchase price of USD $76.50 per share represents a premium of 28% over the average share price in the last 90 days and 17% over the closing price on 3 July 2025. Both firms' boards of directors have unanimously approved the transaction, with closing anticipated by year-end, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

Strategic rationale

According to Capgemini, the acquisition aligns with a growing trend among enterprises looking to transform end-to-end operations using Generative and Agentic AI, especially within business process services (BPS). The combined entity aims to capitalise on what both businesses describe as a paradigm shift from traditional BPS to intelligent, AI-driven operations.

""Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end. Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI. Capgemini's acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations,"" comments Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini. ""Together we will create a leader in Intelligent Operations, uniquely positioned to support organizations in their AI-powered business process transformation, blending the critical capabilities needed from consulting, technology and platforms to deep process and industry expertise. This will address the client needs for Agentic AI-driven process transformation to deliver efficiency and agility through hyper-automation while achieving superior business outcomes. WNS brings to the Group its high growth, margin accretive and resilient Digital Business Process Services, which is the springboard to Intelligent Operations, while further increasing our exposure to the US market. Immediate cross-selling opportunities will be unlocked through the integration of our complementary offerings and clients. I am looking forward to welcoming the WNS global team to Capgemini.""

Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS, also highlighted the significance of integrating AI deeper into operational frameworks:

""As a recognized leader in the Digital Business Process Services space, we see the next wave of transformation being driven by intelligent, domain-centric operations that unlock strategic value for our clients. Organizations that have already digitized are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core—shifting from automation to autonomy,"" said Murugesh. ""By combining our deep domain and process expertise with Capgemini's global reach, cutting-edge Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, a robust partner ecosystem, and advanced technology platforms, we are creating a powerful proposition that accelerates enterprise reinvention. WNS' complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini's rapidly growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors. Just as importantly, our shared values, cultural alignment, and complementary client relationships ensure a seamless integration—unlocking exciting opportunities for innovation, co-creation, and growth across all stakeholder groups.""

Timothy L. Main, Chairman of the WNS Board of Directors, underscored the transaction as a milestone for WNS and cited the opportunities for both clients and employees.

""WNS and Capgemini share a bold, future-focused vision for Intelligent Operations. I'm confident that Capgemini is the ideal partner at the right time in WNS' journey to extend our capabilities, accelerate innovation, and establish a leadership position in this rapidly evolving market,"" said Main. ""This marks a pivotal chapter in WNS' growth—enhancing the resilience and agility of our clients through advanced AI-driven solutions, creating sustained value for our investors, and opening up new avenues for our employees to thrive within a global technology powerhouse.""

Financial impact and integration

On a financial basis, Capgemini has secured bridge financing totalling EUR €4.0 billion, with plans to refinance through available cash and new debt issuance. The deal is projected to be accretive to Capgemini's normalised earnings per share by 4% prior to synergies in 2026, rising to 7% with synergies by 2027. Revenue synergies are estimated between EUR €100 million and €140 million annually by the end of 2027, while cost and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach EUR €50 million to €70 million per year within the same timeframe.

Combined, the two organisations would have generated EUR €23.3 billion in revenue at a 13.6% operating margin in 2024, based on published information.

Capgemini expects the integration to be smooth, citing both companies' shared values and cultural alignment, as well as Capgemini's record of successful past integrations. The merger will further strengthen Capgemini's global business services, especially in the US market where WNS has a strong presence.

Market context and future outlook

WNS, which reported revenues of USD $1,266 million and an 18.7% operating margin in fiscal year 2025, has focused on providing digital-led BPS solutions to clients in eight industries. The company has achieved approximately 9% constant currency revenue growth on average over the last three fiscal years. Capgemini believes that combining WNS's industry-specific expertise with its own consulting and AI capabilities will allow the enlarged group to support organisations seeking end-to-end transformation through advanced technologies and platforms.

Both companies say the acquisition will enable them to address rapidly-growing demand for AI-driven business process redesign, which is increasingly prioritised by enterprises aiming to improve efficiency, agility and business outcomes. With market analysts and Capgemini's clients reportedly recognising the group's leadership in AI and business transformation, the acquisition of WNS is expected to reinforce Capgemini's role as a partner to organisations on similar transformation journeys.",https://channellife.com.au/uploads/story/2025/07/08/compatible_business-professionals-shaking-hands-ai-integration-corporate-acquisition-illustration.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 01:58:20.083774

""You created a movement,"" the post said. ""A movement so powerful that you finally won.""

According to McDonald's, the revamped Snack Wrap includes one of the chain's new McCrispy Strips, which hit menus in May. In the wrap, the strip is topped with shredded lettuce and shredded cheese, and wrapped in a flour tortilla.

Yet, there remains a lack of enthusiasm and emotional draw for affluent consumers.” Note: I am professionally affiliated with ACRC.
These insights require luxury goods brands to reframe their value proposition above the price-value relationship toward a return on worth.
Pamela N. Danziger is an internationally recognized expert specializing in consumer insights for marketers targeting the affluent consumer segment.","The personal luxury goods market faces a decline of up to 5% this year as consumer enthusiasm wanes, according to the latest projections from Bain and Company in association with Altagamma.

Not since the 2008-2009 financial crisis has the luxury market experienced such a significant contraction, except for the 2020 Covid pandemic.

Besides the obvious flashpoints creating uncertainty in the market, including rising geopolitical tensions, currency fluctuations and volatile economic pressures, luxury consumers are disillusioned by the industry’s offerings, particularly after post-pandemic price increases threw a monkey wrench into brands’ traditional price-value relationship.

“There’s a sense of emotional detachment, even among the wealthy, who can’t explain why the same bag that cost $1,200 before now costs $2,000 – prices are too high for such a low level of creativity,” Bain’s senior partner Federica Levato shared with me. “The disillusionment and detachment we talk about is particularly noted among younger consumers.”

Bain’s Macro Overview

Rising luxury consumer detachment was reflected last year, as the luxury market declined 1% at current exchange rates to $418 billion (€364 billion) – or remained flat at constant rates. Yet, most telling was that the luxury market lost some 50 million customers over the last two years. Today, the estimated number of luxury consumers worldwide is approximately 353 million, down from 400 million in 2022.

“This is true alienation, meaning many people are just not buying anymore,” she observed, adding that engagement with luxury brands across all demographics, not just the younger aspirational cohort, has declined since 2022.

Brand-related searches and engagement rates are down more than 40% and social media follower growth has plummeted by 90% – “largely due to price fatigue and stagnant creativity.”

Creative Churn

For an industry that thrives on artistic creativity, the growing churn in luxury brand senior executives and creative directors is taking its toll. Consumers may not be aware of what’s going on behind the curtain, but they see it in the stores and the brands ultimately feel it on their top and bottom line.

“While companies are waiting for a new creative director to introduce a new collection, it can take nine months to a year for the transition – like giving birth to a baby,” Levato explained. “Consumers may not know about the shifts, but they see it when no new products arrive and the brands are totally silent during the transition.”

And she added, “Then there’s also a 50% probability that the new collection doesn’t work, as has been the case for some brands in the recent past.”

Profit Pressure

All this is sinking to luxury brands’ bottom line. Bain notes that since 2021, margins (defined by earnings before interest and taxes) have either stagnated or declined, even among top industry performers, and margins are expected to erode further in 2025.

“All the macroeconomic uncertainties, tariffs, lower traffic, fewer new products – over 70% of luxury brands are pulling back volume from multi-brand retail platforms – have an impact on the topline, but have a more than proportional impact on the bottom line and on the EBIT,” Levato said.

“The message is to some extent is positive because brands are not hitting the brakes on investments in technology, marketing, clienteling and stores, but they still must absorb the costs,” she continued, adding further price increases are probably off the table in the current environment.

Global Luxury Reset

Saying the luxury market faces “far-reaching disruptions,” the Bain report also stresses the industry’s proven resiliency, yet Levato stresses industry players can’t rest on their laurels.

“As the industry faces an increasingly complex global landscape, luxury brands are entering a pivotal new chapter – one that demands sharper focus, greater cultural relevance, and growth rooted in purpose.

“At the heart of this transformation is a redefinition of value and meaning that resonates across all generations – with those shaping luxury today, and those who will define it tomorrow,” she observed.

U.S. Luxury Consumers On Hold

Because the U.S. is the world’s richest market – last year 1,000 new millionaires were minted here each day, totaling nearly 400,000, and more than half of all new millionaires globally – and the largest personal luxury market by far – the Americas totaled about $115 billion last year with the lion’s share in the U.S., compared to $51 billion in Mainland China – what happens here will have a profound impact on the global personal luxury market overall.

According to the Affluent Consumer Research Company’s May luxury tracking survey, luxury consumer fatigue is measurable. Specifically, 52% of the roughly 200 affluent Americans with incomes of $250,000 and above reported being disappointed with luxury options, and 46% were unable to justify new purchases.

But most telling is that among those affluents who tend to opt for the luxury option most often, 55% said they’re bidding their time, and the same 55% share signaled that the available options simply do not move them.

“Purchase hesitation isn’t one-size-fits-all,” observed ACRC’s founder and CEO Chandler Mount. “At the top of the market, it’s not about affordability – it’s about emotional resonance. They’re bidding their time, a signal of flexibility, not resistance. Yet, there remains a lack of enthusiasm and emotional draw for affluent consumers.” Note: I am professionally affiliated with ACRC.

While Americans wait for luxury goods brands to present more compelling options, Bain reports that the luxury experiences market, including hospitality, fine dining, cruising and private jets, is “flourishing,” as consumers prioritize meaningful experiences over goods, particularly among older consumers, where wealth tends to accumulate.

Personal Transformation Is The Goal, Not More Stuff

At its core, luxury is a cultural construct rooted in personal meaning, social status, and an expression of self-worth. While owning an abundance of luxury goods can confer some of those advantages, increasingly affluent and high-net-worth individuals are turning luxury expression inward toward personal growth and well-being.

This cultural shift in consumer consciousness has profound implications for the goods side of the luxury market. “This isn’t a trend – it’s a complete reconstruction of how success is defined by the world’s most affluent and influential consumers,” said Mark Miller, chief strategy officer at Publicis Groupe’s Team One agency. “It’s a shift from building high-net-worth to pursuing high-life-worth.”

He was speaking about Team One’s latest study entitled “Worth Beyond Wealth,” based upon research among its exclusive Global Affluent Collective. The collective represents the top 10% of global earnings across 22 countries and totals some 4,200 consumers aged 25 and above.

“The most provocative finding is how they’ve moved beyond asking ‘What do I own?’ to ‘Who am I becoming?’ This transformation demands an entirely new approach from premium brands,” he continued.

Emerging Values

Findings that popped in the study, which combined both qualitative and quantitative research, include:

Prioritizing emotional fulfillment and human connection through key life moments defined by meaningful connections (89%) and relationships that elevate their lives (90%).

Pursuit of growth and discovery with continuous learning their ultimate luxury (95%) and 75% defining personal growth as life’s most significant moments.

Belief that status is earned through being knowledgeable and respected rather than through possessions (88%).

This shift toward pursuit of high-life-worth through meaningful experiences requires luxury goods brands adapt to a new “return on worth” price-value framework. Miller described this as a selective abundance approach, where people with means will spend abundantly on things that have special worth and save abundantly, i.e. trade down, in purchases that are substitutable or replaceable.

“There’s a strong need in this world of selective abundance for luxury goods brands to not just make things that are functionally excellent – consumers will know the difference – but to offer a value proposition that goes above and beyond the functional things they make,” he explained, stressing the need for greater high-life-worth storytelling, rather than relying on product features, benefits, brand heritage, design and quality.

“Luxury is no longer only about having exceptional things – it’s about integrating excellence with impact. The best premium brands won’t just sell luxury – they’ll help architect high-worth lives,” shared Tahni Candelaria, Team One’s director of cultural anthropology.

Miller added, “Luxury isn’t just about possessions anymore. It’s about acquiring the learning and relationships to become a more evolved version of who I aspire to be over time.”

Value Beyond Money

While the Bain study acknowledges some of this – “Across generations, drivers linked with self-reward, status, personal identity and the celebration of achievements will continue to drive engagement, reinforcing and building the lasting relevance of luxury with the consumers’ lives,” Claudia D’Arpizio said in a statement – Team One’s perspective pushes the concepts of luxury as self-reward, status, personal identity and celebrating achievements further toward value beyond what money can buy.

Less than two years ago, BermudAir launched service between Bermuda and Boston, with a fleet of two ex-Flybe Embraer E175 jets. The carrier now serves 10 destinations across the U.S. east coast, operating two E175s and two E190s.

The Bermudan carrier has since announced the launch of its subsidiary carrier, AnguillAir, which will operate seasonal flights from Anguilla (AXA) to both Baltimore (BWI) and Boston (BOS). Flights will operate twice weekly, starting on December 19 and 20, 2025, respectively. The winter service is expected to wrap up in early April 2026.

AnguillAir will have their own branded aircraft and respective marketing identity, but will still be part of BermudAir’s operations, rather than operating entirely as a separate airline. I’m no expert at aviation law, but I suspect it might be easier for them to keep operations streamlined, and maybe the fact that both Anguilla and Bermuda being U.K. overseas territories might make it easier for them to climb any regulatory hurdles.

“This is more than a new route – it’s a reflection of what BermudAir was built to do: strengthen island connections, deliver extraordinary service, and create lasting economic value for Bermuda and beyond,” said Adam Scott, Founder and CEO of BermudAir. “We’re proud that, because of the support of Bermudians and the growth in tourism demand, we are now able to extend our reach and share our island hospitality with Anguilla.”

On the flip side, BermudAir also announced that its Providence (PVD) and Ft. Lauderdale (FLL) flights will be suspended. It’s unclear if they will return to PVD, but plan to resume Ft. Lauderdale service only in the winter periods.

While Anguilla currently has some connectivity throughout the Caribbean, they only have two daily flights between the island and Miami (MIA), Florida. This will be a great boost for Anguilla’s travel market, but could also open the possibility of offering more non-U.S. connectivity to Anguilla in the long run.

It’s not clear either if they plan to acquire more aircraft, or if they will rebrand one of their current BermudAir jets for the period.",https://www.gatechecked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bermudair-embraer-e175.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 21:01:12.338731

When the acquisition closes, it’s expected to position Capgemini as a leader in digital business process services, blending WNS’ horizontal and vertical expertise with a global footprint.
Capgemini and WNS already dabble in intelligent operations.
Capgemini offers consulting-led transformation of business processes, advanced AI tools and BPS platforms, while WNS has built a number of industry-specific BPS offerings.
“The key driver is less to do with the tools and software, but rather the access to business process operations expertise that WNS brings to the table,” Ranjan told Computerworld.","French technology consulting services giant Capgemini SE said today it has agreed to buy the Indian business process automation firm WNS Holdings Ltd. in a $3.3 billion cash deal, as part of an effort to expand the range of artificial intelligence tools it can offer to customers.

The acquisition will enable Capgemini to create a consulting service that’s focused on helping companies boost business process and cost efficiency through the use of generative AI and agentic AI technology.

Capgemini said it’s buying WNS for $76.50 per share, which represents a 17% premium over its last closing price on July 3. The deal does not include WNS’ financial debt.

WNS, which is based in India and specializes in business process outsourcing and data analytics, will bring its “high growth, margin accretive and resilient Digital Business Process Services while further increasing our exposure to the U.S. market,” said Capgemini Chief Executive Aiman Ezzat.

WNS counts major customers including Coca-Cola Co., T-Mobile USA Inc. and United Airlines Inc. When the acquisition closes, it’s expected to position Capgemini as a leader in digital business process services, blending WNS’ horizontal and vertical expertise with a global footprint. The two companies generated combined revenues in digital BPS of more than $1.9 billion.

One of the largest opportunities for companies to create value with generative AI and AI agents is said to be in the redesign of business processes and operations. This is likely to attract a significant amount of AI investment budgets, as the technology promises to transform organizations into AI-powered companies with dramatically increased productivity through a new type of service known as intelligent operations.

Intelligent operations is a consulting-led approach that aims to transform horizontal and vertical business processes with AI agents and generative AI, seeking to improve companies’ efficiency, speed and agility and improve business outcomes through process automation.

Capgemini and WNS already dabble in intelligent operations. Capgemini offers consulting-led transformation of business processes, advanced AI tools and BPS platforms, while WNS has built a number of industry-specific BPS offerings.

Capgemini said the addition of WNS will act like a catalyst, transforming it into an intelligent operations leader, with both the required scale and unique capabilities ranging from strategy and transformation to horizontal and vertical sector expertise.

“The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities,” Ezzat said in a statement. “It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.”

Forrester Research Inc. analyst Charlie Dai told Computerworld that hybrid automation and agentic AI will be major priorities for enterprise decision makers in the next three years. He said WNS’s domain-specific AI agents and platforms such as its AI.Agentic suite and WNS Expirus will substantially improve Capgemini’s own agent-focused BPS offerings.

There’s also a strategic angle to the acquisition, said Everest Group Managing Partner Rajesh Ranjan. He pointed out that agentic AI is still a nascent technology, and that most implementations up until now are pilot projects.

“The key driver is less to do with the tools and software, but rather the access to business process operations expertise that WNS brings to the table,” Ranjan told Computerworld. “This is a pre-requisite to develop and deploy real-world AI solutions.”

Capgemini said it expects the acquisition to be finalized by the end of the year, adding that it will be immediately accretive to both its revenue and its operating margin.

The markets didn’t react too kindly to the news, though. Capgemini’s stock fell 5% on Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index, as analysts from Morgan Stanley warned that the acquisition would have a negative effect on its balance sheet flexibility, without adding any significant revenue boost.

Franklin St. Starbucks voted 14-1 in favor of unionization, joining Starbucks Workers United, a national worker-led unionizing effort.
Store employees have also dealt with numerous safety issues.
“Our store is considered a high incidence store,” Washburne said.
So, the manager took it to Starbucks corporate, which resulted in security guards being temporarily implemented at the store, Washburne said.
The security guards were phased out after a few months and are no longer stationed at the store, Washburne said.","On June 30, workers at the 100 E. Franklin St. Starbucks voted 14-1 in favor of unionization, joining Starbucks Workers United, a national worker-led unionizing effort.

Earlier in June, the store’s baristas and shift supervisors sent a letter to upper management stating their intent to unionize, and they later read the letter aloud to the store manager and customers.

“We are not writing to ask for favors,” the letter said. “We are writing to demand dignity.”

The letter, addressed to Brian Niccol, Starbucks’ CEO, discussed the workers’ reasons for unionization, including reduced raises, unsustainable workloads and unsafe working conditions..

Unionization had been discussed previously without coming to fruition, Alexandria Washburne, a shift supervisor who has worked for Starbucks for six years, said. What specifically prompted this petition was a discussion with the store’s manager regarding availability, she said.

“[The store manager] told us in a shift meeting that we would either open our availability for one day — open-to-close Saturday or Sunday — or we could demote ourselves or we could transfer to a store that could accommodate our availability,” Washburne said.

Matthew Wynne, a shift supervisor who has worked for Starbucks for six years, said he had his availability and time-off requests denied several times in a row, an experience shared by multiple baristas at the store.

Store employees have also dealt with numerous safety issues. Wynne said that the store has called the police more than 100 times in the past year.

“Our store is considered a high incidence store,” Washburne said. “That's what they call it in the Starbucks language, meaning we have a lot of, I guess, ‘incidents,’ quote, unquote, that occur in the store.”

Employees said they have seen a man choking a woman outside the store, faced harassment from customers and witnessed someone stabbing a person’s hand with a pen in the store.

In response to the stabbing, the store’s previous manager asked the district manager to implement security guards. The district manager denied the request, Wynne said. So, the manager took it to Starbucks corporate, which resulted in security guards being temporarily implemented at the store, Washburne said.

The security guards were phased out after a few months and are no longer stationed at the store, Washburne said. She said employees received no communication from management regarding the guards’ removal.

“It just makes you feel unsafe to be at work in those situations,” Washburne said. “We're supposed to be making lattes, not breaking up fights.”

Ethan Gulledge, a barista at the Starbucks, said the policies of the Back to Starbucks plan — a corporate plan emphasizing policies like a dress code and writing on cups in order to revitalize the chain — have led to more upset customers.

“With this new policy of asking everybody if they've made a purchase to get the free water, people don't necessarily respond well to that when they're used to getting free water,” Gulledge said.

Gulledge said these policies are not feasible when the store experiences a high volume of customers, which can reach up to 160 people in half an hour.

The union prevents Starbucks from firing employees for union-related activities and secures employees’ right to collective bargaining and having union representatives.

“Any conversation that's going to have the result of disciplinary action, we have the right to have a representative there to bargain or argue for us,” Gulledge said.

Starbucks has not discussed the union’s contract in good faith, and a contract will not be signed until the company does so, Wynne said. Employees will not have to pay dues until a contract is signed, he said.

“This win shows that when partners come together and speak up, we can't be ignored,” Wynne said. “We didn't vote for this union just to make noise. We voted because we're tired of being mistreated and left out of the decisions that affect our lives in our day-to-day workplace.”

Shares of WNS (Holdings) soared by over 14 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange in the morning session on Monday. Institutional investors hold around 90 per cent stake in WNS.

The acquisition will expand Capgemini’s capabilities in Digital BPS and Intelligent Operations. With investments in AI and strategic partnerships with Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI, and NVIDIA, Capgemini reported over euro 900 million in Gen AI bookings in 2024. The combined entity would have generated euro 23.3 billion in revenue with a 13.6 per cent operating margin in 2024, including euro 1.9 billion in Digital BPS revenue.

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat said the acquisition positions the group to lead in Intelligent Operations, blending consulting, technology, platforms, and deep industry expertise. WNS CEO Keshav R. Murugesh echoed the sentiment, noting the shift from automation to autonomy as clients seek to embed AI into their operating models.

To finance the deal, Capgemini has secured bridge financing of euro 4 billion, covering the purchase price, WNS’s gross debt, and the redemption of a euro 0.8 billion bond due in June 2025. It plans to refinance the bridge through a mix of existing cash and new debt issuance.

This acquisition comes a decade after Capgemini acquired Igate, another India-based IT company, for $4 billion. The WNS deal underscores India's growing importance in Capgemini's global strategy. Over 44,000 of WNS' 65,000 employees are based in India. WNS, founded in 1996 and listed on NYSE, counts United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica and McCain Foods among its key customers. It was initially established as a captive business process and back-office unit of British Airways. In 2002, Warburg Pincus acquired a majority stake, leading to WNS becoming an independent entity. WNS will add $1.2 billion to Capgemini's revenue of about 22.1 billion euro last fiscal. The two will have an operating margin of about 13.6%. Capgemini will acquire WNS for a cash consideration of $76.5 per share, reflecting a premium of 17% over the closing price on July 3. Explaining the rationale of the acquisition, Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat said enterprises are rapidly adopting generative AI and agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end, and business process services will be the showcase for agentic AI. The acquisition, he said, will ""provide the group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations. "" Keshav R Murugesh, CEO of WNS, said, ""By combining our domain and process expertise with Capgemini's global reach, cutting-edge GenAI and agentic AI capabilities, a robust partner ecosystem, and advanced technology platforms, we are creating a powerful proposition that accelerates enterprise reinvention. WNS' complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini's rapidly growing business services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors. "" WNS has delivered an average constant currency revenue growth of over 9% over the past three fiscal years, reaching $1.2 billion in revenue in the 2025 financial year with an operating margin of 18.7%. The transaction will position Capgemini as one of the key players in digital BPS.

KG.","Fast fashion giant H&M and Remondis, a partner of global logistics specialist Rhenus Group, have founded Looper Textile & Co., an independent company in which they each hold 50 percent that collects, sorts and sends post-consumer textiles for reuse and recycling.

Looper Textile has been operational since 2023, but is ready to work on an industrial scale and process up to 150 million garments per year and send them for reuse and recycling.

The company is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and operates through three sorting facilities in Europe-two in Germany, in Hamburg and Polch, and one in Poland in Pila.

Garments are sorted into more than 200 categories, based on material and type of product. In 2023, Looper helped extend the useful life of more than 40 million garments. By 2024, the number has risen to more than 72 million garments, of which 65% are destined for reuse, 25% are sent for recycling, and less than 10% disposed of responsibly due to contamination.

“The need for textile collection and sorting solutions has never been more urgent, and Looper is uniquely positioned to generate concrete change,” says Erik Lagerblad, CEO, Looper Textile Co.

""Used textiles represent one of the largest material flows in the world. That's why we rely on digital solutions and our experience in the circular economy to efficiently coordinate the volumes collected. With an operational capacity of up to 150 million garments per year, Looper Textile stands as a key player in the sustainable management of textile streams globally. Together, we want to bring the sustainable use of textiles into the future,"" said Simon Bodmer, head of the Logistics Department at Remondis Recycling GmbH & Co. KG.

Among the services offered to support the initiative, the Rhenus Group provides advanced logistics solutions and services such as centralized coordination of transportation flows, end-to-end supply chain visibility, and implementation of a 4PL digital Control Tower, custom-designed to meet the specific needs of circular textile logistics.

The system was custom-designed to meet the specific needs of the circular economy, making it possible to reuse and recycle textiles through smooth coordination among all stakeholders.

“Our 4PL Control Tower provides a central platform for the integrated and coordinated management of all logistics activities, increasing visibility along the entire value chain,” explains Chris Gerfertz, managing global director, Rhenus 4PL Solutions.

Looper has also started a pilot line for automated sorting based on optical and infrared sensor technologies to meet the increasingly precise requirements of textile-to-textile recycling.

The Rhenus Group is a global logistics specialist, with annual sales of €8.2 billion. It has more than 41,000 active employees in 1,330 locations in more than 70 countries, and develops innovative solutions along the entire supply chain including activities such as transportation, warehousing, customs clearance or value-added services.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics as well as Japan's Daikin and Tata's Voltas have also brought suits, which are set to be heard by the High Court of Delhi on Tuesday. All of the companies are seeking to have the rules quashed.

India is the third-biggest generator of electronic waste behind China and the U.S., but the government says only 43% of the country's e-waste last year was recycled.

Modi's government in September fixed a floor price that electronics makers must pay recyclers, which manufacturers argue is roughly three to four times higher than what they paid earlier.

In a 380-page court filing dated June 3, which has not been disclosed publicly, Carrier said recyclers were willing to continue their work at the older prices and the government should not interfere in private dealings between companies and recyclers.

""The burden of the benefit being given to the recyclers has been put on the producers, which is unfair and arbitrary,"" said submissions by Carrier Airconditioning & Refrigeration which were reviewed by Reuters.

The submissions added that the rules will impose a ""huge financial burden"" on the company.

Carrier did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

India's Ministry of Environment also did not respond to Reuters queries. It has previously argued in court that the pricing rules are needed to ensure proper waste disposal and were a ""reasonable"" intervention.

The new rules mandate a minimum payment of 22 rupees per kilogram to recycle consumer electronics. Such rates are still lower than levels in the U.S where they are up to five times higher, according to research firm Redseer.

Carrier reported sales of $248 million in India last year, its highest level since at least the financial year ending March 2020.

Still, tariffing imports from South Korea, America's sixth-largest trading partner, is particularly galling.
For starters, that's because the new tariffs seem to violate an existing trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea.
That deal, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, was signed in 2007 by President George W. Bush and implemented in 2012.
It's also silly because Trump himself signed a renegotiated version of that same trade deal in 2018.","If you still believe there is some overarching goal—new trade deals, negotiating for lower trade barriers, or whatever—to the Trump administration's trade policy agenda, Monday's announcement of new tariffs targeting imports from South Korea ought to put an end to all that.

South Korea was not the only country whose goods were hit with higher tariffs on Monday, nor does it seem likely to be the last. President Donald Trump also announced higher tariffs targeting imports from Japan, Myanmar, Laos, South Africa, Kazakhstan, and Malaysia. The White House indicated that Trump will be sending letters to other countries in the coming days announcing various tariff rates. This is, in effect, a slow-motion repeat of the ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcements that were put on hold for 90 days in early April after the markets reacted negatively to those announcements.

Still, tariffing imports from South Korea, America's sixth-largest trading partner, is particularly galling. If Trump's goal here is to strike deals that will lower foreign barriers to American exports and deliver better trading conditions for American manufacturers (who rely on imports), then hiking tariffs on South Korea makes startlingly little sense.

For starters, that's because the new tariffs seem to violate an existing trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea. That deal, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, was signed in 2007 by President George W. Bush and implemented in 2012. Under the terms of the deal, about 95 percent of the goods traded between the two countries are imported tariff-free. Among other things, that deal put an end to high South Korean tariffs on American cars and light trucks, which has boosted American exports and U.S. auto manufacturing jobs.

On the whole, the deal has been good for both countries. Bilateral trade between the U.S. and South Korea expanded nearly 70 percent in the first 10 years that the deal was in place. As The Heritage Foundation noted in 2022, the deal was particularly good for American farmers (who saw exports to South Korea hit record highs) and for foreign investment in American industries (South Korean investment in the U.S. nearly tripled during the deal's first decade in force).

Some Trump allies might argue that the current president has no obligation to respect deals signed by the Bush administration. That's silly, of course, since incoming presidents are expected to respect trade deals made by their predecessors. Indeed, if not for that expectation, trade deals would provide little long-term certainty for businesses in either country, as they could always be voided after the next election.

It's also silly because Trump himself signed a renegotiated version of that same trade deal in 2018. The so-called KORUS 2.0 rolled back some of the free trade provisions in the original deal—most notably, it limited exports of Korean steel to the U.S. and postponed a planned elimination of the U.S. tariff on imported light trucks.

Still, it was mostly ""a minor tweak"" to the previous deal, as the Cato Institute termed it at the time.

Trump called the reworked deal ""fair and reciprocal"" and said it was ""a historic milestone in trade.""

Now, less than seven years later, he's effectively torn up that deal. Or he's pretending that it never existed (or he forgot about it).

So, here's the question: What is the White House hoping to accomplish with this latest maneuver?

If the goal is to lower tariffs across the board, then KORUS already did that. If the goal is to increase American exports to foreign countries by getting them to lower their trade barriers, then KORUS has already done that too. If the goal is to allow Trump to renegotiate the supposedly flawed trade deals from previous generations of American leaders, then KORUS 2.0 did that.

And, of course, if the goal is to strike more deals with more countries—as the White House keeps claiming—then this seems to be a step in the wrong direction. What other leader will be willing to negotiate seriously with this administration, knowing full well that it does not respect the deals it reaches?",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/07/polspphotos582950-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 18:07:22.090756

In short, Merit Medical's shift in leadership and Q2 momentum are positive signs, but investors must weigh the risks of overvaluation against the promise of execution.","The appointment of Martha Aronson as CEO of Merit Medical Systems (NASDAQ: MMS) marks a pivotal moment for the 38-year-old medical device manufacturer. Aronson's deep healthcare leadership experience—spanning roles at Ecolab, Hill-Rom, and Medtronic—aligns neatly with Merit's current priorities: expanding its portfolio through acquisitions, navigating regulatory approvals, and sustaining growth in a price-competitive medtech sector. Meanwhile, preliminary Q2 2025 revenue guidance of $380–384 million (up 12–14% YoY) signals momentum that could position the company for sustained value creation—if execution meets expectations.

Leadership Transition: A Smooth Handoff or Risky Bet?

Aronson succeeds founder Fred Lampropoulos, who remains as chairman, a move that aims to blend institutional knowledge with fresh strategic vision. Lampropoulos built Merit into a global leader in interventional medical devices, but the industry has evolved. Today's medtech landscape demands agility in M&A, regulatory compliance, and cost management—areas where Aronson's background stands out.

Her prior roles at Ecolab and Hill-Rom involved leading large-scale operations and international expansions, which may prove critical as Merit integrates its $120 million acquisition of Biolife Delaware L.L.C. That deal, completed earlier this year, is expected to add $10–11 million in annual revenue and improve margins by streamlining product offerings. Aronson's experience in scaling operations could accelerate the integration's success, a key near-term catalyst.

Q2 Guidance: A Strong Start, but What Lies Ahead?

The preliminary Q2 revenue figures—12–14% growth on a reported basis, 11–13% on a constant currency basis—reflect robust demand for Merit's core interventional devices. This outperformance in a quarter where many medtech peers are grappling with reimbursement pressures and pricing wars is notable. The company's reaffirmed full-year guidance of $1.48–1.50 billion in revenue (9–11% growth) suggests confidence in its execution.

The Biolife acquisition's contribution to 2025 revenue and its promised margin improvements by 2026 are critical to sustaining this trajectory. Additionally, the Health Canada approval of the WRAPSODY device opens a new revenue stream, with its WAVE trial demonstrating superior outcomes. Piper Sandler analysts highlighted this as a “key differentiator” in vascular access markets, though they noted the need for consistent quarterly results to maintain confidence.

Valuation and Risks: Is the Premium Warranted?

Merit's stock trades at a premium valuation relative to its peers, with a trailing P/E of ~25x and a price-to-sales ratio of 2.1x. This reflects investors' optimism about its long-term growth, but the question remains: Does the current valuation account for execution risks?

The Canaccord Genuity price target hike to $112 (from $108) and Piper Sandler's $110 target suggest Wall Street sees upside in Aronson's leadership and the Biolife synergies. However, risks loom large. Sector-wide pricing pressures—particularly in the U.S. hospital market—could crimp margins, while Merit's reliance on a few key products (e.g., its vascular access tools) leaves it vulnerable to regulatory setbacks or competitive innovations.

Moreover, recent insider sales—though attributed to M&A timing—could spook investors if not paired with consistent earnings beats. The July 30 Q2 results will be a critical test: missing estimates could reignite concerns about the premium multiple.

Investment Takeaway: Buy the Dip, or Wait for Clarity?

Merit Medical presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to a medtech firm with a strong balance sheet (current ratio of 4.87) and near-term catalysts. Aronson's track record and the strategic moves under her watch—Biolife integration, WRAPSODY commercialization—suggest the company is positioned to capitalize on its strengths.

Historical data reinforces this perspective: since 2022, MMS has averaged a 0.37% return in the days following earnings releases, with a 50% win rate over three and ten-day periods, though this moderates to 42.86% over 30 days. This short-term outperformance aligns with the article's emphasis on the July 30 earnings as a catalyst for upward momentum, though investors should anticipate potential volatility beyond the immediate post-report period.

The stock's premium valuation leaves little room for error. Investors should consider buying on dips below $95, with a focus on the July 30 results as a key milestone. For long-term holders, Merit's potential to expand margins through acquisitions and innovation could justify the premium—if execution meets expectations. However, the broader medtech sector's challenges—pricing pressures, regulatory uncertainty—demand caution.

In short, Merit Medical's shift in leadership and Q2 momentum are positive signs, but investors must weigh the risks of overvaluation against the promise of execution. Stay tuned to the earnings call and margin improvements in 2026 for clarity.",,N,,2025-07-07 19:04:02.199818

What’s the newest addition to McDonald’s breakfast menu?

READER'S DIGEST, COURTESY MCDONALD'S

Get ready to turn up the heat—McDonald’s is rolling out their all-new Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches, and they’re every bit as bold as they sound. Picture this: melty cheese, a freshly cracked egg, savory Canadian bacon and what McDonald’s calls “a perfectly towered and buttered English muffin.”

Now here’s the summer-hot twist: Each sandwich gets a kick from McDonald’s signature Spicy Pepper Sauce. And that’s not all—spice lovers can also sink their teeth into the Spicy Sausage McMuffin and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

According to McDonald’s, “Whether you’re fueling up for a morning marathon of meetings or just need something delicious to kickstart your day, these breakfast sandwiches deliver big, bold flavors.”

When will the Spicy McMuffin be available?

Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches will launch on July 8. They’ll be available at select locations nationwide, so be sure to check in with your local Golden Arches to see if they’re part of the initial roll-out.

How are people reacting to the news?

McDonald’s fans on Reddit have already started commenting about the upcoming McDonald’s menu additions. Some love that the new Spicy McMuffin breakfast sandwiches have the same sauce as other Mickey D’s menu favorites, with one Reddit user saying, “I love the sauce from the Spicy McCrispy, and I love the Sausage, Egg and Cheese McMuffin (the most perfect breakfast sandwich), so this is good enough for me.”

Under food reviewer Snackolator’s Instagram post about the news, one McDonald’s regular commented that their “stomach is bubblin with excitement,” while others are calling for more spicy menu items, specifically a spicy Chicken McGriddle.

How long will the Spicy McMuffin be sticking around?

We don’t know for sure. McDonald’s does, however, describe the drop as “a limited-time glow-up,” stating on their website: “Just like your social media stories, the Spicy McMuffin won’t last forever.” So don’t wait too long to try a Spicy McMuffin. It might just be the spicy start you need to get through the day.

After the Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257 was reviewed, a potential issue was detected involving the lithium-ion battery cell, which was sourced from a single vendor. Costco noted that the likelihood of a malfunction is minimal, but the company has decided to initiate a global voluntary recall of several models.

The Anker PowerCore 10000 power bank (Model A1263) also underwent a voluntary recall, issued by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), due to concerns about the lithium-ion batteries inside the product.

Final Verdict: Buy the Dip, but Monitor Closely Barclays' leadership reshuffle and APAC focus present a compelling value proposition.","Barclays, the UK-based banking giant, is undergoing a dramatic transformation. By reshaping its leadership and doubling down on high-growth sectors in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, the bank aims to reignite shareholder value. Recent moves—including the appointment of co-CEOs and sector specialists—suggest Barclays is positioning itself to capitalize on tech, infrastructure, and green finance opportunities while slashing costs. But can this pivot turn the tide for a stock that has languished behind peers? Let's explore.

The Leadership Overhaul: A Blend of Tech and Global Banking Expertise

Barclays' most significant shift is the elevation of Craig Bright and Anne Marie Darling as Group Co-Chief Operating Officers and Barclays Execution Services Co-Chief Executive Officers. This dual leadership structure merges two critical strengths:

- Craig Bright, formerly Group CIO, brings 30 years of tech expertise, having spearheaded digital transformation across consumer and wholesale banking. His focus on cloud infrastructure and AI integration aligns with Barclays' push into high-margin tech financing.

- Anne Marie Darling, a Goldman Sachs veteran with 25 years in global sales and execution services, adds depth to cross-border client relationships—a linchpin for success in APAC's fragmented markets.

Together, they are tasked with streamlining operations to reduce costs by £2 billion by 2026. This includes slashing the cost-to-income ratio to the “high 50s” from 67% in 2024. Initial results are promising: Q1 2025 pre-tax profits rose 19% to £2.7 billion, with the investment bank hitting a 16% ROE, its highest in years.

APAC and Middle East: The New Growth Frontier

Barclays is betting big on Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, where infrastructure spending and green finance are booming. Key leadership appointments include:

- Avinash Thakur, Head of APAC Investment Banking, who will spearhead M&A and debt financing in markets like India and Singapore.

- Ee-Ching Tay, now Head of APAC M&A, expanding her role in Southeast Asia.

- Arun Saigal and Pramod Kumar in India, focusing on energy transition projects and corporate financing.

These hires reflect a strategic focus on sectors with stable margins and growth potential:

1. Tech and Infrastructure: Supporting deals like data centers and smart cities.

2. Green Finance: Advising on renewable energy projects, such as offshore wind farms in the North Sea and solar investments in India.

3. Middle East Ties: Leveraging Dubai and Abu Dhabi's role as hubs for energy and tech investments.

Barclays' shares have lagged peers, trading at a P/E of 7.73—far below UK banks' average of ~10. This undervaluation creates an entry point if APAC strategies deliver market share gains.

Risks and the Case for Caution

Debt Exposure: Barclays' debt-to-equity ratio of 1.45 remains elevated, requiring careful management amid rising interest rates.

Execution Risk: APAC's regulatory complexity could delay profit growth. For instance, Pramod Kumar's Vice Chairman role in India is pending regulatory approval.

Geopolitical Headwinds: U.S.-China trade tensions and Middle East political risks could disrupt corporate financing pipelines.

The Investment Thesis: A Value Play with Catalysts

Barclays' stock trades at a 3.84% dividend yield, offering income stability while growth strategies play out. Analysts like Morgan Stanley have raised price targets to 350 GBp, implying a ~20% upside from current levels. Key catalysts include:

1. APAC Market Share Growth: Success in winning mandates for tech IPOs or green infrastructure deals.

2. Cost Cuts Delivering ROE Targets: Achieving a 14% ROE by 2026 would re-rate the stock significantly.

3. Debt Reduction Progress: Improving leverage metrics could attract risk-averse investors.

Final Verdict: Buy the Dip, but Monitor Closely

Barclays' leadership reshuffle and APAC focus present a compelling value proposition. The stock's undervaluation, dividend yield, and potential for margin expansion make it a speculative buy for investors willing to ride near-term volatility. However, success hinges on executing its cost-cutting and capturing market share in high-growth sectors. Monitor Q3 2025 results for progress on APAC revenue and cost savings.

If Barclays hits its 14% ROE target, its valuation could align with peers, unlocking ~40% upside. For now, this is a high-risk, high-reward bet—but one worth considering in a diversified portfolio.

Investment Grade: BB (Speculative)

The move sparked outrage from the Teamsters union, which represents roughly 340,000 UPS workers.
The Teamsters accused UPS of violating their national contract and trying to ""weasel"" out of commitments to create new full-time union jobs.
UPS drivers are among the highest paid in the country, with strong retirement perks under the union contract.
He added that ""she’s not gonna push around the Teamsters.” UPS previously offered buyouts to corporate-level employees in 2020 to trim payroll.","UPS is taking heat over a dramatic move that could shrink its delivery force, and possibly the number of trucks on the road.

The company is under fire as workers brace for what could be a drastic reduction in deliveries across the country.

UPS is offering buyouts to full-time drivers for the first time in its 117-year history.

The program, quietly rolled out Thursday, comes as executives cite “an unprecedented business landscape"" in a new statement.

UPS, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, said drivers could voluntarily leave the company in exchange for a financial package.

The move sparked outrage from the Teamsters union, which represents roughly 340,000 UPS workers.

“Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out,” Teamsters President Sean M. O’Brien said in a statement.

The Teamsters accused UPS of violating their national contract and trying to ""weasel"" out of commitments to create new full-time union jobs.

“UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts,” O’Brien said.

Under the 2023 contract, UPS agreed to create 22,500 full-time positions and add another 7,500 over the final three years of the deal.

The union claims UPS's proposed Driver Voluntary Severance Plan (DVSP) threatens those job guarantees.

It also warns the program could strip retirees of key benefits, including health insurance.

UPS drivers are among the highest paid in the country, with strong retirement perks under the union contract.

“UPS Teamsters work too damn hard to be treated with such disrespect,” O’Brien added.

According to UPS, the buyout is optional and won't impact existing retirement packages, including pensions and healthcare.

Each driver would ""have the ability to decide if this voluntary program is beneficial to their family,"" the company stated.

UPS insists it is honoring its 2023 contract and has spoken with the Teamsters about the plan.

The company is also in the middle of what it called ""the largest network reconfiguration in UPS history.""

Earlier this year, UPS revealed it would cut 20,000 jobs and close 73 buildings to save costs.

In January, it slashed its agreement with Amazon, its top client, cutting shipment volume by more than half through 2026.

The Teamsters say the new buyout plan hasn’t been fully disclosed to members yet and warn it’s “illegal.”

They have demanded data from UPS on open positions and delivery vans, including air-conditioned vehicles promised under the current contract.

UPS has so far failed to respond to the union’s request and asked for more time, the Teamsters claim.

“They can’t force anything on us,” Teamsters Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said.

Zuckerman also called out UPS CEO, Carol Tomé , saying she could ""screw over her own team.""

He added that ""she’s not gonna push around the Teamsters.”

Second Quarter 2025 Preliminary Revenue Results

Merit also announced preliminary unaudited revenue in the range of approximately $380 to $384 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, a projected increase of approximately 12% to 14% compared to revenue reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Preliminary constant currency revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, increased in the range of approximately 11% to 13% compared to the prior year period. Constant currency revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included under the heading ""Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below.

As previously announced on July 3, 2025, Merit plans to release its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, after the close of the stock market on Wednesday, July 30, 2025. Merit plans to hold its investor conference call on the same day (Wednesday, July 30, 2025) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (4:00 p.m. Central, 3:00 p.m. Mountain, and 2:00 p.m. Pacific).

A link to both register for the conference call and view the webcast will be made available at www.merit.com.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

Although Merit’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP”), Merit’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue referenced in this release may provide investors with useful information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Merit’s ongoing operations and can be useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations.

Merit’s management team uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate Merit’s financial performance generally, to compare operating and financial results to prior periods, to evaluate changes in the results of its operating segments, and to measure and allocate financial resources internally. However, Merit’s management does not consider this non-GAAP measure in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

Readers should consider the non-GAAP measure used in this release in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure generally excludes some, but not all, items that may affect Merit’s revenue. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded. The non-GAAP financial measure used in this release may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Merit urges readers to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure included herein, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Merit’s business or results of operations.

Constant Currency Revenue

Merit’s constant currency revenue is prepared by converting the current-period preliminary unaudited revenue of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period and adjusting for the effects of hedging transactions on preliminary unaudited revenue, which are recorded in the U.S. dollar. The preliminary constant currency revenue adjustment of $(2.3) million to preliminary unaudited revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was calculated using the applicable average foreign exchange rates for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation

The following table sets forth supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of non-GAAP preliminary constant currency revenue to Merit’s corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

Which recalled Costco items should you stop using immediately?

PIMPAMPIX/STOCK.ADOBE.COM

Costco included more than a dozen items on its recall list from various manufacturers, but the five below are the most potentially dangerous. Here’s what the retailer is advising customers to remove them from their homes immediately, and why:

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires: While Costco is indeed a great place to buy tires, Michelin tires sized 185/60R15C are under recall. According to Michelin, “chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block,” which could increase the risk of a crash.

Anker Powercore 1000 Power Bank: These power banks have a risk of overheating, and “this could lead to melting of plastic components, smoke or fire,” according to Anker in its recall letter.

Danby 8k U-Shape Window Air Conditioner: If you purchased this air conditioner between June 10, 2021, and Feb. 2, 2022, it may be harboring toxic mold—and blowing it through your house along with all that cold air this summer. “Pooled water in the air containers can fail to drain quickly enough, which can lead to mold growth,” Danby explained. The company notes that mold can cause respiratory issues or infections, especially for sensitive individuals.

Midea U-Shape Window AC: Similar to the issue above, this Midea window air conditioner has drainage issues that can cause mold growth.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler: Customers who bought this cooler between January 2020 and January 2025 should stop using it immediately. Why? There’s “a risk that the tow handle can pinch consumers’ fingertips against the cooler, posing fingertip amputation and crushing hazards,” the brand notes. Yikes!

What other items has Costco recalled?

While we called out the items with the most urgent risks above, many of the ones below are still problematic, as you’ll see. Give your home a thorough check, and if you find these items, stop using them ASAP.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells: The weight plates can dislodge from the handle when you’re using these dumbbells, which could pose “an impact hazard.”

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires: Bridgestone is recalling these tires because they were sold as “replacement equipment only.” Plus, “they do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 139.”

Anker Power Bank: There’s “a potential issue involving lithium-ion battery cells from a single vendor.” Anker has deemed the likelihood of malfunction minimal, but the company has still issued “a voluntary global recall,” just in case.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass: Coca-Cola is voluntarily recalling a limited number of these glasses due to “the possibility of contamination with pseudomonas.”

Fresh & Ready Foods Prepared Sandwiches and Salads: Fresh & Ready Foods is recalling some of its ready-to-eat sandwiches—specifically, ones sold in Arizona, California, Nevada and Washington. This voluntary recall is due to a possible listeria contamination.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer: Some customers have reported that the lids open while the pressure cooker is being used, which can lead to “severe burn injuries from hot contents.”

Segway Ninebot Electric Kickscooter: The problem here is a potential failure of the folding mechanism, which can lead to falls.

Sublue Underwater Scooter: Underwater scooters purchased between June 2018 and March 2024 are being recalled due to battery malfunctions.

Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu: The caplets with the lot code P140082 are being recalled due to their accidental release and shipment. According to Kirkland, they “may have foreign material contamination.”

What should you do if you have one of these items?

If you own one of these items, it’s important to stop using it right away. We know it can be tough, especially if it’s something you’ve used for a while, but you shouldn’t chance it, since the product could malfunction at any time.

In addition to discontinuing use, check the brand’s website for more details about the recall. You can also visit Costco’s recall page for brand contact info and next steps. Some brands provide guidance on how to inspect the product to determine if it’s still safe to use, so it’s worth a look.

Will Costco give you a refund for these items?

Yes, but typically only if you have a Costco membership. And if you’re a Costco member, there’s more good news: A receipt is not always required. Just having your membership card or number should do the trick, since Costco keeps your receipts in its system for years—yes, years!

In lieu of a refund from Costco, there is another option: Some of the brands offer free repair kits, full refunds or prorated refunds, depending on when you bought the item or when it was made. The bottom line? You have options, so make sure to explore them before throwing in the towel—and throwing out your recalled item.

The aircraft are scheduled for delivery commencing 2028 through 2032.

Witnessed by Prime Minister of Malaysia YAB Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim, the agreement was signed today in Paris between Tony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A, and Christian Scherer, CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

Tony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A and Advisor & Steward of AirAsia Group said: “We pioneered low-cost travel in Asia – now, we are taking it to the next level. AirAsia is on a transformative journey to become the world’s first low-cost network carrier. This is about exponential growth, connecting geographies beyond Asean, and making flying even more democratic. We gave people in Asean the opportunity to explore Asia – now we want the world to see Asean, and Asean to see the world. The A321XLR and A321LR are the game-changers enabling this vision, and we are proud to lead the charge in making our world smaller. We can’t wait to paint the skies even wider in red.”

Christian Scherer, CEO Commercial Aircraft at Airbus said: “We are pleased to confirm this agreement, as AirAsia Group begins its next development chapter. Having resumed its growth trajectory, which we salute and support, the airline is creating solid fleet efficiencies, allowing global network expansion. The A321XLR unlocks new opportunities for AirAsia to launch non-stop flights linking primary and secondary cities all around the globe.”

The next-generation A321XLRs will operate alongside AirAsia’s all-Airbus fleet of A320 Family and A330 aircraft, supporting its long-term strategy to deliver unmatched connectivity across Asia and beyond, while maintaining a low-cost model through improved route economics, enhanced aircraft utilisation and fleet efficiency. AirAsia Group aims to carry 150 million guests annually by 2030, reaching a cumulative total of 1.5 billion guests since inception.

The new fleet plays a pivotal role in this transformation. AirAsia’s multi-aircraft strategy enables the airline to match capacity with demand, reduce fuel consumption, and support a sustainable, cost-effective growth model in a highly competitive global landscape. The A321XLR also offers up to 20 per cent lower fuel burn per seat than the Airbus A321neo aircraft, significantly improving emissions performance and operating efficiency.",https://iorbitnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 18:06:59.392197

These events are no longer challenges only for operations or safety teams. They’re driving real increases in healthcare claims and exposing gaps in benefits strategy—and should be an increased focus for HR and benefits leaders.

To help employers prepare, Mercer and the National Commission on Climate and Workforce Health have launched a new digital tool: the Climate Health Cost Forecaster. The tool gives employers their first clear line of sight into how climate-related health risks—such as extreme heat, poor air quality, flooding and hurricanes—could increase healthcare costs for their populations over the next decade.

For benefits leaders trying to manage plan design, anticipate cost drivers and align across regions, this kind of data is increasingly essential.

Why rising climate health costs matter for benefits teams

Employers today are already facing rising medical costs, and many are looking for new ways to contain costs without cutting coverage. What’s often overlooked is how climate-related health risks are quietly compounding the problem, especially in industries or geographies with higher exposure, and that these risks are growing.

The Forecaster, built by Mercer, offers customized, ZIP code-level projections based on a company’s workforce size, industry and percentage of employees working in climate-controlled environments. It draws on historical weather data, epidemiological research and Mercer’s proprietary claims database to estimate when and where employers may face increased spending from climate-related health conditions—ranging from heat stroke to respiratory illness to mental health impacts.

Key insights include:

For employees not working in a climate-controlled environment, the incremental cost of climate-related health impacts is 40% higher on average than for those working in climate-controlled settings.

Industries like construction, agriculture and utilities may face up to 2x greater exposure to incremental healthcare costs than other sectors.

Employers with significant headcount in metro areas such as New York, Boston, Phoenix and Charlotte are projected to see 5x higher climate-related healthcare claims.

These aren’t abstract trends—they’re cost drivers that can and should be factored into budgeting, plan forecasting and location-specific health and wellbeing strategies.

From visibility to action

The Forecaster helps bridge the gap between rising environmental risks and rising claims costs. For HR and benefits leaders, it provides a data-backed way to start internal conversations—whether with finance, risk, sustainability, operations or facilities teams—about this emerging dimension of healthcare cost trends and associated mitigation strategies.

The tool also allows employers to model how climate risk could contribute to a 1% or greater increase in annual healthcare spend over the next decade, which could translate to millions in additional costs for many organizations. With this data, companies can benchmark projected exposure, compare across regions, and prioritize interventions that lower risk.

Despite the growing exposure, few companies have addressed this risk strategically. According to research from Mercer, fewer than one in five CEOs say their organizations have a clear plan to protect employees from climate-related health risks. And yet, 76% of employers say severe weather has affected their employees—whether through heat, air quality or severe weather disruptions.

New polling from the Commission and Northwind Climate illustrates how this is transforming into an HR risk: Forty-three percent of employees say an employer’s ability to respond to these threats influences whether they stay long term.

Planning ahead, building resilience

The Forecaster can also support broader strategy conversations—such as where to build new sites, how to evaluate relocations or how to adapt benefits offerings by region. It enables employers to assess which specific perils pose the greatest risk in each location. In some cities, heat is the dominant factor; in others, air quality or flooding are more likely to drive higher costs. These insights can guide smarter, more tailored decisions.

For example:

In high-heat areas, if not already mandated, companies may consider heat-safety policies, cooling benefits or modified working hours to help employees avoid the hottest times of the day.

In wildfire-prone areas, employers might offer respiratory education and support for flexible work arrangements.

In flood zones, business continuity planning may include alternatives for accessing healthcare and other benefits as well as disaster relief.

Proactive investments like these can not only reduce claims and absenteeism but also improve retention and workforce engagement—especially among employees who expect visible action on environmental sustainability.

From insights to innovation: How leading employers are responding

Understanding the risks is essential, but the real opportunity lies in taking action. It is typical for companies to have some policies in place to support climate resiliency; in fact, a recent Mercer survey found that 66% of large employers (those with 500 or more employees) have one or more policies or programs in place to address climate risks for the workforce, up from 53% last year (2024). However, only a few have done a vulnerability assessment to understand which employees are most at risk.

Leading companies are already pioneering policies to safeguard employees and operations from climate disruption.

For example, Adobe introduced a Disaster and Epidemic Time Off policy, granting paid time off to workers affected by events that trigger a state of emergency. Public entities and employers are also offering subsidies for home heat pumps, a greener HVAC alternative that reduces emissions and boosts indoor air quality for employees at home by filtering air and regulating temperature.

Policy is moving quickly in some places. In Spain, a law now gives employees up to four paid “climate leave” days when extreme weather makes commuting unsafe. And in the U.S., Minnesota’s Earned Sick and Safe Time law requires employers to provide leave that covers situations like workplace closures due to weather emergencies.

Rising to the occasion

Innovative companies have the opportunity to meet this moment. Employers can expand disaster response policies—quickly approving pharmacy refills during crises, fast-tracking disability claims, offering emergency relief funds and scaling telemedicine during wildfires or floods. Many are further reducing risk exposure through on-the-ground adaptations: installing cooling stations, updating filtration systems, implementing flexible shift schedules, educating employees on the risks they face and enabling remote work during air quality alerts or heat waves.

These investments yield measurable benefits, including reduced absenteeism, lower claims, stronger talent retention and improved morale. They also demonstrate to employees that the company values their safety and wellbeing. Employers that integrate climate resilience into benefits, facilities and operational planning position themselves to outpace their peers.

New resources for a growing challenge

The Climate Health Cost Forecaster is one of several tools available through the National Commission on Climate and Workforce Health, a cross-sector initiative presented by Mercer and supported by Elevance Health and The Hartford.

In addition to the Forecaster, the Commission provides resources on extreme heat, air quality and climate-related mental health challenges—offering practical steps HR and benefits leaders can take today.

Two additional tools can help employers move from awareness to action. The new Climate and Worker Health Scorecard allows organizations to assess how well their current policies, benefits and preparedness strategies address climate-driven risks. Developed by Mercer with support from the commission, the Scorecard guides teams through a review of the policies and programs currently in place to protect workers from climate-related health risks and support them in weather emergencies, and immediately delivers a report with their score. This process can help employers identify new opportunities to safeguard worker health and wellbeing as climate risks intensify. Explore the Scorecard here.

For those just getting started, check out Managing Extreme Weather and Climate Risks at Work, a playbook designed specifically for HR and benefits leaders. The guide offers a practical, four-step plan to help companies prepare for extreme climate conditions, protect their teams and build long-term resilience.

This summer, the commission is hosting a series of virtual events focused on extreme heat and workforce health. The sessions will feature new research, expert perspectives and strategies to help HR, operations, and Environmental, Health and Safety leaders address the rising risks and costs associated with heat exposure. The next session takes place from 1-2 p.m. ET on July 30. Secure your seat here.

The bottom line for HR and benefits leaders

Climate risks aren’t theoretical; they are already affecting employee health and productivity and impacting medical claims. Nor are they a problem to deal with in the future: Heat waves, wildfires and hurricanes are expected to intensify this summer.

With healthcare costs continuing to rise, benefits professionals need every available tool to get ahead of emerging risks.

The deal equips Capgemini to create a consulting business service focused on helping companies improve their processes and cost efficiency with the use of artificial intelligence, namely generative AI and agentic AI, which it expects to attract significant investments.

The purchase price, translating to $76.50 per WNS share,e represents a 17% premium compared to their last closing price on July 3 and does not include WNS’s financial debt, Capgemini said.

Its interest in India-based WNS, whose services include business process outsourcing and data analytics, was first reported, report says.

“WNS brings its high growth, margin accretive and resilient Digital Business Process Services while further increasing our exposure to the US market,” Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat said in a press statement.

WNS’s customers include large organizations such as Coca-Cola, T-Mobile and United Airlines.

On a conference call with media and analysts, Ezzat said the acquisition would immediately create cross-selling opportunities between the two companies, mainly in the US and Britain.

Capgemini expects the deal to be closed by the end of 2025 and to be immediately accretive to its revenue and operating margin.

However, its shares fell around 5% following the news, the biggest losers on Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index as of 1024 GMT, with Morgan Stanley analysts saying the deal would limit its balance sheet flexibility while not having a major impact on financials.

Some investors are also concerned that Gen AI could impact the typically staff-intensive business process outsourcing (BPO) market, which could bite into Capgemini’s revenues and expose it to new competition, the analysts said in a research note.

“We expect investors to be able to see the opportunity that could come from disrupting BPO with Gen AI, but think some evidence will be needed to convince the market WNS is the right vehicle,” they added.

Capgemini declined to discuss further details of the planned acquisition of WNS in response to a CRN request.

However, in an analyst conference call after news of the acquisition was released, Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat (pictured above) said in his prepared remarks that the transaction targets the growing need for AI capabilities.

“This transaction positions the group as a leader in the emerging market of intelligent operation, which is the most significant opportunity for our clients to create value in the era of GenAI and agentic AI,” Ezzat said. “The strategic value of this transaction lies in the complementarity of capabilities and expertise between Capgemini and WNS to provide intelligent operations at scale.”

Ezzat said Capgemini expects the integration of the two companies’ business services global capabilities to be straightforward based on the cultural fit and complementarity of capability.

The $3.3 billion acquisition, which was unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to close by the end of 2025, Ezzat said.

Capgemini plans to finance the acquisition with about 1 billion Euros of available cash plus 4 billion Euros in bridge funding.

The acquisition comes at the right time for Capgemini and WNS, Ezzat said.

“Since the advent of ChatGPT and GenAI, enterprises have focused significant attention and increasing amounts of investment around GenAI, and more broadly, AI,” he said. “Clients today better comprehend what the technology can actually deliver. Their focus is shifting from individual productivity to the transformation of end-to-end business processes.”

Large enterprises want to invest in agentic AI to change how they operate for both efficiency and growth, Ezzat said.

“It is the realization that end-to-end business processes provide the background to fully leverage the power of GenAI and agentic AI,” he said. “It is a unique opportunity to make AI real and reap its expected benefits.”

Capgemini started investing in GenAI over five years ago, building over 25 strategic partnerships, upskilling its staff, and developing a wide portfolio of offerings, and in the process became a leader in GenAI and agentic AI, with data and AI becoming one of the company’s core pillars, Ezzat said.

“With GenAI, bookings are already hitting 900 million euros last year,” he said. “Clients rely on Capgemini and their business and technology partners for the GenAI transformation journey.”

The last 12 months have seen a significant increase in client interest in the revolution of business process services driven by agentic AI, Ezzat said.

“We are convinced that intelligent operations, which is a consulting-led approach to transform and operate business processes leveraging GenAI and agentic AI, will be the primary showcase for agentic AI in terms of value creation,” he said. “This is about making GenAI and agentic AI real for our clients.”

Business process services, or BPS, have over the last 20 years shifted from a focus on cost reduction to things like robotic process automation and digital platforms, Ezzat said.

“Intelligent operation is the next revolution in the BPS market,” he said. “It includes consulting-led business process transformation, leveraging GenAI and agentic AI. It provides clients with efficiency, speed, and agility through process hyper automation at scale while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI, and digital. Client focus has shifted from cost and efficiency to agility, speed, and significantly better business outcomes. This is about value creation. In parallel, the BPS market is shifting away from its labor-based drivers to being consulting-led and tech-driven.”

Intelligence operation requires strategy and transformation, consulting, deep technology expertise, and in-depth knowledge of horizontal and sector processes to deliver end-to-end process transformation, blending advanced agentic AI agents, custom GenAI assistance, enterprise data, data platform and management, and digital solutions, Ezzat said.

“Capgemini has essentially all the ingredients to answer its clients’ need for intelligent operation,” he said. “It is about scaling BPS. It’s about industry knowledge. It’s about leading in intelligent operation. This is the real strategic value of this transaction.”

WNS is a global leader in digital business process services operating at scale with deep industry and process expertise, with offerings powered by a comprehensive stack of solutions and platforms and fueled by a set of data and analytics solutions, Ezzat said.

“Their vertical industry specific expertise supports over 40 percent of their revenue, while data and analytics contributes 13 percent, underscoring WNS’ commitment to data and insight-led business process transformation,” he said.

WNS and its 65,000 employees serve a blue-chip client base with clients including United Airlines, U.K.-based Centrica, MNC Bank, and McCain Foods, Ezzat said. Nearly half the company’s revenue comes from North America, he said.

“WNS brings deep industry expertise through outcome-based platforms tailored to key verticals for every industry it serves,” he said. “WNS has developed and deployed proprietary platforms that deliver measurable value to its clients. This includes, for example, WNS Malkom. It’s an end-to-end AI-powered shipment documentation platform. It automates bills of lading, invoices, and consignment notes, turning core manual and error-prone processes into digital workflows. … Malkom intelligent architecture is delivering 40 [percent] to 60 percent productivity gains, ROI of up to four times, and 99 percent data accuracy, also reducing invoicing disputes by 20 percent and cutting documentation cycle times.”

Because of the complementary capabilities, offerings, and clients, the acquisition immediately unlocks cross-selling opportunities, Ezzat said.

“[We will] fully leverage the extensive portfolio of Capgemini service offerings with WNS clients, mainly in the U.S. and the U.K.,” he said. “We also see a great opportunity to leverage WNS’ digital BPS offerings, notably its platform and sector expertise in our client base. You can think about banking and insurance clients, for example, where today we can benefit from their vertical process capabilities.”

The combined company will be differentiated in its data and AI capabilities, Ezzat said.

“We have invested in talent, innovation, and [an] ecosystem of strategic partners,” he said. “Our approach is industry-specific and AI-powered. All these capabilities will be supported by an extended delivery network that brings scale and geographic diversity enabling global reach. Together, we have a unique set of capabilities that enable end-to-end business process transformation.”

The acquisition is strategic to both Capgemini and WNS, Ezzat said.

“We share the same vision of the market and the fast-emerging opportunity around intelligent operation driven by GenAI and agentic AI,” he said. “We are convinced that the complementarity of our capabilities and offerings will position Capgemini as the leader in this fast-emerging intelligent operation market, while providing great cross-selling revenue.”",https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2025/media_10f2e7881be914d776295766296820d9bbfd09822.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-07-07 17:09:23.793064

Second Quarter 2025 Preliminary Revenue ResultsMerit also announced preliminary unaudited revenue in the range of approximately $380 to $384 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, a projected increase of approximately 12% to 14% compared to revenue reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Preliminary constant currency revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, increased in the range of approximately 11% to 13% compared to the prior year period. Constant currency revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below.

As previously announced on July 3, 2025, Merit plans to release its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, after the close of the stock market on Wednesday, July 30, 2025. Merit plans to hold its investor conference call on the same day (Wednesday, July 30, 2025) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (4:00 p.m. Central, 3:00 p.m. Mountain, and 2:00 p.m. Pacific).

A link to both register for the conference call and view the webcast will be made available at www.merit.com.

Non-GAAP Financial MeasureAlthough Merit’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), Merit’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue referenced in this release may provide investors with useful information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Merit’s ongoing operations and can be useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations.

Merit’s management team uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate Merit’s financial performance generally, to compare operating and financial results to prior periods, to evaluate changes in the results of its operating segments, and to measure and allocate financial resources internally. However, Merit’s management does not consider this non-GAAP measure in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

Readers should consider the non-GAAP measure used in this release in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure generally excludes some, but not all, items that may affect Merit’s revenue. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded. The non-GAAP financial measure used in this release may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Merit urges readers to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure included herein, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Merit’s business or results of operations.

Constant Currency RevenueMerit’s constant currency revenue is prepared by converting the current-period preliminary unaudited revenue of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period and adjusting for the effects of hedging transactions on preliminary unaudited revenue, which are recorded in the U.S. dollar. The preliminary constant currency revenue adjustment of $(2.3) million to preliminary unaudited revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was calculated using the applicable average foreign exchange rates for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure ReconciliationThe following table sets forth supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of non-GAAP preliminary constant currency revenue to Merit’s corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

The move comes as retailers across the UK explore a range of security measures to tackling rising retail crime.
In February, Tesco unveiled a new multimillion-pound security hub in Daventry, Northamptonshire, as part of a major investment to tackle the growing problem of retail crime across its UK stores.
The Auror platform allows the company to gather and share relevant information on retail crime with local police and other retailers.
In January, the BRC’s annual crime survey also found that retail crime is at the highest level on record with losses reaching £2.2 billion.","Swedish fashion brand H&M is reportedly testing body cameras across three UK stores in a bid to tackle growing retail crime.

The retailer told The Mail on Sunday that it is trialling the technology in one store in Edinburgh and two in London.

“We're testing this new technology in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with proper staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers,” an H&M spokesperson told This is Money over the weekend.

The move comes as retailers across the UK explore a range of security measures to tackling rising retail crime.

In May, Currys has announced its largest ever investment in in-store security with the rollout of headsets at stores nationwide.

The move follows a successful trial of the VoCoVo developed technology in 20 stores.

The headsets aim to help staff stay better connected and therefore safer on the shop floor amidst the rise in shoplifting and abuse incidents across the retail industry.

In February, Tesco unveiled a new multimillion-pound security hub in Daventry, Northamptonshire, as part of a major investment to tackle the growing problem of retail crime across its UK stores.

The high-tech centre, which operates 24 hours a day throughout the year, analyses thousands of hours of CCTV footage to target shoplifters and protect staff from violence.

Security operators have been assigned responsibility for monitoring specific groups of stores across the UK.

bp has also rolled out a crime intelligence platform across its 300 company-owned stores and has provided staff with body cameras at 70 locations.

The Auror platform allows the company to gather and share relevant information on retail crime with local police and other retailers.

H&M's trial comes after figures from the British Retail Consortium published in March revealed that nearly a quarter of the UK population have witnessed shoplifting taking place while at a shop in the last 12 months.

The organisation also found that around 23 per cent of customers have seen the physical or verbal abuse of staff including racial or sexual abuse, physical assault or threats with weapons.

In January, the BRC’s annual crime survey also found that retail crime is at the highest level on record with losses reaching £2.2 billion.

It also showed that there were over 2,000 incidents of violence and abuse over 2023-2024, more than triple the levels recorded in 2020.

Separately, shopworkers’ union Usdaw, has produced its own research which shows 77 per cent of retail staff experience abuse, with 53 per cent on the receiving end of threats and 10 per cent experiencing assault.",https://nationaltechnology.co.uk/images/H&M Logo.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 17:09:47.257654

SOUTH JORDAN, Utah, July 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MMSI), a global leader of healthcare technology, announced today the appointment of Martha Aronson as Merit’s new President and Chief Executive Officer, effective October 3, 2025. Fred P.

Martha is uniquely qualified to lead Merit into the future and drive its continued success. Her keen intellect and proven track record of empowering global teams through collaborative excellence, consistent with “The Merit Way,” makes her the ideal leader for Merit’s next stage of growth.

With Martha’s experience and capability, I look forward to supporting her vision while she charts Merit's course forward.”

Ms. Aronson has extensive experience in global healthcare. Her business management experience includes overseeing global healthcare businesses ranging in size from $500 million to $1 billion.

As Merit’s founder, he has advanced patient care and significantly improved health outcomes worldwide. Fred’s genuine leadership reaches beyond the workplace and has touched communities around the globe.”

Second Quarter 2025 Preliminary Revenue Results

Merit also announced preliminary unaudited revenue in the range of approximately $380 to $384 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, a projected increase of approximately 12% to 14% compared to revenue reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Preliminary constant currency revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, increased in the range of approximately 11% to 13% compared to the prior year period. Constant currency revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below.

As previously announced on July 3, 2025, Merit plans to release its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, after the close of the stock market on Wednesday, July 30, 2025. Merit plans to hold its investor conference call on the same day (Wednesday, July 30, 2025) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (4:00 p.m. Central, 3:00 p.m. Mountain, and 2:00 p.m. Pacific).

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

Although Merit’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), Merit’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue referenced in this release may provide investors with useful information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Merit’s ongoing operations and can be useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations.

Merit’s management team uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate Merit’s financial performance generally, to compare operating and financial results to prior periods, to evaluate changes in the results of its operating segments, and to measure and allocate financial resources internally. However, Merit’s management does not consider this non-GAAP measure in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

Readers should consider the non-GAAP measure used in this release in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure generally excludes some, but not all, items that may affect Merit’s revenue. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded. The non-GAAP financial measure used in this release may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Merit urges readers to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure included herein, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Merit’s business or results of operations.

Constant Currency Revenue

Merit’s constant currency revenue is prepared by converting the current-period preliminary unaudited revenue of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period and adjusting for the effects of hedging transactions on preliminary unaudited revenue, which are recorded in the U.S. dollar. The preliminary constant currency revenue adjustment of $(2.3) million to preliminary unaudited revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 was calculated using the applicable average foreign exchange rates for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation

""This permanent increase offers significant planning opportunities for high-net-worth business owners looking to optimize succession strategies,"" she says.
Philanthropic business owners could also potentially take advantage of the scholarship granting organization credit under the OBBA.","To describe the past few months' worth of news over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which has now officially been signed into law, one might consider butchering that famous Shakespearean phrase: ""full of sound and fury, signifying not much.""

That last part is certainly up for debate, especially for critics blasting the additional $3.3 trillion burden the bill would add to the deficit over the next decade, or the cuts it introduces into Medicaid. But the weeks leading up to the legislation's passage have definitely been furious.

For weeks after the House version the bill squeaked through by one vote in May, progress on the Senate version was stalled by holdouts objecting to its proposed Medicaid cuts and the cap on the SALT deduction. Last week, a marathon voting session in the Upper House ended in another deadlock, prompting Vice President JD Vance to cast a tiebreaking vote.

When all was said and done, the tax break package President Donald Trump approved in a splashy July 4 signing event at the White House didn't depart in any world-shaking way from his first signature 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

In other words, it's now safe for advisors to tell their high-net-worth business owner clients not to panic over their exit planning – at least, not more than usual – while highlighting a couple of interesting opportunities.

""I think it's business as usual, where they use the same techniques they've always used,"" Jere Doyle, a senior vice president and estate planning strategist at BNY Mellon, said in an interview with InvestmentNews. ""If there were drastic changes in the tax law, I'd give you a different answer.""

A recently published BNY Wealth Study stressed tax as a crucial issue for private business owners, calling it ""a constantly evolving area."" In particular, it said techniques to minimize income tax, estate tax, and gift tax should be treated as a core part of the business sale process, which the report encouraged business owners to ""begin planning early"" for.

A bigger estate tax exemption

According to Doyle, one of the report's authors, many advisors and estate planning experts have spent the last three to four years urging clients to use their $14 million estate tax exemption from the TCJA, which would have reverted to $7 million assuming Trump's first-term tax cuts expired this year. But following the frantic and tense budget reconciliation process at Capitol Hill, small business owners will now have a more substantial $15 million exemption to work with.

Jenny Giemza, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, notes that the extra $1 million of relief for business owners will take effect in 2026, with inflation-indexed adjustments to be applied moving forward. Married couples, she adds, could potentially shield an extra $2 million by using the portability provision of the exemption.

""This permanent increase offers significant planning opportunities for high-net-worth business owners looking to optimize succession strategies,"" she says.

Because many of Doyle's clients have businesses worth more than $15 million, he and his team go through numerous potential alternative strategies for them to shield their stock from estate taxes.

One option, he says, is to sell the stock to a grantor trust in exchange for a promissory note. Because the value of the note doesn't fluctuate with the markets, the business owner would be able to effectively freeze the value of their business within their estate, while any appreciation of the stock would accrue to the trust for the benefit of their children.

""That's been the bread-and-butter strategy to get the value of a business out of the estate before it appreciates,"" Doyle says.

Exploring C-corps and SGOs

For businesses organized as C-corporations whose holdings count as qualified small business stock, Doyle also sees an opportunity to exclude up to $10 million of capital gains on a business sale. If those business owners were to gift some stock to their children, he says they would each also enjoy their own $10 million exclusion, further amplifying the opportunity for estate planning.

""Some people don't qualify. But when we're talking to business owners, especially if they're going to do a startup, we mention that they may want to think about organizing your company as a qualified small business to take advantage of this huge exclusion,"" he says.

Philanthropic business owners could also potentially take advantage of the scholarship granting organization credit under the OBBA. According to Giemza, the one-for-one tax credit allows them to contribute the greater of $5,000 or 10% of their adjusted gross income, with a federal cap of $4 billion annually starting in 2027. Contributions could be made in cash or marketable securities, such as appreciated stock, to SGOs that offer scholarships to private or religious K-12 schools.

""Overall, this credit could offer significant tax-saving opportunities and philanthropic flexibility for high-income business owners looking to reduce the value of their estate, support educational causes, and leave a lasting legacy aligned with their values,"" Giemza says.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/in/leoa_638875138727937513.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:09:19.178147

Each university received $25,000 “to support innovative research aimed at deepening scientific understanding of yogurt, probiotics, and the gut microbiome.”1

The fellowship program has been active for 13 years and has provided over half a million dollars to support research initiatives. According to the press release, grant winners are picked “solely on their scientific merit and potential contribution to the scientific community, regardless of any benefit to Danone's business.”1 Winners are picked via a panel of experts who consider faculty recommendations, relevance to human health and wellness, and proposal quality. The funding is unrestricted and comes without any oversight or involvement from Danone.

""As interest in gut health continues to grow, it's critical that we support early-stage research that helps uncover how probiotic-rich foods, like certain fermented dairy products, can influence human health,"" said Miguel Freitas, PhD, vice president of nutrition and scientific affairs at Danone North America.1 ""Owen and Ella's projects stood out for their scientific merit and potential impact, and we're excited to see the discoveries their work will bring to light.""

Danone North America first began accepting applicants for their Annual Gut Microbiome, Yogurt and Probiotics Fellowship Grant back in January and wrapped up their acceptance period on March 24, 2025.2

Hale is planning to investigate “eco-evolutionary processes within the microbiome that affect human health, which contributes to identifying the causes and consequences of dysbiosis.”1 His research will focus primarily on Lactobacilli and what long-term effects come from antimicrobial compounds produced by the bacteria. ""I hope my discoveries will inform the development of evolutionarily sustainable treatments or preventative strategies that will protect people from harmful bacteria linked to dysbiosis, inflammation, and infection,"" says Hale.1

Ramamurthy intends to “engineer a probiotic bacterium to import, sense, and produce neurotransmitters to maintain healthy levels in the gut and better understand the interactions between gut and human health and wellness, including reducing depression and anxiety.”1

""This funding underscores the significance of probiotics in maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis in the gut microbiome,"" explains Ramamurthy.1 ""With Danone North America's support, I'm excited to study the gut-brain axis and develop interventions to restore a healthy gut microbiota and improve overall wellness.""

According to reports in Israeli media, including tech news outlet Ctech, the company is burdened with approximately $516 million in debt and has encountered a critical cash flow shortfall following the abrupt withdrawal of shareholder funding.

The move comes after years of heavy investment and limited commercial return. Founded in 2011 by industry pioneer Benny Landa, the company introduced its first alpha and beta digital press models in 2017. However, commercial sales only began in earnest in 2022. To date, just over 50 machines have been sold globally.

Calcalist, an Israeli financial newspaper, reports Landa Digital Printing posted combined losses of $312 million over 2022 and 2023. Revenue reached $35 million in 2022, followed by $47 million in 2023, but losses deepened year-over-year due largely to interest on shareholder loans, many of which were later converted into equity. The company does not have audited financial results for 2024.

At drupa 2024, Landa reportedly secured 50 letters of intent from prospective buyers, prompting the company to order components from suppliers. Ultimately, just 11 of those letters translated into confirmed sales.

A statement issued by the company on June 29, 2025, confirmed the sudden halt in shareholder funding and acknowledged the resulting financial crisis. In response, Landa has implemented a company-wide reorganization, including staff reductions and cost-cutting measures. On June 30, the court granted Landa Digital Printing a 14-day freeze on legal proceedings as it seeks a path forward.

The news has sparked speculation about a potential acquisition by a larger digital print player. While no official discussions have been confirmed, some observers have drawn parallels to HP’s 2002 acquisition of Indigo — another Benny Landa-founded company that helped establish HP as a major force in digital print.

Medtronic demonstrates strong operational efficiency without expanding capital

Capital has improved steadily over recent years

Performance metrics align with broader sector movement on the NYSE Composite

Medtronic, a prominent name in the medical technology sector, is showing promising structural strength in its return metrics. Aligned with broader industry trends reflected in the NYSE Composite, the company’s recent trajectory reveals encouraging operational performance backed by strategic use of existing resources.

Capital Employed A Key Operational Indicator

Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) serves as a significant marker for efficiency. It gauges how well a company is generating profit from its operational base. For Medtronic, the trend in ROCE over a multi-year period has indicated a consistent upturn, even as the capital base has remained largely unchanged. This pattern reveals a shift in operational productivity rather than increased spending.

Steady Capital Base Supports Growing Efficiency

One of the key takeaways from Medtronic’s performance is that its capital employed has stayed within a tight range, yet its ability to extract more output from this same base has strengthened. This suggests internal improvements in how the organization is deploying its assets and optimizing its functions across segments. Enhanced efficiencies without an increase in committed capital often indicate disciplined resource allocation.

Efficiency Gains Reflect in Broader Market Context

The company’s performance aligns with the overall behavior, which have seen certain healthcare entities outpace other sectors in operational refinement. As global demand for medical technologies continues, Medtronic's position remains relevant through its focus on productivity improvements.

Reinvestment Through Performance, Not Expansion

Rather than expanding its asset base, Medtronic appears (NYSE:MDT) to be achieving growth through operational reinvestment. This reinvestment is not linked to external funding but to the generation of higher returns through core capabilities. This development enhances the stability of long-term performance metrics.

Distribution Consistency

As part of its shareholder approach, Medtronic has consistently distributed dividends over time, underlining a reliable capital return structure. This aligns with practices common among firms maintaining a stable operating model, where earnings support consistent payout patterns rather than requiring financial restructuring.

Internal Momentum Drives Value Creation

Medtronic’s internal performance indicators reveal that the company is progressing through internal momentum rather than relying on external drivers.

Two types of tires were part of a long list of recalled issued by Costco in recent months.

The Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C and the Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires Size 235/40R19 were both recalled.

Michelin issued a recall notice for the Agilis CrossClimate C-metric tires because the size did not comply with regulatory requirements and posed a greater risk of a crash.

""Chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block,"" the recall stated.

The recall also noted that tire identification information is usually written on the side of each tire, directly above the bead.

Drivers who believe they purchased the recalled product were urged to double-check if they possess the faulty tires.

Those who bought the Michelin tires were asked to visit their local Michelin retailer, who would remove and replace the product with an equivalent tire.

Drivers will not be charged for the service.

The other tire, by Bridgestone Blizzak, was recalled because it did not comply with certain safety measures.

According to the recall, the Blizzak 6 tires ""did not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls.""

""The Department of Transportation has found that tires missing the required DOT symbol may be used in appropriate applications, increasing the risk of a crash,"" the recall said.

Drivers were urged to confirm they were affected by the recall by identifying if their tire has four distinct markings.

Any tire that has the brand ""Bridgestone,"" the ""Blizzak 6"" tire line, the ""235/40R19"" tire size, and a ""1VR100W122224/1VR100W122324/1VR100W122424"" identification number should be brought in for an inspection.

The vehicle should be brought to any Bridgestone company-owned retail store or Bridgestone/Firestone authorized dealer.

Employees will inspect and replace all tires that match the description, according to the recall.

Drivers who replaced the tires already could be eligible for a reimbursement for the tires, parts, labor, fees, and taxes by contacting Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations.

Any Costco shopper who isn't sure if their product was recalled should visit the retailer's website and search for their list of product recalls.

The wholesale retailer also provides a list of archived recalls.

Costco has a generous return policy where consumers can make returns without time limits.

But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don't cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare.
That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.
Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies, trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.
She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.","Prices are falling for the popular obesity treatments semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Zepbound), but steady access to the drugs remains challenging.

The medications still amount to around $500 per month for those without insurance -- out of reach for many patients. And even for people with insurance, coverage remains uneven.

""The medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,"" said Matt Maciejewski, PhD, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.

Doctors say the situation forces them to get creative in treating patients, but there's hope that prices may fall more in the future.

Drugs Are Still in High Demand

Semaglutide and tirzepatide are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity.

Tirzepatide brought in $2.3 billion in U.S. sales during this year's first quarter, making it one of drugmaker Eli Lilly's best sellers.

Novo Nordisk says semaglutide has about 200,000 weekly prescriptions in the U.S., where it brought in nearly $1.9 billion in first-quarter sales.

Insurance Coverage Is Increasing -- for Some

Benefits consultant company Mercer says more businesses with 500 or more employees are adding coverage of the injected drugs for their workers and family members.

And Novo says 85% of its patients who have coverage in the U.S. pay $25 or less per month.

Plus some patients with diabetes can get coverage of the GLP-1 drugs approved to treat that condition, with semaglutide branded as Ozempic and tirzepatide branded as Mounjaro.

But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don't cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare.

Even the plans that cover the drugs often pay only a portion of the bill, exposing patients to hundreds of dollars in monthly costs, said Beverly Tchang, MD, of Weill Cornell Medicine's Comprehensive Weight Control Center in New York City.

Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.

""Coverage is not the same as access,"" said Tchang, who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.

Coverage Remains Inconsistent

Bill-payers like employers are nervous about drugs that might be used by a lot of people indefinitely.

Some big employers have dropped coverage of the drugs due to the expense. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also are starting to pick one brand over the other as they negotiate deals with the drugmakers.

One of the nation's largest PBMs, run by CVS Health, dropped Zepbound from its national formulary on July 1 in favor of Wegovy.

That forced Tchang to figure out another treatment plan for several patients, many of whom took Zepbound because it made them less nauseous.

Courtney Younglove, MD's, office sends prospective patients a video link showing them how to check their insurer's website for coverage of the drugs before they visit.

""Then some of them just cancel their appointment because they don't have coverage,"" the Overland Park, Kansas, doctor said.

Cheaper Compounded Drugs Are Still Being Sold

Compounding pharmacies and other entities were allowed to make off-brand, cheaper copies of Wegovy and Zepbound when there was a shortage of the drugs. But the FDA halted compounding earlier this year after deciding that the shortage had ended.

That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.

The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.

It's a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies, trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.

Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by U.S. regulators.

Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.

Prices Have Dropped

Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.

Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per-person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.

There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.

Younglove said some of her patients save as much as 15% by getting their doses shipped from a pharmacy in Canada. They used to get them from an Israeli pharmacy until the Canadians dropped their prices.

She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.

""I think price wars are going to drive it down,"" she said. ""I think we are in the early stages. I have hope.""",https://assets.medpagetoday.net/media/images/116xxx/116389.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 20:03:33.942170

However, the “Back to Starbucks” strategy could unlock value.
Starbucks' stock trades at a P/E ratio of 22x, below its five-year average of 25x, suggesting it's undervalued relative to its potential.","Starbucks' recent decision to discontinue its Oleato olive-oil infused beverages and streamline its menu marks a pivotal moment for the coffee giant. Under CEO Brian Niccol's “Back to Starbucks” strategy, the company is shedding complexity to cater to health-conscious consumers and operational efficiency—a move that could position it to reclaim its crown as the go-to destination for premium coffee experiences. For investors, this shift presents a compelling opportunity in a stock that has been languishing amid declining sales and rising competition.

The Health-Conscious Turn: Aligning with Consumer Values

The removal of Oleato and seed oils from most menus is a shrewd response to evolving consumer preferences. Health trends have shifted decisively toward transparency and natural ingredients, with many diners avoiding processed seed oils like canola oil due to perceived health risks. Starbucks' pivot to eliminate these ingredients—and its broader menu simplification—aligns with this demand. By focusing on core coffee offerings and eliminating niche items that failed to resonate (like the divisive Oleato), Starbucks is recalibrating to serve customers who prioritize quality, simplicity, and wellness.

This strategy also addresses a critical operational flaw: menu bloat. The 30% reduction in items, including the elimination of surcharges for plant-based milk, reduces customization complexity. Baristas can now focus on crafting drinks efficiently, which directly tackles the four-minute wait-time goal—a metric critical to customer satisfaction.

Operational Efficiency: The Engine of Recovery

The simplification is not merely about catering to trends; it's about profitability. A would likely show a gradual rebound as reduced menu complexity lowers waste and speeds up service. The introduction of Clover Vertica drip coffee brewers and store redesigns—such as reintroducing condiment bars and ceramic mugs—aims to cut labor costs while enhancing the “third place” ambiance that once defined Starbucks.

Crucially, the company is doubling down on its loyalty program, Starbucks Rewards, which now accounts for 60% of transactions. By prioritizing repeat customers and reducing discounted transactions, Starbucks is safeguarding margins even as it navigates rising coffee bean prices (up 23% since early 2024). The shift also positions the brand to compete with discount rivals like Luckin Coffee, which threatens to undercut prices in key markets.

The Financial Crossroads: Undervalued Stock, Strategic Gains Ahead

Starbucks' stock has underperformed in recent years, reflecting its struggles with declining traffic and operational inefficiencies. A underscores this divergence. However, the “Back to Starbucks” strategy could unlock value. Analysts estimate that menu simplification and operational improvements could boost margins by 100-200 basis points over the next two years.

The company's decision to suspend 2025 financial guidance suggests confidence in its turnaround timeline. With $9.1 billion in cash and equivalents as of July 2025, Starbucks has the liquidity to invest in its store upgrades and labor adjustments without diluting shareholders.

Risks and Considerations

The strategy is not without hurdles. Over-simplification could alienate customers seeking variety, and execution risks loom large—especially with Luckin's aggressive entry into the U.S. market. Additionally, the return of ceramic mugs and free refills may test supply chains. Yet, the long-term bet here is on Starbucks' brand equity and the enduring appeal of its core products, like the Pumpkin Spice Latte, which have proven resilience in nostalgia-driven markets.

Investment Thesis: A Bitter Brew or a Sweet Opportunity?

Starbucks' stock trades at a P/E ratio of 22x, below its five-year average of 25x, suggesting it's undervalued relative to its potential. With a dividend yield of 1.5% and a balance sheet that allows for share buybacks once profitability stabilizes, the stock offers both growth and income appeal.

Investors should consider a gradual position-building approach, with a focus on the next 12-18 months. Key catalysts to watch include:

- Quarterly updates on average order times and store-level margins.

- Competitor dynamics, particularly Luckin's U.S. expansion.

- The rollout of Clover Vertica brewers and store redesigns.

In conclusion, Starbucks' pivot to simplicity is both a necessity and a strategic masterstroke. By leaning into health trends and operational discipline, the company is laying the groundwork for a comeback. For investors, this could be the moment to sip on the undervalued stock while the winds of change brew in its favor.",,N,,2025-07-07 18:07:38.155246

… It’s just super fast for that.” Caper Cart is part of technology company Instacart, which is known for its home delivery services.
The carts drive customers to spend more in part because they expose people to more marketing materials while shopping, Caper told the Washington Post.
How it works A customer who wants to use a Caper Cart can get one at the entrance.
Moving around the store, the technology senses when items are put in the cart — customers don’t need to scan a barcode.","Imagine going on your weekly grocery shopping trip, filling the cart, tapping a credit card and rolling out of the store without having to put a single item on a checkout conveyor belt.

For a little over a week, customers at the ShopRite in Bethlehem Township have had the option of using a Caper Cart to expedite their trip to the store. Sam Colalillo, whose family owns and operates the store at 4701 Freemansburg Ave., said more than 1,000 customers used the carts in the opening week and the plan is to soon double the current fleet of 20.

“It’s really been great, especially in this area,” Colalillo said during a ribbon-cutting Monday morning that drew several curious customers. “We have the hospitals nearby, we have all these different local office buildings. People come in for kind of a midweek shop or to get dinner and a couple of items. … It’s just super fast for that.”

Caper Cart is part of technology company Instacart, which is known for its home delivery services. Instacart acquired Caper AI in 2021 for $350 million.

Grace Mazier, an implementation associate for Instacart, said the company has been rolling out the carts nationwide in the last three years, including Kroger Stores in the Midwest and Sprouts in the Las Vegas area.

“This particular location has been doing so well,” Mazier said. “They’re averaging about 140 per day, which is insane and super exciting. I can see them getting more carts right now.”

Colallio said the carts were brought in by Wakefern Food Corp., the cooperative that runs ShopRite stores. The Colallio family also owns and operates ShopRites in Yardley, Bucks County, and Clinton, Greenwich and Flemington, New Jersey. It plans to implement the technology at those locations as well.

As part of a partnership with Instacart, ShopRite pays a per-use charge, Colallio said.

“They’ve always been great partners,” Colallio said. “They’re always rolling out technology, trying to make this better for customers.”

According to The Washington Post, an individual cart can cost a merchant $5,000 to $10,000, though many have reported recouping costs within a year.

The carts drive customers to spend more in part because they expose people to more marketing materials while shopping, Caper told the Washington Post. It might recommend milk, for example, if someone puts cereal in the cart; an average shopper’s checkout total increases 18% when using its product, the firm said.

Caper said its tech isn’t meant to replace jobs but instead to free workers to maintain aisles or offer customer service, the Post reported.

Other supermarket chains in the Lehigh Valley have implemented technological advances over the years, with Giant Food Store’s Marty the Robot being the most visible.

A spokesperson for Giant said the chain has no plans at the moment to implement Caper Cart technology, though “we’re always exploring ways to best serve our customers.”

Redner’s spokesperson Eric White said said the company has looked into Caper Cart and discussed using the technology.

“At this time we have not taken any steps to placing them within our stores and continue to monitor their use and efficacy within the grocery industry,” White said. “We have an active and positive partnership with Instacart and will reach out to them if we decide to use these carts within our store operation.”

On the other hand, Wegmans has started its own pilot program with Caper Cart at a location near Syracuse, New York.

“At this time, we are collecting customer feedback with the goal of determining whether smart cart technology is a fit for the unique shopping assortment offered in our stores and if it meets the shopping needs of our customers,” spokesperson Tracy Van Auker said. “Since we are in the early stages of our limited pilot, we aren’t yet able to share any specifics on next steps.”

Weis Markets did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

How it works

A customer who wants to use a Caper Cart can get one at the entrance. The customer can enter loyalty club information on the screen to access coupons and apply discounts, though that isn’t a requirement.

Moving around the store, the technology senses when items are put in the cart — customers don’t need to scan a barcode. For produce, a scale is built into the bottom of the cart and weighs the item automatically. The cart shown to the media had its own Northampton County weights and measures inspection sticker.

The screen shows a tally of what’s added to the cart, and includes a running total cost. If an item is taken out of the cart, it’s removed from the list.

When the customer is ready to check out, there is a special lane for the Caper Carts for cash-paying customers or a code can be accessed on the cart’s screen to let you leave without touching anything further in the store. Receipts are then delivered via text or email.

H.R. 1, President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” was signed into law on July 4, 2025. The sweeping legislation proposes to end a number of climate-focused funding programs and emissions regulations. The bill affects nearly every sector of the economy, but it hits heavy-duty trucks — both electric and diesel-powered — especially hard.

For fleet managers managers, this bill sends a clear message. The federal government is stepping back from its clean truck investment strategy.

The Big Beautiful Bill Puts EV Tax Credits on the Chopping Block

One of the most immediate impacts of H.R. 1 is the proposed repeal of the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit under Section 45W of the Internal Revenue Code. Fleets have used this credit, which provides up to $40,000 per vehicle for eligible commercial electric trucks, to offset the high cost of electrification. The bill terminates this credit outright. Section 112003 cuts off a major financial incentive for adopting battery-electric Class 6–8 trucks.

The section states:

IN GENERAL. — No credit shall be determined under this section with respect to any vehicle acquired after December 31, 2025.

(2) EXCEPTION FOR BINDING CONTRACTS. — Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to vehicles placed in service before January 1, 2033, and acquired pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before May 12, 2025.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. — The amendment made by this section shall apply to vehicles acquired after December 31, 2025.

The bill also proposes to eliminate the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (Section 112004), which helps subsidize the cost of EV charging infrastructure.

IN GENERAL. — Section 30C(i) is amended by striking ‘‘December 31, 2032’’ and inserting ‘‘December

Faced with these headwinds, the company is focusing on cutting costs.
UPS’ rival FedEx FDX is also cutting costs to combat the weak demand scenario.
UPS’ Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of UPS have declined in excess of 24% in a year, underperforming its industry.","It is no secret that United Parcel Service’s UPS bottom line is being hurt by high costs, mainly on the labor front. High labor costs, in addition to softness concerning parcel volumes, are hurting the company’s operations.

Geopolitical uncertainty and high inflation continue to hurt consumer sentiment and growth expectations. The weak demand scenario due to the economic slowdown has led to a decline in the volume of packages shipped. Faced with these headwinds, the company is focusing on cutting costs. As part of this exercise, UPS is offering buyouts to delivery drivers for the first time in its 117-year history. UPS’ full-time drivers are eligible for this offer.

The company reportedly aims to trim its workforce by 20,000 this year, representing approximately 4% of the global workforce and shut 73 facilities to streamline operations and lower labor costs. Notably, expenses on compensation and benefits increased 2.1% year over year in 2024. The same is expected to decrease 2.6% in 2025 from 2024 levels, as per our model.

Apart from the tariff-induced economic uncertainties, UPS’ decision to reduce business with its largest customer, Amazon AMZN, contributed to the decision to trim the workforce. UPS’ management has reached an agreement in principle with Amazon to lower the latter’s volume by more than 50% by June 2026. According to Carol Tome, UPS’ chief executive officer, Amazon was not its most profitable customer.

UPS’ rival FedEx FDX is also cutting costs to combat the weak demand scenario. FedEx reportedly will lay off more than 480 employees as it reshuffles operations through the Network 2.0 initiative. In the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve its long-term profitability. The DRIVE program resulted in $1.8 billion in permanent savings in fiscal 2024. The program resulted in further $2.2 billion cost savings in fiscal 2025.

These cost reduction initiatives include reducing flight frequencies, parking aircraft and cutting staff. For fiscal 2026, management expects to achieve $1 billion of transformation-related savings, which includes DRIVE and Network2.0.

Taken collectively, these project cancellations represent billions of dollars in lost investment and a million tons of planned hydrogen production capacity that will not materialize.","The last 30 days marked a particularly rough period for hydrogen advocates, with a striking series of cancellations and project halts around the globe. The cumulative scale of these decisions underscores how challenging and economically vulnerable the hydrogen-for-energy sector has become. Over the span of approximately four weeks, projects valued at tens of billions in multiple countries have collapsed or been shelved indefinitely, erasing significant planned hydrogen production capacity. These reversals are not merely isolated incidents. They represent a broader recognition by industry leaders and governments that hydrogen, particularly for transportation and energy export, is confronting fundamental economic and technical barriers that optimism alone cannot overcome.

Here’s a structured summary table with estimated hydrogen production values (annual tons), based on typical scale for projects of similar size and stated goals from public plans:

Total estimated annual H₂ production capacity canceled: ~1 million tons/year

Australia’s high-profile CQ-H2 green hydrogen export project at Gladstone became the most notable casualty at the start of July. Originally slated as a AUD$12.5 billion (US$8.13 billion) venture aimed at providing substantial hydrogen exports to Japan and South Korea, the project quickly unraveled when Stanwell Corporation withdrew support, citing ballooning costs and questionable market viability. Gladstone was positioned to become Australia’s hydrogen export flagship, but now serves as a stark symbol of hydrogen’s broader economic uncertainties. The cancellation eliminated planned annual hydrogen production of several hundred thousand tons, dealing a severe blow to Queensland’s ambitions to become a renewable energy export powerhouse.

It’s in this context that other Australian news is of interest. Fortescue recently pulled back from hydrogen with significant retrenchment and leadership changes in its hydrogen group. In May, roughly 90 positions in hydrogen-related roles across Perth and Gladstone were eliminated as the company refocused away from large-scale manufacturing toward research and development aimed at improving efficiency and reducing costs. Mark Hutchinson, CEO of Fortescue Hydrogen Systems, retired ahead of his 65th birthday after less than two years in the position, transitioning to a senior adviser role with marketing responsibilities. Cameron Smith, who previously led the hydrogen systems division, also departed amid these cuts. CEO Dino Otranto has now absorbed operational responsibility for hydrogen and electrification, while Agustin “Gus” Pichot, formerly head of global growth, took on the role of CEO Growth and Energy effective July 1. These changes reflect a significant recalibration, abandoning the earlier ambitious target of producing 15 million tons of hydrogen per year by 2030, in favor of a more cautious, research-driven approach amid weaker-than-expected market conditions.

Germany faced similarly harsh realities. ArcelorMittal, one of Europe’s largest steel producers, abandoned plans to convert its Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt plants to hydrogen-based direct reduced iron and electric arc furnaces. Each of these green steel plants was to cost roughly €1.3 billion (US$1.52 billion), with projected hydrogen consumption amounting to hundreds of thousands of tons annually. ArcelorMittal cited soaring energy costs and insufficient economic incentives as key reasons for pulling the plug.

This abandonment was part of what prompted my recent assessment of different new steel approaches, which found that hydrogen-based iron and steelmaking remains fundamentally disadvantaged compared to emerging alternatives. With hydrogen typically priced around $5 to $8 per kilogram, even optimistic scenarios of $3 to $4 per kilogram still render it uneconomical for steel production at scale. Direct reduction processes relying on hydrogen incur substantial energy losses through electrolysis, storage, compression, and handling, inevitably inflating steel production costs beyond competitive thresholds. Molten oxide electrolysis, on the other hand, becomes viable with electricity at $0.03 to $0.05 per kWh, delivering steel at costs approaching $170 to $250 per ton assuming it reaches full commercialization.

Similarly, biomethane-based direct reduction combined with carbon capture can be economically attractive where biomass is abundant and sequestration sites are nearby. Flash ironmaking paired with natural gas and carbon capture achieves steel costs comfortably below $200 per ton. Hydrogen is thus hampered not by technological maturity, but by structural economic limitations that alternative processes inherently avoid. For steel decarbonization strategies, it’s clear the future belongs to methods that offer fundamentally superior cost structures and energy efficiencies.

Germany’s struggles did not end there. E.ON, a major utility, canceled its planned 20-megawatt green hydrogen facility in Essen and also withdrew from the regional H₂ Ruhr pipeline initiative. These actions further reduced Europe’s planned hydrogen capacity and infrastructure, again driven by unmanageable economic realities.

In India, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) abruptly terminated its ₹2 billion (US$23.3 million) green hydrogen hub tender in early July. The project’s cancellation included the refunding of all tender fees, highlighting how rapidly India has reversed course amid growing doubts about hydrogen’s economic competitiveness. While India’s government had previously heralded hydrogen as a key component of its decarbonization strategy, economic pragmatism now appears to have overshadowed earlier enthusiasm.

Spain’s once-promising Repsol and Hydric Power joint venture at Puertollano similarly collapsed. The green hydrogen project, valued at more than €100 million (US$117 million), faced immediate shelving in July due to both technical and economic infeasibility. Spain had touted Puertollano as a cornerstone of its green hydrogen ambitions, yet the project’s failure signals severe underlying structural problems in hydrogen deployment even within supportive policy environments.

The United Kingdom also saw major hydrogen initiatives retreat. Air Products scrapped its £2 billion (US$2.72 billion) green hydrogen import terminal project in Immingham on the Humber Estuary. The facility, initially seen as critical for the UK’s hydrogen supply and industrial decarbonization plans, fell victim to policy uncertainty and inadequate governmental financial backing. This cancellation underscores the risks inherent in hydrogen infrastructure investments that rely heavily on continuous policy and subsidy support.

In the United States, the picture was equally bleak. BP indefinitely paused its blue hydrogen and carbon capture project at its refinery in Whiting, Indiana. Once considered a potential multi-billion-dollar flagship for blue hydrogen in America’s Midwest, the project stalled amid rising skepticism over carbon capture’s viability and shifting political priorities. Cleveland-Cliffs canceled its $500 million hydrogen-based steel facility planned for Middletown, Ohio, depriving the industry of another major hydrogen consumer. ExxonMobil’s $330 million clean hydrogen initiative at its Baytown, Texas refinery was also halted after federal funding evaporated under new political realities, leaving substantial planned hydrogen production capacity stranded.

Taken collectively, these project cancellations represent billions of dollars in lost investment and a million tons of planned hydrogen production capacity that will not materialize. The ripple effect on hydrogen-based transportation and infrastructure projects is significant. Without reliable, economically viable hydrogen supplies, many downstream initiatives from heavy trucks and marine vessels to industrial heat and green steelmaking face substantially increased operational risks and reduced credibility. The cancellations of June and July reinforce what has become increasingly clear throughout 2025: hydrogen’s economic model, particularly for transportation and export, remains fragile and heavily dependent on external subsidies, stable policy frameworks, and optimistic assumptions about market uptake.

It’s in context of these billions in evaporating hydrogen plays that I updated my hydrogen deathwatch list today, finding more firms that had given up the ghost, either through complete fiscal meltdown or by quietly pivoting away from hydrogen. Over 20% of the firms on my list, 33 of 162, have either gone into receivership or pivoted to something useful.

These widespread reversals should serve as a critical wake-up call for policymakers and industrial strategists still vainly hoping to leverage hydrogen as a central pillar of energy transition efforts. Electrification and battery storage solutions, by contrast, continue gaining momentum, attracting investment and achieving reliable cost reductions year over year. Hydrogen proponents must grapple realistically with the fundamental economics at play.

Remember, this is only four weeks worth of failures. They’ve been ongoing since the beginning of 2025, with Michael Liebreich putting up #HydrogenSouffle LinkedIn posts almost daily. BNEF just reported on its database of hydrogen contracts and still only 13% of the 299 hydrogen contacts in their database have firm off takers. This is a radically small number of contracts and a homeopathic number of firm agreements given the massive ambitions for 2030, as well as the massive announcements of the past few years.

This disastrous month underscores that promises alone cannot sustain a hydrogen economy. Realism, pragmatism, and a clear-eyed approach to economically sustainable energy solutions must now prevail if meaningful progress is to be made. That means hydrogen will be reserved for what it is absolutely required for, almost entirely industrial feedstocks, and nothing else.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-7-2025-06_44_11-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-07-07 16:11:39.090437
ID24,Levi Strauss,2025-07-07 19:14:34+00:00,Retail Dive,The retail inventory method vs. cost accounting in the tariff era,Daphne Howland,,,,,https://www.retaildive.com/news/rim-retail-inventory-method-vs-cost-accounting-under-tariffs-Walmart/751824/,"Cost accounting is also more accurate because it leverages the actual cost of inventory, according to Mike Sansone, partner in Kearney’s consumer practice.
“With tariffs, RIM will, basically, rapidly revalue your inventory, much more quickly than cost accounting.
Under RIM accounting, cost spikes are reflected in the retail-to-cost ratio but not at the item level, leading to broader adjustments in markups, he said.
“All methods will experience the impact of tariffs, but cost accounting will more precisely reflect the effect at the item level compared to the retail method,” he said.
Major chains still using the retail inventory method include Walmart, Target, Dillard’s, Kohl’s, J.C. Penney and Dollar Tree.","To determine the value of ending inventory and, ultimately, margins, many retailers have stuck with an accounting practice known as the retail inventory method — in some cases for more than 100 years — despite a slew of downsides.

Now there’s another reason to switch from RIM to a cost-based accounting method: see-sawing tariffs under current U.S. trade policy.

It’s not just that RIM is outdated, although cost-based accounting is better equipped to take full advantage of digital tools, experts say. Cost accounting is also more accurate because it leverages the actual cost of inventory, according to Mike Sansone, partner in Kearney’s consumer practice.

“With tariffs, RIM will, basically, rapidly revalue your inventory, much more quickly than cost accounting. But I didn't suddenly bring in more product, right?” he said by video conference. “It's a revaluation of the inventory that is not really grounded in reality.”

The ups and downs of tariffs

RIM uses a cost complement — a ratio of the cost of goods available divided by the retail price of goods available. A century ago this was a brilliant formula for pencil-and-paper estimates of inventory and margins, as merchandise flowed in and out of stores.

Visibility into those line items fogs up easily, though, because the method works best when markons, markups and markdowns are fairly consistent, according to Suni Shamapande, partner at PwC U.S. Under RIM accounting, cost spikes are reflected in the retail-to-cost ratio but not at the item level, leading to broader adjustments in markups, he said.

Enter today’s U.S. tariff policy, where consistency is out the window. Using RIM, all inventory — including older inventory unaffected by tariffs — is subject to the ratio. Margins fluctuate wildly as tariffs move up, up again, or down.

Cost accounting — the alternative that Macy’s and Nordstrom recently embraced for reasons unrelated to tariffs — instead uses the actual cost of goods at the item level. This provides tariffs’ impact on margins, cost of goods sold and inventory valuation only for the stock hit by the import duties.

There can still be some aberration under cost accounting because different approaches — variations like FIFO (first in, first out), LIFO (last in, first out) or weighted average — can yield different results when there’s a change in input costs like tariffs, according to Shamapande. But not as much as with RIM.

“All methods will experience the impact of tariffs, but cost accounting will more precisely reflect the effect at the item level compared to the retail method,” he said.

The repercussions

The consequences are playing out at retailers in different ways and to varying degrees. Major chains still using the retail inventory method include Walmart, Target, Dillard’s, Kohl’s, J.C. Penney and Dollar Tree.

At Walmart, the method is making it difficult to assess how tariffs are impacting performance, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told analysts in May. The company pulled its near-term guidance as a result.

Rainey described how, under the ratio used in RIM, rising prices drive markups on inventory and merchandise margin gains, while markdowns offset that. Walmart U.S. has always employed RIM — “it's not new for us, and it's a common method of accounting in the retail industry” — but the up-and-down tariffs are injecting volatility into the exercise, he said.

“The magnitude of these swings, both positive and negative, given the level of additional costs that could be applied to the inventory that we're purchasing right now, are unprecedented in our business and could result in swings in margin and earnings by quarter,” Rainey said.

Walmart has been vocal on the issue, but this is likely also affecting other retailers, analysts say.

“Walmart's disclosure that its inventory accounting might cause a 2Q gross margin benefit has stirred some questions,” Bank of America analysts led by Lorraine Hutchinson said in a May research note. “A key reason that [Walmart] called this out is that it has started raising prices, but not all products in inventory carry tariffs yet.”

Because gross margins factor into buyers’ evaluations and compensation, RIM often plays a part in buying behavior at apparel retailers and department stores. A sudden revaluation due to tariffs can throw a wrench into inventory planning, according to Kearney’s Sansone.

Mostly, though, the RIM-induced effect seen at Walmart will be less pronounced at any retailer less willing or able to quickly adjust prices, according to Bank of America analysts.

“Apparel and footwear retailers have much less dynamic pricing and typically can't change prices quickly (most clothing is ticketed at the factory well in advance of hitting the shelves),” Hutchinson said. “We might see more dynamic pricing in off-price, which has a more advanced distribution network and may have started changing tickets already. But it will take some time for the traditional apparel retailers to move their prices.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/wtnzX68Do_Hl45i5DgGwO2Fm7ZPbQgSmlWGaF6VzHRQ/g:nowe:0:31/c:1024:578/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjIyMTg5NzQwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-07 17:10:05.198679

Some industry leaders see these efforts as key to solving the industry’s much talked about recruitment and talent issues.

One novelty at the Sydney event this year is an interactive Q&A session where delegates can ask a panel pressing questions about their own personal careers. Julie Morgan (pictured) is one of the panellists for “Off the record: Career advice from insurance trailblazers.” Morgan is head of claims in Australia for the global insurer AXA XL.

However, Morgan said, during her career, she has found two things that stand out and really help. “First, seeking out the right role models and mentors, which are different and change at each stage of your career, with a focus on always building renewing your supporter and sponsor network during your progression,” she said.

Secondly, Morgan suggested that insurance professionals actively risk manage their own careers and ask questions that will help them improve their prospects. “Seek feedback that is going to inform how confident and impressive your current performance is so that you do actively make corrections in how you engage with those influencing your career,” she said.

The AXA XL leader said the industry is always looking for driven, passionate people “who get the job done. You will be very happily surprised by the support and guidance that gets retuned to you by leadership and experienced professionals if you are eager to learn and develop on what will progress your career and meet the needs of the business,” she said.

Big insurers and mentorships

Mentorships of some kind are in place at many of the country’s insurance firms. The big insurers, including Suncorp Group, Insurance Australia Group (IAG) and QBE all have well established programs.

“Mentorship programs are one of many levers that a business can use to help lift our female talent,” said Sydney-based Claudio Saita, the firm’s head of Australia and Pacific, at the time of the launch.

One of Morgan’s co-panellists, Ricarda Simon, is also a very strong supporter of mentorships. Simon is a senior partner with global insurance recruitment firm, Eliot Partnership. Her work includes talent advisory projects. “One of the most effective steps the insurance industry and its stakeholders can take to address the growing skills gap is to invest in structured, cross-generational talent development that combines mentorship with modern capability building,” said Simon in a recent IB interview.

Dollar Tree has completed the previously revealed sale of its Family Dollar business segment to Brigade Capital Management LP and Macellum Capital Management LLC for $1 billion. Net proceeds from the sale are estimated to total approximately $800 million, comprising $665 million paid at closing and approximately $135 million as a result of the monetization of cash prior to closing through a reduction of net working capital.

Prominent retail executive Duncan MacNaughton was appointed chairman and CEO of Family Dollar back in May. MacNaughton is no stranger to the Family Dollar business, having previously been its president and COO. With more than 30 years of experience guiding large-scale businesses through growth and transformation, his resume also includes stints at Kraft Food, H-E-B, Albertsons, Supervalu and particularly Walmart, where he was EVP, chief merchandising and marketing officer.

Jason Nordin will remain as president of Family Dollar.

Under the dedicated leadership team and new private equity owners, Brigade and Macellum, along with Arkhouse Management Co., Family Dollar is focused on building a stronger, more agile organization.

Family Dollar’s headquarters will remain in Chesapeake, Va., and it will continue its mission to “serve the underserved,” focused on the opportunity to build a “new Family Dollar.”

The discount retailer was founded in 1959 in Charlotte, N.C., with the goal of offering high-quality merchandise at affordable prices. Today, Family Dollar has more than 7,500 locations nationwide.

“This is a defining moment for Family Dollar — a chance to return to our roots, refocus on our unique strengths and build a future tailored to the communities we proudly serve,"" said MacNaughton.

Costco customers are being urged to inspect recent purchases after the retailer issued multiple product recalls spanning a range of household and personal items over significant safety hazards. The recall affects purchases made both in-store and through the retailer’s direct-from-manufacturer program, Costco Next.

Among the most urgent warnings are recalls for two U-shaped window air conditioners: one from Danby, sold between June 2021 and February 2022, and another from Midea, sold from June 2021 through May 2025.

According to safety notices, these units may retain water that doesn’t drain quickly enough, potentially creating a breeding ground for mold. Mold exposure may pose health risks, especially for individuals with respiratory conditions. Costco has asked owners of these units to stop using immediately and has offered free repair kits or refunds.

Portable charging devices have also been recalled. Two Anker power banks, models A1257 and A1263, have been recalled for safety risks related to overheating. Overheating may cause plastic components to melt, smoke, or catch fire.

Customers are instructed to stop using the devices and contact Anker for a replacement or refund, provided they submit photos of the unit and its serial number marked as “recalled.”

Anker's recall reminds customers that recalled lithium-ion batteries must be disposed of differently than other batteries, because they present a greater risk of fire. It’s recommended to check your municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center for proper disposal.

Tire safety concerns have also emerged for specific Bridgestone and Michelin tires sold at Costco.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 tires in size 235/40R19 were recalled because they lack the required Department of Transportation (DOT) certification marking on their sidewalls. While they meet performance standards, their use without proper labeling violates federal regulations.

Also recalled are the Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires in size 185/60R15C, which may experience tread separation, which could increase the risk of an accident.

Other items now under recall include:

BowFlex 552 adjustable dumbbells, which have had reports of weight plates detaching during use.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer, following reports that its lid may open while under pressure, risking burns.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler, which can pinch or crush fingers when the handle is in use.

Segway Ninebot Kickscooter and Sublue Underwater Scooter, both recalled over mechanical and electrical hazards.

Topo Chico Mineral Water (18-pack) sold in certain Texas and Louisiana stores, recalled for potential contamination with pseudomonas, a bacteria that may affect immunocompromised individuals.

A selection of Fresh and Ready Foods sandwiches and salads sold in business centers across four Western states due to possible Listeria contamination.

Certain Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu medications, which were pulled January 2025 for potential foreign material contamination.

Costco Gave Directions For Customers To Receive Repairs Or Refunds Following The Recalls

Customers who purchased a Danby brand U-shaped window air conditioner between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022, Midea brand U-shaped window air conditioner between June 2021 and May 2025 should stop using the units “immediately.

Costco members who purchased Anker power banks should discontinue use due to a potential issue with the lithium-ion batteries. They can submit to receive a replacement power bank.

Costco also issued recalls for Bridgestone Blizzak 6 tires and Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires. The Bridgestone tires, “do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 139.” The Michelin tires are being recalled because “chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block.”

BowFlex 552 adjustable dumbbells are also being recalled by Costco “for posing an impact hazard” if plates dislodge during use.

Global organizations are in constant need of strategic partners to support their transformation to enhance efficiency and accelerate growth. This continues to be a key driver of the Digital BPS market and WNS targets revenue growth of +7% to +11% for FY2026.

Immediate unlocking of value

This transaction will position Capgemini as a leader in Digital BPS blending horizontal and vertical process expertise, with a global footprint. With combined revenues of €1.9 billion in 2024 in Digital BPS, this will strengthen Capgemini’s ability to accompany clients on their business and technology transformation journeys.

The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities. It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.

Intelligent Operations – Agentic AI creates a paradigm shift that opens a strategic opportunity

The largest opportunity for global organizations to create value with Gen AI and Agentic AI lies in the fundamental redesign of their operations and business processes. It will attract a significant share of their AI investments as they seek to become AI-powered companies to lead their market. This is creating demand for a new type of business process services: Intelligent Operations.

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI. It addresses clients’ goal of efficiency, speed and agility through process hyper-automation, while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI and digital.

AI technologies trigger a paradigm shift in delivering business process services: from labour-intensive services to being consulting-led and tech-driven. In parallel, client focus has shifted from efficiency gains toward end-to-end value creation and business outcomes, opening opportunities to add non-linear revenues (i.e. transaction-based, subscription-based or outcome-based models). This is creating a rapidly growing market opportunity.

Combining the capabilities and scale required to lead in Intelligent Operations

Both Capgemini and WNS are already pioneering Intelligent Operations. Capgemini with its consulting-led end-to-end transformation of processes, advanced AI tools and technology stacks, and BPS platforms, while WNS has developed a set of sector-specific AI-led solutions recently augmented by the acquisition of Kipi.ai[7] to strengthen its data, analytics and AI capabilities.

The combination of Capgemini and WNS will act as a catalyst to lead in Intelligent Operations providing the required scale and unique set of capabilities from Strategy & Transformation consulting, to horizontal and sector expertise, platform offerings to deep AI and technology capabilities.

This combination will also leverage the significant investments made by Capgemini in AI through training, offers and its 25 strategic partnerships, including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and NVIDIA. The Group’s leadership is recognized by its clients, with over €900 million of Gen AI bookings in 2024, and by market analysts such as Forrester, IDC and ISG.

This transaction will reinforce Capgemini as a business and transformation partner to those enterprises who want to become AI-powered businesses.

Value creation

Based on calendar year 2024 published information, the combined entities would have generated a revenue of €23.3 billion at a 13.6% operating margin6 in 2024.

The Group expects accretion to normalized EPS, before synergies from the combination, of 4% in 2026.

Capgemini expects revenue synergies run-rate of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027. Costs and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach an annual pretax run-rate of between €50 million and €70 million by the end of 2027.

With the benefits of these synergies, the accretion on normalized earnings per share should reach 7% in 2027.

Smooth integration

WNS and Capgemini have a natural cultural fit and share common values that will facilitate a smooth integration of the teams, helped by the Group’s track record of successful integrations. Furthermore, the integration will be straightforward into Capgemini’s Global Business Services activities.

For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect such forward-looking statements, please refer, without limitations, to the risks identified in Capgemini’s most recent Universal Registration Document (Document d’Enregistrement Universel) available on Capgemini’s website (https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/). Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and future prospects include, but are not limited to, the following risks relating to the Transaction, including in respect of the satisfaction of closing conditions to the Transaction on a timely basis or at all, including the ability to obtain required regulatory approvals and the required scheme shareholder approval; unanticipated difficulties and/or expenditures relating to the Transaction and any related financing; uncertainties as to the timing of the Transaction; litigation relating to, or other challenges to, the Transaction; the impact of the Transaction on each company’s business operations (including the threatened or actual loss of employees, clients or suppliers); the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining cost savings and synergies from the Transaction; incurrence of unexpected costs and expenses in connection with the Transaction; risks related to changes in the financial, equity and debt markets; and risks related to political, economic and market conditions. In addition, the risks to which WNS’ business is subject, including those risks described in WNS’ periodic reports filed with the SEC, could adversely affect the Transaction and, following the completion of the Transaction, the Company’s operations and future prospects. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for Capgemini and WNS to predict or assess the impact of every factor that may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Specifically, statements of estimated cost savings and synergies relate to future actions and circumstances which, by their nature involve, risks, uncertainties and contingencies. As a result, the cost savings and synergies referred to may not be achieved, may be achieved later or sooner than estimated, or those achieved could be materially different from those estimated. Due to the scale of the Post-Transaction Group, there may be additional changes to the Post-Transaction Group’s operations. As a result, and given the fact that the changes relate to the future, the resulting cost synergies may be materially greater or less than those estimated.

Forward-looking statements contained herein are only based upon currently available information and speak only as of the date of this announcement, and Capgemini expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Capgemini’s expectations with regard thereto or change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based.

Dive Brief:

Food giant Kraft Heinz is recalling more than 360,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer turkey bacon products for possible listeria contamination.

Affected products include fully cooked turkey bacon produced from April 24 through June 11, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Products were shipped across the U.S., with some exported to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

No illnesses have been reported, FSIS said. The possible contamination was discovered through Kraft Heinz's internal laboratory testing.

Dive Insight:

Major food companies have grappled with high-profile listeria recalls. Last September, Boar's Head closed a facility months after an outbreak led to nine deaths and more than 7 million pounds of recalled meat.

Deli meats and ready-to-eat products are among the foods most susceptible to listeria contamination, since pathogens aren't destroyed in the refrigeration process. There were 65 recalls over potential listeria contamination in 2024, compared to 47 the prior year, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.

Following large-scale outbreaks last year, the USDA released a plan to ramp up listeria inspections at meat plants. However, a scientific advisory committee tasked with overseeing the regulatory strategy was terminated in March as part of the Trump administration's effort to slash costs and streamline the government.

Consuming food contaminated with listeria can lead to Listeriosis, which can be especially harmful for pregnant women, newborns and those over the age of 65. Symptoms can appear sometimes weeks after eating contaminated food, according to the FSIS.

The Kraft Heinz recall includes Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original products across a variety of package sizes. Affected products include ""use by"" dates ranging from as early as July 18 to as late as Sept. 4.

That’s where Intelligent Operations comes in, and that’s exactly where Capgemini is aiming to lead.
WNS brings deep industry experience and a strong digital BPS business into the mix.
Capgemini’s goal is clear: build a consulting-led, AI-native services business that can deliver outcomes across the entire value chain.
If successful, Capgemini will walk away with more than just a stronger BPS portfolio, it will have a clearer, more scalable path to lead in the age of AI-powered intelligent operations.","Capgemini is making a calculated move to reshape its business services portfolio with the $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS. It’s not just about scale, it’s about readiness for a new model of delivery. As AI adoption moves past experimentation, enterprises are under pressure to operationalize it in meaningful, measurable ways. That’s where Intelligent Operations comes in, and that’s exactly where Capgemini is aiming to lead.

WNS brings deep industry experience and a strong digital BPS business into the mix. With capabilities spanning analytics, automation, and AI-powered service delivery across sectors like banking, insurance, travel, and healthcare, WNS gives Capgemini a ready-made platform to serve clients looking to go beyond traditional outsourcing. This isn’t about cutting costs at the margins. It’s about using Agentic AI and GenAI to redesign how processes run, decisions get made, and value is created.

Capgemini’s goal is clear: build a consulting-led, AI-native services business that can deliver outcomes across the entire value chain. By integrating WNS, it strengthens its BPS revenue base (a combined €1.9 billion in 2024), opens up cross-selling opportunities across complementary client bases, and extends its presence in North America, still the largest market for managed and digital services.

Agentic AI is central to the pitch. Unlike basic automation or rule-based workflows, Agentic AI enables systems to act autonomously, adapt over time, and deliver insights with context. That’s a different level of capability, and one that demands new approaches to operations. This acquisition positions Capgemini to meet that demand head-on, with the vertical depth, tech stack, and service delivery capacity to back it up.

From a financial perspective, the deal is expected to be EPS accretive starting in 2026, with additional value unlocked through revenue and cost synergies by 2027. But beyond the numbers, this move signals a strategic pivot. Capgemini isn’t just responding to where the services market is heading, it’s trying to shape it. And in an environment where AI adoption is moving fast and client expectations are evolving even faster, that’s exactly what it needs to do.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. If successful, Capgemini will walk away with more than just a stronger BPS portfolio, it will have a clearer, more scalable path to lead in the age of AI-powered intelligent operations.",https://files.cyberriskalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/capgemini-4.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:12:00.953228

Under new leadership, both companies have placed a renewed focus on digital operations.

Kroger: Moving full steam ahead on omnichannel strategies to enhance both its operations and customer experiences, Kroger launched a new e-commerce business unit aimed at centralizing operations. Yael Cosset, SVP and CIO at Kroger, is heading up the e-commerce unit.

Sargent said that the move and Cosset’s appointment will propel growth in Kroger’s e-commerce operations, which took in $13 billion sales during the most recent fiscal year. “Accelerating Kroger’s e-commerce growth is a top priority,” added Sargent. “As the architect of Kroger’s digital strategy, Yael will continue to make it easier for customers to shop for our fresh, affordable food.”

“The interim CEO, Ron Sargent, has not been timid about moving forward strategically,” noted Carol Levenso, director of research at independent bond research firm Gimme Credit. “He has consolidated the companyʼs e-commerce operations, announced the closing over the next 18 months of 60 unprofitable stores and has begun a comprehensive review of the e-commerce business and noncore assets.”

On the retail media side of things, Kroger Precision Marketing (KPM) brought incremental sales reporting to self-service programmatic campaigns. Incremental sales measurement is now available for qualified campaigns placed through The Trade Desk. The new capability isolates the impact of media spend by comparing exposed audiences with a control group that mirrors the advertising audience. Progressive Grocer was able to find out more from Brian Spencer, KPM’s marketing director, this past February.

Albertsons: Meanwhile, during Albertson' Q3 earnings in January, then-CEO Vivek Sankaran observed that retail media is one of the grocer’s biggest opportunities for business reinvestment. Since then, the company’s retail media arm has revealed several advancements.

The Albertsons Media Collective launched an API that will enable advertisers to integrate Albertsons campaign performance data into their own measurement models for analysis. Complementing these efforts, Albertsons Media Collective is partnering with TransUnion to offer its advertisers TruAudience marketing mix modeling measurement to unlock ease and efficiency in comparing performance across retailers and channels.

In March, the Albertsons Media Collective extended its partnership with omnichannel advertising management platform ADvendio. The retail media arm for Albertsons first adopted the platform last year to simplify its advertising workflows, improve integration between sales and ad order management, and automate important processes.

Albertsons Media Collective also recently launched an in-store digital display network pilot through a partnership with STRATACACHE Inc. In addition to creating a more engaging shopping experience for customers, the program will help provide insights through advanced measurement capabilities for brand partners, allowing for proof of play, direct sales attribution and sales lift.

[RELATED: Albertsons Focuses on 4 Digital Platforms for Growth]

In addition, shortly following its failed merger with Kroger, Albertsons began reorganizing its regional structure. The grocer is combining its Intermountain and Denver divisions, and also reorganizing itself into three regions: East, West and California.

The region that now encompasses most of Idaho, Montana and much of Wyoming, as well as Colorado, will be known as the Mountain West Division.

An Albertsons representative confirmed the divisional consolidation to Progressive Grocer, sharing that the changes will help the company “operate in new and innovative ways as we serve our customers and communities.”

Private Label

Store brands continue to provide strength and growth opportunities for grocers. This is an area where both Kroger and Albertsons have invested their dollars.

Kroger: In Kroger’s first quarter of fiscal 2025, private label outperformed national brands for the seventh straight quarter. In March, the company’s assortment of products sold under its Our Brands umbrella added five new items: Salad Kits, Kettle Style Tortilla Chips, Restaurant Style Italian Dressing, Organic Instant Mushroom Tea, and Muffins. The retailer is on track to launch more than 900 new items in 2025.

Albertsons: For its part, Albertsons launched its latest Own Brand, Chef’s Counter. The new private label is first debuting with a selection of ready-to-cook marinated meats. Albertsons plans to expand its Chef’s Counter line next year by introducing premium selections in the deli and frozen sections, along with globally inspired products in the center store. To celebrate the launch, Albertsons partnered with renowned chef and TV personality Antonia Lofaso as the brand’s first ambassador.

Cincinnati-based Kroger employs nearly 410,000 associates who serve more than 11 million customers daily through an e-commerce and store experience under a variety of banner names. The grocer is No. 4 on The PG 100, Progressive Grocer’s 2025 list of the top food and consumables retailers in North America.

As of Feb. 22, Albertsons Cos. operated 2,270 retail food and drug stores with 1,728 pharmacies, 405 associated fuel centers, 22 dedicated distribution centers and 19 manufacturing facilities. The Boise, Idaho-based company operates stores across 34 states and the District of Columbia under more than 20 well-known banners.

The collaboration combines advanced steelmaking technologies with next-generation electrocoat solutions.
During the paint shop phase, PPG’s advanced electrocoat technologies provide superior corrosion protection while also minimizing environmental impact.
These technologies help reduce emissions from component use by 20% and cut GHG emissions by 10%.
“We already offer solutions that can deliver significant CO2 reductions today,” said Elena Uta, product development manager for breakthrough products automotive, ArcelorMittal Global R&D.","PPG and global steel leader ArcelorMittal have announced a major step forward in reducing the carbon footprint of automotive manufacturing. The collaboration combines advanced steelmaking technologies with next-generation electrocoat solutions. The results were presented at the recent SURCAR automotive painting conference in Cannes.

The study revealed that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the steel material required to build a vehicle can be reduced by up to 30% by using ArcelorMittal’s electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking process, along with lightweighting strategies such as its ArcelorMittal Multi Part Integration (MPI) solution and the application of its third-generation advanced high-strength steels (AHSS). These innovations not only lower emissions but also enhance structural performance and design flexibility.

During the paint shop phase, PPG’s advanced electrocoat technologies provide superior corrosion protection while also minimizing environmental impact. These technologies help reduce emissions from component use by 20% and cut GHG emissions by 10%. This aligns with increasingly stringent environmental and health regulations.

The companies also highlighted the success of the PPG Zircobond thin-film pretreatment technology. PPG Zircobond technology is a benchmark for sustainable surface treatment in the automotive industry.

“This case study is more than a technical achievement, it’s a blueprint for how collaboration across the value chain can deliver real climate impact,” said Thierry Destruhaut, PPG customer sustainability business partner, Automotive OEM Coatings.

ArcelorMittal’s MPI solution helps carmakers build vehicles more efficiently. It uses strong steel and special laser-welding technology to combine multiple parts into one, reducing the number of components and simplifying assembly. MPI works with all types of powertrains and is especially useful for making battery packs, chassis and body structures in electric and small vehicles. This smart design approach cuts production time, saves materials, lowers CO2 emissions and helps manufacturers meet their environmental goals.

“We already offer solutions that can deliver significant CO2 reductions today,” said Elena Uta, product development manager for breakthrough products automotive, ArcelorMittal Global R&D. “That’s why close collaboration across the value chain is essential. Our advanced steel solutions, including third-generation AHSS and our MPI concept, help OEMs lower emissions while optimizing vehicle performance.”

Rates of decline in both new orders and output accelerated in June 2025, leading to the sharpest cutback in purchasing for almost a year, S&P Global said in its latest monthly survey of around 400 companies.

The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell to 48.8 in June from 49.5 in May, remaining below the 50.0 neutral threshold for the fourth consecutive month. A score below 50 indicates economic contraction.

“A faster drop in input purchases combined with stalling hiring activity suggests that firms expect demand to remain low and are thereby looking to make cost savings,” said David Owen, senior economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

He said that the “downbeat” sentiment reflects subdued hopes for order books and concerns that geopolitical risks could cause greater economic disruption.

Originally published on U.S. Bank company blog

MINNEAPOLIS - U.S. Bank released its third Small Business Perspective survey report, revealing how owners across the country are responding to an environment defined by rapid change. The nationwide survey of 1,000 small business owners explored how they are navigating challenges ranging from economic stressors to the rise of generative AI, all while remaining focused on long-term growth, succession planning, and leaving a lasting legacy.

""This year's survey makes it clear that small business owners are committed to future-proofing their businesses in response to today's economic climate and rapid technological change,"" said Shruti Patel, U.S. Bank's Chief Product Officer for Business Banking. ""From embracing generative AI to responding to shifting economic conditions like tariffs and thinking proactively about succession, owners are serious about the future of their businesses. There is a real opportunity - and responsibility - for financial institutions to show up as strategic partners in helping small businesses navigate what's next.""

Handing the Reins to the Next Generation

With more than half of U.S. small business owners now over age 55, succession planning is becoming increasingly urgent. While many owners are not yet ready to step away - with only 54% having created a succession plan - new generations are preparing to take their place: more than one-third (36%) of Gen Z and Millennial owners say they plan to acquire a business from a retiring owner.

The report reveals a striking gap between intention and action. While 85% of surveyed participants say they originally became an owner to create something they could pass on, and 84% wanted to create generational wealth for their family, only 54% have a formal succession plan in place.

A growing number of owners (62%) have seen their retirement timelines accelerate in the past five years. But for many, navigating succession is a challenge:

* 62% find the process overwhelming

* 56% worry they won't get a reasonable price for their business when it's time to sell

* 53% lack the proper resources or guidance to plan for the future of their business

Owners with strong business performance were more likely to have a succession plan in place: 64% of those with a plan reported significant growth over the past year, compared to 50% of those without a plan.

Nearly 4 in 10 small business owners (37%) say they plan to sell their business in the next 12 months, suggesting how quickly transitions of ownership may be approaching for some businesses. However, retiring business owners are not the only ones looking to sell, with a higher number of Gen Z and Millennial owners (41%) than Boomers and Gen X (33%) saying they plan to sell their business.

While the small business landscape has changed dramatically over the years, the motivations that originally inspired owners still drive them today. Most remain deeply committed to their work: 86% want to continue running their business as long as possible, and 87% are hopeful they'll leave behind a positive legacy when they eventually step away.

Economic Pressures are Influencing How Owners Operate

The need for small business owners to make long-term plans is reinforced by the day-to-day worries they are facing. Respondents reported their top macroeconomic stressors as:

* The economic environment (98%)

* Inflation or increased costs of materials / supplies (92%)

* Competition (92%)

* The ability of consumers to maintain their spending (86%)

* Fraud or cybersecurity threats (85%)

* Obtaining enough funding to support my business (84%)

Among other stressors small business owners cited, 4 out of 5 (81%) owners felt at least somewhat stressed about tariffs.

Despite these stressors, 96% of owners reported their business as currently successful and 88% saw growth in the past year. To manage pressures and position their businesses for the future, many owners are prioritizing key steps in the year ahead, including focusing on revenue (48%), ensuring enough staff (33%), improving company efficiency and cost-effectiveness (32%), and reacting to the general economic landscape such as inflation and recession risk (29%).

To get a pulse check on the most current sentiment, U.S. Bank conducted a follow-up survey of 500 small business leaders during the month of May. While stress levels on the economic environment were similarly high, two-thirds (66%) said the country's economy is moving in the right direction, with only 18% saying it's going in the wrong direction. This sentiment was even stronger among younger business leaders (Gen Z and Millennial), with 74% saying it was moving in the right direction, vs. 52% of leaders from older generations (Gen X and Boomer).

Despite this optimism, a majority (58%) of the leaders expressed at least some concern that tariffs may impact their business operations, and 57% expect their input costs to go up as a result of tariffs with most expecting a cost increase between 1-10%. At the same time, leaders were slightly more likely to anticipate a positive rather than negative impact from tariffs across several business factors - including cost of goods, customer demand, margin profitability, capital investments, and labor/HR - but these expectations were generally modest, with most leaders expressing a neutral or only slightly positive outlook on the potential effects of tariffs.

Small Business Owners are Turning to Gen AI and Digital Tools to Stay Competitive

As small business owners look to create long-term success for their businesses, they are embracing generative AI (Gen AI) and digital tools. Nearly 6 in 10 (57%) are currently using or plan to implement Gen AI solutions in the next year. Among those using it, the top applications include content creation (44%), data analysis and information gathering (41%), and marketing and sales strategies (39%).

The majority of owners using Gen AI have found that adoption doesn't require a massive investment. Nearly 7 in 10 (68%) Gen AI users report spending less than $50 a month on it, and nearly 1 in 5 (18%) are using free tools or subscriptions. These tools allow users to spend more time on the personal connection they have with their customers (88%).

Still, the rise of AI is not without tension. Over 8 in 10 (81%) report keeping up with technological advancements such as Gen AI is stressful, and 56% worry their business (or products / services) will be replaced by Gen AI or automation.

Beyond AI, digital tools are seen as essential now more than ever. The number of owners who view digital tools as very important or essential jumped a striking 15 percentage points from last year (87% in 2025 vs. 72% in 2024). At the same time, 63% say they're overwhelmed by the number of tools needed to run their business and 82% say consolidating them is a priority.

Looking at payment methods, nearly half (48%) of owners still report cash as a primary method of in-person payment. However, newer methods of payment are catching up with 42% reporting tap-to-pay as a primary method.

Despite Challenges, Most Owners Would Do It Again

Even amid today's business challenges, most small business owners remain grounded in their original purpose that inspired them to become entrepreneurs. When asked why they launched their business, 90% say they wanted to be their own boss, 88% cited a desire to control their financial future, and 86% wanted their passions to be part of their work.

Legacy has also played a defining role. More than two-thirds (67%) of owners come from a family of entrepreneurs, and 62% took over a relative's business to carry on their family legacy. For Gen Z and Millennial entrepreneurs, however, the path to ownership has often been shaped by necessity. More than half (52%) of younger owners say they became business owners because they couldn't find a job elsewhere, compared to 44% of Gen X and Boomer owners.

When asked if they'd do it all over again, 80% of owners say they'd still start their business today. This confidence is particularly notable given challenges they see in today's environment. Almost 8 in 10 (79%) say there is greater market competition today than when they started and 70% say that securing funding and capital is more difficult now.

Integrating its BPO operations into Capgemini's AI ecosystem could exacerbate margin erosion, especially as AI infrastructure costs balloon.
Capgemini's AI ambitions require advanced chips (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs), which are increasingly subject to export controls.
WNS's BPO model, meanwhile, relies on low-cost labor hubs like India and the Philippines—regions vulnerable to geopolitical instability.
For investors, WNS's shares are a trap—locked into a declining BPO model while bearing the costs of Capgemini's AI ambitions.","The $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS by Capgemini, announced in July 2025, is framed as a marriage of AI innovation and BPO expertise. However, beneath the surface, this deal exposes critical misalignments between Capgemini's AI-first vision and WNS's labor-intensive business model, compounded by rising semiconductor costs and geopolitical fragmentation. For investors, the risks of overvaluation, operational dissonance, and shifting market dynamics far outweigh the perceived synergies. Here's why the deal may prove a costly misstep—and where to look for safer returns.

Strategic Misalignment: AI vs. Labor-Heavy BPO

Capgemini's push to build “Intelligent Operations” relies on advanced AI frameworks like its Resonance platform, which require cutting-edge semiconductor-driven infrastructure. WNS, however, derives 85%+ of its revenue from traditional labor-heavy BPO services—data processing, back-office operations, and IT support—for industries like healthcare and manufacturing. This model thrives on cost arbitrage, not algorithmic innovation.

The clash is twofold:

1. Cost Structure Mismatch: WNS's 18.7% operating margin in FY2025 depends on low-cost offshore labor. Capgemini's AI strategy demands high-margin, capital-intensive R&D and semiconductor-driven compute power. Integrating these could strain Capgemini's balance sheet, especially as global semiconductor costs rise due to supply chain bottlenecks.

2. Market Realities: The BPO sector is contracting as enterprises automate with generative AI. WNS's Q2 2025 revenue fell 4.4% YoY, with attrition rates near 34%—a red flag in an industry reliant on labor retention. Meanwhile, Capgemini's AI projects demand expertise in chips, cloud infrastructure, and data governance—areas where WNS has no comparative advantage.

Valuation Overreach: A 17% Premium for a Fragile Asset

The $76.50-per-share offer represents a 17% premium over WNS's pre-announcement price. Yet WNS's valuation already incorporates optimistic assumptions:

- Synergy Overreach: Capgemini projects 4-7% EPS accretion by 2027 via $100–140M cross-selling and $50–70M cost savings. But WNS's declining revenue and Capgemini's tepid 2025 targets (-2% to +2% revenue growth) suggest these synergies are overly optimistic.

- Margin Pressures: WNS's operating margin has shrunk from 21.5% in 2024 to 18.6% in Q2 2025. Integrating its BPO operations into Capgemini's AI ecosystem could exacerbate margin erosion, especially as AI infrastructure costs balloon.

Geopolitical and Semiconductor Risks

The deal's risks extend beyond financials:

- Supply Chain Fragmentation: The U.S.-China tech cold war has disrupted semiconductor supplies. Capgemini's AI ambitions require advanced chips (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs), which are increasingly subject to export controls. WNS's BPO model, meanwhile, relies on low-cost labor hubs like India and the Philippines—regions vulnerable to geopolitical instability.

- Semiconductor Cost Inflation: AI workloads demand more compute power, which is directly tied to semiconductor availability. Rising chip prices (up 12% YoY in H1 2025) could squeeze Capgemini's margins, while WNS's BPO model offers no relief.

Investment Implications: Avoid WNS, Hedge with Semiconductors

The Capgemini-WNS deal presents three clear risks for investors:

1. Overvaluation of WNS: Its premium pricing ignores structural declines in BPO demand and margin pressures.

2. Integration Pitfalls: Merging AI-driven tech with labor-heavy BPO is akin to mixing oil and water.

3. Exposure to Tech Fragmentation: The deal amplifies Capgemini's reliance on global supply chains, now at risk from sanctions and nationalism.

A Better Play: Semiconductor Leaders

Instead of betting on WNS's overvalued shares, investors should focus on semiconductor infrastructure plays:

- ASML (ASML): Dominates EUV lithography, essential for advanced AI chips. Its stock has outperformed Capgemini's by 40% over five years.

- Lam Research (LRCX): Critical for semiconductor fabrication, with pricing power amid chip shortages.

These companies benefit directly from AI's compute demands and are less exposed to BPO's headwinds.

Conclusion: A Deal Built on Shifting Sands

The Capgemini-WNS acquisition reflects a dangerous confluence of overvaluation, strategic mismatch, and macro risks. For investors, WNS's shares are a trap—locked into a declining BPO model while bearing the costs of Capgemini's AI ambitions. Instead, hedging with semiconductor leaders like ASML and LRCX offers a safer path to profiting from the AI revolution.

Dive Brief:

JPMorgan Chase is working to allow voluntary carbon markets to issue blockchain tokens at the registry level that represent ownership of carbon credits, permitting market participants to issue, transfer and retire credits, the bank announced Wednesday.

JPMorgan is currently exploring testing processes with carbon registries from S&P Global Commodity Insights, EcoRegistry and the International Carbon Registry through its blockchain business unit, Kinexys, according to the July 2 release.

The three registries are testing the viability of carbon credit tokenization, as JPMorgan hopes its solution will bring more data transparency to the market and allow for additional market token standardization, according to a report accompanying the announcement.

Dive Insight:

Bringing carbon registries to blockchain and creating a “single, tokenized carbon ecosystem” that allows carbon credit sellers and buyers to seamlessly interact and transfer credits, JPMorgan said, could help address issues of transparency, lack of standardization and market fragmentation.

The bank is currently developing an app to allow the carbon registries to represent ownership, data attributes and rules for the assets in a digital token and directly issue and track credits on the Kinexys Digital Assets Blockchain platform. JPMorgan launched the blockchain business unit to allow for tokenization of financial assets and to utilize other blockchain benefits. The unit has processed more than $1.5 trillion in transactions in the three years since it began serving clients, according to its webpage.

J.P. Morgan Payments Head of Natural Resource Advisory Alastair Northway said in the release that the “voluntary carbon market is ripe for innovation.”

“Tokenization could support development of a globally interoperable system that adds confidence into the integrity of the underlying infrastructure,” Northway said. “This technology could support greater information and price transparency, which could ultimately lead to greater liquidity in the market.”

The bank said in its report that native tokenization projects, like the one it’s undertaking, “can be difficult to implement in use cases based around mature markets with long-established registers and system integrations.” However, JPMorgan said that given the relative nascency and concentration of the voluntary carbon markets — where a small number of registries account for “85-90% of assets issued,” according to the report — it believes there is a greater potential for faster adoption.

While the creation of a tokenization standard, with embedded project and credit attributes, would aid issues of data transparency and lack of standardization across the market, JPMorgan said its application is “not an authority on [credit] quality.” The bank said the application’s role is “to enforce standardized data structures, improve transparency, strengthen resiliency and enable users to independently assess and interpret the available information for specific projects and credits on our platform.”

The carbon registries will look to allow external stakeholders to more easily read and act on registry data. In addition to the viability of tokenization, the registries will test Kinexys’ capabilities for account, project and credit lifecycle management and include specific objectives to explore the application’s technical connectivity, compatibility with different data models and its overall functionality.

Verdict: A Worthwhile Bet on Regional Power Barclays' Middle East leadership shift is more than a managerial tweak—it's a strategic masterstroke to tap into a region where capital is abundant and demand is soaring.","Barclays has placed a bold bet on the Middle East's surging financial influence by appointing Khaled El Dabag and Walid Mezher as Co-CEOs for its regional operations. This dual leadership structure, effective July 2025, aims to capitalize on the region's growing role in global capital markets while aligning with the bank's broader three-year strategy to streamline operations and boost returns. The move underscores Barclays' ambition to turn the Middle East into a profit engine, blending the complementary expertise of two veterans whose careers have been defined by shaping the region's financial landscape.

The Co-CEO Play: Why El Dabag and Mezher?

El Dabag, with 25 years of investment banking experience in Dubai and New York, brings deep expertise in structuring deals for corporate clients, particularly in energy and infrastructure. As former head of MENA Investment Banking, he has steered Barclays' advisory role in landmark transactions, such as the privatization of Saudi Aramco's downstream assets. Mezher, meanwhile, has spent 19 years at Barclays, most recently leading Markets activities across the Middle East and Africa. His focus on sales, origination, and debt capital markets positions him to drive growth in trading and client execution—a critical edge as regional wealth surges.

Their partnership is designed to eliminate silos between Barclays' Investment Banking and Markets divisions, enabling faster decision-making and cross-selling opportunities. Stephen Dainton, BBPLC President, emphasized the strategic imperative: “The Middle East is no longer a side note—it's a linchpin of global finance. This structure ensures Barclays can act as a unified partner to clients in a region where capital flows are accelerating.”

Strategic Alignment: Efficiency Meets Ambition

The co-CEO model directly supports Barclays' three-year plan to become “Simpler, Better, and More Balanced” by 2026. Key targets include:- £500 million in cost savings by 2025 (already £150M achieved in Q1 2024), driven by operational streamlining.- Reducing the Investment Bank's share of Group RWA to 50% by 2026, freeing capital for higher-return divisions like UK retail banking.- 11% ROTE by 2025, rising to over 12% by 2026—targets already exceeded by the Investment Bank, which delivered 16.2% ROTE in Q1 2024.

The Middle East fits seamlessly into this framework. By unifying Investment Banking and Markets under one leadership team, Barclays can:1. Leverage client relationships across both divisions, from sovereign wealth funds to family offices.2. Cut costs by eliminating redundant processes, such as overlapping sales teams or technology platforms.3. Accelerate deal flow in sectors like energy transition, real estate, and tech—areas where Middle Eastern capital is flowing aggressively.

The Prize: A Region on Fire

The Middle East's financial ascendancy is undeniable. Sovereign wealth funds now hold over $3.2 trillion in assets, and private wealth is projected to grow at 7% annually through 2030. Barclays is well-positioned to benefit:- Private banking: The appointment of Farzad Billimoria as UAE Private Bank head signals a push to capture high-net-worth clients, particularly in wealth hubs like Dubai and Riyadh.- Debt capital markets: Mezher's expertise in structuring debt deals aligns with demand for infrastructure financing, from UAE's Expo City to Qatar's World Cup legacy projects.- ESG integration: Barclays' focus on sustainable investing—distinguishing between ethical, responsible, and impact investing—can attract ESG-focused capital, a priority for younger Middle Eastern investors.

Investment Implications: Risk and Reward

Barclays' Middle East pivot offers two clear catalysts for investors:1. Cost discipline: The £500M savings target, if met, could structurally improve margins. A cost-to-income ratio of 61% by 2025 would put Barclays on par with peers like HSBC.2. Regional growth: A 12% ROTE target by 2026, achievable if Middle East revenue outperforms, could lift shares. The bank's Q1 2024 results—net profit up 20% to £1.86B—hint at progress.

Risks remain, however. Geopolitical tensions, such as Iran's nuclear talks or Gulf rivalries, could disrupt markets. Additionally, Barclays' US Consumer Bank, which dragged ROTE to 4.5% in Q1 2024, demands close scrutiny. Yet the Middle East's momentum suggests Barclays is placing its best foot forward in the right market.

Verdict: A Worthwhile Bet on Regional Power

Barclays' Middle East leadership shift is more than a managerial tweak—it's a strategic masterstroke to tap into a region where capital is abundant and demand is soaring. For investors, this aligns with the bank's broader efficiency push, which could deliver double-digit ROTE by 2026. While risks persist, Barclays' early wins in cost savings and deal flow suggest it's primed to outperform in a high-growth arena. Consider this a long-term play for those betting on the Middle East's rise—and Barclays' role in it.",,N,,2025-07-07 15:07:07.215594

(Reuters) -UPS, FedEx and other private parcel carriers are busy cornering a bigger share of the nearly $17 billion Canadian delivery market, while government-owned Canada Post copes with labor turmoil.

Canada Post, the country's primary postal service, has been plagued by labor disruptions since last year, including during the peak holiday season as workers went on strike over pay.

The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), representing delivery personnel at Canada Post, initiated a nationwide overtime ban in May after contract negotiations failed.

The repeated disruptions have prompted small businesses to turn to rivals and private carriers for timely deliveries, even if they are more expensive.

""For retailers who can't afford to roll the dice on labor peace, their T-shirts and iPhone cases hop over to brown or purple vans (UPS/FedEx) at the first whiff of trouble,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at wealth management company Running Point Capital.

Parcel giant FedEx told Reuters it expects ""the circumstances at Canada Post may trigger an increase in demand for FedEx services.""

The company may offer special rates, add delivery vehicles, re-work routes, reallocate resources and open temporary sorting centers to handle the additional demand.

UPS declined to divulge its plans to boost capacity.

Calgary-based Lisa Graham, who runs a small e-commerce based business called YYC Beeswax, told Reuters her business relied heavily on Canada Post's affordable small-package rates for domestic shipments.

But after the business suffered some losses during last year's holiday season strikes, Graham turned to UPS and FedEx to keep deliveries running, and enlisted local courier services to supply domestic customers, who make up 70% of her sales.

""Anything that's going to take over two days, we are spending extra to ship with them (private courier services).""

Last year's strikes cost small and medium-sized businesses over $1 billion in lost sales, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said.

Michael Cox, who imports Irish sweaters, textiles, jewelry, and other goods from the UK to his Ottawa-based shop, said he had to halt business during last year's strikes, as Canada Post was its sole logistics provider — causing significant losses.

The Canadian courier, express, and parcel market is valued at $16.74 billion and could hit $21.55 billion by 2030, according to Mordor Intelligence.

The impact of the ongoing uncertainty, including last year's strikes, has been significant on our business, a Canada Post spokesperson said.

""Since the union restarted their strike action in May 2025 once the collective agreements expired, we have lost almost 60% of our business.""

Canada Post's market share plunged to 26.7% in 2024 from 62% in 2019, according to the company's annual report, despite a post-pandemic e-commerce boom in deliveries.

It lost $208 million due to last year's 32-day strike.

""If CUPW's contract slug-fest drags on, Canada Post's share could drop into the teens by December 2026,"" Schulman added.

That was down from 46.1 in the previous month and indicative of another decline in operating conditions. It was the fifth successive survey period in which the PMI has posted below the critical 50.0 no-change mark.

Production volumes fell in June at the sharpest pace in over five years, driven by a significant drop in new orders. Tariffs were frequently cited as a key factor negatively affecting market demand, contributing to a fifth consecutive monthly decline in overall sales. International demand, particularly from the neighboring U.S., remained weak. The latest data indicated that new export orders fell in June at one of the fastest rates recorded in the survey’s history.

According to S&P Global, some panellists expressed optimism that trade uncertainty linked to tariffs may ease over the next year, while others anticipated stronger sales from domestic markets. As a result, business confidence reportedly rose to its highest level since January, showing a marked improvement compared to May.

However, compared to the survey’s historical average, confidence remained subdued. This was largely the result of difficulties in forecasting the direction of trade policies and tariff levels with the neighbouring United States.

Ongoing declines in both output and new orders led firms to continue cutting back on purchasing activity at a historically sharp rate. Input inventories also fell, marking the steepest drop in five years. In addition to intentional stock reduction, delays in receiving purchased inputs reportedly prompted firms to draw more heavily on existing inventories. Average lead times significantly lengthened again in June.

Commenting on the latest survey results, Paul Smith, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: “Canada’s manufacturing economy continued to struggle in the face of tariffs and the ongoing uncertainty related to future trade policies. A lack of new orders underpinned the latest downturn and helped to explain the steepest reduction in production since the height of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. International sales unsurprisingly were especially subdued, and, against this backdrop, firms chose to make further cuts to their employment and purchasing activity.

“Although sentiment improved on hopes of some stability in the year ahead, confidence in the outlook remains subdued and uncertain. And firms continued to face pressure on their operating margins as, despite easing since May, inflationary pressures were again evident. Tariffs again drove steep rises in prices and also exacerbated supply-side delays, which intensified during June.”

Tariffs were widely reported to have also driven up input costs during June, dominating the anecdotal evidence provided by those manufacturers that experienced a rise in prices. Although the rate of inflation softened during June to a four-month low, it remained elevated compared to the survey trend. Manufacturers sought to pass on their higher input costs to clients via a rise in their own selling prices during June. Similarly, the rate of inflation remained marked, despite easing to a four-month low.

Finally, with production and new order volumes deteriorating sharply, there remained little pressure on capacity during June. This was highlighted by another steep, and accelerated, fall in backlogs of work. Manufacturers subsequently also registered a decline in staffing volumes. It was the fifth successive month in which overall employment fell and reflected a mixture of redundancies and the non-replacement of leavers.",https://www.plant.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-07-at-10.58.34 AM.png,N,,2025-07-07 15:08:37.392092

The Spyral GEMINI pilot program (an abbreviation for Global pilot study of rEnal and hepatic coMbINed denervatIon) includes off-med and on-med studies investigating the safety and potential efficacy for denervation of both the renal and common haptic (liver) arteries in uncontrolled hypertension patients.

“In addition to denervation of the renal arteries — where the blood pressure lowering clinical benefit has already been established through multiple rigorously designed clinical trials — targeting other richly innervated vascular areas such as the common hepatic artery is an emerging horizon for treating hypertension,” said the study’s lead principal investigator, Piedmont Heart Institute and Cardiovascular Services Chief Dr. David Kandzari, in a Medtronic news release. “We look forward to learning more about the potential efficacy of denervation in both the liver and renal arteries from Spyral GEMINI.”

Medtronic said preclinical data presented at EuroPCR in May “showed a 90% significant reduction in norepinephrine (marker of sympathetic activity) with multi-organ denervation.”

“These findings suggest that multi-organ denervation using the Spyral system can successfully denervate within both the hepatic and renal arteries,” the company continued.

More than 200 Pueblo and Pueblo West Safeway workers voted May 31 to join the strike, with 100% of meat department employees and 97% of retail employees at the two local stores — located at 1231 S. Prairie Ave. in Pueblo, and 1017 N. Market Place in Pueblo West — voting to strike.

The union went through with the strike on June 15 and Pueblo was among the first cities to participate.

UnitedHealth Leads The Downturn Amidst Guidance Withdrawal And CEO Resignation

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) led the downturn with a staggering 40.9% drop in market cap in the second quarter and a 39.6% decline year over year, triggered largely by its decision to withdraw 2025 earnings guidance.

UnitedHealth's CEO, Andrew Witty, resigned for personal reasons, and the previous CEO, Stephen Hemsley, succeeded him. The company also withdrew 2025 guidance.

Despite the significant drop, UnitedHealth retained its top spot as the largest U.S. insurer, with a market cap of $283 billion, well ahead of second-ranked The Progressive Corp. (NYSE:PGR), which stood at $156.44 billion.

Among the eight companies that saw market cap declines of more than 5%, half were managed care firms. In contrast, five of the six insurers with gains were property and casualty providers, reflecting stronger investor confidence in that sector.

Despite the significant drop, UnitedHealth retained its top spot as the largest U.S. insurer, with a market cap of $283 billion. That still puts it well ahead of second-ranked The Progressive Corp. (NYSE:PGR), which stood at $156.44 billion.

Ripple Effect: Other Health Insurers Follow Suit

Other health insurers followed UnitedHealth's downward trajectory. Centene Corp. (NYSE:CNC) saw its market cap drop 10.3% in the second quarter, while Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV) declined 10.8%. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) posted more modest losses of 7.6% and 1%, respectively.

Third-Quarter Woes Intensify With Policy Uncertainty

The pressure has extended into the third quarter. Last week, Centene also withdrew its 2025 guidance, sending the market into shock. The result was a 40.37% stock plunge in a single day. The fallout also affected peers, with UnitedHealth and Elevance falling 5.7% and 11.5%, respectively.

Investor sentiment was further rattled by President Donald Trump's proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which appears close to congressional approval.

The S&P report added that the legislation could significantly impact Medicaid access, a key business area for managed care insurers like UnitedHealth and Centene that administer the program through government funding. The policy risk triggered another selloff in the first week of the third quarter.

Broader Insurance Industry Shows Resilience

Still, the broader insurance industry has shown resilience. At the end of the second quarter, the S&P 500 insurance index climbed 19.55% year over year, surpassing the S&P 500's 15.16% gain during the same period.

The GLP-1 obesity med soared to the top of the month’s ranking of TV drug ad spenders, according to data shared with Fierce Pharma Marketing by iSpot.TV, repeating an occurrence last seen in March.

Novo shelled out just under $40 million to air one Wegovy ad throughout the month of June—quite a ways above its $24.1 million outlay in May, when it slipped to fifth place in the rankings, and almost even with the $40.4 million spend that earned it the top spot in March.

And, just like the last time it was on top, Wegovy once again capitalized on a major basketball event taking over TV screens: According to iSpot, the top TV program for the drug’s singular commercial in June was NBA coverage, as the league’s championship series played out throughout the month. In March, Wegovy’s top TV program by spend was men’s college basketball, amid the kickoff of the annual NCAA March Madness tournament.

Wegovy’s sister drug, meanwhile, stayed put toward the bottom of the top 10 list in June. Ozempic held onto its ninth-place ranking from May, with $11.5 million spent airing a pair of commercials.

Falling in line behind Wegovy was a trio of mainstays on the monthly rankings, as AbbVie’s Skyrizi and Rinvoq and Johnson & Johnson’s Tremfya took the next three slots, respectively. TV ad spending for Rinvoq and Tremfya notched upward, while Skyrizi’s fell to $30.3 million for the month, compared to the $34.2 million outlay that earned it the No. 1 spot in May.

Next up, Lundbeck and Otsuka’s Rexulti, Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Jardiance and Lilly’s Zepbound each jumped one spot compared with their May rankings, thanks in large part to a major drop in spending for Dupixent’s TV advertising. In May, Sanofi and Regeneron threw more than $28 million behind the immunology med, sending it up to second place in the month’s analysis; in June, that spending was slashed by more than 50% to $13.8 million, pushing it down to No. 8.

Behind Ozempic, rounding out June’s biggest TV ad spenders was Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo, which made its triumphant return to the monthly top 10 lists for the first time since May 2024, with $10.3 million spent airing a single commercial.

All together, the top 10 brands poured $219.4 million into airing their TV ads in June, continuing the steady downward trend logged almost every month this year after January’s staggering $302.5 million total.

That said, 2025’s monthly totals so far have also adhered to another, more positive trend, with each significantly outperforming the top 10 list a year prior. Last June, for example, the biggest spenders shelled out a combined $151.7 million for their TV ads, meaning this June’s results surged nearly 45% year over year, even as they dropped sequentially from May’s $221.1 million total.

BNP Paribas said it is adapting its governance, aiming to strengthen the cross-functionality between its businesses.

The French lender said Monday that its commercial, personal banking and services division will have a new unit encompassing the commercial and personal-banking businesses in the eurozone. The new unit will be led by Yannick Jung, who is currently head of corporate and institutional banking global banking.

The company is also making changes at its corporate and institutional banking division, which will now consist of an executive chairman and a chief executive. Consequently, the group's Chief Operating Officer Yann Gerardin will also become executive chairman of the business. Olivier Osty, current head of CIB Global Markets, will become deputy chief operating officer of the group and CEO of the division.

The investment and protection services business will continue to accelerate its development under the responsibility of Renaud Dumora, the group's deputy chief operating officer, helped by external growth operations, primarily the acquisition of AXA IM.

These appointments will take place from Sept. 1.

S&P Global's Q2 results are generating interest with a stronger-than-expected performance, thanks to a June surge in credit issuance that offset earlier quarter dips.

What does this mean?

Initially, S&P Global faced a cautious period with a softer credit market outlook. However, a 13% rise in June credit issuance changed the narrative. Morgan Stanley revised their outlook for S&P Global's ratings revenue to a 2% decline from a projected 5% drop. This positive shift led to a 2% increase in EPS estimates, boosting confidence in S&P Global's annual guidance and suggesting a more optimistic trajectory for the year. The firm's stock price rose to $530.90, reinforcing its reputation as a resilient player in the financial landscape.

Why should I care?

For markets: Credit markets rebound.

These developments highlight a recovering credit landscape, with major implications for market volatility and stability. S&P Global's strong performance and revised projections signal potential growth, making it a company to watch for investors focused on financial sector resilience and opportunity.

The bigger picture: Optimism in financial outlooks.

Buc-ee’s stores are open all day, every day.","(NEXSTAR) — It’s been a busy few weeks for Buc-ee’s, the Texas-based convenience store and gas station chain that has developed a cult following in recent years.

In early June, Buc-ee’s opened its first Mississippi location in Harrison County. Last week, the company opened its first Virginia location and its third store in Georgia.

As of early July, Buc-ee’s operates 54 stores across nine states, with other stores in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The company has undergone a major multi-state expansion since 2019, and it isn’t done yet.

Buc-ee’s has several more sites that are already under construction.

In April, work began on the Buc-ee’s location in Benton, Arkansas, at what it described as the largest groundbreaking event in company history. Another Arkansas location in West Memphis is on track to open next year as well. CEO Arch “Beaver” Aplin III hinted at a potential third location for Arkansas while speaking with Nexstar’s KLRT.

Ohio expects to get its first Buc-ee’s in 2026. Construction began in August 2024 on the location in Huber Heights, located northeast of Dayton. However, work was briefly paused amid a conflict over sewer and water services. The company confirmed to Nexstar’s WDTN that the planned opening in late 2025 had been pushed to spring of next year.

Buc-ee’s is also on track to open locations in Murfreesboro, Tennessee; Ocala and Fort Pierce, Florida; Monroe County, Georgia; Ruston and Lafayette, Louisiana; and Goodyear, Arizona. Stores in Louisiana and Arizona mark the first in each state for Buc-ee’s.

The company’s Mebane, North Carolina, store — the state’s first — is expected to open in 2026 or 2027.

Three additional Buc-ee’s could open in 2027: Gallaway, Tennessee; Oak Creek, Wisconsin; and Kansas City, Missouri.

Buc-ee’s has pursued locations in eight more areas:

San Marcos, Texas

Palmer Lake, Colorado

Harbour Heights, Florida

Anderson, South Carolina

Hardeeville, South Carolina

Oak Grove City, Kentucky

Boerne, Texas

These locations are at various steps in the process, according to local reporting.

Construction has begun on the location in Boerne. No timeline for opening the store has been released.

Oak Creek, located about 10 miles south of Milwaukee, announced Buc-ee’s had submitted a proposal for a massive location after plans to build one near Madison stalled. Despite pushback from some residents, the city’s common council approved the plans in May. Construction could begin later this year, according to local outlet WISN.

In Palmer Lake, the board of trustees approved an annexation request for a proposed Buc-ee’s during a contentious meeting in May, Nexstar’s KXRM reported. Residents have also pushed back against a proposed Buc-ee’s location in southwest Florida, expressing concerns that it could exacerbate flooding in the area and encroach on a wildlife habitat.

The Buc-ee’s in Anderson was delayed earlier this year due to a nearby interchange. Local leaders told Nexstar’s WSPA it would cost about $60 million to fix the interchange, the brunt of which they believe should come from the state.

Should all these locations be built and opened before 2027, Buc-ee’s will have more than 70 locations across 17 states.

Buc-ee’s did not immediately respond to Nexstar’s request for comment or additional information.

The first store of the Texas-based chain opened in 1982, but its first true travel center opened in 2003. That location, in Luling, outside of San Antonio, was damaged in a fire last year. A month prior, that Buc-ee’s had been replaced by a new travel center in the same area.

It’s the massive travel centers — featuring everything from fuel and snacks to Buc-ee’s merchandise, hot food, kitchen items, grills, and even hunting gear — that have seemingly attracted a cult-like following to the brand. The company’s beloved mascot, Buc-ee the Beaver, receives just as much adoration.

He’s also been at the center of recent lawsuits from Buc-ee’s. Earlier this year, Buc-ee’s sued a Florida store, accusing it of selling merchandise sporting what appears to be the beloved beaver logo with punk rock makeovers.

Costco recalled all Danby brand U-shaped air conditioners that were sold between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022, as well as Midea brand U-shaped window air conditioners sold between June 2021 and May 2025. The company has asked customers to discontinue use of these products ""immediately"" due to issues with water pooling underneath the units as they are not draining quickly enough. This presents a ""risk of mold growth."" Customers who wish to have the issue repaired can be sent a free repair kit from Costco which would include a new drain plug and bubble level, depending on the model. Customers can also reach out to Costco to get a full or prorated refund, based on the purchase date or the date of the unit's manufacture.

There have been several other items recalled by Costco as well, including Anker power banks, which are used for portable charging. There is a potential risk factor with these power banks, which were sold between June 1, 2016 and Dec. 31, 2022, due to the possibility that they ""may overheat, posing a potential fire safety risk,"" which ""could lead to melting of plastic components, smoke or fire,"" per the recall. Anyone who has purchased one of these power banks can reach out for a refund or a replacement with a photo of the product showing the serial number on the back, model number, date the photo was taken, and the word ""recalled"" written on the power bank in permanent marker.

Costco has also recalled Bridgestone Blizzak 6 tires and Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires. The Bridgetstone tires were sold as replacement tires only and ""do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 139,"" per the recall, while the Michelin tires were recalled as ""chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block.""

Other Costco items that have been recalled include the 18 packs of Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass, Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler, Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer, Segway Ninebot Electric Kickscooter and the Sublue Underwater Scooter. There were also select Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu items added to the recall, as well as multiple products from Fresh and Ready Foods Prepared Sandwiches and Salads.

Krispy Kreme has named Raphael Duvivier as its chief financial officer, effective July 11, according to a press release. He replaces Jeremiah Ashukian, the current CFO, who is leaving on that date to work at a private company.

Duvivier is currently serving as president, international and has worked at Krispy Kreme since 2019. He has also worked as chief development officer and segment chief financial and strategy officer, international. Prior to Krispy Kreme, he held various positions in global finance, development and operations at Restaurant Brands International.

The company did not immediately respond to a request to clarify if Duvivier would continue serving in his current capacity while also working as CFO.

“[Duvivier’s] deep understanding of the Company coupled with his strong finance background will enable a smooth transition as we focus on achieving sustainable, profitable growth,” Josh Charlesworth, Krispy Kreme’s CEO, said in a statement.

Ashukian informed the company of his intent to leave on June 27, as did Chief Growth Officer David Skena, according to an 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week.

The two executives informed the company of their impending departures only a few days after the doughnut maker acknowledged that it was suspending its partnership with McDonald’s.

Krispy Kreme did not immediately respond to a request to clarify if Ashukian and Skena’s departures were precipitated by the implosion of its McDonald’s partnership.

Food giant Kraft Heinz is recalling more than 360,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer turkey bacon products for possible listeria contamination.

Affected products include fully cooked turkey bacon produced from April 24 through June 11, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Products were shipped across the U.S., with some exported to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

No illnesses have been reported, FSIS said. The possible contamination was discovered through Kraft Heinz's internal laboratory testing.

Dive Insight:

Major food companies have grappled with high-profile listeria recalls. Last September, Boar's Head closed a facility months after an outbreak led to nine deaths and more than 7 million pounds of recalled meat.

Deli meats and ready-to-eat products are among the foods most susceptible to listeria contamination, since pathogens aren't destroyed in the refrigeration process. There were 65 recalls over potential listeria contamination in 2024, compared to 47 the prior year, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.

Following large-scale outbreaks last year, the USDA released a plan to ramp up listeria inspections at meat plants. However, a scientific advisory committee tasked with overseeing the regulatory strategy was terminated in March as part of the Trump administration's effort to slash costs and streamline the government.

Consuming food contaminated with listeria can lead to Listeriosis, which can be especially harmful for pregnant women, newborns and those over the age of 65. Symptoms can appear sometimes weeks after eating contaminated food, according to the FSIS.

Earnings forecasts for Greggs PLC (LSE:GRG) for this year and next were cut by Barclays following weaker-than-expected trading and a recent unscheduled update, where the company had blamed hot weather for its poor performance.

Discussions with the company indicate that hot weather was the single largest reason for the downgrade, as the company had bemoaned. However, analysts noted that some investors had questioned this, as not all parts of the UK experienced a heatwave.

""Our analysis of previous Greggs trading updates during hot weather suggests that the heat wave is a credible explanation of weaker trading, but we believe that as the business sells more cold drinks vs much earlier in its history, the impact of warm weather has become less severe.""

Raising broader concerns about pricing strategy, over-expansion, and dependence on a recovery in consumer spending, Barclays now expects FY25 LFL sales growth of 2%, down from 3% previously.

The broker noted a potential shift in consumer behaviour away from food-to-go and questioned whether recent price increases have softened volumes.

Earnings forecast for 2025 and 2026 were also cut by around 11% and 10% citing slower like-for-like sales growth, margin pressure, and increased finance costs. Profit before tax forecasts were cut to £171 million and £176 million, around 6-7% below Bloomberg consensus

However, the bank kept its 'overweight' stance, though analysts conceded their rating has been ""far too optimistic"", highlighting Greggs’ vertically integrated model, strong returns on capital in new locations, and long-term positioning as supportive of value for money.

The deal marks one of the largest buyouts in the BPM space and underscores the growing demand for AI-powered, digitally integrated business solutions. Both companies have a strong footprint in India, together employing over 200,000 people across 24 locations in the country.

With combined revenues of €1.9 billion in 2024 in business process services, the transaction will strengthen Capgemini’s ability to accompany clients on their business and technology transformation journeys, said the company.

Scale, sector edge

“Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations,” said Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini, adding that WNS’s high growth, margin accretive Digital Business Process Services will increase the company’s exposure to the US market, unlocking immediate cross-selling opportunities.

Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS, said, “WNS’ complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini’s rapidly growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors.”

Finding synergies

One of the key challenges could be finding synergies between employees of the two companies. During an analyst call, Capgemini said there is currently no “refined plan” for integrating the two companies, but confirmed that post-merger management teams will include leaders from both Capgemini and WNS. The company also noted that its European headcount will decline from 35 per cent to 30 per cent, while its offshore workforce is expected to rise from 58 per cent to 63 per cent as a result of the merger.

Ashutosh Sharma, VP & Research Director, Forrester, said the acquisition demonstrates the impact of AI in reshaping business processes. “Capgemini gains scale and process depth, while WNS taps into cutting-edge AI capabilities. While there may be no immediate disruption to the workforce or their India operations, the long-term trajectory is clear: automation will drive significant efficiency gains which in turn will inevitably lead to workforce optimisation,” said Sharma.

Similarly, Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO and Chief Analyst at Greyhound Research, argued the move should be seen as a control-layer acquisition where it can use WNS’s operational foundation, trusted by over 600 clients across banking, healthcare, travel, utilities, and more.

“Capgemini is betting that in a GenAI-led market, the differentiation will come from who can embed the models into real processes, in real-time, across real industries. That’s where WNS’s BPO playbook — historically focused on outcome-based pricing, F&A maturity, and embedded analytics — provides a ready-made testbed for Capgemini to deploy its AI stack,” said Gogia.

The 150-year-old company has 38,000 employees who serve 50 million customers in more than 50 countries. Bob Bastian, chief information and technology officer, leads the company's agentic AI initiative, which is built on Salesforce's Agentforce for Financial Services.

We discussed with Bastian the company's deliberate approach to rolling out AI services for its various insurance, retirement products and mutual funds.

How would you describe Prudential's AI strategy?

Bob Bastian: Because we're a regulated business, we give a lot of thought to how we're using AI. Our main strategy is thinking about how to build governance so it does exactly what we need it to do for our customers and stakeholders, but at the same time, it's protected, it's governed and we think about data management right out of the gate.

Then we say, ""Where would it provide the most value for our customers or advisors?"" We've created various use cases that help us understand that value proposition. Or, in the case of something like underwriting -- something we've been doing for quite a while -- we have multiple tests [of AI tools] against our underwriting to make sure that we're getting valid results.

When you saw generative AI for the first time, did you immediately see use cases?

Bastian: I enjoy technology overall. I just love to understand how things work. My first thought was, ""Okay, I need to understand more about how this is coming together.""

After understanding about LLMs [large language models] and RAG [retrieval augmented generation] and all the other technical details that go into it, I started to think about how this can apply itself to the insurance, annuity and advisor spaces. Everything that we've come up with focuses on a human in the loop, just because of how GenAI is structured. It's important for us to make sure that we still have humans thinking about what is happening. We are a company that generates a lot of documentation. We want to ensure that we get the right policy, contract and type of products out there in production. It necessitates a lot of information, and GenAI can help pull that information together. Many of our use cases are set up around that.

What are examples of operational use cases?

Bastian: We have a use case for group insurance claims. They're different based on each company's contract and the company's state regulations. So if I'm on the phone with a customer, I have to go out to different places to pull that information together. With what we've done with GenAI, we know who the customer is, we know what company they work for, and we know what state they're coming from. We gather all that information so that, instead of trying to find different documents, CSRs [customer service representatives] can focus on the customer and be very empathetic.

We also have another use case for advisors. It pulls together information about who they're meeting. We have wholesalers [who support financial advisors] as well as advisors. In the wholesaler space, we're pulling together information about the people they're meeting with so that they can come well prepared. That makes them a lot more productive.

Do you employ multiple LLMs for different functions, or are you a one-LLM shop?

Bastian: We are not a one-LLM shop. Different LLMs are optimized for different things. We give a lot of thought to what the right LLM is for the job. We also give thought to how we're going to apply it; what is the right risk for our customers, stakeholders, advisors, whomever else. So we're very protective how we're using LLMs, which ones we're using and which ones are the best for any given use case.

What are you doing with Salesforce agents and Financial Services Cloud?

Bastian: They have done some great things in our wholesaler space, as mentioned above. We consolidated our customer service across all our businesses onto Salesforce. We consolidated all our claims -- except for disability claims -- onto Salesforce. Our retirement business, our U.S. life insurance business, group insurance business and everything is on Salesforce.

On the sales side, we're using agentic AI to help with call logging. If a CSR meets with a customer or a wholesaler meets with an advisor, it logs what happened during that meeting. The agents can go off and deal with follow-ups. Agentic is great at summarizing how we met with [an advisor], how they want to do these types of cases in the future and what follow-ups are needed, then it will set those up in Salesforce and deal with those background pieces. We think we can save at least half a day per week, just on different follow-ups and setting up other things in Salesforce. So that's a great use case beta that we're starting.

On the service side, there's a lot that goes on after a call. When a customer calls up and has a service request, there are a bunch of other things, different follow-ups, different background things that happen with administration systems and others. We're in a beta there where an agent can do some of those things. [This allows] the CSR to get on the next call and be more empathetic to the conversation that they're having -- as opposed to having to think about the call log, follow-ups or the things that they have to do in the background. This agentic force helps us get through many of the background [tasks] so that our advisors or CSRs can stay focused on the customer.

What advice do you have for your peers experimenting with or evaluating agentic AI?

Bastian: One thing is to keep customers at the heart. How do you make your CSRs better with the customer? How do you make them more empathetic? How do you make it a great relationship, so when a client calls up Prudential, they feel like the agent is listening to them? Design your agents keeping in mind how to enable better interactions.

The other thing, especially for our industry -- whether it be bank, financial services or asset management -- is that we're regulated, so you've got to think that through first. Don't go off and create a bunch of agents that do a bunch of things that could get you into trouble. Think through the governance before you get down the path of thinking about agentic.

If you focus on a customer at the heart of it and you really balance yourself with governance and regulatory, that space in the middle that allows the human to do the best that they can when they're on the call or when they're meeting with an advisor. That's the path to greatness on some of this.",https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/money_g1250581414.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 14:14:23.427426

McDonald’s breakfast traffic has been declining, with many customers opting to skip the meal or eat at home.","Spice meets tradition as McDonald’s revamps its breakfast icon for summer.

The chain is rolling out two seasonal items aimed at capturing morning and midday customers.

Starting July 8, participating US restaurants will debut three Spicy McMuffin options: Egg, Sausage, and Sausage with Egg.

This launch coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, which has remained a morning staple since its nationwide rollout in 1975.

In its latest ""USA Menu Spotter,"" McDonald’s described the new item as a spicy update to a classic AM offering.

""This limited-time glow-up includes everything you already love about the iconic Egg McMuffin sandwich—melty cheese, a freshly cracked egg (now sourced 100% cage-free in the U.S.), Canadian bacon and a perfectly toasted and buttered English Muffin—plus a fiery, delicious twist: a shot of McDonald’s signature Spicy Pepper Sauce.""

McDonald’s confirmed that the new Spicy McMuffin lineup features the same ingredients customers recognize: cheese, freshly cracked eggs from 100% cage-free sources in the US, Canadian bacon or sausage, and a toasted English muffin.

Each sandwich includes McDonald’s signature Spicy Pepper Sauce, previously seen only on its lunch offerings, now applied to morning meal for the first time.

Sweet Spot for Seasonal Sales

The fast-food giant also quietly brought back its Blueberry & Crème Pie on June 30.

Served warm, the seasonal dessert features a dual filling of sweet blueberries and vanilla-flavored crème inside a flaky crust.

It’s currently available at locations nationwide while supplies last.

While McDonald’s has not confirmed end dates for either item, the short-term availability encourages quick customer trial.

The timing also aligns with peak summer travel and holiday dining, where morning meals and quick-service desserts often see increased demand.

For brand leaders and marketers, this signals a clear seasonal approach: refresh core products with small ingredient updates that can create marketing momentum without changing operations.

McDonald’s continues to maintain menu familiarity while offering just enough novelty to create interest.

This is especially important across morning menu, where competition for traffic remains high.

Recent earnings reports also reveal deeper business implications.

McDonald’s breakfast traffic has been declining, with many customers opting to skip the meal or eat at home.

The financial backdrop adds urgency to McDonald’s latest menu moves.

In Q1 2025, the company reported a 3% drop in both net income and revenue compared to the same period last year, with global comparable sales also declining 1%.

These figures highlight the need for initiatives that can bring back traffic without requiring heavy investment.

Exclusive run breakfast and dessert items are one way to address that.

CEO Chris Kempczinski noted that this drop reflects economic pressures, not competitive losses.

“Morning now is a place that you’re seeing people who are choosing either to skip breakfast or they’re choosing to eat at home,”

In that context, the Spicy McMuffin isn’t just a seasonal offering.

It’s a calculated effort to re-engage customers while keeping operations consistent.

Our Take: Does This Limited Breakfast Drop Really Matter?

It does, and here’s why I see it as a smart move.

Early-day lineup has long been a high-margin, underleveraged part of quick-service, but momentum in the category has slowed.

Spicy McMuffins give McDonald’s a way to re-engage regulars without overcomplicating prep or ingredients.

Adding flavor variety to a familiar item invites repeat visits and keeps marketing teams talking without putting strain on operations.

It’s a practical update that supports both sales goals and brand consistency.

Section 42104 repeals the Diesel Emissions Reduction Program (DERA), Section 60104 of Public Law 117–169 (the Inflation Reduction Act). This EPA program helped fleets pay for the retrofitting or replacement of older diesel trucks. Because many state programs rely on DERA funding, this repeal could trigger ripple effects on local emissions compliance incentives.

Additionally, the bill rescinds Inflation Reduction Act funding originally intended to reduce emissions near freight corridors, schools, and ports (Sections 42105–42108). Without these resources, efforts to mitigate localized pollution from diesel traffic may fall short, putting more pressure on municipalities—and ultimately, fleets.

Regulatory Rollbacks for Diesel Emissions Standards

Perhaps most consequential for future truck development, Section 42201 repeals greenhouse gas and multi-pollutant emission standards issued by the EPA. These rules included long-term limits targeting 2027-plus model year heavy-duty engines, particularly NOx and particulate matter. While repeal could offer near-term regulatory relief for manufacturers and fleets, it also introduces uncertainty for companies that have already invested in technology to meet the upcoming standards.

The section states:

The final rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to “Revised 2023 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards” (86 Fed. Reg. 74434, Dec. 30, 2021) and “Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles” (89 Fed. Reg. 27842, April 18, 2024) shall have no force or effect.

Additionally, Section 42301 repealed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) rules relating to CAFE Standards, stating:

The final rules issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration relating to “Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Model Years 2024–2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks” (87 Fed. Reg. 25710, May 2, 2022) and “Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks for Model Years 2027 and Beyond and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans for Model Years 2030 and Beyond” (89 Fed. Reg. 52540, June 24, 2024) shall have no force or effect.

Let’s be clear here: That rule does not apply to heavy-duty Class 7–8 trucks. It applies to:

• Light-duty vehicles

• Medium-duty vehicles, including some commercial diesels (Class 2b–6).

EPA’s Phase 3 GHG rule for heavy-duty trucks, which covers 2027–2032 model years, is a different rule published separately. At this time, H.R. 1 does not explicitly repeal EPA’s heavy-duty GHG Phase 3 rules, but it does grant itself broad authority to roll back climate and emissions regulations elsewhere in the bill.

As a reminder, EPA’s Phase 3 rule was finalized in March 2024. It covers heavy-duty trucks (Classes 7–8) and model years 2027 through 2032, and it sets both carbon-dioxide and pollutant standards for long-haul tractors and vocational vehicles.

Fewer Reporting Requirements

Also worth noting is Section 42111, which repeals funding for corporate greenhouse gas reporting. While this doesn’t directly change emissions requirements, it could relieve some of the compliance pressure on large fleets who were beginning to measure and disclose carbon outputs.",https://s18391.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Volvo-Engine-Service1-1400.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 14:15:54.161272

AG2R-La Mondiale leaves sponsorship after 28 years in the peloton and hands over to Decathlon

The transition in the veteran AG2R team is consolidated, a paradigm shift that began with Decathlon's sponsorship last year. Now, the French sports multinational remains solely in charge of the cycling team with a clear intention, to increase its contribution and strengthen it to bring it to the highest level. All with a clear objective, to bring French cycling back to the forefront, including the assault on the yellow jersey of the Tour de France.

A growth process that, obviously, begins with the search for a secondary sponsor with the intention of having a budget of more than 40 million euros for the next season, a significant increase considering that this year they had 28 million.

However, it does not seem to be a problem as indicated by the words of team director Dominique Serieys who pointed out that negotiations with the new sponsor are very advanced ""We trust that we can announce the name before the end of the Tour de France"" while being clear about the trajectory they intend to follow ""Our goal is to enter the Top 5 and then the Top 3 in the world and win the Tour de France by 2030"".

Decathlon's bet to achieve this milestone seems to fall on young Paul Seixas who, at 18 years old, is completing his first season as a professional in the French team after coming from the development team. In his debut season, he has left good impressions after several honorable positions in the Tour of the Alps or the 8th place he occupied in the general classification of the Critérium du Dauphiné.

Dominique Serieys is clear about it ""When he was a junior, I met him at his parents' house; I spent a whole afternoon there. He was the only one who told me that his ambition was to win the Tour de France"". A bet on young cyclists that is more of an obligation than a choice ""all the great leaders have contracts until 2030, not to mention the value of their contracts. Our job is to identify and train"".

Along the way, Decathlon sets more achievable goals, starting with the classics in general and the Paris-Roubaix, the classic at home.

The medications still amount to around $500 per month for those without insurance — out of reach for many patients. And even for people with insurance, coverage remains uneven.

“The medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,” said Matt Maciejewski, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.

Doctors say the situation forces them to get creative in treating patients, but there’s hope that prices may fall more in the future.

The drugs are still in high demand

Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity.

Zepbound brought in $2.3 billion in U.S. sales during this year’s first quarter, making it one of drugmaker Eli Lilly’s best sellers.

Novo Nordisk says Wegovy has about 200,000 weekly prescriptions in the U.S., where it brought in nearly $1.9 billion in first-quarter sales.

Insurance coverage is increasing — for some

The benefits consultant Mercer says more businesses with 500 or more employees are adding coverage of the injected drugs for their workers and family members.

And Novo says 85% of its patients who have coverage in the U.S. pay $25 or less per month.

Plus some patients with diabetes can get coverage of the GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Mounjaro from Novo and Lilly that are approved to treat that condition.

But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don’t cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare, the federal program mainly for people age 65 and older.

Even the plans that cover the drugs often pay only a portion of the bill, exposing patients to hundreds of dollars in monthly costs, said Dr. Beverly Tchang.

Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.

“Coverage is not the same as access,” said Tchang, a New York-based doctor who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.

But coverage remains inconsistent

Bill-payers like employers are nervous about drugs that might be used by a lot of people indefinitely.

Some big employers have dropped coverage of the drugs due to the expense. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also are starting to pick one brand over the other as they negotiate deals with the drugmakers.

One of the nation’s largest PBMs, run by CVS Health, dropped Zepbound from its national formulary, or list of covered drugs, on July 1 in favor of Wegovy.

That forced Tchang to figure out another treatment plan for several patients, many of whom took Zepbound because it made them less nauseous.

Dr. Courtney Younglove’s office sends prospective patients a video link showing them how to check their insurer’s website for coverage of the drugs before they visit.

“Then some of them just cancel their appointment because they don’t have coverage,” the Overland Park, Kansas, doctor said.

Cheaper compounded drugs are still being sold

Compounding pharmacies and other entities were allowed to make off-brand, cheaper copies of Wegovy and Zepbound when there was a shortage of the drugs. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined earlier this year that the shortage had ended.

That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.

The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide, the drug behind Wegovy, that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.

It’s a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.

Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by US regulators.

Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.

Prices have dropped

Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.

Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.

There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.

Younglove said some of her patients save as much as 15% by getting their doses shipped from a pharmacy in Canada. They used to get them from an Israeli pharmacy until the Canadians dropped their prices.

She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.

“I think price wars are going to drive it down,” she said. “I think we are in the early stages. I have hope.”

The union letter shared that a fully recommended tentative agreement had been reached with Safeway/Albertsons, bringing picket lines down and allowing workers to prepare for their return. The strike, which began in mid June, expanded to include more than 45 stores statewide and lasted for nearly three weeks.

According to a UFCW Local 7 Facebook post on Saturday, July 5, striking workers were not required to report to work until Monday, July 7, but could contact their store director if they wanted to return earlier. All employees who participated in picketing for at least one day last week and have not yet received their full strike benefit will be paid for an eight-hour day on July 5. The union also confirmed that Safeway has agreed to terminate all temporary replacement workers and that all striking employees will be reinstated to their original positions, classifications, seniority, and hire dates.

The letter stated, “The provisions of the all gains, no concessions agreements include 45 tentative agreements.” There will be fully funded healthcare benefits and improvements to dental and vision coverage. Workers will now receive double the lens allowance for vision care and an increase in life insurance benefits under the healthcare plan.

Retiree healthcare remains protected, with no cuts or changes and fully funded pension benefits are secure for another contract cycle. The agreement also states that healthcare contributions will be made for striking employees who didn’t work enough hours in June or July to qualify for coverage, to qualify for health coverage.

The deal includes “strong” wage increases and a longevity bonus for associates with at least one year of service, the letter states. Attendance points will be fully reset, and employees will have access to expanded vacation cash out options. The agreement also introduces a test-and-learn trial designed to study meaningful staffing improvements in stores.

The union also secured protections against outsourcing bargaining unit work to gig companies like DoorDash, ensuring that in-store responsibilities remain with union employees. Full details of the agreement will be shared during upcoming ratification vote meetings.

While Rybrevant is an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, Zegfrovy is a first-in-class selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
Since the FDA signed off on Zegfrovy last week, Dizal’s share price has increased by 10%.
Supporting the FDA approval of Zagfrovy is the WU-KONG1B trial, which showed the treatment shrunk tumors in 46% of patients and provided an 11.1-month median duration of response.
Dizal has completed enrollment in the study which will evaluate Zagfrovy versus chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients in 16 countries.","Eight years after it was established partly by AstraZeneca, Dizal Pharmaceuticals has gained its first FDA approval, winning an accelerated nod for Zegfrovy (sunvozertinib) to become the only U.S.-endorsed oral treatment for those with a rare type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Patients in the U.S. with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose cancer has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy are now eligible for Zegfrovy.

The blessing comes 16 months after the FDA signed off on Johnson & Johnson’s infused Rybrevant in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in the indication. While Rybrevant is an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody, Zegfrovy is a first-in-class selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

“(Zegfrovy) offers a more effective treatment option with enhanced safety and ease of administration for NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions,” Dizal CEO Xiaolin Zhang, Ph.D., said in a release.

Zhang, who served at AstraZeneca for 20 years before taking the reins at Dizal, told Fierce Pharma last year that he was in discussions with multiple drugmakers who were interested in partnering with the Shanghai-based company on Zagfrovy. Dizal already commercializes the drug in China, where it was approved in August of 2023.

Since the FDA signed off on Zegfrovy last week, Dizal’s share price has increased by 10%.

Dizal will try to succeed where another oral EGFR inhibitor failed in the indication. Takeda’s Exkivity, which received an accelerated FDA approval for second-line use in 2021, was withdrawn from the U.S. market two years later after it failed to beat out chemotherapy in a confirmatory trial.

Supporting the FDA approval of Zagfrovy is the WU-KONG1B trial, which showed the treatment shrunk tumors in 46% of patients and provided an 11.1-month median duration of response.

These figures compare to a 40% objective response rate (ORR) and an 11.1-month median duration response, which backed the accelerated nod for Rybrevant in 2021. Meanwhile, the trial supporting conditional approval of Exkivity showed a 28% ORR.

Additionally, in WU-KONG1B, Zagfrovy showed an anti-tumor effect regardless of prior treatment with Rybrevant. The WU-KONG1B trial enrolled patients in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.

“Findings from WU-KONG1B have demonstrated Zegfrovy's significant therapeutic effects with consistent efficacy across both Asian and non-Asian patient populations,” Pasi Jänne, M.D., Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School and the lead principal investigator, said in the release. “Its convenient once-daily oral dosing substantially improves administration convenience and patient adherence, which is an increasingly critical factor as lung cancer care shifts toward chronic disease management.”

Along with the approval, the FDA simultaneously signed off on Thermo Fisher’s Oncomine Dx Express Test as a companion diagnostic to identify patients with EGFR Exon 20 insertions.

Roughly 2% of NSCLC patients have the genetic type, though it is the third most common type of EGFR mutation.

Treating this type of NSCLC is “particularly challenging” because of its “unique spatial conformation, diverse mutation subtypes, and high heterogeneity,” according to Mengzhao Wang, M.D., Ph.D., the principal investigator of the WU-KONG1B study. “As a result, patients face a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.”

As for the progression of Zagfrovy, much will depend on its multinational phase 3 WU-KONG28 trial. Dizal has completed enrollment in the study which will evaluate Zagfrovy versus chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients in 16 countries.

At the 2023 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) conference, Dizal reported that Zegfrovy as a solo treatment in the first-line setting achieved an ORR of 79% and a median progression-free survival of 12.4 months.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/fiercepharma/1644327351/greenlight.jpg/greenlight.jpg?VersionId=LhMxhJMPbJ2t8xpkYyIRznMdcYZPYi7U,N,,2025-07-07 12:14:12.866992

The company's Q2 2025 results mark a pivotal moment for its $36 billion MedTech business, which accounts for 36% of total revenue. Despite challenges in China and tariff pressures, JNJ is positioned to accelerate growth in the second half of the year, fueled by strategic acquisitions and a robust pipeline. Here's why investors should consider this stock as a “Buy.”

Asia Pacific Struggles: China's VBP Program and No Near-Term Relief

The MedTech segment's performance in Asia Pacific, particularly China, remains a drag. The government's volume-based procurement (VBP) program—a cost-containment initiative—has slashed sales volumes and prices for medical devices. Anticorruption campaigns have further stifled demand. J&J has explicitly stated it expects no improvement in China's market conditions in 2025 as the VBP program expands to more provinces and product categories.

While Asia Pacific accounts for roughly 30% of MedTech sales, the segment's outlook in this region is grim. Competitors like Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) are also grappling with these pressures, but J&J's exposure to China's MedTech market makes it particularly vulnerable.

U.S. Innovation: Growth Engine for MedTech's Turnaround

The U.S. market is where JNJ's MedTech strategy is paying off. Key drivers include:

1. Acquisitions: Newly acquired businesses like Abiomed (cardiovascular solutions) and Shockwave (vascular therapies) contributed significantly to Q1's 4.1% operational sales growth. These firms are now integral to JNJ's cardiovascular portfolio.

2. Electrophysiology Momentum: Despite competitive pressures from rivals like Abbott (ABT) and Boston Scientific in PFA ablation catheters, JNJ is advancing its VARIPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation Platform (approved in early 2025). While sales dipped in Q1 due to one-time orthopedic issues, this segment is expected to rebound as the VARIPULSE gains traction post-U.S. regulatory reviews.

3. Robotic Surgery: The OTTAVA system, a next-gen robotic surgical platform, is on track for FDA approval in 2026. Early trials suggest it could disrupt the $5 billion robotic surgery market dominated by Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).

The U.S. MedTech market grew 5.1% operationally in Q1, driven by cardiovascular and general surgery products. With fewer one-time disruptions in Q2, this momentum is poised to accelerate.

Second-Half Acceleration: Easing Comparisons and New Product Lift

JNJ's guidance points to stronger MedTech performance in the second half of 2025. Key catalysts include:

- Easing Comparisons: The first quarter faced tougher year-over-year comparisons, but Q2 and beyond should see easier benchmarks.

- Pipeline Execution: The OTTAVA system's FDA approval timeline and expanded use of Shockwave's lithoplasty technology in peripheral artery disease (PAD) will drive growth.

- Global Diversification: While China's issues persist, markets like Europe and Japan are stable, offsetting regional risks.

Management also highlighted that tariff-related costs, though a near-term profit headwind, are factored into full-year guidance. The company's adjusted EPS is expected to grow 6.2% in 2025, with the MedTech segment's operational sales forecasted to expand 2.5%–3.5%.

Valuation and Zacks Metrics: Undervalued with a Strong Buy Signal

JNJ's shares are trading at a forward P/E of 14.43, below both the industry average (14.99) and its five-year historical mean (15.73). The stock has outperformed the sector YTD, rising 9.7% versus a 0.6% decline for healthcare peers.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 EPS is $10.62, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Analyst upgrades and a robust dividend yield of 2.3% further bolster its appeal.

Investment Thesis: Buy on Undervaluation and Turnaround Potential

JNJ's MedTech segment is transitioning from a China-dependent model to one fueled by U.S. innovation and diversification. The second-half acceleration narrative, supported by new products and easing comparisons, justifies a “Buy” stance. Key risks include:

- Tariff Costs: Could compress margins unless offset by pricing power.

- Regulatory Delays: The OTTAVA system's FDA timeline is critical.

However, the stock's valuation discount and Zacks' bullish rating suggest the market underestimates JNJ's ability to navigate these challenges. Investors seeking a resilient, dividend-paying stock with growth catalysts should consider JNJ a top pick in the MedTech space.

Actionable Takeaway: Accumulate JNJ shares on dips below $175, with a 12-month price target of $195–$200.

Dive Brief:

Johnson & Johnson’s Abiomed has recalled automated controllers for its Impella heart pumps over a fault linked to three deaths, the Food and Drug Administration said last week.

Abiomed’s controllers can fail to detect a pump when connected. No visual alarm is triggered by the fault, which can lead to inadequate hemodynamic support that puts patients at risk.

The FDA released an early alert about a week after Abiomed contacted customers because the fault is a potentially high-risk issue. Abiomed has advised users on how to mitigate the risk.

Dive Insight:

Healthcare professionals use the Impella pump to provide temporary full or partial heart support. The device pumps part or all of the patient’s blood circulation during certain procedures or when a person’s heart needs time to recover from an acute condition.

Abiomed provides an automated Impella controller with the heart pumps. The device is the primary user control interface for Impella pumps. Information about the use of the pump, including error messages when needed, are shown on the controller’s screen.

The company has identified two situations in which the controller may fail to detect the Impella pump when connected. During a console-to-console transfer, the controller can freeze on a screen that tells users to anticoagulate once the sheath is in place.

Abiomed has asked users to check if the screen freezes for more than 20 seconds and does not advance after connecting the pump to the transferred console. If that happens, users should immediately switch the pump to the previous console to restore support to the patient. Abiomed has advised users to switch to a different console if the previous console displays an alarm message.

The other fault happens during the case start process, when the screen can freeze on information about connecting up the controller. Abiomed has asked users to switch the pump to a different console if the screen freezes for more than 20 seconds after connecting the pump and does not progress to indicate “Detecting Impella.”

To mitigate the risks, the company has told users to have a back-up controller available. Abiomed said device failure is unlikely. The FDA is yet to classify the recall but has published an early alert, which the agency reserves for potentially high-risk issues.

When FDA classifies the recall, the affected controllers will add to the list of 46 products that Abiomed has recalled since being acquired by J&J in December 2022.

The run of post-takeover regulatory actions began in April 2023 with a Class I recall that was triggered by complaints that purge fluid had leaked from the purge sidearm of the pump.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nzcbnYrvivroHpNaclT3RVM4JE8nuguAMWN7D44-NQU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BYmlvbWVkX2hlYXJ0X3B1bXBfcmVzaXplZC5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-07-07 12:14:20.624854

The deal may trigger a new consolidation in the tech industry, he said.
According to tech industry observers, Capgemini, with WNS’s operational expertise integrated into its offerings, could deliver end-to-end transformation services that the Big 4 cannot – and at lower price points.
In some cases like procurement services, Capgemini acquires a well-established strategic sourcing capability built on WNS’s 2017 Denali acquisition, strengthening Capgemini’s F&A and procurement capabilities.
Earlier in the day, Capgemini and WNS had entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which Capgemini would acquire WNS for a total cash consideration of $3.3 billion.","Capgemini, the Paris-based technology and digital transformation major, made the Big 4 – Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG – sit up globally on Monday with its announcement of buying the India-grown business process management firm WNS for a total cash consideration of $3.3 billion, said global analysts.

“This acquisition will give Capgemini a new positioning in the global tech market against the Big 4 comprising Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG, which have traditionally dominated the consulting and technology services,” Phil Fersht, CEO, HFS Research, a Cambridge-based analyst firm told The Hindu.

Mr. Fersht said, from a competitive perspective, a potential big win for Capgemini was its new positioning against the Big 4, which have traditionally dominated consulting and technology services.

“With Capgemini’s global scale and depth of technical capabilities, the addition of WNS could create an ideal incubation business to develop leading-edge Services-as-Software solutions to attack this huge $1.5 trillion emerging marketing opportunity,” Mr. Fersht said.

“The long-rumoured acquisition of WNS is finally here. Capgemini is returning to its acquisition lead growth model and acting as a major force in industry consolidation.,” said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and executive chairman of Dallas-based Everest Group.

According to the Everest Group’s chief, Capgemini is betting that the WNS book of business will provide a fertile ground for AI-driven transformation and allow it to develop new transformative AI-powered platforms. “The potential is clearly there, but the journey will require significant additional investment and a resolute leadership team,” Mr Bendor-Samuel cautioned.

The deal may trigger a new consolidation in the tech industry, he said.

Mr. Bendor-Samuel said BPO (BPM) as a space has held up well in a world rocked by AI which has yet to have a significant impact on the space. “However, this deal could be the start of a significant industry consolidation,” he opined.

“This may well kick off another round of industry consolidation as the large strategics look to grow inorganically and prepare for the massive changes that AI is starting to bring,” he forecast.

According to tech industry observers, Capgemini, with WNS’s operational expertise integrated into its offerings, could deliver end-to-end transformation services that the Big 4 cannot – and at lower price points.

In some cases like procurement services, Capgemini acquires a well-established strategic sourcing capability built on WNS’s 2017 Denali acquisition, strengthening Capgemini’s F&A and procurement capabilities. Also, WNS’s North American and U.K.-centric client base allows Capgemini to expand its geographic footprint.

To a firm like Capgemini, Mr. Fersht further said, WNS’s client base was a gold mine of sales opportunities where its client operations executives could easily explore to replace BPO services with Services-as-Software. “Further, WNS’s deep domain expertise, the cornerstone of its client growth rate, provides Capgemini, which has historically lagged behind other companies in terms of domain-specific operational BPO delivery,” he added.

Earlier in the day, Capgemini and WNS had entered into a definitive transaction agreement under which Capgemini would acquire WNS for a total cash consideration of $3.3 billion.

The French tech major said it would US-listed WNS for a cash consideration of $76.50 per WNS share, which represents a premium of 28% to the last 90-day average share price, of 27% to the last 30-day average share price and a premium of 17% to the last closing share price on July 3, 2025.

The transaction would be accretive to Capgemini’s normalised EPS by 4% before synergies in 2026 and 7% post synergies in 2027, it said. “Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS will provide the Group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations,” said Aiman Ezzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini.

Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS said, “Organisations that have already digitised are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core—shifting from automation to autonomy.”

In sum – what to know:

AI operations – new Danone AI academy in Poland aims to upskill 20,000 factory staff in AI by 2026.

Industry 5.0 – push includes AI-driven decision-making, digital twins, and a 10-site innovation network

Digital change – ongoing Renew Danone strategy ties digital training to productivity and sustainability.

French food and beverage manufacturer Danone has opened a so-called ‘Industry 5.0 Academy’ to train 20,000 operational staff in digital technology and artificial intelligence (AI) by next year (2026). The academy is part of its digital manufacturing strategy, geared to improve the productivity, sustainability, resilience, and flexibility of its global operations. Danone has 183 production sites around the world; the new academy cohort will be taken from all.

The new facility is located at the company’s Nutricia factory in Opole, in southern Poland. (The Nutricia brand specialises in therapeutic food and infant formula.) The site in Opole is listed as one of the World Economic Forum’s ‘global digital lighthouse’ venues. Training will cover advanced automation, AI prompt writing, and data-enabled decision-making; modules will be delivered in person and online.

Indeed, the Paris-based firm has a burgeoning reputation as a digital progressive. It is using AI – or data analytics and machine learning, marketed as AI – variously for predictive maintenance (“smart sensors detect vibrations and temperature changes to anticipate machine issues before they occur”), generative AI agents (“AI assistants analyse production line data”), ‘AI decision-making’ (“to optimise processes, such as spray drying in baby formula production”), and digital twins (“AI powered simulations… to test new recipes and production scenarios virtually”).

It will also create a “new network of 10 pioneering factories” to pilot disruptive smart manufacturing (“digital factory of the future”) models, it said. “The academy is just the beginning,” said Vikram Agarwal, chief operations officer at the firm. “Our ambition is to set new industry standards for human-machine collaboration, so we can better service our customers, consumers, and patients around the world.”

A year ago, Danone signed with US software giant Microsoft to “explore” a multi-year collaboration to integrate AI throughout its operations. It said at the time, the pair would launch a ‘Danone Microsoft AI Academy’, dedicated to upskilling all Danone employees to ensure that all Danoners are equipped with the AI and digital tools they need to thrive in the new AI-driven economy. Presumably, the new academy is the upshot, in some fashion.

There was no reference to Microsoft in the latest release. But the original remit, from a year ago, talked about upskilling or reskilling around 100,000 Danone employees “to the jobs of the future”, as well as attracting new AI talent. The duo talk about AI solutions and use cases for “all of Danone’s functions”, as well as for an “AI-enabled supply chain”. As many as 50,000 staff are already in position to leverage AI in their day-to-day work, they said – with Microsoft Copilot, and suchlike.

Danone employs around 90,000 people, and sells products in around 120 markets. Its 2024 sales revenue was €27.4 billion. Its brands include Actimel, Activia, Alpro, Aptamil, Danette, Danio, Evian, Nutricia, Nutrilon, and Volvic.

Vikram Agarwal, chief operations officer at Danone, said of the new initiative: “The global manufacturing sector faces a significant shortfall of skilled workers. It’s a commercial imperative for us to train existing talent… to be active participants in Industry 5.0. Technologies like AI and robotics are already reshaping how we operate – but their true potential lies in the hands of our people. The [academy] is about how we bring that vision to life… Our ambition is to set new industry standards for human-machine collaboration.”

It’s a key pillar of our Renew Danone strategy and will create long-term value for all our stakeholders.

Meanwhile, Danone is investing in a Digital Lab (D-Lab) in Singapore, focused on ‘digital science, data analytics, and AI-driven health solutions’. Danone has a partnership with the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), with a joint initiative around ‘digital health’ since 2018. Danone’s research and innovation network spans multiple continents, anchored by flagship centres in Paris, France, and Utrecht, Netherlands.

It has a concerted co-innovation programme with partners, with a whole bunch of strategic agreements (19, as of September) and joint business development plans (eight) across ingredients, packaging, manufacturing, agriculture, and indirect suppliers. It said it wanted to double its number of partnerships over the next two years, as part of this Partner for Growth (P4G) scheme.

Like the new academy, and its tyre-kicking on AI with Microsoft, its partner programme is part of its so-called Renew Danone strategy, which is based around “science and technology, precision capacity creation, cost competitiveness and sustainability”. New digital technologies and techniques are a core part of the whole plan – to enable its staff to bring higher efficiency, productivity, and sustainability to its operations, as it repeatedly notes.",https://www.rcrwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/danone.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:15:38.795896

McDonald's to find 'restaurant gaps' across Australia, open dozens of new stores

In an interview with local news outlets, McDonald's Australia CEO Joe Chiczewski said the chain plans to open between 30 and 50 new locations across the country by the end of 2026.

""We’re going to open more restaurants over the next 12 months,” Chiczewski told News.com.au, adding that the goal is to find ""restaurant gaps"" in different parts of the country. ""That is a key priority for our growth strategy. Not just the next 12 months, but over the next few years.""

Chiczewski added that the chain is setting its sights on Perth in the western part of the country and framed it as ""continuing to invest in the Aussie community.""

At the start of July, McDonald's Australia announced that it will lock in the prices of certain meal deals and items on its Loose Change Menu at a respective $7 ($4.55 USD) and $4 ($2.60 USD), as many customers expressed concerns with the rising cost of living.

In announcing the upcoming openings, Chiczewski also said the higher demand is fueled by customers choosing to forgo traditional restaurants due to expense.

""My commitment to Australian customers is clear: 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, you can count on us for great value at Macca's,"" he said further.

The new concentrator is engineered to transform Liberia’s abundant but lower-grade iron ore into a high-grade product, adding substantial value before export.
By processing the ore on African soil, Liberia will ship a higher-value product rather than just raw ore, aligning with broader African goals of industrialization and value addition.
These upgrades mean Liberia’s mining corridor now meets international operational and environmental standards, paving the way for multi-user access and regional integration.
ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and, through this expansion, has supported over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs over its two decades in the country.","ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel producer, has officially opened a cutting-edge iron ore concentrator at the Tokadeh mine in northern Liberia, marking a defining moment in the country’s post-war economic transformation.

The inauguration event, held in Nimba County and attended by Liberia’s President Joseph Nyuma Boakai alongside ArcelorMittal’s Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal, showcased one of Africa’s largest iron ore beneficiation plants.

This new concentrator – the first of its kind in West Africa – is the centerpiece of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II Expansion Project, a US$1.8 billion investment that brings the company’s total investment in Liberia to about US$3.5 billion. It is one of the most significant private-sector investments in Liberia since the civil war, cementing ArcelorMittal’s role as the nation’s biggest foreign investor.

President Boakai hailed the project as a “turning point” for Liberia’s industrial future, calling it a symbol of the country’s resilience and a vote of confidence in its stability.

The new concentrator is engineered to transform Liberia’s abundant but lower-grade iron ore into a high-grade product, adding substantial value before export. Using advanced beneficiation technology, the plant upgrades raw hematite ore (~35% iron content) into premium 66% Fe magnetite concentrate.

This higher-grade concentrate commands a better price on global markets and is in growing demand for efficient, lower-emission steelmaking processes like Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). By processing the ore on African soil, Liberia will ship a higher-value product rather than just raw ore, aligning with broader African goals of industrialization and value addition.

“The iron ore that leaves Liberia should not just be raw material—we must add value, create jobs, and build an industrial base for our future,” President Boakai said at the ceremony. This emphasis on local beneficiation echoes the African Union’s vision for mineral-led industrialization, demonstrating how African countries like Liberia (and by extension Ghana and others) can leverage natural resources to spark homegrown industrial development instead of exporting commodities in their lowest form. ArcelorMittal’s Executive Chairman Lakshmi Mittal noted that the concentrator will significantly improve product quality and “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” securing the country’s position as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.

IArcelorMittal’s expansion has been just as much about building Liberia’s infrastructure as boosting output. Alongside the concentrator, the company has invested heavily in modernizing critical transport and energy facilities. The 243-kilometer railway linking the Tokadeh mines to the coastal port of Buchanan has been completely overhauled, with hundreds of thousands of new sleepers laid, track geometry improved, and new passing loops added to handle long, heavy trains.

These upgrades mean Liberia’s mining corridor now meets international operational and environmental standards, paving the way for multi-user access and regional integration. ArcelorMittal has publicly endorsed an open access policy for the railway, working with the Liberian government on a practical operational framework to allow other mining companies to utilize the rail and port under fair agreements.

This sets the stage for Liberia to serve as a regional minerals hub: iron ore deposits from neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone could potentially be transported via Liberia’s infrastructure in the future, strengthening West African economic integration. “These projects are essential to deepening Liberia’s integration into global value chains and unlocking long-term benefits for our people,” President Boakai noted, underscoring how improved infrastructure will connect Liberia – and West Africa – more deeply to international trade networks.

The scale of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II expansion has delivered an immediate boon in employment and training opportunities for Liberians. During the construction of the concentrator and associated infrastructure, over 5,000 jobs were created on site, the majority filled by Liberian workers.

Now that the plant is operational, it is expected to generate roughly 1,000 permanent new jobs in mining, processing, rail operations, and port logistics. “This brings great relief to our economy noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” President Boakai said, highlighting the tangible impact on families and communities.

ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and, through this expansion, has supported over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs over its two decades in the country. In addition to job creation, a strong emphasis has been placed on skill development to ensure Liberians are at the helm of the industry.

The company’s Training Academy in Yekepa has been expanded and modernized, offering a fully funded multi-year technical training program for youth. Dozens of young Liberian engineers and technicians are being trained in disciplines such as mechanical maintenance, electrical systems, heavy equipment operations, and ore processing, gaining the expertise needed to operate the sophisticated new concentrator and related facilities. “I saw young men and women being trained to run this complex facility.

They are the true face of Liberia’s tomorrow,” President Boakai remarked, referring to the new cadre of skilled workers emerging from these programs. This transfer of knowledge and skills is expected to have a long-term multiplier effect, empowering a new generation of Liberian professionals to lead not only in mining, but also to apply their expertise in other sectors.

The expansion has also invigorated local businesses: Liberian contractors were engaged for civil works, trucking, camp services and more, meaning thousands of indirect jobs and a stimulus to local enterprises in Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties.

As Liberia’s largest taxpayer, ArcelorMittal Liberia’s enlarged operations will contribute increased tax revenues and royalties to the government, enabling greater public investment in development projects across the country.

ArcelorMittal Liberia’s current mining infrastructure has been built with future expansion in mind: the upgraded rail and port can handle up to 30 million tonnes of ore annually, leaving room for a further increase beyond the initial 20 Mt target. In fact, company officials disclosed ambitions for a phased ramp-up to 30 Mt per year and possibly building a pelletizing plant down the line. Such expansions would not only boost output but could also enable more in-country processing (like making direct-reduced iron pellets), which would be a game-changer for West Africa’s role in the global steel supply chain.

The project’s social sustainability is also underlined by ArcelorMittal’s community development commitments. The company contributes about $3 million annually to a community development fund, which has financed schools, clinics, water systems, and livelihood programs in local communities.

President Boakai emphasized the importance of this partnership approach, stating that large investments must “enrich the corporate social responsibility envelope” so that communities feel the benefits “not just in employment, but in schools, clinics, and markets”. He urged ArcelorMittal to continue its support for education, healthcare, and small businesses in Liberia, reinforcing that sustainable development should be a mutually beneficial endeavor for both the investor and the nation.

The successful commissioning of this world-class concentrator in Liberia carries broader implications for Africa’s development trajectory. It demonstrates that with a stable investment climate and forward-looking policies, African countries can attract and absorb multibillion-dollar investments in heavy industry.

“We would not have invested this scale of capital of nearly $3 billion if we didn’t believe in Liberia and its people,” ArcelorMittal’s Lakshmi Mittal commented, stressing the company’s long-term confidence in the country.

Such an endorsement from a global industry leader sends a positive signal to international markets about West Africa’s potential as an investment destination. For African governments, the Liberia project highlights the importance of creating a conducive environment for investors while also negotiating agreements that ensure local benefits.

The expansion’s regional integration angle also resonates with continental initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which aims to bolster cross-border infrastructure and industrial supply chains. By developing a mining and transport corridor that could eventually service multiple countries, Liberia is helping lay the groundwork for West African economic corridors that could link mines, power plants, ports, and cities across borders. The project’s focus on value addition and skills transfer aligns with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development.

It offers a case study to other resource-rich nations – such as Guinea, Sierra Leone, or Ghana, on how investing in local processing facilities and infrastructure can amplify the economic impact of natural resources. For investors and companies, ArcelorMittal Liberia’s venture underscores the opportunities in Africa’s drive toward industrialization: building mines and plants not only to extract resources, but to refine and export higher-value products and ultimately, finished products. It also shows that strong ESG practices and community engagement can go hand-in-hand with profitability, thereby de-risking large projects.

In sum, the newly inaugurated Tokadeh concentrator stands as a landmark of African industrial progress, a shining example of resilience, ambition, and partnership. Liberia has emerged from the shadows of conflict and crisis to reclaim its place on the global mining map, this time with a focus on sustainable growth and shared prosperity. The nation is now poised to export not just raw materials, but innovation, skills, and a narrative of success.

As the first high-grade iron ore shipments from the concentrator set sail later this year, a powerful message reverberates across the continent: Africa is open for business and ready to lead in transforming its natural wealth into lasting development.",https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ore-.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:14:50.666368

The biggest story? Tariffs, again.

On Wednesday, a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs expires, and President Donald Trump has made it clear: no extensions. Instead, he’s expected to begin sending out letters detailing new tariff rates for trading partners—an announcement he’s teased for 12pm ET on Monday via his Truth Social account.

Markets have taken it in stride—so far. But Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, warns that the calm may not last. “The market remains sanguine about the prospect of tariffs,” she said. “But that raises the risk of a deeper selloff. This is a crucial week for the dozens of countries trying to reach trade agreements with the US.”

In other words, headline risk is back on the table. And this time around, it may be more targeted. Analysts expect tariff impacts to be sector- and region-specific, with autos and metals among the likely focal points. That means risk aversion could hit hardest in countries—like Japan and Canada—that have struggled to make progress in negotiations.

Still, some argue that the broader market may prove resilient. “The macro story remains strong,” Brooks added, pointing to last week’s jobs report showing a still-solid US labor market. That strength is helping prop up confidence, even as investors brace for what could be a bumpy start to the week.

Trade twists and the Fed’s fog

Deutsche Bank analysts echoed a similar tone, noting that while the administration may impose new tariffs on lagging trade partners, a return to “Liberation Day” levels (north of 20%) seems unlikely. Treasury Secretary Bessent has hinted at progress in negotiations, and the Senate’s removal of a contentious “revenge tax” provision from last week’s newly passed budget bill could help reduce friction.

Still, as Swissquote’s Ipek Ozkardeskaya put it, “you can’t count on the tariffs announced in the next few hours staying unchanged for more than a day. That’s just the reality.” And with Trump threatening extra duties for countries aligning with BRICS, the geopolitical drama is unlikely to ease.

Adding to the mix is Wednesday’s release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting. The Fed has been sharply divided over whether rate cuts are needed this year, and last week’s labor market data did little to push consensus in either direction. The minutes will be closely watched for clues on how deep those divisions go.

Only two Fed officials are scheduled to speak this week—both non-voters—so the market will likely key off the minutes and bond market signals, especially after the passage of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which includes an extension of tax cuts, more defense spending, and Medicaid cuts. The bill is expected to add over $3 trillion to the US debt over the next decade—raising concerns about borrowing costs.

Oil slips, energy stocks sputter

Meanwhile, oil is under renewed pressure as OPEC+ agreed to boost production by an additional 548,000 barrels per day—well above expectations—with more increases likely in September. Shell is down over 2.8% after warning of a weak second quarter, citing underperformance in its trading division and refining losses. The company also recently ruled out a bid for rival BP, adding to investor concerns.

Musk moves markets again

Tesla is back in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Shares dropped more than 7% in pre-market trading Monday after Elon Musk announced the launch of a new political party aimed at challenging Democrats and Republicans alike. The move, which drew immediate backlash from Trump, is renewing investor worries that Musk is distracted from the core business, even as EV sales slide and competition ramps up.

Earnings season kicks off—softly

While the Q2 earnings season doesn’t ramp up in earnest until mid-July, Thursday brings results from Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), Conagra Brands Inc (NYSE:CAG), and Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI), offering early clues on consumer demand and corporate profitability.

For now, US equity markets remain near record highs, but with tariffs looming, oil under pressure, and earnings season kicking off against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, it’s shaping up to be a test of investor confidence—and nerves.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzA3XC9zaHV0dGVyc3RvY2stMjc1MjA4ODc1LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-07-07 13:16:21.013777

Here's what to know if you are affected by the CVS Caremark formulary change.
What to do if you get Zepbound through CVS Caremark First, check your mailbox.
Those using weight loss drugs on coverage plans different from the standard formulary are not impacted.
CVS Caremark estimates between 25 to 30 million people use its standard formulary template, comprising about 30% of its entire membership base.","When Zepbound, Eli Lilly's highly anticipated weight loss drug, hit the market a year and a half ago, it marked a turning point for the accessibility of weight loss drugs.

Since then, Zepbound, the brand name for tirzepatide, has nearly become a household drug brand. Lilly estimates 4.5 million people take one of the Indianapolis drugmaker's GLP-1 medicines to lose weight or curb other health concerns like sleep apnea.

But a recent coverage change by a major pharmacy benefit manager may force many to decide how much they're willing to pay for the drug or whether they want to try another weight loss option.

As of July 1, CVS dropped Zepbound from preferred coverage for those covered by its pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark. Novo Nordisk A/S's Wegovy, a semiglutide injectable medicine, is now the primary weight loss drug offered on CVS's standard formulary, a list of medications an insurance plan covers.

The news was not only a blow to Lilly but also a surprise to millions using Zepbound on Caremark plans, who are now questioning how to move forward.

Here's what to know if you are affected by the CVS Caremark formulary change.

What to do if you get Zepbound through CVS Caremark

First, check your mailbox. Those affected should have received a letter with additional information and next steps that could vary person to person.

Generally speaking, under the formulary change, CVS Caremark will now cover Wegovy for patients prescribed GLP-1 drugs, and patients on Caremark insurance plans should be able to switch easily.

Those who currently use Zepbound on an insurance plan negotiated by Caremark should have received a letter stating the date their transition goes into effect. Some transitions may happen later than July 1, depending on the plan's sponsor.

The coverage change only applies to employer and union insurance plans that choose the standard formulary template, about one-third of the population Caremark covers. Those using weight loss drugs on coverage plans different from the standard formulary are not impacted.

Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about switching. Caremark offers a medical exceptions process for patients to gain access to off-formulary medications if the preferred alternative is ineffective.

Or, talk to your employer. Some employers negotiate their own coverage plans so they may be able to switch to a non-standard formulary.

Lilly also offers resources online to those on Zepbound.

How much does Zepbound cost out of pocket?

The list price for Zepbound sits at $1,086 for a 28-day supply, for those without insurance.

Lilly estimates patients who have insurance that covers Zepbound pay as little as $25 for a one or three-month supply. Those with commercial insurance plans that do not cover Zepbound may be eligible for a 1-month supply that runs $650. One month equates to 28 days, or four injectable pens.

Can you get Zepbound directly from Lilly?

Yes. Lilly sells vials of Zepbound to consumers through its online sales portal, LillyDirect.

The lowest dose of 2.5 milligrams starts at $349 for four single doses that will last four weeks. Higher dose packs start at $499.

The Indianapolis drugmaker expanded access through LillyDirect, and providers will be able to prescribe 12.5 and 15 milligram doses starting July 7.

How many people use Zepbound and Wegovy through CVS Caremark?

CVS Caremark estimates between 25 to 30 million people use its standard formulary template, comprising about 30% of its entire membership base. However, not all of those members take weight loss drugs.

Weight loss drugs represent about 10% of what Caremark clients spend, up from 1% just a couple of years ago, a CVS executive said.

Wegovy and Zepbound use is pretty evenly split for those on weight loss drugs through Caremark plans.

Are Wegovy and Zepbound the same drug?

Not entirely.

Zepbound and Wegovy come from the same class of GLP-1 drugs and deliver significant weight loss through a once-weekly injection. But the two medications have different main active ingredients.

Zepbound's main ingredient is tirzepatide and is approved for weight loss and obstructive sleep apnea. Wegovy is a semiglutide medication and helps manage weight loss and cardiovascular health.

Though the two drugs are both approved for weight loss, a study published in May funded by Eli Lilly found that patients on Zepbound were more likely to experience weight loss. It was the first time the drugs were compared head-to-head.

Why is CVS Caremark excluding Zepbound from coverage?

Caremark says it is dropping Zepbound from preferred coverage to ultimately lower the cost of the drug for its clients.

Since Wegovy and Zepbound are clinically similar products approved for weight loss, Caremark encourages the drug manufacturers to compete against each other for preferred insurance coverage for millions of patients. Doing so, Caremark says, can significantly lower prices for employers and unions.

""Our decision to prefer Wegovy over Zepbound will deliver significant cost savings for our clients in this therapy class, and the lower net price we were able to negotiate for Wegovy will enable more employers to provide coverage for the weight loss category,"" CVS Health Vice President of External Affairs David Whitrap told IndyStar in a written statement.

Caremark expects employers and unions to expand access to Wegovy as a result of the change in policy.

Are there other GLP-1 drugs?

Two other GLP-1 injectables exist on the market, though each varies slightly from Zepbound and Wegovy.

Ozempic, the original blockbuster semaglutide injection developed by Novo Nordisk, is used to treat type 2 diabetes. Mounjaro, a Lilly tirzepatide drug, is approved to treat type 2 diabetes when combined with diet and exercise.

Eli Lilly is also well into clinical trials for the development of orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 drug for type 2 diabetes and weight management.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/11/26/USAT/76580679007-20241117-t-161843-z-1687233784-rc-26-x-7-akpelv-rtrmadp-3-healthobesitymedicaid.JPG?crop=2091,1176,x0,y0&width=2091&height=1176&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-07 14:14:27.108890

Earnings season is more than just a calendar—it’s the ultimate corporate report card, where a company’s promises are put to the test. This week, a fascinating mix of high-flyers, household names, and hidden gems will step into the spotlight, and their results could ignite explosive rallies or trigger painful slides.

To find the best opportunities, savvy investors look for companies with strong fundamentals that are poised for a positive surprise. Here’s your guide to the most compelling earnings reports to watch this week, along with the full calendar for your own research.

1. The High-Growth Powerhouse: Progressive (PGR)

All eyes are on insurance giant Progressive this week, and for good reason. The company is forecast to deliver a stunning 62% year-over-year surge in earnings per share (EPS). In an economy where growth can be hard to find, that number is a blockbuster.

With a strong Composite Rating of 81, Progressive already has solid fundamentals. The key question for investors: can it meet or beat these sky-high expectations? A strong report could confirm its market leadership and send the stock soaring, while any sign of weakness could be punished severely.

2. The Tech Paradox: Aehr Test Systems (AEHR)

Here’s a fascinating puzzle. Aehr Test Systems, a semiconductor equipment maker, boasts an elite Composite Rating of 97—a score reserved for the market’s top growth stocks. Yet, Wall Street expects its earnings to collapse by a jaw-dropping 103%.

This is a high-stakes test. Will the company’s guidance for the future outweigh the disastrous quarterly results? Investors will be digging through the report to understand this disconnect. This is a prime example of why you must look beyond a single metric; a high rating doesn’t guarantee a smooth ride.

3. The Consumer Bellwethers: Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Levi Strauss (LEVI)

Want a read on the American consumer? Look no further than Delta and Levi’s. Both iconic brands are facing headwinds, with Delta expected to report a 14% drop in earnings and Levi’s a 16% decline.

These reports will offer crucial clues about consumer spending habits. Are people pulling back on travel? Are they buying fewer discretionary items like new jeans? The answers could have ripple effects across the entire retail and travel sectors.

Packaging Spotlight: Plastic Leads with a Sustainable Twist

Plastic remains the dominant packaging material in the Consumer Packaged Goods market due to its cost-effectiveness, versatility, and durability. However, the focus is now on sustainable plastic innovation.

Nestlé is working toward making over 95% of its plastic packaging recyclable by 2025 and aims to cut virgin plastic usage by one-third from 2018 levels.

Leading companies are spearheading innovation:

In October 2024, Vaseline launched a recyclable, non-metal-spring pump in the United States and Canada—part of Unilever’s commitment to reducing plastic waste.

These efforts are helping reduce the environmental impact of packaging while aligning with consumers’ desire for eco-friendly solutions.

From wellness-focused food to new-generation personal care products, the region remains a hub of product development and consumer-first thinking.

Recent Developments in the Consumer Packaged Goods Market

This past week, bankrupt Prospect Medical Holdings, the parent company of CharterCARE, sold off arguably its most valuable remaining asset to Astrana.

Prospect sold off its 11,000 provider network to Astrana — the healthcare company formerly known as Apollo Medical Holdings, which describes itself as “a physician-centric, AI-powered healthcare company committed to delivering high-quality, patient-centered care.”

The provider groups involved in the deal are located in Southern California, Texas, Arizona, and Rhode Island.

The sale by Prospect to Astrana may make it more difficult to sell the bonds necessary to save Rhode Island’s third-largest hospital group.

Bond Sales Stagnated

For the past two months, the Rhode Island Health and Education Building Corporation (RIHEBC) has been attempting to sell bonds totaling $140,665,000. The money from the bonds is to fund the deal in which Georgia-based Centurion Foundation would take over the CharterCARE hospitals from bankrupt Prospect Medical Holdings. The hospitals include Roger Williams and Fatima.

Centurion has never run a hospital.

Josh Nemzoff, a top national hospital executive, said this latest development is a potential blow to the sale of the CharterCARE bonds.

“[The provider network is one of] the only profitable assets that Prospect owns, and they just sold them, which means that all those profits go to the new owner,” said Nemzoff.

The bonds were pre-marketed for weeks, which included roadshows, online presentations, and one-on-one investor meetings. The marketing started on May 7.

S&P rated the bonds as BB- with a negative outlook.

The sale of the bonds was scheduled to close on May 29; the bonds did not close, and the deal has been floundering. It is now six weeks later.

The Wall Street firm Barclays, the deal's underwriter and the group leading the marketing of the bonds, has been unable to sell a significant amount of the bonds.

“That means everything that’s left is losing even more money than before, because it’s not offset by these profitable entities. My guess is this will put even more pressure on Prospect and force them to close CharterCARE's sale as quickly as they can. If the Barclays [sale of the bonds] doesn’t go through quickly, there is significant trouble. Now that Barclays has had more than two months to market these bonds, at some point, someone’s gonna say, “This is not working,’” Nemzoff added.

According to Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for RIHEBC, the bonds are still being marketed.

The Deal

According to the press announcement on the deal, “The Company completed the acquisition of Prospect Health for a total purchase price of $708 million, a reduction from the originally announced $745 million in accordance with the terms of the executed Purchase Agreement. The updated purchase price underscores the Company's commitment to disciplined capital deployment, while maintaining full conviction in the value creation potential of the asset. The acquisition of Prospect Health will deepen Astrana's capabilities in providing access to high-quality and high-value care to communities across the country.”

""We are excited to welcome Prospect Health's physicians, providers, and team members to Astrana Health,"" said Brandon Sim, President and CEO of Astrana. ""Together, we will further accelerate our mission to drive consistent, coordinated, high-quality patient outcomes at scale, ultimately driving greater value across the healthcare ecosystem.""

Potential Big Impact

Rhode Island's healthcare system is now even more stressed.

Layoffs and closures have hit Thundermist, Providence Community Healthcare Centers, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, and Anchor Medical, to name but a few. Anchor, the primary care group that served 25,000 Rhode Islanders, closed last month.

Health insurers in Rhode Island are requesting premium increases of 20% or more.

This past week's passage of the Trump budget legislation, the so-called ""big beautiful bill,"" is expected to adversely impact the Medicaid coverage for tens of thousands in Rhode Island.

CharterCARE employs 2,400 full and part-time employees. Just over 1,100 of those jobs are union.

If the bonds do sell and Centurion takes control, CharterCARE would change from for-profit to not-for-profit, and the respective host cities, Providence (Roger Williams Hospital) and North Providence (Fatima), would lose approximately $6.5 million combined in tax revenues.

The two hospitals, combined, have 552 beds, conducted over 17,000 surgeries in 2024, and saw over 377,000 visits last year.

Companies exempt from reporting on non-material activities—defined as under 10% of revenue, CapEx, or OpEx.

Reporting templates streamlined—datapoints cut by 64% for non-financial firms and 89% for financial firms.

New measures apply from January 2026, with an option to delay until the 2026 financial year.

The European Commission has adopted a Delegated Act to streamline the EU Taxonomy framework, significantly easing the compliance load for financial and non-financial companies. The changes are part of a broader effort under the Omnibus I package to reduce administrative and reporting burdens across sustainability regulations.

“Today we take a decisive step towards a more growth-friendly, usable and proportionate sustainable finance framework,“ said Maria Luís Albuquerque, Commissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union.

“Our measures simplify the application of the EU Taxonomy and strike the right balance between reducing excessive administrative burden for our companies, while keeping our longer-term goals in focus, including the transition to a sustainable economy.”

Key Changes in the Simplification Package:

Materiality Thresholds Introduced:

Companies will no longer be required to assess EU Taxonomy eligibility or alignment for economic activities that are not financially material to their operations.

For non-financial companies, activities are non-material if they make up less than 10% of revenue, capital expenditure (CapEx), or operational expenditure (OpEx).

For financial companies, the same threshold applies to financial assets financing specific economic activities, provided the use of proceeds is known.

OpEx Reporting Relief:

Non-financial firms may now omit Taxonomy alignment assessments for total operating expenditures if these are not material to their business model. They are only required to report the total OpEx value along with a justification of non-materiality.

Simplified Reporting Templates:

Non-financial companies: 64% reduction in required datapoints.

Financial institutions: 89% reduction in datapoints, including simplified disclosure of the Green Asset Ratio (GAR).

“Do No Significant Harm” Criteria Adjusted:

Rules under the pollution prevention and control objective—especially those involving chemicals—have been clarified and simplified to ease compliance while maintaining environmental integrity.

RELATED ARTICLE: European Commission to Withdraw Greenwashing Regulation

Timeline and Implementation:

The changes are formalized in a Delegated Act amending the Taxonomy Disclosures, Climate, and Environmental Delegated Acts. Following a four-month scrutiny period by the European Parliament and Council—extendable by two additional months—the updated rules will:

Apply from 1 January 2026, covering the 2025 financial year.

Allow companies the option to delay implementation to the 2026 financial year if preferred.

These measures aim to align Europe’s green transition with its competitiveness goals by reducing bureaucratic friction in sustainable finance disclosures, without compromising environmental ambitions.

Originally published on U.S. Bank company blog

U.S. Bank released its third Small Business Perspective survey report, revealing how owners across the country are responding to an environment defined by rapid change. The nationwide survey of 1,000 small business owners explored how they are navigating challenges ranging from economic stressors to the rise of generative AI, all while remaining focused on long-term growth, succession planning, and leaving a lasting legacy.

""This year's survey makes it clear that small business owners are committed to future-proofing their businesses in response to today's economic climate and rapid technological change,"" said Shruti Patel, U.S. Bank's Chief Product Officer for Business Banking. ""From embracing generative AI to responding to shifting economic conditions like tariffs and thinking proactively about succession, owners are serious about the future of their businesses. There is a real opportunity - and responsibility - for financial institutions to show up as strategic partners in helping small businesses navigate what's next.""

Handing the Reins to the Next Generation

With more than half of U.S. small business owners now over age 55, succession planning is becoming increasingly urgent. While many owners are not yet ready to step away - with only 54% having created a succession plan - new generations are preparing to take their place: more than one-third (36%) of Gen Z and Millennial owners say they plan to acquire a business from a retiring owner.

The report reveals a striking gap between intention and action. While 85% of surveyed participants say they originally became an owner to create something they could pass on, and 84% wanted to create generational wealth for their family, only 54% have a formal succession plan in place.

A growing number of owners (62%) have seen their retirement timelines accelerate in the past five years. But for many, navigating succession is a challenge:

62% find the process overwhelming

56% worry they won't get a reasonable price for their business when it's time to sell

53% lack the proper resources or guidance to plan for the future of their business

Owners with strong business performance were more likely to have a succession plan in place: 64% of those with a plan reported significant growth over the past year, compared to 50% of those without a plan.

Nearly 4 in 10 small business owners (37%) say they plan to sell their business in the next 12 months, suggesting how quickly transitions of ownership may be approaching for some businesses. However, retiring business owners are not the only ones looking to sell, with a higher number of Gen Z and Millennial owners (41%) than Boomers and Gen X (33%) saying they plan to sell their business.

While the small business landscape has changed dramatically over the years, the motivations that originally inspired owners still drive them today. Most remain deeply committed to their work: 86% want to continue running their business as long as possible, and 87% are hopeful they'll leave behind a positive legacy when they eventually step away.

Economic Pressures are Influencing How Owners Operate

The need for small business owners to make long-term plans is reinforced by the day-to-day worries they are facing. Respondents reported their top macroeconomic stressors as:

The economic environment (98%)

Inflation or increased costs of materials / supplies (92%)

Competition (92%)

The ability of consumers to maintain their spending (86%)

Fraud or cybersecurity threats (85%)

Obtaining enough funding to support my business (84%)

Among other stressors small business owners cited, 4 out of 5 (81%) owners felt at least somewhat stressed about tariffs.

Despite these stressors, 96% of owners reported their business as currently successful and 88% saw growth in the past year. To manage pressures and position their businesses for the future, many owners are prioritizing key steps in the year ahead, including focusing on revenue (48%), ensuring enough staff (33%), improving company efficiency and cost-effectiveness (32%), and reacting to the general economic landscape such as inflation and recession risk (29%).

To get a pulse check on the most current sentiment, U.S. Bank conducted a follow-up survey of 500 small business leaders during the month of May. While stress levels on the economic environment were similarly high, two-thirds (66%) said the country's economy is moving in the right direction, with only 18% saying it's going in the wrong direction. This sentiment was even stronger among younger business leaders (Gen Z and Millennial), with 74% saying it was moving in the right direction, vs. 52% of leaders from older generations (Gen X and Boomer).

Despite this optimism, a majority (58%) of the leaders expressed at least some concern that tariffs may impact their business operations, and 57% expect their input costs to go up as a result of tariffs with most expecting a cost increase between 1-10%. At the same time, leaders were slightly more likely to anticipate a positive rather than negative impact from tariffs across several business factors - including cost of goods, customer demand, margin profitability, capital investments, and labor/HR - but these expectations were generally modest, with most leaders expressing a neutral or only slightly positive outlook on the potential effects of tariffs.

Small Business Owners are Turning to Gen AI and Digital Tools to Stay Competitive

As small business owners look to create long-term success for their businesses, they are embracing generative AI (Gen AI) and digital tools. Nearly 6 in 10 (57%) are currently using or plan to implement Gen AI solutions in the next year. Among those using it, the top applications include content creation (44%), data analysis and information gathering (41%), and marketing and sales strategies (39%).

The majority of owners using Gen AI have found that adoption doesn't require a massive investment. Nearly 7 in 10 (68%) Gen AI users report spending less than $50 a month on it, and nearly 1 in 5 (18%) are using free tools or subscriptions. These tools allow users to spend more time on the personal connection they have with their customers (88%).

Still, the rise of AI is not without tension. Over 8 in 10 (81%) report keeping up with technological advancements such as Gen AI is stressful, and 56% worry their business (or products / services) will be replaced by Gen AI or automation.

Beyond AI, digital tools are seen as essential now more than ever. The number of owners who view digital tools as very important or essential jumped a striking 15 percentage points from last year (87% in 2025 vs. 72% in 2024). At the same time, 63% say they're overwhelmed by the number of tools needed to run their business and 82% say consolidating them is a priority.

Looking at payment methods, nearly half (48%) of owners still report cash as a primary method of in-person payment. However, newer methods of payment are catching up with 42% reporting tap-to-pay as a primary method.

Despite Challenges, Most Owners Would Do It Again

Even amid today's business challenges, most small business owners remain grounded in their original purpose that inspired them to become entrepreneurs. When asked why they launched their business, 90% say they wanted to be their own boss, 88% cited a desire to control their financial future, and 86% wanted their passions to be part of their work.

Legacy has also played a defining role. More than two-thirds (67%) of owners come from a family of entrepreneurs, and 62% took over a relative's business to carry on their family legacy. For Gen Z and Millennial entrepreneurs, however, the path to ownership has often been shaped by necessity. More than half (52%) of younger owners say they became business owners because they couldn't find a job elsewhere, compared to 44% of Gen X and Boomer owners.

When asked if they'd do it all over again, 80% of owners say they'd still start their business today. This confidence is particularly notable given challenges they see in today's environment. Almost 8 in 10 (79%) say there is greater market competition today than when they started and 70% say that securing funding and capital is more difficult now.

The key takeaway: Marketers must move beyond siloed systems and embrace connected data to understand better, engage, and retain consumers in an increasingly complex omnichannel world.

According to The Global Consumer Products Engagement Report, 63% of Gen Z consumers say they don’t care about brands, and more than half of CPG marketers admit they can’t access or use data in real time. 63% of Gen Z consumers say they don’t care about brands, and more than half of CPG marketers admit they can’t access or use data in real time.

“The consumer journey is happening across digital and physical spaces,” Neely writes. “Yet most brands are still unable to connect the dots because their data is disconnected.”

Connected Data Powers Real-Time Personalization

By adopting platforms like SAP S/4HANA and SAP Emarsys, Neely says, brands can unify customer data, develop more accurate profiles, and activate AI-driven personalization at scale. This enables capabilities like:

Triggered mobile offers that drive in-store purchases

Progressive profiling to gather valuable customer insights over time

Real-time product recommendations powered by AI

Unified customer data across departments from marketing to supply chain

SAP cites candy maker Ferrara—owner of brands like NERDS and Jelly Belly—as a case study in transformation. The company integrated SAP tools to modernize legacy systems, create unified profiles, and turn casual buyers into brand fans.

Strategic Recommendations for Marketers

Neely offers several practical steps for marketers aiming to grow their consumer database and boost engagement:

Create omnichannel opt-in experiences using progressive profiling to collect data gradually.

Use personalized incentives to re-engage former subscribers via web forms and email.

Leverage AI and automation to scale personalized campaigns and free up creative teams.

The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers.
Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.","WASHINGTON (AP) — An analysis finds a critical group of U.S. employers would face a direct cost of $82.3 billion from President Donald Trump's current tariff plans, a sum that could potentially be managed through price hikes, layoffs, hiring freezes or lower profit margins.

The analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute is among the first to measure the direct costs created by the import taxes on businesses with $10 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, a category including roughly a third of private-sector U.S. workers. These companies are more dependent than other businesses on imports from China, India and Thailand — and the retail and wholesale sectors would be especially vulnerable to the import taxes being levied by the Republican president.

The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump's import taxes, contradicting his claims foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed.

The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum.

Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would've faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do.

Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: ""Everything's going well.""

The president has indicated he'll set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. Trump announced Wednesday he'd reached a deal with Vietnam, while India has signaled it's close to agreeing on a trade framework.

Trump said on his social media site Vietnam will pay the U.S. a 20% tariff on all goods sent ""into our Territory"" and a 40% tariff on any transshipping, which usually means exports that come from China but pass through Vietnam to dodge tariffs on Chinese goods.

In return, Vietnam will grant the U.S. ""TOTAL ACCESS"" to its market for trade, Trump said, meaning ""we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff."" He added he thinks SUVs ""will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam.""

There's a growing body of evidence suggesting more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report it expects companies to pass 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses' inflation expectations to say companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand.

The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins they might need to spread the tariffs' costs to their customers.

The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Fox News Channel's ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies.

The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate.

The findings are presented in our report: Mastering the Sale: 2025 Insights for Private Business Owners. With its candid, first-hand accounts and expert advice from BNY specialists, this report offers unique perspectives on the business of selling a business.

Smart sellers plan ahead

A business owner who begins deal preparations today won’t be selling into the market we have now, but the market of tomorrow. Indeed, 38% of owners in this study expressed regret they didn’t devote enough time to deal preparation. Ideally, a two-year runway ensures a smoother deal process. While the timing of a sale depends on each business owner’s unique circumstances, dedicating more time to developing the right strategy beforehand can ultimately result in a successful exit.

Make it less taxing

Tax and estate planning can make or break the overall success of a sale. In fact, 40% of study participants wished they had engaged in tax and estate planning earlier. Trusts, such as Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs), Spousal Lifetime Access Trusts (SLATs), Dynasty Trusts, and other wealth planning strategies may be essential for managing and protecting sale proceeds, reducing income and estate taxes, and transferring wealth across generations.

Build your team

To effectively navigate a sale, business owners will need to assemble their ‘deal team’ of expert advisors. This team will likely include an investment banker, wealth manager, certified public accountant, mergers & acquisitions attorney and a trust & estate attorney. Access to well-connected professionals with strong industry expertise provides sellers with essential guidance, advice and greater peace of mind throughout the deal process.

“You want advisors close to you who know your business and your family. Set this team up early. Establish regular meetings, so everyone knows each other and can work well together. You’re leveraging your team’s expertise, and that team is greater than the sum of its parts. Setting up this team early will allow the most success during and post-sale.”

Heather B. Cheney

Senior Wealth Strategist, BNY Wealth

Add AI to your deal team

A larger than expected 75% of respondents said they used or plan to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist them with selling their business. As AI technology rapidly evolves, it is expected to play a growing role in ways that assist the sale of a business, including compliance, valuation, accounting and financial preparation.

Life beyond the sale

Preparing for a sale can take years, making it easy to overlook the importance of what comes afterward. Sellers often leave behind longstanding relationships with employees and customers and are worried about carving out a new identity. To ease the transition, 90% remained involved temporarily as consultants or advisors, while 70% maintained an ownership stake in the business.

We understand that navigating the sale process can appear to be a formidable challenge. With careful planning, strategic guidance and the right support, a successful business sale can be a catalyst for unlocking new opportunities and securing a lasting legacy.

Health Investment: Prioritize companies offering mental health days, sleep programs, and preventive care (e.g., IBM's partnership with Headspace).","The modern workplace is undergoing a seismic shift. Employees are no longer content with just a paycheck—they demand environments that prioritize their mental and physical health, flexibility, and work-life balance. Companies that fail to adapt risk losing top talent, enduring higher turnover costs, and falling behind peers. Conversely, organizations investing in employee well-being are reaping rewards: higher productivity, stronger retention, and superior stock performance. This article explores why ""well-being-driven"" enterprises are becoming must-hold investments and how to identify them.

The Productivity Payoff: Well-Being as a Profit Multiplier

Recent data reveals a clear link between employee well-being and productivity. A McKinsey Health Institute report (2025) found that companies embedding holistic well-being programs—covering mental health, flexible work, and boundary-setting tools—achieve up to 20% higher productivity than peers. This isn't just about avoiding burnout; it's about fostering creativity and resilience. For instance, firms using AI-driven analytics (e.g., Microsoft's Viva Insights) to monitor workloads and stress levels report 15% faster problem-solving and 30% higher innovation output.

Microsoft's focus on hybrid work flexibility and employee wellness correlates with a 25% stock gain since 2023, outperforming Exxon's flat trajectory.

Retention: The Ultimate Cost-Saving Tool

High turnover is a silent killer of profitability. The 2024 Global Talent Retention Index estimates that replacing an employee costs 1.5–2x their annual salary. Companies prioritizing well-being slash this risk. A Deloitte study shows firms with robust well-being programs retain employees 10% longer, reducing recruitment costs and maintaining institutional knowledge.

Unilever's adoption of ISO 45003 psychosocial risk standards correlates with a 40% lower turnover rate compared to industry averages.

The Stock Market's Love Affair with Well-Being

Wall Street is catching on. A 2025 S&P analysis reveals that S&P 500 companies with top-tier well-being scores (as measured by employee satisfaction, DEI metrics, and health programs) have delivered 18% higher total returns over five years than those in the bottom quartile. This outperformance isn't accidental: well-being-driven firms attract top talent, stabilize labor costs, and avoid productivity-draining burnout.

Tech giants like Salesforce (CRM), which invest in mental health days and flexible work, have surged 35% since 2023, while healthcare laggards like CVS Health (CVS)—still grappling with outdated workplace policies—lag behind.

Risks for Laggards: Stagnation and Talent Exodus

The cost of resistance is steep. Companies clinging to 9-to-5 rigidities or ignoring burnout face a triple threat:

1. Talent Drain: A 2024 Glassdoor survey found 68% of workers would leave a job without mental health support.

2. Legal Pushback: The “Right to Disconnect” laws in 20+ countries (e.g., France, Japan) and the EU's Work-Life Balance Directive penalize non-compliance.

3. Reputation Damage: Social media and employee review sites amplify criticism of toxic workplaces, deterring customers and investors alike.

How to Invest: Spotting Well-Being Champions

Focus on firms demonstrating three pillars of well-being leadership:

1. Flexibility: Look for hybrid work models, remote options, and compressed workweeks (e.g., Microsoft's 4-day trials in Japan).

2. Health Investment: Prioritize companies offering mental health days, sleep programs, and preventive care (e.g., IBM's partnership with Headspace).

3. Accountability: Seek transparency via ESG reports or certifications like ISO 45003.

Top Sectors to Watch:

- Tech: Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM)

- Healthcare: UnitedHealth (UNH), Cigna (CI)

- AI/Analytics: NVIDIA (NVDA), Veeva Systems (VEEV)

Conclusion: Well-Being is the New Competitive Edge

The data is unequivocal: companies that invest in employee well-being aren't just doing good—they're doing well. From productivity gains to stock outperformance, the ROI is clear. For investors, the path is straightforward: allocate capital to firms prioritizing work-life balance, and avoid those clinging to outdated models. The well-being economy isn't a trend—it's the future of work.

High employee satisfaction (90+ scores) correlates with 20-30% higher stock returns over five years.

The BHRRC is calling for major fashion brands to respect the people who work for them.
Reports like The Missing Thread are pressuring fast-fashion companies to do better.","A report from the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre has called out many major fashion brands for their harmful labor practices.

What's happening?

Al Jazeera stated that the report, titled The Missing Thread, looked at 65 global fashion brands. Forty-four of them had previously pledged to reduce carbon emissions, but none of them created a ""just transition"" policy.

Just transition policies aim to protect workers while companies shift to cleaner energy. Of the 65 analyzed, only two companies are doing anything to protect their workers. One was Inditex, which owns Zara, and the other was Gucci's parent company, Kering.

Companies that have the least worker protections in conjunction with environmental policies include Hermes, Nike, and H&M.

Why should the fast-fashion industry change its ways?

The BHRRC is calling for major fashion brands to respect the people who work for them. Otherwise, their environmental policies are greenwashing.

As Natalie Swan, BHRRC's labour rights programme manager, said in a news release: ""The fashion industry's climate targets mean little if the people who make its products are not taken into consideration. It's not enough to go green. It has to be clean and fair.""

The United Nations Development Programme says that the concept of a just transition was first discussed in the 1980s. U.S. trade unions embraced it so workers weren't left behind when new pollution regulations took effect.

Just transitions value the public and local solutions. They also strive to create green jobs with living wages and health benefits.

Fast-fashion companies notoriously mistreat their workers, but a just transition could reverse some of the damage. If companies do this effectively, they could drastically reduce the dirty energy they use and the textile waste they produce every year.

What's being done about the lack of worker protections?

""Decarbonisation strategies, done right, protect workers and communities, reduce long-term risk and lay the foundation for stronger, fairer, and more resilient supply chains,"" Swan said in BHRRC's news release.

Reports like The Missing Thread are pressuring fast-fashion companies to do better. If we keep the pressure up, it's more likely that companies will change their ways.

In the meantime, breaking up with fast fashion can help. Minimizing what you consume can also be an effective action to take. After all, there's a reason why ""reduce"" comes first in ""reduce, reuse, recycle.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/just-transitionimage-recE7ao2O1VtzhW73-e1751855183660.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:15:48.843936

“Hybrid automation with agentic AI is a key priority for enterprise decision-makers in the next three years,” said Charlie Dai, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester.

The deal is an indicator of the rapid expansion of the business process services (BPS) market driven by the surging demand for automation powered by agentic AI, said Industry experts and analysts.

“Hybrid automation with agentic AI is a key priority for enterprise decision-makers in the next three years,” said Charlie Dai, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester.

The global business process outsourcing (BPO) market, including BPS, was valued at $300 billion in 2024 according to Grand View Research, which projects the market will surge to $525 billion in 2030, driven by demand for new technologies such as generative AI.

Capgemini has reached a definitive agreement to acquire WNS, and plans to it into its Global Business Services portfolio when the deal closes some time before the end of the year. It expects the deal to help it serve enterprise clients seeking intelligent automation and digital transformation.

Forrester’s Dai said WNS’s domain-specific AI agents and agentic AI platforms, especially the AI.Agentic suite and WNS Expirius, will effectively help Capgemini enhance its agent-driven business process services and offer the same to its existing customers.

For Gartner vice president analyst DD Mishra, WNS’s investments in intelligent automation, analytics, and agentic solutions including its TRAC analytics suite and Malkom knowledge management platform will complement Capgemini’s existing technology and consulting strengths.

Sharath Srinivasamurthy, research vice president at IDC, pointed to the acquisitions WNS has itself made in recent months, including Kipi.ai, Smart Cube, and OptiBuy to enhance its data, analytics, and procurement stack and extend its proficiency in business process operations, said.

However, Rajesh Ranjan, managing partner at Everest Group, views the WNS acquisition as more of a strategic play rather than being focused on garnering more agentic tools or capabilities.

“The key driver behind the acquisition is less to do with the tools or software but rather the access to business process operations expertise that WNS brings to the table, a pre-requisite to develop and deploy real-world AI solutions,” Ranjan said, adding that agentic AI is still in its infancy and are largely locked in pilot stages across enterprises.

However, recent quarters have tested its resilience, with margin pressures, leadership upheavals, and regulatory scrutiny casting a shadow over its stock performance. Despite these challenges, the company's strategic focus on complex patient cohorts, AI-driven efficiency, and vertical integration positions it to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. This analysis argues that UNH's current underperformance is a buying opportunity for investors with a multi-year horizon.

The Near-Term Storm: Margin Pressures and Leadership Transitions

UnitedHealth's Q2 2025 results revealed significant margin compression in its Optum Health division, driven by higher utilization in senior care (orthopedics, cardiology) and behavioral health. While CEO Andrew Witty's exit and a 45% market cap decline since Q1 2025 have spooked investors, these challenges are not existential. The margin squeeze stems from a deliberate strategy to acquire complex patient cohorts—those requiring intensive outpatient care—which carry higher upfront costs but promise long-term value.

The illustrates the divergence: UNH's shares have stagnated, while broader markets rose. This underperformance reflects short-term concerns, not structural flaws. Meanwhile, the shows medical loss ratios remain stable at ~85%, underscoring that cost pressures are concentrated in specific segments rather than systemic.

Strategic Investments: Building for the Future

Complex Patient Cohorts: UnitedHealth's focus on seniors and behavioral health patients aligns with an aging population and rising mental health needs. While these groups initially strain margins, their long-term retention and improved care coordination will boost profitability. As CEO Stephen Hemsley stated, “The challenges we face are largely within our control,” emphasizing the company's ability to refine benefits and pricing.

Vertical Integration: Acquisitions in home health (LHC Group, Amedisys), ambulatory care (SurgeryCenter.com), and behavioral health (Refresh Mental Health) are critical to its integrated care model. These moves reduce reliance on third-party providers, allowing UNH to control costs and improve care continuity—a key differentiator in value-based care.

AI and Operational Efficiency: UnitedHealth's AI initiatives—automating medical appeals, optimizing provider networks, and enhancing fraud detection—are already reducing G&A expenses. The could cut operating expenses by 15–20% over the next two years, offsetting margin pressures.

Leadership Stabilization and Compliance Focus

The departure of Andrew Witty and the return of veteran CEO Stephen Hemsley mark a shift toward operational discipline. Hemsley's track record of turning around UNH during prior crises instills confidence. Additionally, the appointment of Dr. Patrick Conway to lead Optum signals a focus on clinical expertise and compliance. Former Optum CEO Heather Cianfrocco's new role in governance and cybersecurity underscores a commitment to addressing regulatory risks, such as the ongoing DOJ investigation into Medicare Advantage practices.

Risks and Mitigations

Regulatory Scrutiny: Investigations into Medicare fraud and PBM legislation pose risks, but UNH has already begun adjusting its benefit designs and compliance protocols.

Market Competition: Peers like Elevance Health and Centene are outperforming UNH due to its self-inflicted margin issues. However, UNH's scale and diversified revenue streams (insurance, pharmacy, digital health) provide a moat.

Investment Thesis: Buy with a 3–5 Year Horizon

While near-term EPS guidance has been lowered, UnitedHealth's raised 2023 EPS target ($26.50 vs. $26.00) and stable MLR suggest resilience. The stock's current P/E of ~14x (vs. a 5-year average of 18x) reflects pessimism about its ability to navigate challenges. However, the could rebound to 8–10% annually as margin pressures ease and AI savings materialize.

Conclusion: A Leader in Transition

UnitedHealth's current struggles are a test of its strategic vision, not its viability. The investments in complex patient cohorts, AI, and vertical integration are bets on the future of healthcare—where integrated, data-driven care models dominate. For investors willing to overlook short-term volatility, UNH offers a compelling entry point at a valuation discount. Buy the dip.",,N,,2025-07-07 13:15:43.766636

The chain is introducing premium features across these locations, including lounge-style seating, warmer lighting, and locally inspired wall art, in an effort to cultivate a traditional coffeehouse feel and encourage customers to spend more time in stores.

Newsweek has contacted Starbucks outside of regular working hours via email for comment.

Why It Matters

The major changes come after Starbucks took a hit when its baristas went on strike before Christmas, waiting times for orders grew longer, and its Q4 earnings report for the last fiscal year showed a 7 percent decline in global sales.

Since stepping in as CEO in September 2024, Niccol launched the ""Back to Starbucks"" initiative to try to encourage customers to come back to the stores.

When he was appointed as the new leader of the major chain, Starbucks' shares leapt up 18 percent after two consecutive quarters of sale slumps, Fortune reported, suggesting there are lot of expectations weighing on Niccol's shoulders to bring the company's sales back up to speed.

What To Know

The first remodeled locations, including stores in Bridgehampton and East Hampton, New York, now showcase cozy chairs, hardwood floors, and artwork on the walls that capture the spirit of the areas' local communities.

Starbucks has also brought back ceramic mugs for some in-store orders and reintroduced the self-service condiment bar. Baristas were also instructed to be welcoming to customers and leave hand-written notes on cups.

The redesigns are part of a comprehensive strategy to reverse the downward slope in sales by enhancing the customer experience and reestablishing Starbucks as a welcoming ""third place,"" a space of respite over coffee away from home and work—a vision first championed by former CEO Howard Schultz.

Alongside the aesthetic updates, Starbucks has focused on operational changes such as streamlining its food and beverage menu, by reducing some options for customizations, and introducing a new order sequencing algorithm to reduce wait times.

The company said that the measures enabled three-quarters of orders at test locations to arrive in under 4 minutes during peak hours, Fortune reported.

In June, Starbucks also hosted over 14,000 coffeehouse leaders from across North America at its Leadership Experience 2025 in Las Vegas in June, as part of the initiative. At the event, leaders had the chance to engage in workshops, connect and network, and hear directly from company leaders.

What People Are Saying

Starbucks' CEO Brian Niccol said in June: ""'Getting 'Back to Starbucks' means refocusing on what has always set us apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas. We are bringing together our coffeehouse leaders from across North America to celebrate, empower and equip them to accelerate our transformation.

""The coffeehouse experience defines the Starbucks brand, and these leaders and their teams bring that experience to life for millions of customers every day.""

Starbucks' Chief Operating Officer (COO) Mike Grams said in June: ""This isn't just a reset—it's a recommitment to who we are when we are at our best. We're making progress, have real momentum with our 'Back to Starbucks' plan and are on the right track to turn the business around.

""Our turnaround is rooted in listening—to partners and customers—and taking action on what we hear. We're listening and testing in the coffeehouse, and then applying our learnings to scale quickly and enhance the customer and partner experience.""

M&M’s resist change Despite Kennedy’s momentum, candy companies are digging in.","Food giants like Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo pledge to eliminate synthetic dyes by 2027 under Health Secretary RFK Jr.’s voluntary campaign.

But the candy industry, led by M&M’s maker Mars, resists, citing costs, taste challenges, and lack of natural alternatives.

States like Texas and West Virginia plan independent bans and warnings, potentially forcing nationwide change.

Less than three months after declaring war on synthetic food dyes, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has scored significant wins in reshaping America’s food landscape. Major manufacturers—including Kraft Heinz, General Mills, Nestlé, ConAgra, and PepsiCo—have agreed to remove petroleum-based dyes from popular items like Jell-O snacks, Kool-Aid drinks, and Lucky Charms cereals by the end of 2027.

The pledges come amid growing concern over links between synthetic dyes and behavioral issues in children, highlighted by studies like California’s 2021 review concluding that artificial dyes can trigger neurobehavioral problems in some kids.

Yet a vibrant and powerful opponent remains: the candy industry.

M&M’s resist change

Despite Kennedy’s momentum, candy companies are digging in. Mars, the privately held maker of M&M’s and Skittles, insists its products are safe and says sweeping changes would be costly and technically difficult. Mars previously attempted to drop artificial colors in 2016 but reversed course after finding American consumers still craved brightly colored candies—even as European customers shifted toward natural hues.

Some candy makers say that the dyes not only add color, but also taste. Without them, candy can end up tasting like raw vegetables or worse, they say. The National Confectioners Association has signaled that candy companies won’t reformulate without federal mandates.

State laws may force the issue

Kennedy’s voluntary approach has critics, but it’s producing progress where federal regulation might stall. The FDA is moving to revoke certain dye approvals and has cleared new natural colors for use, avoiding lengthy court battles but that's a slow process prone to court intervention.

Meanwhile, states are stepping in. Texas will require warning labels on foods containing dyes starting in 2027, and West Virginia plans broader bans in 2028. Consumer advocates predict that industry holdouts, including candy makers, will eventually bend under state-by-state pressure.",https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/news/mandms-ca-2025.webp,N,,2025-07-07 11:11:54.711460

The latest closure notice impacts the Rite Aid located in the Summit Square shopping center along the Newtown Bypass in Middletown Township.

The new closure adds to a growing list of local Rite Aid shutdowns, including locations on New Falls Road in Bristol Township’s Levittown section, in the Shoppes at Flowers Mill on North Flowers Mill Road in Middletown Township, on Pond Street in Bristol Borough, and on Lincoln Highway in the Fairless Hills section of Falls Township.

Employees have been informing customers of the upcoming closures.

The closings are part of a nationwide wave as the Philadelphia-based company continues to grapple with significant financial challenges.

Rite Aid initially filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and emerged in 2024, but recently announced it is “pursuing a strategic and value-maximizing sale process for substantially all of its assets.”

Retail locations in Bristol Borough and Falls Township closed during the 2023 bankruptcy.

In spring, Rite Aid sold its pharmacy assets to several companies, including CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, Albertsons and Kroger.

Despite its prior restructuring, local Rite Aid stores have reportedly faced issues with bare shelves for the past two years.

A court document filed in New Jersey bankruptcy court indicated that Rite Aid’s post-bankruptcy plan was contingent on vendors returning to less restrictive payment terms and assurances of credit from capital providers, which the company claims did not materialize.

Rite Aid also cited macroeconomic pressures and reduced consumer spending as contributing factors to its financial woes.

Customers are advised that Rite Aid stopped honoring gift cards and accepting returns or exchanges after June 5.

Earlier this year, Rite Aid operated more than 1,000 stores nationwide, with hundreds now slated for closure.

The redesigned stores feature cozy chairs and couches, Starbucks’ signature green tones, hardwood floors, and regionally inspired wall art meant to give each location a more local, personal feel. A Bridgehampton, NY location leans into darker tones and plush seating, while a store in East Hampton nods to the town’s nautical roots.

Starbucks is also bringing back the once-retired condiment bar, offering ceramic mugs for some in-house orders, and instructing baristas to create a warmer, more personalized experience. The idea? Make Starbucks feel less like a fast-coffee chain and more like a true neighborhood hangout.

Operationally, the company is also tightening up. It has trimmed menu options, limited drink customizations, and piloted a new order sequencing algorithm that’s already reduced peak-time wait times to under four minutes at test stores.

Founder Howard Schultz, who stepped away from day-to-day operations, praised the effort, saying the new direction made him so happy he “did a cartwheel.”

The changes come as Starbucks works to regain momentum. Sales dipped slightly below Wall Street expectations in the second quarter, but Niccol isn’t backing down. “We have a lot of work ahead, but we are on the right track and moving quickly,” he said in April.

Starbucks isn’t just updating furniture. It’s trying to rewire how customers think about the brand. Whether ceramic mugs and cushy seating can reignite the café culture that made Starbucks iconic remains to be seen. However, the company clearly believes that comfort is its next competitive edge.",https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE2MTQ1NzA1NTY2MjE3NzQ3/former-starbucks-ceo-schultz-testifies-at-senate-hearing-on-labor-and-unions.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:13:02.185486

The initiative pairs women studying business, engineering, art, and fashion with Dior employees in their same concentrations.

Art Nouveau architect and Paris Métro designer Hector Guimard will get his own museum.

Paris will open a museum dedicated to Art Nouveau architect Hector Guimard—best known for designing the city’s iconic Métro entrances—inside one of his own architectural landmarks, the Hôtel Mezzara. Located in the 16th arrondissement, the 1910 townhouse will undergo restoration under a 50-year lease agreement and is slated to open as the Musée Guimard by late 2027 or early 2028. The initiative, spearheaded by private backers and preservation advocates, comes after years of campaigning to save the building and honor Guimard’s legacy.

Hoping to raise funds, Albright College moves to auction its 500-piece art collection.

To address a $20 million budgetary deficit, Albright College plans to auction more than 500 works from its art collection, including pieces by Jasper Johns and Jacob Lawrence, through Pook & Pook on July 16. The move has drawn criticism from donors, including the family of Doris C. Freedman, who argue the sale undermines the collection’s educational purpose and offers limited financial relief.

Not everyone is happy about Wimbledon shifting from human judges to A.I.-assisted line calls.

British tennis player Jack Draper criticized Wimbledon’s use of A.I.-assisted line calls, saying the system lacked full accuracy, and lamented the removal of human line judges. Tournament director Jamie Baker defended the shift, noting that live electronic line calling is now standard across the tour and has become more sophisticated over time.

Beltone Holding, the Cairo-based financial services group led by Egyptian business executive Dalia Khorshid, has unveiled Robin, a new data science and artificial intelligence subsidiary aimed at accelerating digital transformation across the MENA region.

The wholly owned unit, headquartered in Cairo, is positioned to deliver intelligent, scalable AI solutions tailored to large enterprises, startups, and key sectors across Egypt and the broader Middle East and North Africa. “We’re turning data into decisions and decisions into impact,” said Basma Rady, Chief Data Scientist at Beltone and Managing Director of Robin.

Robin’s offerings include real-time market monitoring tools, intelligent dashboards, predictive analytics, and automated strategic reporting. These tools are designed to enhance operational efficiency, support data-driven decision-making, and unlock measurable business value.

The company’s team blends deep technical expertise with cross-sector insights to build customized AI solutions. Rady emphasized the unit’s human-first approach: “Transformation begins with people. Our strength lies in the diverse minds behind the innovation.”

Beltone’s broader shift beyond investment banking

The launch of Robin is part of Beltone Holding’s strategic expansion under Khorshid, who has rapidly repositioned the company into one of MENA’s most diversified financial services groups. Since her appointment, Beltone has scaled operations across leasing, factoring, asset management, venture capital, and non-banking financial services (NBFIs).

In Q1 2025, Beltone reported operating revenues of EGP2.8 billion ($56.73 million), more than doubling from EGP1.34 billion ($27.15 million) in Q1 2024, a 111 percent year-on-year growth driven by strong performance in its NBFI and investment banking segments. Net profit reached EGP 703 million ($14.24 million).

Capital infusion and impact investment

Beltone recently secured $20 million from impact-focused funds SANAD and the Green for Growth Fund (GGF) to expand access to finance for MSMEs and green energy projects across the region. In addition, the group raised EGP 10.5 billion ($212.7 million) through a highly subscribed capital increase, further fueling its regional expansion strategy.

Both Mixue and Starbucks opened their first stores in China in 1999.
The same process may take much longer for Starbucks’ 7,800 stores in China.
Starbucks China, meanwhile, may be worth several billion dollars, Bloomberg reported in May, citing sources.
As of the end of March the Seattle-based coffeehouse chain was operating 7,758 stores in China.","Fast-food provider Mixue's 2097 success is adding a bitter taste to Starbucks' SBUX attempts to sell a stake in its business in the People's Republic. The Chinese company has grown into the world's biggest food and beverage chain by selling sub-$1 drinks and adapting quickly as domestic consumers spend less. That's hard for the $107 billion premium-brand U.S. coffee icon to compete with.

Both Mixue and Starbucks opened their first stores in China in 1999. For the latter the challenge was to introduce coffee culture to a nation obsessed with tea. This turned out to be a smooth blend. Chinese consumers have become more picky and cost-conscious of late, though, and the Seattle-based heavyweight's market share has dropped to 14% from 34% in 2019, per market data provider Euromonitor.

Starbucks is trying to fight back. It announced its first-ever price cut in China last month, although its offerings are still far more expensive than those from Mixue and other rivals like Luckin Coffee.

But Starbucks cannot compete on pricing alone. Its problems run deeper than that. Amid all the talks about China’s weak consumer demand, some of the best-performing stocks in the past year have been the so-called new consumption plays, which include trendy toy maker Pop Mart International 9992 and handcraft jewellery retailer Laopu Gold 6181. These are brands that resonate deeply with the shifting spending preferences of young Chinese to focus on intangibles such as convenience, experience or personalization.

Mixue’s robust supply chain, for instance, allows it to reduce costs and introduce new beverages – or even new interior designs – to its more than 45,000 outlets within weeks. The same process may take much longer for Starbucks’ 7,800 stores in China. And a similar strategy caused problems at its U.S. stores in the past. Boss Brian Niccol even told shareholders in March that Starbucks can learn from ""several lessons"" in its China supply chain and improve its North American business.

Shareholders have rewarded Mixue's strategy: its market value has soared almost 80% to some $25 billion since its Hong Kong listing in March.

Starbucks China, meanwhile, may be worth several billion dollars, Bloomberg reported in May, citing sources. Its same-store sales have at least levelled off recently, halting the earlier slump. And Niccol has emphasised the need to find ways to grow. That would seem to require having a local partner - and buyer - with a Mixue-style understanding of how to take advantage of China’s new consumer logic.

CONTEXT NEWS

Starbucks has received “a lot of interest” in the sale of a stake in its China business as it explores a partnership with an outside investor to restore growth there, CEO Brian Niccol told the Financial Times in an interview published on June 11. As of the end of March the Seattle-based coffeehouse chain was operating 7,758 stores in China.

Mixue has surpassed Starbucks and McDonald's as the world's largest food and beverage company by store count, with 46,479 in 11 countries by December, according to the bubble tea retailer's listing prospectus.

However, they bounced back and were able to overtake Starbucks as the biggest coffee chain in China in 2023 despite being delisted from NASDAQ just three years prior.
In the case of Luckin Coffee it also does not hurt that their drinks in China are generally around 30% cheaper than Starbucks.","It is almost undeniable that when we think coffee shop chain we think of Starbucks. The Seattle based company has managed to become a phenomenon worldwide and has had little competition thanks to its uniform but still tailored approach to coffee (and social media worthy seasonal drinks) but it seems like their supreme reign may be coming to an end, as many people are looking for something different, and that seems to be coming from China. The company Luckin Coffee is still not as well-known, but two locations in Manhattan and they are changing the scene already.

They still would have a very long way to go, as there is a reason why no other chain has overtaken Starbucks in about 40 years, and it is not the quality of the coffee, although that has helped.

The new Starbucks coming straight from China, will they be able to compete?

Luckin Coffee’s history seems familiar when we compare it to the American empire Starbucks, although about 50 years later. Founded in 2017, the coffee shop opened multiple locations in a few short years and was able to survive not just the pandemic, but an additional accounting scandal in 2020 which should have brought the company to its knees. However, they bounced back and were able to overtake Starbucks as the biggest coffee chain in China in 2023 despite being delisted from NASDAQ just three years prior.

Part of this is, of course, glocalization, which is not something that is taken seriously despite it being a massive driving force in the market nowadays. Starbucks attempts to force the American standard everywhere it goes, and while it has been well received thanks to the expansion of American culture, as people get used to the novelty, they begin to crave other things that are closer to home. Local chains then get the opportunity to apply some of the expansion techniques but with a local flavor and suddenly they are thriving.

In the case of Luckin Coffee it also does not hurt that their drinks in China are generally around 30% cheaper than Starbucks. This is managed by using a mobile-app-based store model, which has allowed them to cut costs while maintaining quality, but the model may not translate as well as they hope into the US market.

There are two strikes working against them in this transition to the US market. The first one is that it seems like they will not be able to offer their products at the same price differential than in China, and the fact hat the products will only be marginally cheaper will likely not help them grow as fast as they expect. The second one is that the app model that they operate with is not exactly something they can do in the States, as in New York, cashless businesses have been prohibited since 2020.

While in China the cashier less experience is one of the features of the company, which can make clients feel less awkward, in the US that will not be an option, and the ambiance is not the same. Even so, the app remains central to the company’s U.S. strategy.

In its two New York locations, users have been offered their first beverage for just $1.99 and the chance to win a year’s worth of free coffee through a raffle. Those who downloaded the app ahead of the opening also gained early access to limited-time deals. The company is also taking advantage of their Social Media savviness and have recently opened a new account specifically for the American market where they will undoubtedly publish new trends and discounts for their potential and current customers to benefit from.",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/luckin-coffee-starbucks-china.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:13:08.227335

The banking industry’s ‘Big Six’ – Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Natwest, Santander and Nationwide – paid the FOS a combined £38.8m in admin fees for the year ending March 31.

Lloyds topped the list at £12.6m, with Barclays second at just short of £9m, official figures seen by City AM show.

This came as the motor finance row, which Lloyds and Barclays have historical exposure to, dragged total complaints to the FOS to the highest levels since the PPI scandal.

Motor finance complaints jumped by near-500 per cent to north of 70,000 which triggered an over 50 per cent spike in the FOS’ total caseload to 305,726.

The Supreme Court is expected to give its verdict on whether it was unlawful for banks to pay a commission to a car dealer without the customer’s informed consent in the summer.

Lloyds leads the pack for deepest provisions at £1.2bn, with Barclays setting aside £90 and Close Brothers £165m

Analysts have warned the sector’s total payout for the scandal could top £30bn.

Santander, which has reserved £295m for car finance payouts, faced a surge in provisions in its first-quarter report in April. The Spanish-based lender recorded a 69 per cent increase to £140m for liabilites and charges.

The bank said £42m was driven by “charges relating to changes to our branch network”. The lender is set to close 95 branches this year.

Santander paid £5.14m in FOS admin fees for the financial year.

FOS faces crackdown

City minister Emma Reynolds has remained open to clipping the wings of the ombudsman after accusations the watchdog had become a quasi-regulator.

Reynolds told an audience of bankers and investors that the end of a review on the FOS could lead to a winding down of powers.

Banking officials have hoped the Chancellor will use the July 15 Mansion House speech to introduce a series of reforms to the sector, particularly around regulation.

The FOS introduced changes to its administrative fees system in April with it beginning to charge professional representatives £250 for each case referred to the FOS beyond the first ten cases per financial year.

The new system will also not charge banks for the first three complaints they receive in the financial year. From the fourth complaint forward a case fee of £650 is applied, but reduced to £475 if the complaint is dismissed, withdrawn, or abandoned, or if it is found to be outside the FOS’ jurisdiction.

Banking industry body UK Finance had previously sounded the alarm on the FOS fees system and said it opened the door to penalising firms “disproportionately, particularly in the context of mass-generated complaints driven by professional representatives”.

The FOS said around half of the complaints in the last year were brought forward by professional representatives, compared to a quarter previously.

The European Commission said EU AI laws would be rolled out on schedule, after tech companies in Europe and abroad had called for delays of years while criticising the rules as onerous.

“Let me be as clear as possible, there is no stop the clock. There is no grace period. There is no pause,” Commission spokesman Thomas Regnier told a press conference.

“We have legal deadlines established in a legal text,” he said, recapping that some provisions began in February, with obligations for general purpose AI models beginning in August and obligations for high-risk models beginning in August 2026.

Simplification

The Commission has said it plans to submit proposals for simplifying the rules, such as reducing reporting obligations for small companies, toward the end of this year.

European companies including chip manufacturing tools maker ASML, aerospace firm Airbus and AI start-up Mistral were amongst 45 organisations who signed a letter last week asking EU president Ursula von der Leyen to postpone rules targeting the most powerful AI models and calling for a more “innovation-friendly” regulatory approach.

The letter called for the EU to show that it is “serious” about simplifying AI rules and boosting competitiveness in the sector.

Other signatories included Mercedes-Benz Group, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Lufthansa, Publicis Groupe, Prosus and Siemens Energy.

They called for delays to rules targeting general-purpose and high-risk AI models.

The EU promised a code of practice for May but code has been delayed, and in the meantime has been criticised by tech companies and the US government.

The AI Act requires developers to provide information about how their models are trained and to have policies in place that comply with copyright law.

PARP inhibitors are already approved to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but J&J is currently in pole position in the bid to advance their use in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), thanks to a positive readout from the AMPLITUDE study reported at this year's ASCO congress.
J&J has rights to niraparib in prostate cancer, and views the drug as a successor to Zytiga, once a $2.5 billion-a-year blockbuster, which has been hit by generic competition and saw sales fall nearly 29% to $631 million last year.
With its new filing, J&J seems to have set aside concerns about activity in non-BRCA patients, submitting Akeega for approval with a broad HRR-positive label claim.
AstraZeneca currently leads the PAP market with MSD-partnered Lynparza (olaparib), but is developing a next-generation PARP1 inhibitor, saruparib, for HRR-mutated mCSPC patients in the phase 3 EvoPAR-PR01 trial.","Johnson & Johnson's fixed-dose combination of a PARP inhibitor and anti-androgen therapy, Akeega, has been filed for a new indication in prostate cancer that could broaden use of the drug into hormone-sensitive disease.

PARP inhibitors are already approved to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but J&J is currently in pole position in the bid to advance their use in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), thanks to a positive readout from the AMPLITUDE study reported at this year's ASCO congress.

Akeega, which combines the active ingredients in GSK's PARP inhibitor Zejula (niraparib) and J&J's androgen blocker Zytiga (abiraterone), has been submitted for approval in the EU, its first regulatory filing for the new indication.

The drug has been approved for mCRPC since 2023, and while sales are not yet being broken out by J&J, it has been tipped by GlobalData to reach annual revenues of around $676 million by the end of the decade – assuming it gets approval as the first PARP inhibitor for mCSPC.

J&J has rights to niraparib in prostate cancer, and views the drug as a successor to Zytiga, once a $2.5 billion-a-year blockbuster, which has been hit by generic competition and saw sales fall nearly 29% to $631 million last year.

AMPLITUDE enrolled mCSPC patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations, and showed that Akeega significantly reduced the risk of tumour progression or death by 37% compared to Zytiga, both given on top of prednisone or prednisolone. There was also a trend to improved overall survival – a 25% gain for BRCA patients and 21% for the overall group – which is being tracked to see if it becomes significant with further follow-up.

When the results were released at ASCO, there was some debate about whether J&J would be able to file for approval on the strength of the study, as there was a disparity in the data between two patient subgroups – those with and without BRCA mutations

The greatest benefit was observed in the BRCA-positive subgroup, with a 48% reduction in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), which decreased to approximately 20% in non-BRCA patients.

At ASCO, AMPLITUDE lead investigator Gerhardt Attard of University College London (UCL) said the non-HRR result showed clear efficacy, but also exposed the highly heterogeneous nature of HRR-positive mCSPC, which also includes mutations in other genes like CHEK2 and PALB2, that can lead to diverse responses to therapies.

With its new filing, J&J seems to have set aside concerns about activity in non-BRCA patients, submitting Akeega for approval with a broad HRR-positive label claim.

Competition from other PARP inhibitors in mCSPC could be on the way, though. AstraZeneca currently leads the PAP market with MSD-partnered Lynparza (olaparib), but is developing a next-generation PARP1 inhibitor, saruparib, for HRR-mutated mCSPC patients in the phase 3 EvoPAR-PR01 trial.

Meanwhile, Pfizer's Talzenna (talazoparib) is in the late-stage TALAPRO-3 study in combination with Xtandi (enzalutamide) as a treatment for patients with DNA damage response-deficient mCSPC.",https://pharmaphorum.com/sites/default/files/2025-07/JandJ_signage_1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 09:09:54.326498

Since around 2010, major blockbusters including Boehringer Ingelheim International’s Flomax, Pfizer’s Lipitor, and Merck’s Cozaar/Hyzaar have all lost market exclusivity.
Although both are forecast to remain in the top 10 selling drugs in 2030, their revenue is expected to decline.
While several blockbuster drugs are set to lose market exclusivity, only a few big pharma companies are positioned to grow revenue sustainably through 2030.
El-Helou adds: “To effectively navigate a patent cliff, companies must deploy a range of strategies to offset losses and strengthen their long-term position.","The pharmaceutical industry is bracing for one of its most financially significant patent cliffs in over a decade, with multiple blockbuster drugs set to lose exclusivity by 2030. As biosimilars and generics flood the market, pricing pressures will intensify—particularly in oncology—challenging pharma companies to rethink revenue strategies, pipeline investments, and lifecycle management to safeguard long-term growth, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.

Since around 2010, major blockbusters including Boehringer Ingelheim International’s Flomax, Pfizer’s Lipitor, and Merck’s Cozaar/Hyzaar have all lost market exclusivity.

According to GlobalData’s latest report, “Blockbuster Drugs on Patent Cliffs,” there is set to be a smaller proportion of global drug sales which will have patent protection in 2030, a sharp drop compared to previous years. As patents expire, the number of biosimilars and generics entering the market will increase, and subsequently originator pharma companies are going to be faced with aggressive pricing competition. As a result, the US market is set to lose over $230 billion between 2025 and 2030.

One of the key therapy areas that will be affected is oncology, with major drugs including Merck’s Keytruda and Johnson & Johnson’s Darzalex/Faspro both losing US exclusivity by 2029. Both drugs were among the top selling drugs in 2024, with Keytruda leading by generating over $29 billion. Although both are forecast to remain in the top 10 selling drugs in 2030, their revenue is expected to decline.

While several blockbuster drugs are set to lose market exclusivity, only a few big pharma companies are positioned to grow revenue sustainably through 2030.

George El-Helou, Strategic Intelligence Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “More than half of the top 15 pharma companies are expected to face challenges in managing the impact of the upcoming patent cliff. However, some companies have pipeline drugs forecast to offset part of these losses.”

Bristol Myers Squibb is among the companies expected to be hit hardest by the upcoming patent cliff, with two major blockbuster drugs, Eliquis and Opdivo, losing exclusivity. These drugs accounted for a significant share of the company’s 2024 revenue, and their patent expirations could significantly weaken its overall financial performance.

El-Helou adds: “To effectively navigate a patent cliff, companies must deploy a range of strategies to offset losses and strengthen their long-term position. These may include acquiring early-stage biotechs developing promising therapies and increasing investment in R&D, targeting diseases with high unmet needs. Additionally, life cycle management and patent thickets can be effective tools to extend market exclusivity and defend against generic competition.”

Strategies to manage loss of exclusivity need to be considered early on in development, with effective portfolio management which plays a critical role.

Hannah Hans, Head of Pharma Strategic Intelligence at GlobalData, comments: “It is critical to plan from both a patent and regulatory perspective, while also embedding lifecycle management strategies early on in development. This integrated approach will help optimize long term value.”

The current patent cliff implications on pharma companies include loss of revenue and pricing pressures, however there are several opportunities for companies to focus on innovative therapies and re-defining their portfolio.

Hans concludes: “This opens up a significant opportunity for biotech companies to partner with pharma on next generation therapies, novel delivery platforms and differentiated formulations as companies look to strengthen their pipeline.”",https://www.pharmalive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cliff-mountain.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 11:11:09.009094

Launching today (7 July) during the UK’s Youth Employment Week, the company is opening applications for its Accelerated Leadership Programme, a fast-track route from entry level to store manager in just 13 months, a journey that would typically take around three years.

This year’s programme will recruit over 20 participants. No previous hospitality or work experience is required; just passion, potential, and a drive to grow. Training for each participant is free, with Starbucks investing £5,000 (£100,000 in total) in their professional development, helping to set them up for success in the early stages of their career.Whilst the programme offers trainees the opportunity to grow and accelerate their career within Starbucks, the skills gained are designed to open doors wherever their journey leads. There’s no requirement to stay with the company for any length of time, nor are any of the costs of training required to be repaid.

Throughout the programme, delivered by Starbucks training partner Corndel, participants will gain hands-on experience in stores and learn about every aspect needed to become a successful, well-rounded hospitality manager, as well as gaining a professional accreditation from the Chartered Management Institute (CMI).Across the 13 months, participants will:

Gain essential hands-on in-store experience

Build core leadership and team management skills

Strengthen their commercial and strategic understanding

Develop their decision-making

Improve their time management skills

Learn how to deliver standout customer experience

Understand how to resolve conflict and deescalate

Have the opportunity to network with existing partners across the UKThey’ll graduate with a Level 3 apprenticeship qualification (equivalent to an A Level), fully equipping them for a role as a Starbucks store manager by the end of the programme.This is the second intake for the newly formed Accelerated Leadership Programme, with 14 partners currently progressing through the scheme after the first round of applications opened earlier this year in April. In total, Starbucks will invest more than £170,000 across the two cohorts.

Alex Rayner, General Manager, Starbucks UK said: “We’re delighted to open further applications for our Accelerated Leadership Programme. Our success starts and ends with our Green Apron Partners and whether you’re just leaving school or exploring a fresh start, Starbucks is a place where you can be yourself, work with great people, craft your path and spread joy every day through the power of coffee.”

Reina, a Green Apron Partner who is currently enrolled in the scheme, said: “When my manager suggested I should apply to the Accelerated Leadership Programme, I was excited to try something new. My favourite lesson so far has been learning about happiness at work – things like managing your time or finding strategies to improve your wellbeing. I didn’t realise that would be something we’d be taught as store managers, but it is important – for ourselves and our team. I don’t know what the future holds for me but now I’ll have the skills to succeed no matter where life takes me.”

The initiative is part of Starbucks UK’s ongoing commitment to provide young people with meaningful career opportunities. It runs alongside a year-round apprenticeship scheme offering 150 new roles across the business, from entry-level baristas to degree-level positions in the support centre.Applications open on 7 July and close on 21 July.

The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Capgemini’s and WNS’s Boards of Directors.

Capgemini said that the transaction will reinforce Capgemini as a business and transformation partner to those enterprises that want to become AI-powered businesses.

The ad has been confirmed as the largest sports graphic ever installed on the JW Marriott, a testament to Clark’s growing influence both on and off the court.

That follows the NCAA March Madness bracket being on their when the tournament was hosted strictly in Indianapolis due to Covid-19 restrictions.

Fans have been buzzing about the ad’s sheer size and bold design, with one commenter likening it to “a giant cereal box.” Another fan shared, “Literal chills every time I walk past.”

The timing of the ad’s unveiling is significant, as the WNBA All-Star Game is set to take place in Indianapolis on July 19.

However, Clark’s participation remains uncertain due to a groin injury that has sidelined her for five games.

President Donald Trump’s springtime pause on his sweeping global tariffs is set to expire Wednesday. He has indicated the July 9 deadline isn’t set in stone, and his treasury secretary said Sunday that higher rates would kick in Aug. 1 if agreements aren’t reached by then. So without a flurry of trade deals with dozens of countries in the coming weeks, the import taxes are set to drive up the prices of numerous overseas goods for businesses and consumers alike.

In the meantime, major retailers are rolling out deep midseason discounts to keep customers spending despite widespread pessimism. Consumer sentiment has improved from its dismal levels months ago but remains sharply lower than this time last year. The promotions could run as much as 40% off during Home Depot’s 4th of July Sale (June 19-July 9), Target’s Circle Week (July 6-12) and Best Buy’s Black Friday in July Sale (July 7-13), and up to 50% off during Amazon Prime Day (July 8-11) and Walmart Deals (July 8-13).

What happens with prices after the summer sales events is anyone’s guess. Retail executives, including at Walmart, and major consumer brands have warned that tariff-fueled price increases are likely as the year wears on and the inventories they’ve built up dwindle. Some analysts are already seeing signs of those hikes picking up, particularly at department stores, CNBC reported last week.

To reduce some of the guesswork for shoppers, NBC News is tracking online price levels for dozens of items at Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Home Depot to determine when and how much they may fluctuate throughout the rest of the year.

Rather than sweep up hundreds or thousands of items across these retailers’ sprawling e-commerce marketplaces, the tracker zeroes in on a basket of 230 items that tend to be purchased less frequently than, say, groceries or household staples. They range from appliances like dishwashers and toasters to jewelry, smartphones and running shoes.

The NBC News Price Tracker is powered by the e-commerce price-tracking platform Bright Data, which is monitoring 27 to 61 items for each of the five retailers.

The Price Tracker can’t identify what causes prices to rise or fall, so it’s impossible to determine whether any changes reflect retailers passing along tariff expenses to shoppers. But the tool can help consumers plan their purchases at a time when goods from certain countries, such as China, or with specific components, like steel or aluminum, are disproportionately subject to steeper levies.

The summer sales period offers something of a starting line, coinciding with broader trade policy changes and representing the last major discounting spree before back-to-school shopping around Labor Day, followed by early-bird holiday sales leading up to Black Friday.

Since Bright Data began tracking prices of 230 items for NBC News on March 2, about 29% of them saw price hikes, with an average increase of nearly 6%. Home Depot and Target saw the most price hikes, affecting 39% and 37%, respectively, of those tracked since March. And over roughly the last month, price increases have been more common than reductions: In all but one week since May 30, twice as many products increased in price than decreased across the four major retailers.

(A Home Depot spokesperson said the company hasn’t taken tariff-related pricing actions and attributed any price swings to routine promotional cycles. Target didn’t comment.)

So far, there are few signs of broad-based pricing changes that clearly correspond to tariff policy moves.

“It’s been hard to draw a line connecting the dots between things that have been said, things that are happening in the world, and certain items that we know are manufactured in those areas,” said Jennifer Burns, Bright Data’s director of public relations and communications.

But a few patterns are emerging in the run-up to this month’s discounting sprees:

Kitchen appliances: It might not be the best time to make major upgrades in the kitchen. Prices on larger appliances like freezers, stoves and ovens are up, particularly at Home Depot, where 39% of the items we tracked increased in price. The highest individual price increase was 53.1% on a freezer and refrigerator unit. At Best Buy, prices took a sharp dive from mid-April to mid-June but have since rebounded to slightly above their springtime levels.

Water bottles: The prices of three popular stainless-steel water bottles — by Hydro Flask, Stanley and Owala — are each ticking up at Amazon and Walmart, potentially a sign that the 25% tariff on global steel is having an impact. (Owala declined to comment; Hydro Flask and Stanley didn’t respond to requests for comment.)

Electronics: Smartphones saw a sharp price spike, increasing by an average of 15% at Best Buy, but other gadgets such as speakers, headphones and accessories like charging docks stayed flat across the five retailers. (A Best Buy spokesperson said the retailer offers high-quality tech at a range of competitive price points that can fluctuate for reasons including sales, seasonality and device upgrade cycles.)

Apparel: Clothing price changes vary by retailer. In May, Walmart warned shoppers could start seeing tariff-driven price hikes within weeks, and apparel is one of several areas where that may be happening. Of the six clothing items NBC News is tracking at Walmart, four saw price hikes — together rising by an average of more than 57% over the past month. Four of the six Walmart toys NBC News tracked got pricier, up 37% during the same period. At Amazon, by contrast, just one of seven toys saw price hikes, and all six apparel purchases held flat. (A Walmart spokesperson said the company aims to “keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can.” An Amazon spokesperson said the retailer offers industry-leading low prices across hundreds of millions of items and pointed to CEO Andy Jassy’s recent remarks on CNBC that the company has “so far not seen prices appreciably go up.”)

Beauty and jewelry: These prices largely haven’t changed, despite 30% tariffs on goods imported from China, where many such products are made.

Economists warn that consumers haven’t felt the full weight of tariffs at checkout just yet.

“I expect the inflation associated with tariffs to be felt later this year,” the National Retail Federation’s chief economist, Jack Kleinhenz, said in a press release last month. “Consumers remain very price sensitive, and those costs are likely to weigh heavily on consumer budgets.”

But fluctuating prices aren’t expected to deter people from chasing summer deals. Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce spending, projects consumers will shell out $23.8 billion online from Tuesday to Friday — up $9.6 billion from last year’s summer sales.

“You have some consumers who just see really strong deals, and that’s enticing enough for them to do that spontaneous purchasing,” said Vivek Pandya, lead digital analyst at Adobe. “You also have consumers who are cognizant of the broader pricing environment globally, and are kind of trying to stockpile goods in anticipation.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250703-Amazon-package-aa-1221-39bb6d.jpg",N,,2025-07-07 13:15:06.122370

Despite challenges encountered along the way, Best Buy's procurement transformation stands as a compelling example of how procurement can evolve from a transactional function into a strategic business enabler.","Best Buy stands as a major player in the consumer electronics retail space, generating over US$40bn in annual revenue. While its core activity and brand recognition are strongest across North America, the company also maintains operations in India and China.

Beyond its traditional retail footprint, Best Buy is actively expanding its business model.

""We are an organisation that's focused on expanding its footprint beyond traditional retail,"" explains Anna Barej, Vice President of Procurement at Best Buy.

""Best Buy is heavily focused on growing our retail media presence like many other retailers in the industry. We’re also focusing on elevating our omnichannel experience and introducing marketplace as a virtual shopping mall for our customers”

These strategic growth initiatives require significant procurement support, positioning the function as a critical enabler of the company's future success. The procurement team at Best Buy is now at the heart of driving the company forward following a successful transformation mission – spearheaded by Anna.

From reactive to strategic: The procurement transformation journey

When Anna joined Best Buy in 2021, she inherited a procurement function that was fundamentally transactional in nature. While the team was competent in executing core sourcing and contracting activities, it lacked the strategic vision and capabilities needed to drive competitive advantage.

""I was recruited to transform the organisation,"" she explains. ""The organisation at that point in time was more of a reactive, transactional team who did really good work servicing the business. What was missing was innovation and insights that enabled our businesses to actually have a competitive advantage.""

Anna’s mandate was clear: transform procurement from a reactive function into a strategic partner through improvements in people, processes and technology. This comprehensive transformation would require significant changes to how the function operated, from redefining its core value proposition to revolutionising its technological infrastructure.

Redefining procurement value

The first and perhaps most critical step in Best Buy's procurement transformation, labelled ‘Propel’, was redefining what value meant for the function.

While cost optimisation remained a core objective with specific targets, the transformation expanded procurement's value proposition significantly.

""The traditional definition of procurement value is cost transformation and cost optimisation,"" Anna shares. ""That, for us, is still one of our goals and we are measured against it, but we're not doing that at the cost of trade-offs.”

“We want to make sure we provide spent optimisation for quality and for benefit to the business, but that’s only a very small sliver of what we do.""

Best Buy's procurement team now delivers value through strategic insights, innovation, technology enablement and building genuine strategic partnerships – rather than managing transactional engagements. This comprehensive value proposition has become the foundation of the function's new identity.

“Value was definitely the first thing we needed to redefine,” Anna emphasises.

Managing change

While technology and processes were critical components of the transformation, Anna found people and change management to be the most challenging aspects of the journey.

The scale of change required was significant and not everyone was prepared to embrace the new direction.

""Change is the hardest part of transformation,"" Anna reflects. ""I've answered this question quite frequently, ‘what was your biggest challenge?’. It was people’s reaction to and embrace of change.""

The transformation initially triggered some major shifts, with some team members who weren't aligned with the new vision opting to depart Best Buy.

While challenging, Anna views this as ultimately beneficial for both the individuals and the function.

She continues: “We had significant turnover during the first two years of the transformation, primarily because many individuals didn't necessarily believe in the future or they weren't comfortable with the approach, so they self-selected themselves out of the organisation.

“Ultimately, I think that was a good thing – for them and for us.""

Successful change management required a dramatically different leadership approach, focused on keeping team members informed and involved in decision-making, as well as providing them with genuine ownership of the transformation journey.

Anna adds: ""The approach to change management required a very different way of working on my part and on my leadership team's part. We focused on ensuring our team played a role in the transformation, leading change versus being expected to only react to it.”.""

Technology as a transformation enabler

Best Buy's procurement transformation has been heavily enabled by technology, with solutions from multiple partners, including SpendHQ, playing crucial roles.

A particularly challenging aspect was consolidating data from dozens of disparate legacy systems into a unified view.

Anna was faced with taking 38 systems which had existed in the legacy environment and folding most of that data into one view - something she has described as being “a tremendous benefit for the whole company""

""SpendHQ has been a great partner for us,"" Anna notes. ""They are providing us with procurement and performance management capability, a tool we use to manage all our initiatives, from intake to forecasting and planning and reporting.""

“SpendHQ sits at the center of everything we do and allows us to manage all our work in one place. It's a great way for category managers and their leaders to track progress, provide forecasts, prioritise work and manage workload.""

The technology transformation has delivered significant benefits, particularly in terms of data visibility and decision-making capabilities. This has elevated procurement's standing within the organisation and enabled more strategic conversations with business leaders.

""The primary benefit that I see is the ability to provide full visibility into data,"" Anna explains.

""Digitising all of our spend and all of our procurement activities is helping us to not just make better decisions and plan more effectively but is truly helping the enterprise understand how they behave.""

Measurable results and strategic impact

Best Buy's procurement transformation has delivered impressive quantifiable results, with Anna helping to double procurement’s financial contributions within the first year of the Propel program.

""What we delivered to the enterprise doubled during the initial couple of years and we're keeping that momentum going,” says Anna. “It's been sustained by the transformation.”

However, the strategic impact extends far beyond financial metrics. The transformation has fundamentally changed how the procurement function is perceived within the organisation, creating deeper partnerships with business stakeholders and enabling procurement to influence strategic decisions.

The cultural shift has opened new opportunities for procurement to contribute.

""Stakeholders begin to reach out differently,” Anna explains. “They begin to ask different questions, which allows us, in turn, to insert ourselves into the most critical moments of opportunity.

""The partnership elevated us to a different level, unlocking opportunities and literally unlocking rooms for us. We began being invited into business strategy sessions and long-term planning sessions – now that is a significant pivot from the reactive role that we once played.""

Expanding beyond traditional procurement boundaries

Perhaps the most significant indicator of procurement's elevated status is that it has been asked to expand beyond its traditional remit.

The function now plays a central role in driving optimisation.

""Our recent success in delivering incremental value and providing new levels of data visibility to the enterprise has resulted in expansion of our role to include facilitation of operating income optimisation efforts for the company,"" Anna reveals.

""Procurement has been asked to integrate commercial and business operational efficiency strategies into one enterprise governance process. This approach enables visibility to all opportunities for allocation decisions in growth priorities.

""Being a lever of insights and information in a very proactive structured way is driving different levels of discussions and enabling us to be at the forefront of growth through reinvestment strategies,"" celebrates Anna.

""I'm very proud that procurement is not only contributing to the bottom line, but ultimately top-line growth as well.""

Key victories and lessons learned

Reflecting on the transformation journey, Anna identifies three significant achievements:

Redefining procurement's value proposition and becoming a genuine strategic partner to the business.

Building an entrepreneurial culture within procurement that encourages innovation and constructive challenge.

Expanding beyond traditional procurement boundaries to directly contribute to Best Buy's growth strategies.

However, given the chance to do it all again, Anna admits she would have paid more attention to change management: ""I would definitely pay more attention upfront to the change aspect and how people react to it.

""I assumed that, if I were to communicate effectively multiple times, it would be enough. But what I've learned over time is that you have to dedicate much more time to the change conversation.

""You need to have different types of conversations with a variety of audiences. Some people require more attention than others. The differences in approach to change really have to be top of mind. I have not seen a standard playbook that works for all. Considering current state organisational culture, level of functional maturity and differences in how individuals process information are critical and require time to execute effectively.""

The evolution continues

While the Propel transformation program is nearing completion, Anna is clear in her belief that the evolution must continue: “The Propel transformation may soon be complete, but the spirit of transformation will not go away. It will change to an ongoing capability evolution. Propel helped us create a culture comfortable with change and challenges.

Her team is now focused on new opportunities, including leveraging AI, expanding their supplier relationship management capabilities and continuing to build on their operating income optimisation role.

""The idea is that we should never lose the transformational mindset. We must always be challenging ourselves to do things differently, more efficiently for better outcomes, focusing on creating competitive advantage for the company"" Anna concludes.

Despite challenges encountered along the way, Best Buy's procurement transformation stands as a compelling example of how procurement can evolve from a transactional function into a strategic business enabler.

Analysts expect health insurers to find it more difficult to keep Americans signed up for Medicaid and ACA plans because the Trump-approved bill requires more eligibility checks and bureaucratic hurdles.
AHIP represents some of the biggest providers of individual coverage including Centene, Oscar Health, Elevance Health, Cigna and an array of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
In Centene’s case, the actuarial firm Wakely found subscribers to ACA plans, also known as Obamacare, were sicker and needed more healthcare services that what the company planned for.
Mizuho’s Hynes is already hinting Centene will “reprice” its 2026 plans and they will be more expensive for buyers.","The problems Centene appears to be having managing the costs of low-income Americans covered by Medicaid and individual plans under the Affordable Care Act could only be the beginning of what’s to come for more health insurers.

Centene last week pulled its financial forecast for the rest of this year after an outside firm’s review of data that showed subscribers in its ACA plans are sicker and need more care than the company anticipated. In addition, Centene is also seeing higher cost trends in its Medicaid business -- coverage for low-income Americans the insurer helps more than two dozen states manage.

In the future, the management of Medicaid patients may get even trickier for health insurers after President Donald Trump last week signed into law legislation that cuts $1 trillion from Medicaid and ACA plans that is expected to eliminate coverage for nearly 12 million Americans over the next decade, data from the Congressional Budget Office shows.

Analysts expect health insurers to find it more difficult to keep Americans signed up for Medicaid and ACA plans because the Trump-approved bill requires more eligibility checks and bureaucratic hurdles. These eligibility checks in the Medicaid program are called “redeterminations” and they are already to blame for millions of Americans falling off of Medicaid coverage following the end of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2023.

“Due to new red tape and barriers to enrollment and re-enrollment, people losing eligibility for Medicaid will find an individual market with less choice and higher premiums,” the trade group and lobby America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) said. AHIP represents some of the biggest providers of individual coverage including Centene, Oscar Health, Elevance Health, Cigna and an array of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.

In the individual market, millions more Americans face the possibility of losing coverage because the legislation written by Republicans in Congress doesn’t extend tax credits signed into law by former President Joe Biden beyond this year. As the bill Trump signed into law takes effect, the reduced spending on these tax credits, or subsidies, means buyers of ACA plans will face higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs.

In Centene’s case, the actuarial firm Wakely found subscribers to ACA plans, also known as Obamacare, were sicker and needed more healthcare services that what the company planned for.

“We believe a key issue could be a structural shift in the cost profile of the (ACA health insurance exchange) population due to Medicaid Redeterminations,” Ann Hynes and colleagues at Mizuho Securities USA wrote in a report last week. “We would not be buyers on weakness and look for increased clarity on Centene's ability to reprice (health insurance exchange plans) for 2026 and increased visibility on the extent of Medicaid (medical loss ratio) pressures.”

Analysts see sicker patients buying health plans while healthier people will go without, leaving the risk pools filled with those needing more services, costing health insurers even more.

But the search will also expand to include external candidates, with the goal of naming her successor by the year’s end. An interim leader will be named if needed.

The time is right to depart, Barclay said.

Inforum has strong leadership and is in a strong financial position with $3.8 million in assets at the end of last year, one of her proudest accomplishments. The assets helped the organization weather the Great Recession of 2008 and the three-year COVID-19 pandemic.

“When I arrived back in ‘01 there was really no cash reserve, and so we've built up over time because of our business model and our work,” she said.

Inforum, a professional development organization for women, has evolved since it was founded in 1962 as the Women's Economic Club.

Under Barclay's leadership, the organization shifted from a 501(c)6 membership nonprofit — the Women’s Economic Club — to a 501(c)3 education and research nonprofit now operating as Inforum.

That enabled it to seek and receive donations and grants from private and corporate foundations to grow its leadership development programs, in-demand networking events and other efforts like the Michigan Women’s Leadership Report, which tracks the representation of women in top roles on the boards and in the C-suite of Michigan’s public companies.

“Our focus has always been on supporting companies in their war for talent. You know, they want to have the very best people working at their companies, and our goal was to make those opportunities accessible to qualified women,” Barclay said. “Forming the 501(c)3 allowed us to raise the revenue to do that.”

Over the past 20 years, Inforum has served more than 12,000 women and men through its leadership development programs.

Inforum reported $2.18 million in total revenue and an operating loss of just over $93,000 on its 2024 990 form filed with the Internal Revenue Service, with slightly less revenue year over year and an increase in compensation costs.

(MOH) today announced preliminary financial results for the second quarter of 2025 and updated its full year 2025 adjusted earnings per share guidance. The Company’s announcement of preliminary results was driven by recent market dynamics and off-cycle disclosures from others in the managed health care sector.

The Company now expects its second quarter 2025 adjusted earnings to be approximately $5.50 per share(1), which is modestly below its prior expectations. This preliminary result reflects medical cost pressures in all three lines of business. The Company expects these medical cost pressures to continue into the second half of the year. As a result, the Company now expects its full year 2025 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $21.50 to $22.50 per share(1), reflecting a consolidated pre-tax margin of just under 4%, the low-end of its long-term guidance range.

“The short-term earnings pressure we are experiencing results from what we believe to be a temporary dislocation between premium rates and medical cost trend which has recently accelerated,” said Joseph Zubretsky, President and Chief Executive Officer. “As we are still performing near our long-term target ranges, nothing, including the potential impacts of the budget bill, has changed our outlook for the long-term performance of the business.”

As previously announced, the Company expects to report its full second quarter results after the market closes on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, and will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the earnings release on Thursday, July 24, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

The fashion retailer told The Mail on Sunday that it is testing the technology in one store in Edinburgh and two in London.

“We're testing this new technology in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with proper staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers,” an H&M spokesperson told This is Money over the weekend.

The move comes as retailers across the UK explore a range of security measures to tackling rising retail crime.

In May, Currys has announced its largest ever investment in in-store security with the rollout of headsets at stores nationwide.

The move follows a successful trial of the VoCoVo developed technology in 20 stores.

The headsets aim to help staff stay better connected and therefore safer on the shop floor amidst the rise in shoplifting and abuse incidents across the retail industry.

In February, Tesco unveiled a new multimillion-pound security hub in Daventry, Northamptonshire, as part of a major investment to tackle the growing problem of retail crime across its UK stores.

The high-tech centre, which operates 24 hours a day throughout the year, analyses thousands of hours of CCTV footage to target shoplifters and protect staff from violence.

Security operators have been assigned responsibility for monitoring specific groups of stores across the UK.

bp has also rolled out a crime intelligence platform across its 300 company-owned stores and has provided staff with body cameras at 70 locations.

The Auror platform allows the company to gather and share relevant information on retail crime with local police and other retailers.

H&M's trial comes after figures from the British Retail Consortium published in March revealed that nearly a quarter of the UK population have witnessed shoplifting taking place while at a shop in the last 12 months.

The organisation also found that around 23 per cent of customers have seen the physical or verbal abuse of staff including racial or sexual abuse, physical assault or threats with weapons.

In January, the BRC’s annual crime survey also found that retail crime is at the highest level on record with losses reaching £2.2 billion.

It also showed that there were over 2,000 incidents of violence and abuse over 2023-2024, more than triple the levels recorded in 2020.

Separately, shopworkers’ union Usdaw, has produced its own research which shows 77 per cent of retail staff experience abuse, with 53 per cent on the receiving end of threats and 10 per cent experiencing assault.",https://www.retail-systems.com/rs/images/H&M Logo.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 10:02:08.438159

In a statement, the pharmacy benefit manager pointed to drug pricing as a central challenge for insurers.
Although Zepbound is being excluded, CVS stated it is continuing to expand access to other weight-loss drugs considered more cost-effective under current insurance models.
Under the deal, CVS became the first retail pharmacy in Novo Nordisk’s pharmacy network, and Wegovy is now available at reduced pricing across 9,000 CVS locations.
Medicare, Medicaid, and many employer-sponsored plans continue to exclude coverage of these drugs due to pricing concerns.","CVS Caremark has removed coverage of Zepbound, a GLP-1 weight-loss drug, citing pricing concerns and shifting payer dynamics that are reshaping how weight-loss treatments are covered under insurance plans, according to a report from AM Best.

In a statement, the pharmacy benefit manager pointed to drug pricing as a central challenge for insurers. “The egregiously high list prices set by drug manufacturers of GLP-1s for weight loss are the single biggest barrier to patient access,” a CVS spokesperson said. “Many payers, including Medicare and numerous state benefit plans, have declined to cover GLP-1s for weight loss because of the unsustainably high prices set by brand pharma.”

CVS said its updated formulary approach is designed to maintain coverage for treatments it deems clinically appropriate, while also using market competition to manage costs. Although Zepbound is being excluded, CVS stated it is continuing to expand access to other weight-loss drugs considered more cost-effective under current insurance models.

The company declined to say whether its new arrangement with Novo Nordisk, maker of Wegovy, influenced the Zepbound decision, according to the report.

Under the deal, CVS became the first retail pharmacy in Novo Nordisk’s pharmacy network, and Wegovy is now available at reduced pricing across 9,000 CVS locations. The agreement could offer a pathway for insurers and plan sponsors to control spending while still offering GLP-1 coverage.

The shift comes as insurers and benefit managers reassess how high-cost, high-demand weight-loss drugs fit into long-term coverage strategies. Medicare, Medicaid, and many employer-sponsored plans continue to exclude coverage of these drugs due to pricing concerns.

CVS Health also announced plans to exit the Affordable Care Act individual exchange business, citing ongoing financial underperformance and limited potential for future profitability in that segment.

As of the first quarter of 2025, CVS Health reported net income of $1.78 billion, up from $1.12 billion a year earlier.

According to research by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), shoplifting rose 20% last year, with violent and abusive incidents against staff reaching 2,000 per day.

The H&M Group joins retailers such as Go Outdoors, Matalan and Tesco in testing bodycams.

An H&M spokesperson told Drapers: “We’re testing this new technology in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers.”

The news from H&M follows home secretary Yvette Cooper’s announcement of a summer blitz retail crime last week.

Speaking on the Today programme on 4 July, Cooper said extra neighbourhood patrols would be supported by more than £60m funding for hotspot policing.

That would be linked up “with stronger enforcement against shop theft, against street theft [and] stronger prevention work”.

Cooper said that shop theft and street theft hits at the heart of communities and would be a priority now for policing across the country. “It’s been treated as low level, whereas when it happens in the heart of your community, if it keeps shoppers away, if it makes shop staff feel unsafe, if it means traders just think, I’m not going to operate here anymore, that hits at the very heart of communities.”

Helen Dickinson, CEO, BRC, said at the time of the announcement: “With the huge rise in retail theft and the continued impact of violence and abuse on retail colleagues, we welcome the announcement of increased police patrols and local action to tackle town centre crime and anti-social behaviour.

The new Trader Joe’s location is about 40% bigger than its neighbor, also according the report.
Others wished Trader Joe’s would stake a claim in another neighborhood; Trader Joe’s does have plans to open five new stores in California before the end of this year.
Putting consumers first paid off: Trader Joe’s saw the sixth-largest reputation boost (+3.5) this year, moving it to the number-one spot.","Walk down the street in almost any city, and you’ll see the ubiquitous green mermaid logo staring back at you.

In some cities, you'll find her on sidewalks, strip malls, office plazas, and even highway exit ramps, as predictably as street signs.

There are now multiple Starbucks locations within a mile of each other in many U.S. cities. In places like New York, California, and the Pacific Northwest, it seems like there’s one on every corner, probably because there are.

This saturation strategy once fueled explosive growth: by 2017, around 62% of U.S. stores had at least one Starbucks (SBUX) rival right next door, often competing not with Dunkin’ or local cafés, but with themselves.

Some critics have argued for years that this internal competition cannibalized sales, but the omnipresence has been a convenience to countless caffeine seekers. Need a morning latte or an afternoon pick-me-up? Just walk 100 yards.

Starbucks’ growth strategy has always been about presence and dominance. It ensures it’s the most convenient choice, beating local cafés and other chains through sheer availability. It’s kind of a game of real estate chess. Each new store captures more foot traffic and prevents competitors from setting up shop.

Now, Trader Joe’s looks to be experimenting with the same model.

New Trader Joe’s store is across the street from an old one

In a surprising twist on the saturation playbook, Trader Joe’s recently opened a second store in Sherman Oaks, right across the street from the neighborhood’s first location, which opened in 1973.

Dubbed “Sherman Oaks too,” the new branch brings modern upgrades that will make any Trader Joe’s shopper jump for joy: convenient and ample underground parking.

The store also has high ceilings and wider aisles than most other locations, giving it a more modern look.

Rather than retire the older store, Trader Joe’s elected to keep both open, emphasizing customer convenience and store differentiation. The veteran location offers a cozy, nostalgic shopping experience that appeals to long-time fans, while the new site caters to those needing more space and wanting easier parking.

The goal is to bring delicious products at great value to more people, a Trader Joe’s spokesperson told the Los Angeles times.

The new Trader Joe’s location is about 40% bigger than its neighbor, also according the report.

Some customers said that the better parking situation means they will never return to the other location with its “cramped” parking.

Others wished Trader Joe’s would stake a claim in another neighborhood; Trader Joe’s does have plans to open five new stores in California before the end of this year.

Another 16 stores will open in other states before the end of 2025.

Trader Joe's is the most popular grocer in the U.S.

Trader Joe’s may be known for the best snacks and the worst parking, but it also has an enviable reputation among consumers.

With a reputational quotient (RQ) score of 82.1, the beloved grocery chain ​​recently claimed the top spot in the 2025 Axios Harris Corporate Reputation Poll of 100 companies.

Outdoor brand Patagonia came in a close second with an 82.0, followed by big names like Microsoft, Toyota, Costco, and Samsung.

The poll gathered insights from over 16,000 Americans, who rated companies across key categories like trust, ethics, culture, and overall customer experience.

Putting consumers first paid off: Trader Joe’s saw the sixth-largest reputation boost (+3.5) this year, moving it to the number-one spot. Consumers clearly appreciate a brand that’s got their back when prices are rising.

Here is the list of all the top 10 brands named in the Axios poll:

Trader Joe’s

Patagonia

Microsoft

Toyota Motor Corp.

Costco

Samsung

Arizona Beverage Company

Nvidia

UPS

Apple

Immediate unlocking of value

This transaction will position Capgemini as a leader in Digital BPS blending horizontal and vertical process expertise, with a global footprint. With combined revenues of €1.9 billion in 2024 in Digital BPS, this will strengthen Capgemini’s ability to accompany clients on their business and technology transformation journeys.

The mix of WNS and Capgemini’s complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities. It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity.

Intelligent Operations – Agentic AI creates a paradigm shift that opens a strategic opportunity

The largest opportunity for global organizations to create value with Gen AI and Agentic AI lies in the fundamental redesign of their operations and business processes. It will attract a significant share of their AI investments as they seek to become AI-powered companies to lead their market. This is creating demand for a new type of business process services: Intelligent Operations.

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI. It addresses clients’ goal of efficiency, speed and agility through process hyper-automation, while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI and digital.

AI technologies trigger a paradigm shift in delivering business process services: from labor-intensive services to being consulting-led and tech-driven. In parallel, client focus has shifted from efficiency gains toward end-to-end value creation and business outcomes, opening opportunities to add non-linear revenues (i.e. transaction-based, subscription-based or outcome-based models). This is creating a rapidly growing market opportunity.

Combining the capabilities and scale required to lead in Intelligent Operations

Both Capgemini and WNS are already pioneering Intelligent Operations. Capgemini with its consulting-led end-to-end transformation of processes, advanced AI tools and technology stacks, and BPS platforms, while WNS has developed a set of sector-specific AI-led solutions recently augmented by the acquisition of Kipi.ai7 to strengthen its data, analytics and AI capabilities.

The combination of Capgemini and WNS will act as a catalyst to lead in Intelligent Operations providing the required scale and unique set of capabilities from Strategy & Transformation consulting, to horizontal and sector expertise, platform offerings to deep AI and technology capabilities.

This combination will also leverage the significant investments made by Capgemini in AI through training, offers and its 25 strategic partnerships, including Microsoft, Google, AWS, Mistral AI and NVIDIA. The Group’s leadership is recognized by its clients, with over €900 million of Gen AI bookings in 2024, and by market analysts such as Forrester, IDC and ISG.

This transaction will reinforce Capgemini as a business and transformation partner to those enterprises who want to become AI-powered businesses.

Value creation

Based on calendar year 2024 published information, the combined entities would have generated a revenue of €23.3 billion at a 13.6% operating margin6 in 2024.

The Group expects accretion to normalized EPS, before synergies from the combination, of 4% in 2026.

Capgemini expects revenue synergies run-rate of €100 million to €140 million by the end of 2027. Costs and operating model synergies are anticipated to reach an annual pretax run-rate of between €50 million and €70 million by the end of 2027.

With the benefits of these synergies, the accretion on normalized earnings per share should reach 7% in 2027.

Smooth integration

WNS and Capgemini have a natural cultural fit and share common values that will facilitate a smooth integration of the teams, helped by the Group’s track record of successful integrations. Furthermore, the integration will be straightforward into Capgemini’s Global Business Services activities.

Key transaction terms and timeline

The contemplated transaction will be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under the laws of Jersey. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Capgemini’s and WNS’ Boards of Directors.

This isn't just a tuck-in acquisition—it's a calculated play to accelerate Wabtec's transition into a leader of rail digitization, with immediate EPS accretion and long-term growth potential.
The Strategic Imperative: Building a Digital Railroad Empire Wabtec's move to acquire Frauscher reflects its focus on vertical integration in the rail industry.
Investment Thesis: A Play on Digitization and Global Infrastructure Spend For investors, the acquisition underscores Wabtec's ability to execute on its “strategic M&A” mantra.
However, Wabtec's track record with past acquisitions—like the 2020 Wilco acquisition, which boosted its aftermarket parts business—gives investors reason to be optimistic.","Wabtec Corporation (WAB) has made its boldest move yet in the rail technology space with its $675 million acquisition of Frauscher Sensor Technology Group, announced July 2, 2025. The deal positions Wabtec to capitalize on surging demand for advanced signaling and sensor systems while bolstering its foothold in critical markets like Europe and India. This isn't just a tuck-in acquisition—it's a calculated play to accelerate Wabtec's transition into a leader of rail digitization, with immediate EPS accretion and long-term growth potential.

The Strategic Imperative: Building a Digital Railroad Empire

Wabtec's move to acquire Frauscher reflects its focus on vertical integration in the rail industry. Frauscher's core technologies—train detection systems, axle counters, and wayside control solutions—are foundational to modern rail safety and efficiency. These systems are critical for managing track occupancy, preventing collisions, and enabling autonomous train operations. By integrating Frauscher's expertise into its Digital Intelligence segment, Wabtec can now offer a more complete suite of solutions to rail operators, from predictive maintenance (via its Evident acquisition) to real-time track monitoring.

The geographic expansion is equally compelling. Frauscher's strong presence in Europe, where it supplies systems to national rail networks, and India, where rail modernization is a government priority, aligns perfectly with Wabtec's push into high-growth markets. CEO Rafael Santana noted the deal's role in “strengthening our portfolio and market opportunities,” a clear signal that Wabtec aims to become the go-to partner for rail operators worldwide.

The Financial Case: Immediate Gains and Sustainable Leverage

The acquisition's terms highlight Wabtec's confidence in the deal's value creation. At an enterprise value of €675 million (roughly $700 million), the purchase price represents 12.4x Frauscher's 2025 EBITDA. That's a reasonable multiple for a company expected to grow faster than Wabtec's average revenue trajectory. Frauscher is projected to generate €145 million in revenue this year, with growth outpacing Wabtec's broader business.

Crucially, Wabtec expects the deal to be accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full year of ownership, a rare feat in an era of pricey acquisitions. The accretion is likely driven by synergies: Wabtec aims to capture €25 million in cost savings over three years through operational integration. With Wabtec's balance sheet still robust—its leverage ratio remains below 2.5x EBITDA—the deal won't strain its financial flexibility.

Investment Thesis: A Play on Digitization and Global Infrastructure Spend

For investors, the acquisition underscores Wabtec's ability to execute on its “strategic M&A” mantra. Over the past five years, Wabtec has completed nine acquisitions, including the $1.78 billion purchase of Evident in early 2025. This track record suggests management knows how to identify undervalued assets and integrate them profitably.

The rail sector is also a beneficiary of secular tailwinds. Governments worldwide are pouring capital into rail modernization—Europe's Green Deal earmarks €2.6 trillion for sustainable transport through 2030, while India's $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan includes major rail upgrades. Frauscher's technologies are directly tied to these projects, positioning Wabtec to win a larger share of this spending.

Risks and Considerations

Regulatory approvals could delay closing, though Wabtec's history suggests it navigates such hurdles smoothly. The bigger risk is execution: integrating Frauscher's 600+ employees and ensuring its growth trajectory isn't disrupted. However, Wabtec's track record with past acquisitions—like the 2020 Wilco acquisition, which boosted its aftermarket parts business—gives investors reason to be optimistic.

Verdict: Wabtec's Move Makes It a Buy for the Long Run

Wabtec's stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in recent quarters, trading at 15x forward EPS—a discount to its 5-year average of 17x. This acquisition could reaccelerate growth and justify a valuation rebound. For investors, WAB is a compelling play on two themes: the digitization of rail infrastructure and the global push for sustainable transportation. With accretion starting in year one and strong long-term growth catalysts, this stock is worth a closer look.",,N,,2025-07-07 11:10:48.685929

The closing of the transaction is expected to occur by the end of the year.

Capgemini said it will acquire WNS for a cash consideration of USD 76.50 per WNS share, which represents a premium of 17 per cent to the last closing share price on July 3, 2025.

""Enterprises are rapidly adopting Generative AI and Agentic AI to transform their operations end-to-end. Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI.

Ezzat said WNS brings to the Group its ""high growth, margin accretive"" digital business process services and it will further increase their exposure to the US market. ""Immediate cross-selling opportunities will be unlocked through the integration of our complementary offerings and clients. I am looking forward to welcoming the WNS global team to Capgemini.""

Commenting on the acquisition, Keshav R. Murugesh, Chief Executive Officer of WNS, said, ""By combining our deep domain and process expertise with Capgemini's global reach, cutting-edge Gen AI and Agentic AI capabilities, a robust partner ecosystem, and advanced technology platforms, we are creating a powerful proposition that accelerates enterprise reinvention. WNS' complementary portfolio of horizontal and industry-specific solutions will significantly enhance Capgemini's rapidly growing Business Services footprint, enabling next-generation, data-driven operations across sectors.""

WNS's digital-led transformation solutions are used by clients across eight industries. WNS serves a large portfolio of blue-chip clients, such as United Airlines, Aviva, M&T Bank, Centrica, and McCain Foods.

Global organizations are in constant need of strategic partners to support their transformation to enhance efficiency and accelerate growth. This continues to be a key driver of the Digital BPS market and WNS targets revenue growth of 7-11 per cent for FY26.

This acquisition is expected to position Capgemini as a leader in Digital BPS blending horizontal and vertical process expertise, with a global footprint.

""The mix of WNS and Capgemini's complementary offerings and clients will immediately unlock cross-selling opportunities. It will also lay down the foundations to build the capabilities to seize the Intelligent Operations strategic market opportunity,"" the company said in a statement.

The largest opportunity for global organizations to create value with Gen AI and Agentic AI lies in the fundamental redesign of their operations and business processes. It will attract a significant share of their AI investments as they seek to become AI-powered companies to lead their market. This is creating demand for a new type of business process services: Intelligent Operations.

Intelligent Operations answers these business needs, providing a consulting-led approach to transform and operate horizontal and vertical business processes leveraging Gen AI and Agentic AI. It addresses clients' goal of efficiency, speed and agility through process hyper-automation, while significantly improving business outcomes by combining data, AI and digital.

AI technologies trigger a paradigm shift in delivering business process services: from labour-intensive services to being consulting-led and tech-driven. In parallel, client focus has shifted from efficiency gains toward end-to-end value creation and business outcomes, opening opportunities to add non-linear revenues (i.e. transaction-based, subscription-based or outcome-based models). This is creating a rapidly growing market opportunity.

Both Capgemini and WNS already play in Intelligent Operations.

The popular fashion store is the latest retailer to give its UK staff body cameras to help stop shoplifting and protect workers from attacks.

The Swedish clothing giant revealed it had been testing the new technology, according to the Mail on Sunday.

The high street brand follows big names like Tesco, the Co-op, and Lidl, all of which have introduced bodycams for their staff.

These major retailers said they were forced to take action because the police had failed to respond.

Shoplifting rose by 20 per cent from last year, with violent and abusive incidents reported around 2,000 times daily.

Criminals - often in organised gangs - have been stealing goods in full view of staff and shoppers, knowing they’re unlikely to face any consequences.

High street retailers urge their staff not to intervene, fearing they could be attacked.

Workers have faced racial and sexual insults, physical threats, spitting, and in some cases, physical violence.

H&M will trial the new bodycams in stores in Edinburgh, Wood Green, and Beckton in London.

A spokesman for the firm said: ""We're testing this new technology in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with proper staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers.""

The cameras will be worn on staff uniforms and will record distressing incidents to provide police with video evidence.

Superdrug have also issued police-style bodycams and headsets to staff amid soaring levels of violence by shoplifting thugs.

Abuse and attacks on shop workers rocketed 50 per cent from 870 to 1,300 incidents-a-day last year, according to a leading trade body.

Stores are resorting to desperate measures after the British Retail Consortium blasted “woefully inadequate” government action to tackle theHigh Street “crisis”.

The consortium’s survey also revealed shoplifting has more than doubled to 16.7 million incidents in the past year, up from eight million.

They added: ""The cost of theft has soared to almost £1 billion a year.""

By Aditya Kalra and Arpan Chaturvedi

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The Indian unit of U.S. air conditioning giant Carrier has become the latest major firm to sue Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over electronic waste rules that have hiked the fees manufacturers must pay to recyclers.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics as well as Japan's Daikin and Tata's Voltas have also brought suits, which are set to be heard by the High Court of Delhi on Tuesday. All of the companies are seeking to have the rules quashed.

India is the third-biggest generator of electronic waste behind China and the U.S., but the government says only 43% of the country's e-waste last year was recycled.

Modi's government in September fixed a floor price that electronics makers must pay recyclers, which manufacturers argue is roughly three to four times higher than what they paid earlier.

In a 380-page court filing dated June 3, which has not been disclosed publicly, Carrier said recyclers were willing to continue their work at the older prices and the government should not interfere in private dealings between companies and recyclers.

""The burden of the benefit being given to the recyclers has been put on the producers, which is unfair and arbitrary,"" said submissions by Carrier Airconditioning & Refrigeration which were reviewed by Reuters.

The submissions added that the rules will impose a ""huge financial burden"" on the company.

Carrier did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

India's Ministry of Environment also did not respond to Reuters queries. It has previously argued in court that the pricing rules are needed to ensure proper waste disposal and were a ""reasonable"" intervention.

The new rules mandate a minimum payment of 22 rupees per kilogram to recycle consumer electronics. Such rates are still lower than levels in the U.S where they are up to five times higher, according to research firm Redseer.

Carrier reported sales of $248 million in India last year, its highest level since at least the financial year ending March 2020. Its filing said it installed India's first-ever air conditioning system in Jaipur city in 1936.

, increasing numbers of small-business owners rate their firms as successful and reported growth in the past year. Their responses dovetail with data gathered by the $676 billion-asset company's network of small-business bankers.

Though entrepreneurs are concerned about access to capital and the impact of tariffs, ""we continue to see very positive and optimistic outcomes from small-business owners in terms of how their businesses are growing and how they're investing in the day-to-day,"" Shruti Patel, U.S. Bank's chief product officer for business banking, told American Banker.

With more than 36 million small businesses operating around the country, according to the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, the sector is huge. Its well-being has a direct impact on banks' health — especially that of community banks, which do the lion's share of lending to small businesses.

Small businesses have faced so many challenges over the past five years — a pandemic, inflation, labor and supply chain disruptions — that they've developed ""a certain amount of numbness"" to macro factors, according to Richard Cabrera, head of corporate and small-business banking at the $52 billion-asset Umpqua Bank, a subsidiary of Tacoma, Washington-based Columbia Banking System. That has enabled them to concentrate on positioning their companies for growth.

""They can focus on their business. They can focus on investment,"" Cabrera told American Banker. ""They realize the elements that they have within their control and grasp, and that gives them a more positive outlook.""

U.S. Bancorp saw Small Business Administration lending activity spike during the agency's 2024 fiscal year. The trend carried over into fiscal 2025, which began on Oct. 1, 2024. Applications for SBA 7(a) loans, which totaled 2,674 through Wednesday, are well on their way to surpassing the 3,119 U.S. Bancorp received throughout fiscal 2024. The bank's numbers reflect the program-wide growth that SBA's flagship loan guarantee program is experiencing.

""We've seen really strong, robust activity around the SBA 7(a) program,"" Patel said. ""We're actually not seeing any softness, despite the macroeconomic stressors.""

Startup activity, too, ""is still very strong,"" Patel said. Indeed, Census Bureau statistics show that so-called ""high propensity"" applications for a license to operate a small business are trending up in 2025. Licensing applications are categorized as ""high propensity"" if they are deemed likely to result in the formation of a business with a payroll.

""What I will say is that [the total of U.S. small businesses] is growing faster than the pre-COVID level,"" Patel said. ""Small-business entrepreneurship is still very top-of-mind.""

About 70% of the small businesses that U.S. Bancorp contacted in its Small Business Perspective report said now is a good time to start a small business.

Umpqua released its annual Small Business Barometer in June. Similar to U.S. Bancorp's findings, Umpqua showed small businesses' outlook improving despite significant concern surrounding inflation, a possible recession and tariffs. Forty-four percent of the small businesses Umpqua queried expect the economy to improve in the next 12 months. That's a four-year high.

""I think it was a little bit of a surprise,"" Cabrera said, referring to the uptick in optimism.

About half of the small and middle-market businesses that participated in Umpqua's survey expect revenue as well as demand for products and services to increase. Meanwhile, 50% of the small businesses surveyed reported that they anticipate investing to adopt or expand their use of generative artificial intelligence tools over the next 12 months.

Those numbers point to stability more than ""frothy growth,"" according to Cabrera. The Business Barometer ""is really a gauge of sentiment,"" he said. ""It's an emotional feel that business owners have that somehow affects their behavior. … That means we think things are okay, steady, and steady's not bad.""

The U.S. Bancorp and Umpqua surveys were made public around the same time that the National Federation of Independent Business released its Small Business Optimism Index for May, showing a three-point increase to 98.8. The top score is 120. May marked the first time this year the index increased.

The announcement of the transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, heralds one of the largest mergers within the IT and Business Process services market for many years. The acquisition is described by the parties as a strategic move aimed at establishing a leader in Intelligent Operations, which will be positioned strongly to address the anticipated growth in enterprise demand for Agentic AI-driven process transformation.

The deal, which will be funded from available cash of c.€1bn supplemented by debt issuance, is expected to be immediately accretive to the purchaser’s top and bottom lines. For the calendar year 2024, Capgemini and WNS generated revenues of €22.1bn and €1.2bn and delivered operating margins of 13.3% and 18.5% respectively.

The impact of the buy on Capgemini’s presence in the BPS market will be far more significant, increasing the company’s annual sales in a segment in which it has been comparatively underweight by more than 170%. The boost to Capgemini UK will be even more dramatic, lifting its non-engineering related annual business process services revenues almost fivefold to over £320m. The merger will also create substantial cross-selling opportunities. WNS has built a large blue chip client base which includes Aviva, Centrica, McCain and United Airlines

Widespread rumours of the potential deal have been circulating for the last three months (see here) and on paper the marriage makes a great deal of sense for both organisations. Our latest Market Trends and Forecasts report (see here), anticipates that the growth in BPS demand will remain subdued for the foreseeable future. Enterprises will increasingly channel their energies and investmnets into fundamentally re-imagining process delivery through the deployment of Agentic AI-assisted solutions capable of tackling complex, industry specific challenges. The bringing together of Capgemini’s formidable IT transformation capabilities and WNS’s substantial horizontal and vertical business process expertise establishes a strong foundation from which to capitalise on this market shift.

Both companies have also been making fast progress in building out their AI propositions. We have identified Capgemini as one of the Leading Pack of service suppliers on The Road to AI and WNS has been quick to turn its attention to the potential of AI/Gen AI, with both a range of use cases rolled out to date and through the development of a number of domain focused solutions (see here). Whether the new whole can be made to be more than the sum of its parts remains to be seen. The success of the merger will not, however, be limited by a lack of interest in what it is aspiring to offer.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The Indian unit of U.S. air conditioning giant Carrier has become the latest major firm to sue Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over electronic waste rules that have hiked the fees manufacturers must pay to recyclers.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics as well as Japan's Daikin and Tata's Voltas have also brought suits, which are set to be heard by the High Court of Delhi on Tuesday. All of the companies are seeking to have the rules quashed.

India is the third-biggest generator of electronic waste behind China and the U.S., but the government says only 43% of the country's e-waste last year was recycled.

Modi's government in September fixed a floor price that electronics makers must pay recyclers, which manufacturers argue is roughly three to four times higher than what they paid earlier.

In a 380-page court filing dated June 3, which has not been disclosed publicly, Carrier said recyclers were willing to continue their work at the older prices and the government should not interfere in private dealings between companies and recyclers.

""The burden of the benefit being given to the recyclers has been put on the producers, which is unfair and arbitrary,"" said submissions by Carrier Airconditioning & Refrigeration which were reviewed by Reuters.

The submissions added that the rules will impose a ""huge financial burden"" on the company.

Carrier did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

India's Ministry of Environment also did not respond to Reuters queries. It has previously argued in court that the pricing rules are needed to ensure proper waste disposal and were a ""reasonable"" intervention.

The new rules mandate a minimum payment of 22 rupees per kilogram to recycle consumer electronics. Such rates are still lower than levels in the U.S where they are up to five times higher, according to research firm Redseer.

Carrier reported sales of $248 million in India last year, its highest level since at least the financial year ending March 2020. Its filing said it installed India's first-ever air conditioning system in Jaipur city in 1936.

“Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI,” he said.
WNS will be integrated into Capgemini’s Global Business Services division, with leadership teams expected to collaborate on creating future-ready solutions across industries.","French technology giant Capgemini said on Monday that it will acquire India-born business process transformation leader WNS for $3.3 billion in an all-cash deal, in one of the most significant cross-border acquisitions in the tech-enabled services space this year. The transaction, unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, is expected to close by the end of 2025.

This acquisition marks a strategic leap for Capgemini, which aims to position itself as a global leader in Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations—a fast-evolving frontier in enterprise transformation. By integrating WNS’ strong domain expertise and digital-first business process services (BPS) portfolio with its own AI and consulting capabilities, Capgemini is betting on the next phase of enterprise reinvention.

The $3.3 billion deal—valuing WNS shares at $76.50 apiece, a 28% premium over its 90-day average—signals Capgemini’s aggressive move to capture the rising global demand for intelligent, AI-powered business operations. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive, contributing 4% to Capgemini’s normalised earnings per share in 2026, and 7% post-synergies by 2027.

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat noted that “Agentic AI” is ushering in a paradigm shift in how enterprises operate. “Business Process Services will be the showcase for Agentic AI,” he said. “Together, Capgemini and WNS will form a powerhouse uniquely positioned to deliver AI-driven process transformation at scale—combining consulting, platforms, technology, and deep vertical expertise.”

The deal reflects a broader trend: businesses are transitioning from mere automation to intelligent, autonomous operations driven by generative and agentic AI. With enterprise AI investments projected to surge, demand is rising for strategic partners who can integrate data, AI, and digital to deliver end-to-end transformation.

WNS’ portfolio—spanning industries such as travel, insurance, banking, energy, and retail—is a strategic asset in this new reality. With long-term contracts, recurring revenues, and blue-chip clients such as United Airlines, Aviva, and M&T Bank, WNS brings scale and resilience to Capgemini’s offerings.

“This is a pivotal chapter in our journey,” said WNS CEO Keshav R. Murugesh. “We’re entering a phase where operating models must be reimagined with AI at their core. Our domain-centric solutions, combined with Capgemini’s Gen AI prowess and global reach, create a compelling proposition for enterprises worldwide.”

WNS has grown revenues at 9% CAGR over the past three years, reporting $1.27 billion in FY2025 with an operating margin of 18.7%. Its non-linear pricing models and digital-led strategy have made it a standout in the global BPS sector. The combined entity’s Digital BPS revenues in 2024 would have exceeded €1.9 billion, with further revenue synergies projected to be between €100 million and €140 million by 2027.

Capgemini will finance the deal with a €4 billion bridge loan, planning to refinance part of it with internal cash and the rest via debt issuance. Significantly, the acquisition will expand Capgemini’s presence in the US market—WNS’ largest revenue base—while aligning seamlessly with its AI-led growth narrative.

Both companies emphasise their shared values and complementary cultures, projecting a smooth integration. WNS will be integrated into Capgemini’s Global Business Services division, with leadership teams expected to collaborate on creating future-ready solutions across industries.

The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, including clearance from the Royal Court of Jersey. If approved, it will reshape the competitive landscape of digital BPS and intelligent operations, with Capgemini emerging as a formidable AI-powered transformation partner.",https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india%2F2025-07-07%2Fqg8xqf4p%2Fhandshake-blue-line.webp?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-07-07 07:02:38.874176

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The Indian unit of U.S. air conditioning giant Carrier has become the latest major firm to sue Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over electronic waste rules that have hiked the fees manufacturers must pay to recyclers.

The state-of-the-art facility is poised to quadruple Liberia’s iron ore output and stands as one of the largest mining investments in West Africa’s recent history.

ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel producer, has officially opened a cutting-edge iron ore concentrator at the Tokadeh mine in northern Liberia, marking a defining moment in the country’s post-war economic transformation.

The inauguration event, held in Nimba County and attended by Liberia’s President Joseph Nyuma Boakai alongside ArcelorMittal’s Executive Chairman Lakshmi N. Mittal, showcased one of Africa’s largest iron ore beneficiation plants.

This new concentrator – the first of its kind in West Africa – is the centrepiece of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II Expansion Project, a US$1.8 billion investment that brings the company’s total investment in Liberia to about US$3.5 billion. It is one of the most significant private-sector investments in Liberia since the civil war, cementing ArcelorMittal’s role as the nation’s biggest foreign investor.

President Boakai hailed the project as a “turning point” for Liberia’s industrial future, calling it a symbol of the country’s resilience and a vote of confidence in its stability.

The new concentrator is engineered to transform Liberia’s abundant but lower-grade iron ore into a high-grade product, adding substantial value before export.

Using advanced beneficiation technology, the plant upgrades raw hematite ore (~35% iron content) into premium 66% Fe magnetite concentrate.

This higher-grade concentrate commands a better price on global markets and is in growing demand for efficient, lower-emission steelmaking processes like Direct Reduced Iron (DRI).

By processing the ore on African soil, Liberia will ship a higher-value product rather than just raw ore, aligning with broader African goals of industrialisation and value addition.

“The iron ore that leaves Liberia should not just be raw material—we must add value, create jobs, and build an industrial base for our future,” President Boakai said at the ceremony.

This emphasis on local beneficiation echoes the African Union’s vision for mineral-led industrialisation, demonstrating how African countries like Liberia (and by extension Ghana and others) can leverage natural resources to spark homegrown industrial development instead of exporting commodities in their lowest form.

ArcelorMittal’s Executive Chairman Lakshmi Mittal noted that the concentrator will significantly improve product quality and “guarantees the long-term future of mining in Liberia,” securing the country’s position as a key supplier of high-grade iron ore.

ArcelorMittal’s expansion has been just as much about building Liberia’s infrastructure as boosting output. Alongside the concentrator, the company has invested heavily in modernising critical transport and energy facilities.

The 243-kilometre railway linking the Tokadeh mines to the coastal port of Buchanan has been completely overhauled, with hundreds of thousands of new sleepers laid, track geometry improved, and new passing loops added to handle long, heavy trains.

These upgrades mean Liberia’s mining corridor now meets international operational and environmental standards, paving the way for multi-user access and regional integration.

ArcelorMittal has publicly endorsed an open access policy for the railway, working with the Liberian government on a practical operational framework to allow other mining companies to utilise the rail and port under fair agreements.

This sets the stage for Liberia to serve as a regional minerals hub: iron ore deposits from neighbouring Guinea and Sierra Leone could potentially be transported via Liberia’s infrastructure in the future, strengthening West African economic integration.

“These projects are essential to deepening Liberia’s integration into global value chains and unlocking long-term benefits for our people,” President Boakai noted, underscoring how improved infrastructure will connect Liberia and West Africa more deeply to international trade networks.

The scale of ArcelorMittal’s Phase II expansion has delivered an immediate boon in employment and training opportunities for Liberians.

During the construction of the concentrator and associated infrastructure, over 5,000 jobs were created on-site, the majority filled by Liberian workers.

Now that the plant is operational, it is expected to generate roughly 1,000 permanent new jobs in mining, processing, rail operations, and port logistics.

“This brings great relief to our economy, noting that it is impacting the area of job creation,” President Boakai said, highlighting the tangible impact on families and communities.

ArcelorMittal Liberia currently employs about 2,000 Liberians full-time and, through this expansion, has supported over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs over its two decades in the country.

In addition to job creation, a strong emphasis has been placed on skill development to ensure Liberians are at the helm of the industry.

The company’s Training Academy in Yekepa has been expanded and modernised, offering a fully funded multi-year technical training program for youth.

Dozens of young Liberian engineers and technicians are being trained in disciplines such as mechanical maintenance, electrical systems, heavy equipment operations, and ore processing, gaining the expertise needed to operate the sophisticated new concentrator and related facilities.

“I saw young men and women being trained to run this complex facility. They are the true face of Liberia’s tomorrow,” President Boakai remarked, referring to the new cadre of skilled workers emerging from these programmes.

This transfer of knowledge and skills is expected to have a long-term multiplier effect, empowering a new generation of Liberian professionals to lead not only in mining but also to apply their expertise in other sectors.

The expansion has also invigorated local businesses: Liberian contractors were engaged for civil works, trucking, camp services and more, meaning thousands of indirect jobs and a stimulus to local enterprises in Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa counties.

As Liberia’s largest taxpayer, ArcelorMittal Liberia’s enlarged operations will contribute increased tax revenues and royalties to the government, enabling greater public investment in development projects across the country.

ArcelorMittal Liberia’s current mining infrastructure has been built with future expansion in mind: the upgraded rail and port can handle up to 30 million tonnes of ore annually, leaving room for a further increase beyond the initial 20 Mt target.

In fact, company officials disclosed ambitions for a phased ramp-up to 30 Mt per year and possibly building a pelletizing plant down the line.

Such expansions would not only boost output but could also enable more in-country processing (like making direct-reduced iron pellets), which would be a game-changer for West Africa’s role in the global steel supply chain.

The project’s social sustainability is also underlined by ArcelorMittal’s community development commitments.

The company contributes about $3 million annually to a community development fund, which has financed schools, clinics, water systems, and livelihood programs in local communities.

President Boakai emphasised the importance of this partnership approach, stating that large investments must “enrich the corporate social responsibility envelope” so that communities feel the benefits “not just in employment, but in schools, clinics, and markets”.

He urged ArcelorMittal to continue its support for education, healthcare, and small businesses in Liberia, reinforcing that sustainable development should be a mutually beneficial endeavour for both the investor and the nation.

The successful commissioning of this world-class concentrator in Liberia carries broader implications for Africa’s development trajectory.

It demonstrates that with a stable investment climate and forward-looking policies, African countries can attract and absorb multibillion-dollar investments in heavy industry.

“We would not have invested this scale of capital of nearly $3 billion if we didn’t believe in Liberia and its people,” ArcelorMittal’s Lakshmi Mittal commented, stressing the company’s long-term confidence in the country.

Such an endorsement from a global industry leader sends a positive signal to international markets about West Africa’s potential as an investment destination.

For African governments, the Liberia project highlights the importance of creating a conducive environment for investors while also negotiating agreements that ensure local benefits.

The expansion’s regional integration angle also resonates with continental initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which aims to bolster cross-border infrastructure and industrial supply chains.

By developing a mining and transport corridor that could eventually service multiple countries, Liberia is helping lay the groundwork for West African economic corridors that could link mines, power plants, ports, and cities across borders.

The project’s focus on value addition and skills transfer aligns with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development.

It offers a case study of other resource-rich nations, such as Guinea, Sierra Leone, or Ghana, on how investing in local processing facilities and infrastructure can amplify the economic impact of natural resources.

For investors and companies, ArcelorMittal Liberia’s venture underscores the opportunities in Africa’s drive toward industrialisation: building mines and plants not only to extract resources but to refine and export higher-value products and ultimately, finished products.

It also shows that strong ESG practices and community engagement can go hand-in-hand with profitability, thereby de-risking large projects.

In sum, the newly inaugurated Tokadeh concentrator stands as a landmark of African industrial progress, a shining example of resilience, ambition, and partnership. Liberia has emerged from the shadows of conflict and crisis to reclaim its place on the global mining map, this time with a focus on sustainable growth and shared prosperity.

The nation is now poised to export not just raw materials, but innovation, skills, and a narrative of success.

As the first high-grade iron ore shipments from the concentrator set sail later this year, a powerful message reverberates across the continent: Africa is open for business and ready to lead in transforming its natural wealth into lasting development.",https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-10.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 06:02:17.676783

French tech giant Capgemini on Monday announced its acquisition of business process services (BPS) provider WNS for $3.3 billion in cash, a strategic move aimed at creating a global leader in AI-powered business operations. As per the news agency AFP, the deal, unanimously approved by both companies’ boards, values WNS at $76.50 per share, a 28 per cent premium over its 90-day average trading price. With this acquisition, Capgemini aims to tap into the fast-evolving demand for agentic AI, or autonomous AI agents, which can independently perform tasks and make decisions in business environments. “Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS will provide the group with the scale and vertical sector expertise to capture that rapidly emerging strategic opportunity created by the paradigm shift from traditional BPS to agentic AI-powered intelligent operations,” said Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat, as cited by AFP. WNS, headquartered in London with a second base in India and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, began in the late 1990s by offering services to British Airways. Today, it caters to clients across various sectors, helping them transition from conventional outsourcing to tech-driven operational models. The company is widely recognised as a key player in the BPS sector, which has evolved from simple back-office outsourcing to complex AI-integrated process management. “Organisations that have already digitised are now seeking to reimagine their operating models by embedding AI at the core, shifting from automation to autonomy,” WNS CEO Keshav Murugesh said, as per AFP. Capgemini, which provides IT consulting and digital transformation services, said the acquisition would open up strong cross-selling opportunities and is expected to immediately enhance its financial performance. The deal is projected to boost earnings per share by 4 per cent in 2026 and by 7 per cent in 2027 once synergies are realised. To fund the acquisition and assume WNS’s existing debt, Capgemini has secured €4 billion ($4.7 billion) in bridge financing, it said in a joint statement with WNS. The transaction reflects a broader industry shift as companies move from AI-assisted automation to building AI-led autonomous operations.

Barclays is keen on using technology, strategic links, and green campaigns as a growth tool, owing to a market capitalization of about 34 billion pounds and a stable market in retail and investment banking. Based in London, the bank is operating in a difficult economic environment and establishing itself as a leading bank in financial innovations. This 800-word article examines recent developments of Barclays as well as its market performance and the events leading the path of group within the UK and beyond.

Performance and Economic Conditions in the Market

Financial Performance Stock and Health

On July 7, 2025, Barclays shares are selling near 2.20p a share, which is a YTD improvement of nearly 8 percent amid a wider FTSE 100 decline caused by China’s all-time lows in trade statistics. The strength of the bank is premised on the fact that it has diverse revenue lines and its investment banking and the consumer banking arms are strong. In Q1 2025, Barclays recorded a pre-tax profit of 2.2 billion and this was because of the existence of good lending as well as more people in need of digital banking services. Analysts are also positive with targets available at the level of £2.50 at the close of 2025 due to the strategic initiatives of the bank and the UK’s positive economic environment.

Investor Sentiment and Market Position

Barclays has shown how it does it by being proactive in resolving macroeconomic issues affecting it such as inflation along with possible changes in interest rates to boost confidence amongst its investors. Cost consciousness and operational efficiency in the bank has enabled it to keep gaining competitive advantages according to the pressure on smaller banks in the UK. X postings indicate how Barclays is increasingly being recognized as a compliance risk leader, retail investors describe its digital banking solutions, and institutional investors cite its high balance sheet. Nevertheless, what still exists as a possible threat are the global economic uncertainties that are especially seen in the markets dominated by trade.

The current president of Barclays, Jes Staley, is betting hard on innovative transformation across several aspects, including a hefty investment in its mobile application and artificial intelligence-powered financial services. The Barclays app, which was launched not long ago, has the new features of personal financial planning, real-time analytics of expenses, and the ability to interact with third-party payment systems. This upgrade has led to a 15 percent increase in active mobile banking users every year, with more than 10 million customers currently using the application. User experience has made the bank a leader in the competitive UK retail banking industry, competing with disrupting fintech companies such as Revolut and Monzo.

Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Community Initiatives

Barclays is a leading bank that has identified the rising impact of cryptocurrencies and decided to accommodate blockchain technology in its business operations. Early in July 2025, the bank partnered with one of the foremost blockchain corporations, saying that it would test a cloud custody service on digital assets for institutional customers. This recent step corresponds to the gradual entry of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, with, as particular examples, the popularity of crypto-themed ETFs in the UK and U.S. markets. Though Barclays has not yet had any direct cryptocurrency trading with retail customers, the fact that the bank is investigating tokenization and stablecoin capabilities points to an innovative thought leadership in the changing financial landscape.

Partnerships Strategy and Sustainability

Partnership with Fintech Dominators

Strategic alliances are one of the growth strategies of Barclays. The bank has further consolidated its partnership with world leaders in technology to improve its cloud-based system to improve the speed of transaction processing and security. Moreover, the Eagle Labs program developed by Barclays supports UK fintech startups by offering funding and taking part in the mentoring of at least 200 early-stage firms in 2025. The partnerships do not only create innovative solutions but they make Barclays a center of the growing scope of London fintech and allow it to attract talent and capital to the city.

ESG Goals Commitment

Barclays is also underway in the green, social, and governance (ESG) efforts, which go in line with the UK’s drive towards sustainable finance. In 2019, the bank committed to spending 100 billion pounds on green financing by 2030, with a target of renewable energy projects and sustainable infrastructure. Another approach that has found favor with environmentally-minded consumers is seen in July 2025, when Barclays launched a mortgage product, the green mortgage, where only energy-efficient properties are placed on preferential terms, which found a fair response amongst the customers. In conjunction with the bank striving to attain net-zero carbon in all its activities by the year 2035, this initiative creates the notion that the bank is a socially responsible institution.

Problems and Threats

Nevertheless, Barclays has threats that might affect its growth despite its good performance. Regular urbanite watchdog in the UK, especially the anti-money laundering and data protection, is a bother. Investment banking: The investment banking division of the bank is also prone to fluctuations in the global market and this may hinder their profitability where the geopolitical restrictions or trade disturbances aggravate. Moreover, there is already competition among digital-only banks and fintech startups that are taking over the market share of retail banking as offered by Barclays. These risks however are averted by the strong capital reserves and the focus on technology as a strategy by the bank.

Analyst Forecasts and Prospects

Barclays has bullish analyst sentiment with a consensus forecast indicating the share price will range between 2.40 pounds ($ 0.80) and 2.60 pounds ($ 0.84) by Q4 2025. The bank is well positioned to grow as it is already in the process of digitalizing itself, and it has good fundamentals, as well as ESG commitments. X postings indicate that rate reductions, which are expected to be made by the Bank of England, would be beneficial to Barclays since it would encourage lending and boost consumer consumption. The bullish RSI level and backing of an upper support area of 2.00 in the technical picture also make the argument for achieving a closer-term breakout.

Conclusion

In the UK, Barclays is a leader in financial innovation, as it uses digital transformation, strategic alliances, and sustainability efforts to facilitate growth. The fact that it invests in fintech, blockchain, and green finance demonstrates its flexibility in an industry that is changing fast. Since these same challenges as those experienced by Barclays like regulatory uncertainties and business fluctuations seem to be in existence, the diversified business model together with the vision to look ahead still places it as a leader in the financial market of UK. The bank is well placed to become the pioneer in bringing the new era of banking, as the institution keeps on innovating and expanding.",https://www.abcmoney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Leonardo_Lightning_XL_This_dynamic_digital_artwork_showcases_B_0-min.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 09:09:20.452403

She stressed the need for coordinated efforts among the BCEAO, national governments, and private sector players to build regional resilience against growing digital threats.
Ghislaine Samaké: It would be an overstatement to say that all infrastructures are fully equipped to handle the threats, but progress is undeniable.
Several banks, especially regional groups like Ecobank, have invested heavily in securing their core banking systems, data redundancy, and data center certification.
Essentially, cybersecurity isn't just an add-on; it's fully embedded in our core digital strategy.","Sixty-five percent of banks in sub-Saharan Africa view cyber risks as a major hurdle to digitalization, according to the European Investment Bank. In response, several financial institutions across the region are bolstering their digital defenses. Ghislaine Samaké, Managing Director of Ecobank Guinea-Bissau, offered insight into her group’s cybersecurity strategy during the 2025 Cyber Africa Forum in Cotonou. She stressed the need for coordinated efforts among the BCEAO, national governments, and private sector players to build regional resilience against growing digital threats.

Ecofin Agency: With digital stability becoming a regional priority for West Africa's banking sector, do you believe the current infrastructure is equipped to handle growing cyber threats, and how would you assess its resilience?

Ghislaine Samaké: It would be an overstatement to say that all infrastructures are fully equipped to handle the threats, but progress is undeniable. Several banks, especially regional groups like Ecobank, have invested heavily in securing their core banking systems, data redundancy, and data center certification. However, resilience isn't solely dependent on technical equipment. It also hinges on regional coordination and the ability to respond quickly in the event of an incident.

And on that front, there's still plenty of room for improvement. Things like collaborative penetration testing, sub-regional alert centers, and joint audits should become more systematic.

EA: Given the accelerating digitalization of financial services, including at Ecobank, what categories of cyber risks are now at play, and what approaches has your institution adopted to mitigate them?

GS: Digitalization significantly increases potential entry points for attacks, covering mobile, APIs, cloud services, and agent networks. Each channel exposes our ecosystem to specific threats, ranging from phishing and transactional fraud to DDoS attacks and API injections.

At Ecobank, our strategy follows a multilayered approach. This includes end-to-end encryption, real-time behavioral monitoring, two-factor authentication, robust internal privilege management, and regular stress tests. Essentially, cybersecurity isn't just an add-on; it's fully embedded in our core digital strategy.

EA: Since human error often remains a weak link in cybersecurity, what training, awareness programs, or tools do you offer clients to help secure their online banking activities?

GS: We are fully aware that the human factor remains the main vulnerability. That's why we have developed multiple levels of awareness initiatives. For our employees, we conduct regular training sessions on best practices, phishing, and social engineering, which include internal simulation tests. As for clients, our prevention strategy involves alert campaigns, in-app warning messages, and educational micro-content shared across social media and in our local branches. The ultimate goal is to democratize cyber awareness, making it accessible even for first-time users.

EA: How is Ecobank integrating AI or biometric innovations into its cybersecurity systems?

GS: Ecobank is actively exploring innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) and biometrics to bolster its cybersecurity. Across several of our group entities, AI is already at work, improving transaction anomaly detection and refining risk scoring. Biometrics are also integrated into our authentication processes, particularly through mobile apps, utilizing fingerprint and facial recognition, along with one-time passwords (OTPs). This approach allows us to strengthen access security without complicating the user experience. Our ongoing challenge is to ensure top-tier safety while maintaining inclusivity for all users.

EA: What role do you see the BCEAO and West African governments playing in supporting banks against cyber risks?

GS: The BCEAO has played a structuring role by establishing an initial, coherent framework for financial innovation and cybersecurity. This includes licensing fintechs, regulating digital services, and promoting stronger IT supervision, all of which deserve recognition.

The next challenge is to deepen sub-regional harmonization through shared incident response protocols, interconnected alert platforms, and joint best-practice guidelines between banks and regulators. On the government side, strengthening cyber legislation, improving judicial coordination, and implementing cyber training programs for critical operators are essential.

Ultimately, cybersecurity is as much a public policy issue as a banking concern. It's a collective undertaking, engaging financial institutions, regulators, and public authorities alike.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/86c80ba7d4ca4b8e0f7e1507a2a2918e_S.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 04:59:56.354029

With consumers increasingly craving authenticity and relatability, Lucky gives Luckin a way to connect that feels local, even when scaling globally.
Chinese brands are entering global markets with increasingly sophisticated, culturally rich strategies.","As Starbucks navigates declining sales and store closures in its home market, an unexpected challenger started making its move into North America. Luckin Coffee, once best known for its rapid rise (and scandalous fall) in China, is now expanding abroad, with its first locations outside of Asia recently opening in New York. But unlike Starbucks, Luckin isn’t selling a lifestyle rooted in Seattle coffeehouse culture. Instead, it’s exporting the game plan that it honed and refined in the China market.

And it’s not alone. From the runaway success of collectibles like Labubu to the global influence of brands like Mixue, HeyTea, and even White Rabbit, China is no longer just a manufacturing base for global culture … it’s becoming a source of it. China’s expanding brands are showing a shift in cultural influence, driven by storytelling, aesthetics, and emotional resonance that may work just as well in Los Angeles or London as they do in Chengdu.

The Art of the Collab

Luckin has earned a reputation in China as the undisputed king of brand collaborations. From shock-value crossovers with Moutai liquor to delicate tie-ins with hit dramas like Chang’an’s Lychee, Luckin has built a playbook based on timely, culturally relevant partnerships.

Each collab isn’t just about riding a trend, but a much broader strategy:

Reach new audiences across interest tribes

Build emotional resonance via storytelling

Turn limited-time products into viral phenomena

The results speak for themselves: the company’s monthly active customers reached 71.8 million in 2024, up 48.5% from 2023. As much as the drinks have driven traffic, so too have the cultural cachet and merch: collectible badges, character stickers, “mystery blind boxes,” and now, the wildly popular bag charms (including the viral “Lucky Pony” in the Lychee collab).

But like many Chinese consumer brands, Luckin knew that relying solely on borrowed equity had limits. Which is why it’s taken the next step: creating its own IP.

Meet “Lucky”: A Mascot with Meaning

In early 2024, Luckin formally introduced “Lucky,” a reimagined version of its blue deer logo, elevated from a back-end chatbot to a full-blown brand ambassador, complete with costumes, keychains, and its own social media presence.

Lucky is more than a cartoon. It reflects a localised evolution of the mascot trend seen in Asia, where characters like Mixue’s Snow King or Bilibili’s “22 & 33” aren’t just cute figures, but vehicles for brand storytelling, emotional engagement, and even product endorsements.

What sets Lucky apart is its personality: not polished and aspirational like Starbucks’ tone, rather it’s clumsy, loveable, and a bit chaotic. It shows up in employee uniforms, gets in the way during store shoots, and refers to itself tongue-in-cheek as a “Chief Luck Officer.” It’s disarming, funny, and - crucially - memorable.

With consumers increasingly craving authenticity and relatability, Lucky gives Luckin a way to connect that feels local, even when scaling globally.

When the Small Touches Say It All

Luckin doesn’t just do big gestures. In fact, one of its strengths is the care it gives to tiny details.

A recent campaign for Chang’an’s Lychee saw not just product tie-ins and merch, but also a poetic, beautifully written cup sleeve, evoking Tang Dynasty history, imperial couriers, and the fleeting sweetness of fresh lychee. The result? Viral praise, reposts, and even customers ordering the drink just to collect the sleeve.

This attention to micro-storytelling through copy, packaging, and design, turns every order into a shareable experience. It evokes as much as it informs. As ads are becoming less effective and less trusted, word-of-mouth endorsements matter more than ever.

Brewing Something Bigger

As Luckin plants its flag in North America, don’t expect a cookie-cut rollout of what works in China. Nevertheless, we may see some similarities such as:

A digitally-centric approach to the customer journey and heavy use of data in decision-making

Collectible Lucky mascots tailored to local pop culture

Seasonal collabs with regional artists or streaming hits

Beautifully designed cups, sleeves, and snacks that invite storytelling, not just consumption

More importantly, expect a Chinese brand using its playbook from home to win hearts abroad. That matters not just for competitors in the coffee space, but for global marketers everywhere.

Why it Matters

For years, the standard playbook for foreign brands entering China was simple: localise, partner, adapt. But now, we’re seeing the reverse. Chinese brands are entering global markets with increasingly sophisticated, culturally rich strategies.

In many ways, Chinese brands are hungrier and appreciate that they need to work harder than foreign brands did when they entered on the back foot, because they are coming from a less-aspirational base. That makes them even more worth watching out for.

To compete in this new global consumer landscape, brands in the West will need to understand how China’s best brands think, tell stories, and build connections. There’s a good chance they will be your hungriest, and potentially best-resourced competitors.

And if a blue deer in a barista apron starts trending in your local mall or high street, now you’ll know why.

Conclusion Crédit Agricole's full ownership of CACEIS is a masterstroke in a consolidating market.","The acquisition of Banco Santander's 30.5% stake in CACEIS by Crédit Agricole S.A. in July 2025 marks a pivotal moment in European banking's consolidation trajectory. This move, which grants Crédit Agricole full control of its asset servicing subsidiary, underscores a broader shift toward vertical integration and market leadership in a sector grappling with digitization, regulatory complexity, and margin pressures. Below, we dissect the deal's implications for sector consolidation, Crédit Agricole's retail banking competitiveness, and valuation opportunities in French/Spanish financials.

Strategic Implications: Consolidation as a Growth Engine

The acquisition positions Crédit Agricole to capitalize on a consolidating European asset servicing market, projected to grow at 5-7% annually through 2030. CACEIS's assets under custody surged to €5.47 trillion by Q1 2025, a 9% year-on-year increase, fueled by mandates from institutional clients like Syz Asset Management and Vesper Infrastructure Fund. By acquiring full ownership, Crédit Agricole eliminates governance friction and accelerates integration with its institutional banking divisions, such as wealth management and corporate services.

The strategic rationale is clear: vertical control over CACEIS's AI-driven platforms (e.g., Nephelai) and digital asset servicing capabilities (including its Luxembourg-based hub with MiCA authorization) allows the bank to scale innovation faster. This aligns with sector trends: 64% of financial institutions now partner with fintechs, while 52% prioritize digital experience upgrades. Crédit Agricole's move is a preemptive strike to dominate fee-based revenue streams in an era where cross-border institutional services and ESG mandates are surging.

While the deal temporarily reduced Crédit Agricole's fully-loaded CET1 ratio by 30 basis points to 12.1%, its phased-in CET1 ratio under CRR3 regulations remains robust at 17.6%. This regulatory tailwind, coupled with Q1 2025 net income of €1.82 billion, mitigates near-term capital concerns.

Retail Banking: Cross-Selling Synergies and Customer Growth

The acquisition's impact on retail banking is subtler but strategically significant. Crédit Agricole's French retail division added 433,000 new customers in Q1 2025, while international retail (Italy/Poland) grew by 117,000. Deposit growth in France and Italy rose 1.3% year-on-year, supported by cross-selling opportunities with CACEIS. For instance:

- AI-Driven Solutions: CACEIS's technology stack, now fully integrated, can enhance digital banking tools for retail clients (e.g., personalized investment insights).

- Cross-Sector Mandates: CACEIS's role in managing pension funds (e.g., Lincolnshire County Council) creates upsell avenues for Crédit Agricole's corporate and retail clients.

However, risks persist. Retail banking revenues in France grew only 1% in Q1 2025, while international retail declined 3% due to forex headwinds in Egypt. Crédit Agricole must balance institutional growth with retail profitability, especially as peers like BNP Paribas and Société Générale face margin pressures in traditional lending.

Valuation: Undervalued French Financials vs. Spanish Peers

Crédit Agricole trades at 0.8x book value—below its five-year average of 0.95x—despite a 5% dividend yield and 45% payout ratio. This discount contrasts with Spanish banks like Banco de Sabadell, which offers an 8.1% dividend yield but faces higher operational risks (e.g., regional economic exposure). Key valuation takeaways:

Upside Potential: Crédit Agricole's 9.7x P/E multiple (inferred from €15.88 stock price and €2.03 EPS) suggests undervaluation relative to its 15% revenue growth in asset servicing (€2.06 billion in Q1 2025).

Risk-Adjusted Attractiveness: Its beta of 0.73 implies lower volatility than the market. The GF Value of €14.52 versus a current price of €15.88 hints at modest downside protection.

Dividend Dynamics: While the dividend yield has dipped from an 8.5% five-year average, the payout ratio remains sustainable at 45%, offering income stability in a low-yield environment.

Investment Considerations: Buy with a Long-Term Lens

Crédit Agricole's acquisition of CACEIS is a strategic win for its institutional ambitions but carries execution risks. Investors should weigh:

- Bull Case: Full synergies materialize (€70M+ cost savings by 2027), driving EPS accretion and a valuation rerating to 1.0x book value.

- Bear Case: Economic slowdowns reduce institutional client activity, and CET1 pressures persist.

Recommendation:

- Buy: For investors seeking exposure to European asset servicing growth and dividend income. The 5-7% yield, coupled with a 50% discount to peers, offers asymmetric upside.

- Hold: If uncertain about near-term macro risks or regulatory hurdles in digital asset servicing.

Conclusion

Crédit Agricole's full ownership of CACEIS is a masterstroke in a consolidating market. While challenges remain, the deal's focus on technological leadership and cross-divisional synergies positions the bank to outperform peers in fee-based revenue growth. For investors, the stock's undervaluation and resilient dividend yield make it a compelling pick in French/Spanish financials—a sector primed for consolidation-driven winners.",,N,,2025-07-07 05:00:03.902704

FEMAIL can confirm that McGriddles will be available nationally on the fast food giant's breakfast menu from Wednesday, July 9.

The range will see four new items introduced to the menu - all featuring the cult-favourite sweet and savoury maple infused breakfast pancakes.

For the uninitiated, McGriddles are essentially a twist on a classic Macca's breakfast burger, whereby the English Muffin bun is replaced with two fluffy maple-infused sweet pancake buns, creating a delightful sweet and savoury contrast.

The new range includes the Sausage and Cheese McGriddles, which sees a classic beef sausage patty paired with melty cheese and served in-between two soft, warm maple infused pancakes.

Then, there's the Sausage, Egg and Cheese McGriddles, which includes all of the above with the addition of an egg omelette.

Next, there's the Bacon, Egg and Cheese McGriddles, which includes a rasher bacon, egg omelette and a slice of cheese inside the pancake bun.

The final option is to keep it simple with a serve of plain McGriddles.

Previously, the only way that Aussies could get their hands on the fast food giant's legendary McGriddles was while travelling abroad to countries like the US, Canada, Japan or Hong Kong.

McDonald's Australia customers have subsequently lobbied the fast food brand for years to bring the iconic breakfast item down under.

Earlier this year, Aussie fans got wind of a secret trial of McGriddles taking place in certain Maccas stores around Sydney.

The result saw customers flocking to the select locations and willingly waiting for over an hour to to taste the hard-to-find brekkie item.

Following the success of the trial, a McDonald's Australia spokesperson confirmed to FEMAIL that all Australians will now have the chance to taste the legendary McGriddles range.

'Our Aussie fans absolutely obsessed over the sweet and savoury flavours of McGriddles when we trialled it earlier this year,' Amanda Nakad, Marketing Director of Menu and Brand for McDonald's Australia, said.

Rather than making it a limited time menu addition, Ms Nakad confirmed the popularity during the trial phase meant McGriddles had been promoted straight to the nationwide breakfast menu.

'Safe to say, we got the message and gave our iconic breakfast menu a glow up by adding it to the national menu,' she said.

She confirmed that the McGriddles range will now feature alongside other Maccas breakfast staples, such as their hashbrowns, McMuffins and McCafe coffee.

Customers should however note that McGriddles are part of the fast food store's breakfast menu, meaning they can only be purchased until 10.30am.

Back in May during the trial period, Sydney foodie Adrian Wildjy was one of the first to alert his TikTok followers about McGriddles being quietly launched in select stores down under.

Sharing a video to his over 381K followers, the Sydney food content creator raved that his favourite overseas Maccas breakfast food was now in his hometown city.

'Finally my prayer is answered. It's here in Australia. It's the McGriddles,' Adrian said in the video.

'I always have them when I'm in Japan or Hong Kong. Now it's here where I am in Sydney,' the online foodie continued.

'I just love the sweet savoury combo of the McGriddles,' Adrian said.

'I am so happy,' he concluded in the viral video, urging fellow McGriddles fans to 'run' to find them.

During the previous trial period, the McGriddles breakfast burger alone was priced at $7.80 at the Haberfield McDonald's in Sydney.

They could also be purchased as part of a breakfast meal.

Customers could also purchase the McGriddles cakes alone during the trial and were at that time priced at $4.55 - with the option to add on a hot cake syrup for an additional $1.10.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/06/22/100058203-0-image-m-15_1751837808589.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 03:00:24.428706

“Technology is enabling different types of experiences, and it’s setting new expectations, and new types of ways to shop and buy.
The company doesn’t implement AI just to implement AI, Mohammad said, adding that his teams are using generative AI as a tool when needing to solve particular problems instead of being forced to use it.
… They need a strategy that uses AI,” Mohammad said.
“Use AI to solve customer problems.” Working like a tech startup In embracing change, CarMax has had to change the way it works, Mohammad said.","Mohammad spoke with Modern Retail at the Virginia-based company’s technology office in Plano, Texas, which it opened three to four years ago to recruit for tech workers like software engineers and analysts in the region home to tech companies such as AT&T and Texas Instruments. At that office, CarMax has since hired almost 150 employees — more than initially expected — including some of Mohammad’s former colleagues from Blockbuster, which he had worked for in Texas in the early 2000s.

He explained how other legacy retailers can learn from how CarMax leveraged new technology like artificial intelligence and a startup mindset as it embraced change, becoming an omnichannel retailer where customers can buy cars in person, entirely online or through a combination of both. Many customers find a car online and test-drive and complete their purchase at the store.

“Every company, every industry is going through a lot of disruption because of technology,” Mohammad said. “It’s much better to do self-disruption: changing our own business model, challenging ourselves and going through the pain of change before we are disrupted by somebody else.”

Digitizing the dealership

Mohammad has been with CarMax for more than 12 years and had also been vp of information technology for BJ’s Wholesale Club. Since joining the auto retailer, he and his team have worked to use artificial intelligence to fully digitize the process of car buying, which is especially complex given the mountain of vehicle information and regulations dealers have to consider.

He said the company has been using AI and machine learning for at least 12-13 years to price cars, make sure the right information is online for the cars, and understand where cars need to be in the supply chain and when. That, he said, has powered the company’s website in becoming a virtual showroom that helps customers understand the vehicles, their functions and how they fit their needs. Artificial intelligence has also powered its online instant offer tool for selling cars, giving customers a fair price that doesn’t lose the company money, Mohammad said.

“Technology is enabling different types of experiences, and it’s setting new expectations, and new types of ways to shop and buy. Our industry is no different. We wanted to be that disruptor,” Mohammad said. “We want to make sure we change our business model and we bring those experiences so that we continue to remain the market leader in our industry.”

About three or four years ago, CarMax was an early adopter of ChatGPT, using it to organize data on the different features of car models and make it presentable through its digital channels. Around the same time, the company also used generative AI to comb through and summarize thousands of customer product reviews — it did what would have taken hundreds of content writers more than 10 years to do in a matter of days, he said — and keep them up to date.

As the technology has improved over the last few years, the company has adopted several new AI-powered features. One is Rhodes, a tool associates use to get support and information they need to help customers, which launched about a year ago, Mohammad said. It uses a large language model combining CarMax data with outside information like state or federal rules and regulations to help employees quickly access that data.

Anything that requires a lot of human workload and mental capacity can be automated, he said, from looking at invoices and documents to generating code for developers and engineers, saving them time to do more valuable work. Retailers like Target and Walmart have done the same by using AI chatbots as tools for employees.

“We used to spend a fortune on employee training, and employees only retained and reliably repeated a small percentage of what we trained,” said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer for Publicis Groupe. “Increasingly, AI is letting us give way better tools to the salespeople, to train them and to support them when they’re talking to customers.”

In just the last few months, Mohammad said, CarMax has been rolling out an agentic version of a previous buying and selling assistant on its website called Skye that better understands the intent of the user — not only answering the question the customer asks directly, but also walking the customer through the entire car buying process.

“It’ll obviously answer [the customer’s question], but it will also try to understand what you’re trying to do and help you proactively through the entire process. It could be financing; it could be buying; it could be selling; it could be making an appointment; it could be just information about the car and safety,” he said.

The new Skye is more like talking to an actual human being, Mohammad said, where, in addition to answering the question, the agent can make other recommendations in a more natural conversation. For example, if someone is trying to buy a car and asks for a family car that’s safe, it will pull one from its inventory, but it may also ask if they’d like to talk to someone or even how their day is going.

“It’s guiding you through the process beyond what you initially asked. It’s building a rapport with you,” Mohammad said. “It knows you very well, it knows our business really well, and then it’s really helping you get to the right car and the right process.”

Goldberg said that while many functions of retail, from writing copy to scheduling shifts, have also been improved with AI, pushing things done by humans to AI chatbots could lead to distrust or create results that are inappropriate or offensive. “At the moment, most of the AI things are about efficiency and reducing friction,” Goldberg said. “They’re taking something you’re already doing and making it easier, which is generally appealing, but there is also the potential to dehumanize the experience.”

In testing CarMax’s new assistant, other AI agents are actually monitoring it to make sure it’s up to the company’s standards and not saying bad words, Mohammad said, adding it would be impossible for humans to look at everything the new assistant is doing.

The company doesn’t implement AI just to implement AI, Mohammad said, adding that his teams are using generative AI as a tool when needing to solve particular problems instead of being forced to use it.

“Companies don’t need an AI strategy. … They need a strategy that uses AI,” Mohammad said. “Use AI to solve customer problems.”

Working like a tech startup

In embracing change, CarMax has had to change the way it works, Mohammad said. It has created a more startup-like culture, going from cubicles to more open, collaborative office spaces where employees know what everyone else is working on.

About a decade ago, he said, the company started working with a project-based mindset, where it would deliver a new project every six to nine months — each taking about a year in total, with phases for designing and testing.

Now, the company has small, cross-functional product teams of seven to nine people, each with a mission around improving a particular area like finance, digital merchandising, SEO, logistics or supply chain — some even have fun names like “Ace” or “Top Gun.”

Teams have just two weeks to create a prototype of a feature and get it in front of customers. He said that, stacked up over time, those small new changes those teams created completely transformed the business.

“The teams are empowered, and they’re given a mission. I’m not telling them what to do. I’m giving them a goal. They figure out how,” Mohammad said. “Create a culture of experimentation, and don’t wait for things to be perfect. Create a culture where your teams are empowered. It’s OK for them to make mistakes; it’s OK for them to learn from their mistakes.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/ai-human-agreement-1.webp,N,,2025-07-07 00:58:14.759866

According to the industry on the 7th, more than 100,000 customers visited Starbucks Gimpo Aegibong Ecological Park, where you can see North Korean land while drinking coffee at the store.

According to Starbucks Korea, 123,000 consumers purchased the store during the seven months from the opening of the store to last month. Aegibong Ecological Park opened on November 29 last year.

Aegibong Peace Ecological Park, also known as 'North Korea View Starbucks', is only 1.4 kilometers away from Gaepung-gun, Hwanghae-do, North Korea. Here, you can see the Jogang River, a river that meets the Han River and the Imjin River, and Gaepung-gun, North Korea, at a glance.

As the ""North Korea View"" went viral, the total number of visitors to Aegibong Peace Ecological Park surged to 129,000 from January to April. The monthly average number of visitors more than doubled compared to the previous year.

Kim Eun-joo, Starbucks Korea's Gimpo Regional Manager, said, ""In the midst of travel trends that value experience and meaning, Gimpo Aegibong Ecological Park is becoming a space that meets the demand of customers who want a special journey in their daily lives beyond simple consumption.""

In May, Starbucks attracted attention by opening its 12th special store ""Gwangjang Market Branch"" in Gwangjang Market, a traditional market representing Korea.

The Gwangjang Market branch was designed as a special store, Starbucks' specialized store, to capture the taste and taste of the Gwangjang Market, which has more than 100 years of history and tradition, and to revitalize the traditional market.

It was decorated with a retro concept reflecting the characteristics of Gwangjang Market, which is visited by customers of various ages at home and abroad.

Earlier in December 2022, Starbucks remodeled the abandoned theater in Gyeongdong Market in Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, and opened ""Gyeongdong 1960.""

Starbucks opened a specialized store with Newtro sensibility to coexist with merchants in the Gyeongdong market, and the entire market is emerging as a ""hot place"" as it attracts young customers.

As Starbucks introduces specialized stores as a differentiation strategy, the number of visitors to the place is steadily increasing.

According to Starbucks, as of last month, the number of visitors to 11 Starbucks special stores exceeded 9 million. In particular, word of mouth has spread, with constant visits centered on social network services (SNS), and an average of 1,000 customers are visiting on weekdays and 1,500 on weekends.

The Yangpyeong DT branch, the first special store, recorded the highest cumulative number of visitors, with 2.2 million visitors over five years. The Gyeongdong 1960 store was visited by 1.1 million people, and 1 million people visited the ""The North Hansan Store,"" where you can enjoy coffee while looking at Bukhansan Mountain, for two years. The Jeju Songdang Park R attracted 850,000 visitors and The Yeosu Dolsan DT branch also attracted 700,000 visitors.

As market competition intensifies due to the offensive of low-cost coffee brands, Starbucks is also strengthening its competitiveness through differentiation strategies.

Starbucks Korea said Monday that the Gimpo Aegibong Peace Ecopark branch, which opened in November 2024, recorded 123,000 customers through the end of June. The cafe, located within Aegibong Peace Ecopark, has earned the nickname “the North Korea-view Starbucks” among visitors.

The park itself is just 1.4 kilometers (0.9 miles) from Gaepung County in North Korea’s Hwanghae Province. From the site, visitors can take in views of the Han and Imjin rivers forming the narrow estuary of the Joga River, along with the surrounding areas of Gaepung County.

Because the park lies beyond the Civilian Control Line, visitors must make reservations according to a timed schedule and pass through a security checkpoint via shuttle bus.

Word of mouth has spread among tourists about the rare experience of sipping coffee while viewing North Korea. Foreign media outlets such as CNN also reported on the cafe, noting its unusual proximity to the North, drawing even more attention.

Thanks in part to the Starbucks location, overall visits to Aegibong Peace Ecopark surged to 129,000 in the first four months of this year — more than double the monthly average compared to the previous year.

The number of foreign tourists has also risen sharply. The park saw an average of about 1,300 foreign visitors per month last year. That figure now exceeds 3,300 per month — a 2.5-fold increase.

On weekends, the Starbucks branch receives around 1,000 visitors per day, more than twice the weekday average. Families account for a large share of visitors, leading to a food sales ratio about 30 percent higher than at typical locations. Weekdays draw a more diverse clientele, including tour groups, military personnel and school trips.

Because access to the park is limited to certain hours, the Starbucks branch operates on a shortened schedule from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

“In line with travel trends that prioritize unique experiences and meaning, the Gimpo Aegibong Peace Ecopark store has become a destination for customers looking for something beyond ordinary consumption,” said Starbucks Korea’s regional manager for Gimpo.

Declining global demand, geopolitical tensions, and the race to decarbonize are reshaping the landscape. Against this backdrop, Nippon Steel (5401.T) has made a bold move: acquiring U.S. Steel (X) in a $15 billion deal to create the world's second-largest steelmaker. The strategic goal? To leverage U.S. infrastructure, counter Chinese dominance, and hit a 100 million-ton annual production target by 2028—a 51% increase from its current 66 million tons. But can Nippon Steel navigate the regulatory, geopolitical, and operational minefields to reclaim its crown?

Strategic Leverage: Tech + Market = Global Muscle

The acquisition combines Nippon Steel's cutting-edge low-carbon production technologies with U.S. Steel's entrenched U.S. market position. Key synergies include:

- Modernization: A $11 billion investment plan by 2028 will overhaul U.S. Steel's aging infrastructure, including a new $2 billion electric arc furnace mill in Pennsylvania. These upgrades aim to slash carbon emissions and boost output of high-margin specialty steels for EVs, wind turbines, and defense.

- Geopolitical Shield: U.S. tariffs (up to 50%) on Chinese imports protect the merged entity's margins, while the deal aligns with “America First” policies. This shields Nippon Steel from low-cost competitors like China's Baowu Group.

- Scale Advantage: At 100 million tons, the combined firm would surpass ArcelorMittal and trail only China's Baowu. This scale could command better pricing in volatile markets.

The Golden Share: A Sword of Damocles

The deal's approval hinged on a novel “golden share” granting the U.S. government veto power over strategic decisions. This includes:

- Blocking plant closures or capacity cuts (critical for maintaining U.S. jobs and infrastructure).

- Preventing offshore production shifts or relocations of the Pittsburgh headquarters.

- Requiring Nippon Steel to invest $11 billion in U.S. facilities by 2028, including $4 billion for a new mill.

While this shields national security interests, it also shackles Nippon Steel's operational flexibility. A misstep—like delaying the Pennsylvania mill—could trigger regulatory backlash.

Labor & Liquidity: The Execution Hurdles

The deal's success depends on two ticking clocks:

1. The 2026 Labor Deadline: U.S. Steel's union contract with the United Steelworkers (USW) expires in 2026. Nippon Steel's promise of no layoffs hinges on renegotiating terms that could include cost-cutting demands. A strike here would cripple the merger's financial projections.

2. $25 Billion in Debt: Nippon Steel's $5.6 billion loan package and $11 billion investment commitment strain liquidity. If steel prices (currently ~$700/ton) slump further, the firm could face refinancing risks.

Demand Resilience: Betting on Infrastructure & Renewables

The long-term case for steel hinges on two trends:

- U.S. Infrastructure Boom: President Trump's $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan (if passed) could boost demand for rebar, pipelines, and high-grade alloys.

- Green Steel's Growth: The global low-carbon steel market is projected to hit $480 billion by 2030. Nippon Steel's expertise here positions it to capture premiums in EV batteries and wind turbines.

Investment Thesis: A High-Reward, High-Risk Bet

Bull Case:

- Synergies deliver a 100 million-ton capacity by 2028.

- U.S. infrastructure spending boosts margins.

- Nippon Steel's low-carbon tech wins EU carbon tariffs exemptions.

Bear Case:

- U.S. Steel's union disputes disrupt operations post-2026.

- Chinese steel dumping resurges if U.S. tariffs are rolled back.

- $70 oil (current price) crimps demand for automotive and construction steel.

Stock Outlook:

Nippon Steel's stock trades at 12x forward P/E—cheap relative to its peers (sector average 15x). A 4.4% dividend yield adds a buffer, but volatility is inevitable.

Final Call: Hold for Now, Buy the Dip

This is a “high conviction, long time frame” play. The merger's success requires flawless execution on labor, capital, and geopolitics—all while steel demand holds up. For bulls, the 100 million-ton target represents a rare chance to own a dominant player in a strategic industry. For now, investors should wait for clarity on 2026 labor talks and U.S. regulatory stability before diving in.

Recommendation: Hold Nippon Steel (5401.T). Consider a cautious overweight position if shares dip below ¥3,000/ton, with a 3–5 year horizon. Hedge with energy ETFs (e.g., U.S. Oil Fund) to offset commodity risks.

In a world where steel is as much about politics as profit, Nippon Steel's gamble could pay off—if it can thread the needle of U.S. oversight, union demands, and global demand swings.",,N,,2025-07-07 03:00:04.531581

Ctech, the English-language tech news division of Calcalist, Israel’s daily financial newspaper, reports that Landa owes about 516 million USD. The development comes just weeks after local media reported that the company was also planning to lay off more than 100 employees, more than 20 percent of its workforce.

According to Calcalist, Landa Digital Printing lost 312 million USD across 2022 and 2023. In 2022, it posted revenue of 35 million USD alongside a loss of 148 million USD; in 2023, revenue rose to 47 million USD, but the loss deepened to 164 million USD. Ctech explained that the increased loss was primarily due to interest payments on loans from some shareholders, which were subsequently converted into equity. The company does not yet have audited financial statements for 2024.

Benny Landa, director of Landa Digital Printing, is a former Indigo business owner, which HP acquired for 850 million USD in 2002 to create the successful HP Indigo business. He launched Landa Digital Printing in 2011. In 2017, the company began selling alpha and beta models of its machines, but real sales only started in 2022. According to Ctech, the company has sold just over 50 machines so far.

In a statement issued to the media, Landa Digital Printing, said: ‘Despite the company’s significant achievements, the time it has taken to reach the full realisation of its business potential is longer than expected.

‘The geopolitical situation, as a result of the long war in Israel and regional instability, as well as commercial reasons, have made it difficult for the company, and the shareholders who have financed the company throughout its years and they recently informed the company’s management that they intend to stop financing the company immediately.

‘As a result, the company has found itself in a cash flow crisis. In response, the company has carried out a reorganisation process in recent weeks, as part of which significant cuts were also made to deal with the situation and enable the continued realisation of its potential.

‘The company’s employees and customers have been updated on the situation and will continue to be updated as relevant developments occur, out of understanding the complex situation in which they find themselves and out of deep appreciation for their work and their full commitment to the company.’

Landa confirmed that shareholders who have supported the company over the years must stop funding immediately. Consequently, the company is now facing a cash flow crisis. In response, Landa has recently begun a reorganization, including major cuts to manage the situation.",http://www.labelsandlabeling.com/sites/labels/lnl/files/2025-07/landa.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 03:00:19.120005

The Chinese company has grown into the world's biggest food and beverage chain by selling sub-$1 drinks and adapting quickly as domestic consumers spend less. That's hard for the $107 billion premium-brand U.S. coffee icon to compete with.

Both Mixue and Starbucks opened their first stores in China in 1999. For the latter the challenge was to introduce coffee culture to a nation obsessed with tea. This turned out to be a smooth blend. Chinese consumers have become more picky and cost-conscious of late, though, and the Seattle-based heavyweight's market share has dropped to 14% from 34% in 2019, per market data provider Euromonitor.

Starbucks is trying to fight back. It announced its first-ever price cut in China last month, although its offerings are still far more expensive than those from Mixue and other rivals like Luckin Coffee.

But Starbucks cannot compete on pricing alone. Its problems run deeper than that. Amid all the talks about China’s weak consumer demand, some of the best-performing stocks in the past year have been the so-called new consumption plays, which include trendy toy maker Pop Mart International 9992 and handcraft jewellery retailer Laopu Gold 6181. These are brands that resonate deeply with the shifting spending preferences of young Chinese to focus on intangibles such as convenience, experience or personalization.

Mixue’s robust supply chain, for instance, allows it to reduce costs and introduce new beverages – or even new interior designs – to its more than 45,000 outlets within weeks. The same process may take much longer for Starbucks’ 7,800 stores in China. And a similar strategy caused problems at its U.S. stores in the past. Boss Brian Niccol even told shareholders in March that Starbucks can learn from ""several lessons"" in its China supply chain and improve its North American business.

Shareholders have rewarded Mixue's strategy: its market value has soared almost 80% to some $25 billion since its Hong Kong listing in March.

Starbucks China, meanwhile, may be worth several billion dollars, Bloomberg reported in May, citing sources. Its same-store sales have at least levelled off recently, halting the earlier slump. And Niccol has emphasised the need to find ways to grow. That would seem to require having a local partner - and buyer - with a Mixue-style understanding of how to take advantage of China’s new consumer logic.

CONTEXT NEWS

Starbucks has received “a lot of interest” in the sale of a stake in its China business as it explores a partnership with an outside investor to restore growth there, CEO Brian Niccol told the Financial Times in an interview published on June 11. As of the end of March the Seattle-based coffeehouse chain was operating 7,758 stores in China.

Mixue has surpassed Starbucks and McDonald's as the world's largest food and beverage company by store count, with 46,479 in 11 countries by December, according to the bubble tea retailer's listing prospectus.

First Quarter Highlights

- Total net sales amounted to €78.1 million, down 7.6% from €84.5 million in 1Q 2024.

- Gross margin was 34.1%, compared to 36.9% in 1Q 2024, primarily due to the transition phase of the planned production shift of Natuzzi Editions for the North American market from China to Italy.

- In 1Q 2025, we had an operating loss of (€0.8) million, compared to a profit of €0.6 million in 1Q 2024.

- Net finance costs were (€2.9) million, compared to net finance costs of (€2.2) million in 1Q 2024, also due to unfavorable currency movements on trade receivables and payables.

- During 1Q 2025, we invested €1.9 million, primarily to upgrade the Group’s Italian factories.

- As of March 31, 2025, we held €22.5 million in cash, from €20.3 million as of December 31, 2024. Proceeds from extraordinary transactions, notably the sale of the building in High Point, more than offset operating cash outflows.

- Store traffic and written orders are below expectations, due to a generalized decline in consumer confidence. This may adversely affect our results of operations at least in the first part of the current year, subject to the Cautionary Statement included herein.

Pasquale Natuzzi, executive chairman of the group, commented, “The markets in which we operate have not shown those signs of improvement we expected. The business environment has been further affected by the introduction of U.S. trade duties on April 2nd, the perduring Russia-Ukraine conflict, and, more recently, the escalation of tensions in the Middle East. In this context we have intensified our efforts to support commercial deployment.""

""We continue to implement our Brand commercial strategy that integrates collections, marketing and customer experience, while closely monitoring its effectiveness in a challenging market environment. The brand guidelines have now been centrally codified to accelerate their global and consistent roll-out.""

""This year marked our return to the Salone del Mobile Fair in Milan, after a five-year absence that coincided with the pandemic and post-pandemic period. At the Milan Fair, we unveiled the new Natuzzi Editions collections: “Feelwell”, “Dolcevita”, and “Neo Heritage”. During the Milan Design Week, we also presented the Natuzzi Italia “Comfortness” and “Circle of Harmony” collections, which reflect our evolution into a global lifestyle brand, true to our heritage. Natuzzi Italia collections have been enriched through collaborations with international designers such as Andrea Steidl, Karim Rashid, Marcantonio, and Mauro Lipparini. For both Natuzzi Italia and Natuzzi Editions, the new collections have been supported by tailored, high-quality marketing campaigns.""

""We have worked to support and innovate the three channels in which we operate: Retail (DOS and FOS), Galleries, and the newly established Contract channel (B2B opportunities).""

""In Retail we’ve made significant investments to improve analytics and intelligence. We have built the infrastructure to monitor store performance in real time, focusing on key indicators such as foot traffic, conversion rates, average ticket and product category performance. This enables a data-driven diagnostic of each store across our network, with the objective of progressively improving the performance of our retail.""

""The Re-imagined Galleries format, that was introduced late last year, has become operational in 1Q 2025. While still in its early stages, it has started to show some initial signs of positive impact, both in term of new openings and remerchandising, particularly in the U.S.""

""Following the launch of Natuzzi Harmony Residence in Dubai last November, we are seeing early signs of growing interest in our Contract division—an area we consider having significant growth potential and strategic relevance for our Group.""

""Our immediate focus is the full and effective deployment of this strategy in our main markets. We have prioritized initiatives aimed at strengthening sales and engagement across all regions, although their full impact will depend on market dynamics and execution over time.""

""North America remains a strategic priority. We have implemented a new organization with the appointment of a new VP of Retail, Justin Christensen, and a new VP of HR, Sharri McIntyre, who will focus on improving our retail and commercial operations. Justin has over 25 years of experience in the retail industry particularly in fashion, having worked with European and American fashion groups which include Brioni and Ralph Lauren. Sharri, with over 20 years of experience, has held the position of VP Corporate HR at Louis Vuitton and HR Director at Williams-Sonoma...""

Pasquale concluded, ""... We believe that the steps we've taken on collections, marketing, and retail management represent a solid foundation for improving our commercial performance over time. Our objective remains to strengthen the brand and enhance operational efficiency with the aim of delivering sustainable value for our stakeholders. However, the actual results will depend on market conditions, consumer sentiment, and the effective execution of our strategy.”

Antonio Achille, CEO of the Group, commented, “The first quarter was impacted by growing geopolitical tensions and persistent economic uncertainty that impacted consumer confidence...""

""...In October 2024, we completed the closure of our historical manufacturing plant in Shanghai. We made this decision as Shanghai no longer offered competitive labor and production costs. The Shanghai plant had served the domestic Chinese market, North America, and key countries in the rest of Asia for Natuzzi Editions. Our new facility in Quanjiao has been designed to serve exclusively the domestic Chinese market. We made the strategic decision—confirmed by the recent geopolitical outcomes—not to include North American production at this site, given the growing trade tensions between the U.S. and China...""

""The decision to reshore Natuzzi Editions production to Italy has been taken based on a thorough feasibility and sustainability study at Group level. This analysis assessed the potential benefits of the initiative, and the most significant ones include:

- The suspension of indirect and operating expenses related to the Shanghai plant, associated with Natuzzi Editions production for the North American market;

- The avoidance of import duties;

- Reduction in production costs at the Italian plants, driven by higher capacity utilization resulting from increased volumes;

- The mitigation of labor costs related to underutilized workers in Italy, who—due to current social support mechanisms—would otherwise have represented a negative cost impact...""

""We have engaged, together with the Company’s Operations and HR leadership, to address the specific issues arising from this production reallocation. More broadly, we have launched an improvement program to implement solutions aimed at enhancing quality levels, service, and production costs, especially at the Italian plants.""

""As Italy remains structurally more expensive than other production hubs—particularly in terms of labor—we are engaged in constructive dialogue with Italian institutions to address labor market challenges and ensure long-term sustainability—we remain open to exploring alternative solutions to make Natuzzi Editions production for North America structurally more viable.""

""The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade duties poses a significant challenge for the entire industry, especially for companies like ours with deep commercial ties to the U.S. market, as it has created a volatile environment in which consumers and retailers tend to postpone their purchasing decisions.""

""In light of persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainty, including the recent escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, we anticipate continued market volatility. We are therefore adopting a disciplined, risk-aware approach in planning for the coming quarters.”

Yet only 40% agree that being “fast and wrong” is better than “right and slow.”

Looking forward, leaders say they’ll need greater budget agility and workforce readiness to fully unlock AI’s potential. 32% of employees will require reskilling over the next three years, and 48% of firms are now hiring for AI-related roles that didn’t exist a year ago.

With deadlines for reciprocal tariffs now set for July 9 and August 12, 2025, the region faces a labyrinth of new rates—from 34% in China to 20% in Vietnam—while critical sectors like semiconductors and steel grapple with targeted restrictions. For investors, this is not merely a time to brace for impact but an opportunity to identify sectors and geographies with structural resilience and tactical upside.

The Sector Divide: Winners and Losers in the Tariff Regime

The U.S. strategy of using tariffs as a “precision instrument” has created stark disparities across industries. Let's dissect the key sectors:

1. Technology: Semiconductor Manufacturing's Double-Edged Sword

The 25% tariff threat on semiconductors and equipment under Section 232 has created a paradox. While companies like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) face potential headwinds, the “onshoring” push by U.S. demand could benefit Asian suppliers with advanced manufacturing capabilities. reveals a divergence: Taiwanese firms, shielded by lower geopolitical risks, have outperformed their mainland peers.

Investment thesis: Overweight Taiwan's tech giants and underweight mainland firms exposed to critical mineral export controls (e.g., rare earth producers like China Minmetals Rare Earth (600195.SH)).

2. Manufacturing: Steel and Aluminum—A Test of Resilience

The 50% tariffs on non-UK steel imports have accelerated consolidation in the region. Vietnam, now at 20% versus its initial 46% threat, could emerge as a beneficiary, leveraging its lower rates to attract automotive and machinery production. Meanwhile, Japan's auto sector faces a 25% tariff ceiling, but companies like Toyota (TM) may mitigate risks through U.S. assembly partnerships.

show Vietnam's cost advantage widening—a tailwind for its industrial sectors.

Investment thesis: Favor Vietnam's industrials (e.g., Masan Group (MSN.HM)) and Japan's firms with U.S. exposure. Avoid pure-play steel exporters without geographic diversification.

3. Consumer Staples: The Venezuelan Oil Gambit

The 25% tariff threat on countries importing Venezuelan oil—targeting India and Malaysia—adds volatility to consumer goods. However, companies with strong domestic demand decoupling from trade flows (e.g., Indonesia's Unilever (ULVR.L)) may prove resilient.

Investment thesis: Focus on consumer staples with regional dominance and limited reliance on exports to tariff-hit markets.

4. Energy: A Geopolitical Chess Game

Vietnamese and Indian firms exposed to Venezuelan oil imports face direct threats, but this creates opportunities in alternative energy plays. Companies like Australia's Woodside Energy (WPL.AX), which supplies liquefied natural gas to Asia-Pacific, could benefit as countries pivot away from sanctioned crude.

Investment thesis: Overweight energy transition plays and underweight hydrocarbon-dependent firms.

Tactical Allocation Strategies for Q3 2025

Sector Rotation: Shift capital toward technology and energy, while hedging manufacturing exposure through Vietnam and Japan's U.S.-linked firms.

Geographic Play:

Overweight: Vietnam (VNINDEX) and Taiwan (TWII) indices.

Underweight: India (NSEI) and Malaysia (KLSE) until Venezuelan oil tariffs are resolved.

Hedging Tools: Use options on semiconductor ETFs (e.g., SOXX) to cap downside risks.

Conclusion: The New Trade Order Demands Precision

The Asia-Pacific's tariff crossroads is less about broad market declines and more about sector-specific dislocations. Investors who parse the data—geographic rates, supply chain shifts, and geopolitical carveouts—will find pockets of opportunity. The key is to avoid the sectors and regions caught in the crossfire while leaning into those that can pivot, adapt, or profit from the new rules.

As the July 9 deadline looms, the message is clear: In a fragmented trade landscape, precision beats passivity.

Military experts warn we have just three to five years to strengthen Europe’s defense capabilities before facing potentially devastating security challenges.

Philip Stoten talked about these trends and the European response with Kitron Group’s President and CEO, Peter Nilsson and Managing Director of Kitron AS, Hans Petter Thomassen, who participated in the “Implementation Dialogue on EU Defence” with Commissioner Andrius Kubilius, held in Brussels last month.

The European Commission recognizes this urgency. They’ve initiated an “omnibus” bill aimed at helping defense manufacturers ramp up production quickly, bringing together industry leaders from major prime contractors to innovative startups developing cutting-edge battlefield technologies. But the challenges are enormous.

Most electronics components, semiconductors, and specialized materials used in European defense systems come from outside the continent. While stockpiling strategic materials for several years provides a short-term solution, the long-term challenge of rebuilding secure supply chains remains daunting. For specialized materials like munitions chemicals, new production facilities require five years just for permitting and environmental studies.

Regional responses vary dramatically across Europe. Countries feeling immediate threat – the Nordics, Baltics, Poland, and Germany – are leading with bold procurement initiatives and defense budgets approaching 5% of GDP. These long-term commitments provide the certainty manufacturers need for major capacity investments.

Perhaps most exciting is the rise of defense technology startups across Eastern Europe. From drone innovations to laser targeting systems, these companies bring battlefield-ready solutions developed with real-world urgency. As one Ukrainian defense official emphasized: “A system you can provide me two years from now has zero interest – I need something for tomorrow.” The war in Ukraine accelerates these trends, serving as both catalyst for action and testing ground for technologies. Defense donation programs deliver immediate battlefield feedback on new systems, strengthening the innovation cycle.",https://www.emsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EMSnow-logo-1200x630-1-e1623708589690.png,N,,2025-07-06 23:00:19.459021

Instacart will roll out the card to its U.S. shoppers in two phases, first in October, and again in April of next year.
Faster access to funds matters as well at a time when two-thirds of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.
DailyPay has filed its own suit looking for declaratory relief, and contends that its EWA offerings are not loans.","The Instacart Shoppers Rewards Card, which debuted July 1 in partnership with workforce payments platform Branch, lets these workers get free, automatic payouts of their earnings.

“We’re doubling down on our dedication to shopping excellence by empowering and rewarding shoppers who consistently deliver exceptional service to customers,” Daniel Danker, chief product officer at Instacart, said in a news release.

“Instacart shoppers are shopping experts, and they balance efficiency, empathy and skill to serve their communities every day. Through the Cart Star refresh and the new Shopper Rewards Card, we’re recognizing and supporting their incredible work, while providing valuable resources to help shoppers thrive both on and off the platform.”

According to the release, the program lets shoppers have their earnings deposited directly in their Shopper Rewards bank account for free after every batch they complete. If these employees choose to use a different bank account, they’ll be charged $1.50 for the Instant Cashout service, the release said.

Instacart will roll out the card to its U.S. shoppers in two phases, first in October, and again in April of next year. The card is part of Instacart’s Cart Star program, which the company introduced in 2022.

This latest addition comes as Americans are seeking on-demand wages, with “the ability to break free from the two-week pay cycle allows workers to manage cash flow and their expenses in a more fluid manner,” as PYMNTS wrote earlier this year.

Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has found that 83% of individuals want to have more frequent pay schedules, with 75% of millennials saying earned wage access (EWA) availability would impact whether or not they would accept a job offer.

Faster access to funds matters as well at a time when two-thirds of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Another PYMNTS Intelligence report, “Measuring Consumer Satisfaction With Instant Payouts” found that 77% of consumers chose to receive instant payments for income and earnings disbursements.

At the same time, there have been moves to regulate the EWA space on the state and federal level. For example, the New York State attorney general sued earned wage access providers DailyPay and MoneyLion earlier this year, alleging their products are payday loans fees that can add up to interest rates of as much as 750%.

At checkout, customers only need to scan a single barcode on the weekly digital deals sheets to receive all advertised digital discounts.
“Kroger is finally doing something good for consumers who have been cut out of being able to use digital coupons,” Edgar Dworsky, publisher of Consumerworld.org, told Checkbook.
Customers simply scan their loyalty cards or enter their phone numbers at the “Savings Station,” and all that week’s advertised digital coupons are automatically loaded onto their accounts.
“Consumer advocates have been lobbying stores for the past three years, so it’s really good to see a big chain like Kroger get their act together and make digital coupons easier,” Dworsky said.","Grocery shoppers can celebrate a small victory this week after Kroger, one of the nation’s largest supermarket chains, improved its much-maligned digital coupon policy at some of its stores.

Three years ago, to “stop discriminating against senior citizens and low-income shoppers” who are unable to take advantage of in-store digital-only discounts because they don’t have reliable internet access or own smartphones. As a result, these shoppers are forced to pay higher grocery prices than their more tech-savvy counterparts.

Kroger’s solution is to now provide printed “Weekly Digital Deals” at store entrances or customer service desks. At checkout, customers only need to scan a single barcode on the weekly digital deals sheets to receive all advertised digital discounts.

Unfortunately, not all Kroger-owned brands nationwide are participating in this effort. But when I visited QFC and Fred Meyer stores in Seattle, I found the “weekly digital deals” flyers at the entrance to both stores.

Before the policy change, Kroger required shoppers to use its app or website to select each digital-only coupon they wanted to use, then store them on their app or loyalty card to receive the advertised discounts.

“Kroger is finally doing something good for consumers who have been cut out of being able to use digital coupons,” Edgar Dworsky, publisher of Consumerworld.org, told Checkbook. “They created what I call a ‘super coupon,’ a little handout sheet in the store that has all their digital coupons and specials, all on one sheet and a single barcode. It’s so simple, why didn’t they do this sooner?”

Similarly, last year, Stop & Shop, a regional supermarket chain in the Northeast, by installing coupon kiosks at the front of its stores. Customers simply scan their loyalty cards or enter their phone numbers at the “Savings Station,” and all that week’s advertised digital coupons are automatically loaded onto their accounts.

Kroger and Stop & Shop still require customers to take extra steps to get the lowest prices—and shoppers must figure out how to unlock these savings. But it’s an improvement.

Most other mega-grocery chains, including Albertsons, which owns Safeway and Haggen, have stuck to a digital divide strategy.

‘An Unfair Hardship’

One Checkbook subscriber said digital coupons at Fred Meyer “only work 60 percent of the time.” Another complained that they are “overcharged regularly at Harris Teeter for sale items.”

Even when the discounts work, shoppers without smartphones, computers, or tech skills are effectively shut out of advertised savings. According to a 2021 Pew Research Center report, nearly 25 percent of adults aged 65 and older do not use the internet, and roughly 30 percent of low-income households (earning under $30,000 annually) lack reliable broadband access.

“The extra financial burden placed on these vulnerable consumers is an unfair hardship,” the consumer groups told the grocery giants.

Kroger has yet to publicly announce its new coupon program or announce which sub-brands will participate. Checkbook asked Kroger for details, but the company did not respond.

But , Kroger executives discussed digital coupons and CEO Ron Sargent said the company was “working to make sure that our promotional offers are simpler, easier to access by all customers.”

CFO David Kennerly added, “Rather than a customer having to get out their phone to get a digital coupon in-store, we’re trying to make the customer experience in-store much easier for them.”

Food Costs Continue to Rise

Americans are spending a greater portion of their income on food than they have in decades. Coupons can help lower spending, but the digital divide has been a hindrance for a growing part of the population.

For shoppers living on fixed incomes—such as many retirees or those receiving disability benefits—even small savings of $.50 or $1 per item can add up significantly over time. In rural areas, where fewer grocery options exist, shoppers can’t just go to a competing store with more accessible discounts.

“Consumer advocates have been lobbying stores for the past three years, so it’s really good to see a big chain like Kroger get their act together and make digital coupons easier,” Dworsky said. “Now it's Albertson’s turn.”

The Teamsters Union Shared Its Displease With The Buyout Plan From UPS

Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien shared his dissatisfaction with UPS’ buyout plan in a scathing rant on the Teamsters official X account.

“UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts in front of Teamsters drivers.

UPS Teamsters work too damn hard to be treated with such disrespect.”

UPS told Newsweek that it will work through the buyouts, staff reductions, and closures to maintain excellent service to customers.

“As we work through our network reconfiguration, we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing our customers with the reliable, industry-leading service they expect from UPS,” a spokesperson shared.

According to newly compiled data from S&P Global and Mergermarket, there were 10 Chinese mining deals valued at more than $100 million each in 2024—the most since 2013. Analysts reported to Australia Business Review that the trend reflects Beijing’s aggressive push to lock up global raw material supply ahead of mounting geopolitical resistance.

Separate research from the Griffith Asia Institute confirmed that 2024 was the most active year for Chinese mining investment and construction abroad in more than a decade. This momentum appears to have carried into 2025. In April, China’s Baiyin Nonferrous Group acquired a copper and gold mine in Brazil for $420 million. In June, Zijin Mining announced a $1.2 billion acquisition of a gold mine in Kazakhstan, AFR reported.

These moves come as the US and allied nations, including Australia, seek to reduce their dependence on China for materials essential to clean energy and advanced manufacturing, including lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, and other battery metals.

The Trump administration, in its second term, has prioritized securing America’s mineral independence under a broader agenda of expanding US natural resource development. President Trump’s recently signed One Big Beautiful Bill includes major investments in domestic mining, exploration, and processing infrastructure, as well as tax incentives for companies developing critical mineral supply chains within the US and allied countries.

China doesn’t share either environmental or labor standards that are found in the US. Many factory workers in China endure 12-hour shifts, 6–7 days a week, with unpaid overtime.

The communist country is exploiting weak governance in developing countries to undercut the West and lock up global resources.

This is the same tactic that China used on Alaska under the weak leadership of Gov. Bill Walker. China attempted to gain ownership and influence over the Alaska LNG project during Walker’s administration, as part of a broader effort by Beijing to secure long-term energy supplies and strategic infrastructure access in North America in its Belt and Road Initiative.

Just this month, Texas has passed a law prohibiting foreign ownership of land in the state. Alaska has yet to pass such a law.

China, which consumes more minerals than any other nation, dominates the refining and processing of many critical materials but relies heavily on imports for raw supply. Through initiatives tied to its Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese state-backed companies have used loans, infrastructure projects, and joint ventures to expand their control of mines and energy projects across Africa, South America, and Central Asia.

Analysts say the latest wave of acquisitions is part of a deliberate strategy to move quickly before Western restrictions tighten. “Chinese groups believe they have a near-term window,” said Michael Scherb of Appian Capital Advisory. “They’re trying to get a lot of M&A done before geopolitics make it impossible.”

That strategy includes acquiring assets in riskier regions where Western firms may hesitate to operate. China’s willingness to take long-term views and accept less favorable terms has given it an edge, especially in countries where governments are nationalizing Western assets or demanding higher royalties.",https://mustreadalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/34132055_s.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 19:01:43.706959

Earlier this year, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders outlawed anti-competitive practices in the pharmacy industry, and lobbyists are hopping mad about it. There are many reasons drug prices are inflated, but she realized some of the biggest retailers have figured out how to game the system.

“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions, but Arkansas has never been afraid to be a conservative leader for America,” Mrs. Sanders said in a statement after she signed a bill in April prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies.

Pharmacy benefit managers are the middlemen who negotiate rates between pharmaceutical manufacturers, insurance companies and pharmacies. These organizations were supposed to keep costs low for customers through volume discounts, rebates and generic substitution. It hasn’t worked out that way.

In Arkansas, the three largest middlemen are CVS Caremark, Cigna and Optum (an offshoot of UnitedHealthcare). The latter two are giant insurance companies that run HMOs. Combining insurance, doctors writing prescriptions and pharmacies fulfilling those prescriptions in a single package raises a potential conflict of interest.

An insurance company might have an incentive to deny coverage or reduce benefits for patients trying to buy cheaper drugs at an independent pharmacy, which might otherwise be able to offer better service for less money. That was the thinking behind the new law in Arkansas.

CVS sued Mrs. Sanders, claiming her policy is a simply a protectionist ruse designed to hurt out-of-state pharmacies for the benefit of the in-state pharmacies — like Bentonville-based retailer Walmart. “Walmart has announced plans to expand its pharmacy offerings in Arkansas, and has seen a huge uptick in prescription orders since HB 1150 was enacted,” the lawsuit states.

That would be persuasive if attorneys general in 38 other states didn’t also recognize the anticompetitive behavior. “Over the past few decades, horizontal consolidation and vertical integration have transformed PBMs from useful administrative service providers into market-dominating behemoths that control the industry,” the officials wrote in a letter to the congressional leadership.

Signatories include right-of-center stalwarts like Missouri’s Andrew Bailey and Virginia’s Jason Miyares, each asking Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to impose nationwide regulations that mirror what Mrs. Sanders has done.

Some Republican senators are already on board. During a Judiciary Committee hearing in May, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley slammed integrated PBMs. “You’re like one big, huge pharma industry… This looks like classic monopolist behavior. The patients are getting screwed, Missourians are getting screwed, and you’re getting rich.”

A study conducted by the University of Southern California’s Neeraj Sood found 40% of total spending on drugs goes into the pockets of insurers, PBMs and pharmacies. “This finding was striking, because it challenged the conventional narrative that manufacturers were solely responsible for high prescription drug costs,” Mr. Sood testified. Those supply chain firms — often one and the same company — enjoyed profit margins out of step with the rest of the S&P 500.

The Federal Trade Commission confirmed the findings with a report in January showing PBMs marked up specialty drugs by up to $1,000 per prescription compared to costs at a pharmacy not affiliated with a PBM.

It’s easy to lose sight of what’s happening because of how complicated healthcare has become, mostly because of government meddling. While intervention tends to worsen outcomes, Congress ought to consider what might be done to address problems that existing regulations have introduced.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/23/Arkansas_Governor_84298_c0-68-4762-2845_s1200x700.jpg?edb351d4b1f7cd3549f7be4103044aa96b3d07d8,N,,2025-07-06 17:01:36.075322

Starbucks is transforming its stores to offer a more inviting atmosphere, aligning with CEO Brian Niccol's vision to create a ""coffeehouse vibe."" According to Yahoo Finance, the initiative, dubbed the Back to Starbucks plan, has already begun in New York and Southern California, where select locations are being revamped with premium features.

The redesigns include cozy seating areas, warmer lighting, and locally inspired art, providing each store with a unique ambiance. In Bridgehampton, NY, for instance, the Starbucks location now features cozy chairs and couches, complemented by dark green walls and hardwood floors, offering a distinct look. Meanwhile, the East Hampton store showcases wall art that pays homage to the town's seaside and nautical heritage.

Beyond aesthetic changes, Starbucks is reintroducing ceramic mugs for some in-house orders and bringing back the condiment bar, allowing customers to personalize their beverages. Baristas are also being encouraged to warmly acknowledge customers, enhancing the welcoming atmosphere.

In addition to these customer-focused changes, Starbucks is implementing strategic adjustments to boost efficiency. The company has streamlined its menu and introduced a new order sequencing algorithm, which has successfully reduced wait times.

That was the consensus among executives from Uber Advertising, Albertsons Media Collective and Publicis Groupe’s Epsilon, who spoke on a panel moderated by Jon Watts, managing director of the Coalition for Innovation in Media Measurement, at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.

“I look at the four A’s,” said Edwin Wong, head of measurement science at Uber Advertising. “It’s really about access, attention, activation and accountability.”

Wong said Uber’s advertising business benefits from high-intent signals and a first-party data moat that enables closed-loop measurement and real-time engagement with consumers.

“Our experience, which is all around the go and the get, is about the human journey that delivers serendipitously,” Wong said. “We’re seeing that marketers are really being attuned to it.”

Retail media meets moments that matter

For Albertsons Media Collective, retail media offers brands the ability to influence purchase decisions with precision, while preserving the power of storytelling.

“Marketers have been looking for three things forever,” said Julian Mintz, vice president of ad sales at Albertsons Media Collective. “They want a verified person that they know is in market, they want to influence that person, and they want to measure whether that influence led to a sale. Retail media cracks that code.”

Albertsons is investing in in-store innovation to bridge the online and offline experience.

“Today we announced our digital display network,” Mintz said. “Big impactful digital screens in the store. Now we’re making that moment in the store a moment that matters, where we can use data and closed-loop measurement to actually make that moment meaningful for marketers as well.”

Identity, AI and the connected retail ecosystem

Austin Leonard, senior vice president of retail media at Epsilon, emphasized the importance of identity as the foundation of effective retail media strategies.

“The retailer has their audience,” Leonard said. “The first thing you need to do is be able to have a way to identify them. So identity is the backbone. How do you take your CRM? How do you activate it?”

Leonard noted that retailers with a strong understanding of their audiences can help brands drive measurable results, especially as AI accelerates innovation.

“It’s all about AI,” he said. “It is allowing us to actually move a lot faster, whether it’s creating new ways to build audiences or creating better ways to measure.”

Influencers are also becoming a bigger part of the retail media equation. “We think there’s a ton of innovation that’s happening there,” Leonard said, pointing to Publicis’ acquisition of Influential as a key enabler for brands.

Consumer Experience: Relevant, convenient and creative

Despite growing digital sophistication, the panelists stressed that retail media must serve the consumer, delivering convenience and relevance without being disruptive.

“Say what you want about advertising, when it’s relevant, it’s real, and they like it,” Mintz said. “When retail media is done right, and when it’s relevant, it basically becomes a personal shopper that’s whispering in your ear.”

Wong agreed, framing retail media as permissive rather than interruptive.

“Convenience made accessible in a real way,” he explained, citing Uber’s ability to connect ride services with grocery delivery or other needs. “It’s not even leaning in, it’s actually being in.”

The Future: Predictive relevance, collapsing digital-physical boundaries

Looking ahead, the panelists agreed that predictive AI will be central to the evolution of retail media.

“Predictive relevance is a whole new ball game,” Mintz said, describing how AI models can anticipate consumer needs, such as targeting allergy medication based on real-time pollen levels and purchase behaviors. “We can serve an ad to someone to buy that medication before they even get the sniffles.”

Wong highlighted Uber’s vision of creating “serendipity” in the consumer journey by leveraging AI and persistent identity signals.

“With that same sort of precision, I think we’re doing that on the advertising side,” he said.

The panel also addressed concerns around fragmentation, standardization, and the need for interoperability across retail media networks. While Leonard dismissed the idea of a “super aggregator,” he acknowledged the need for collaboration and standard frameworks.

“Competition is actually driving the innovation,” Leonard said. “But building those tools out so they can do that is your core job as a retail media network.”

2030: The retail media landscape redefined

Asked to imagine the future of retail media by 2030, the panelists shared a vision of seamless integration between physical and digital spaces.

“We’re going to see fluidity between physical and digital in a way much bigger than just shoppability online or digital screens in the store,” Mintz predicted. Leonard added that rapid advancements in AI, identity, and ad formats will transform the shopping experience entirely.

For Wong, the future is about “serendipity,” where advertising enhances the consumer journey without being intrusive.

“How are we going to leverage ML and AI to really create that sort of serendipity so that when you’re in that moment, you’re actually with the consumer, convenience adjacent, so that you’re on their path?” Wong asked.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/98076-thumbnail-1-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 16:01:11.916593

They also have expertise when it comes to picking real estate and hiring employees. Basically, simply being big gives you a better cost structure and makes it harder for anyone to compete with you.

Back when Dunkin’ Donuts, now just Dunkin', was rapidly expanding in the 2000s, it seemed to have a strategy of opening near the local donut place. It generally did not take away the hard-core local business, but people just passing through had expectations of the brand.

If they had time or did some homework, they may have visited the local brand. But most people passing through just want a cup of coffee and something to eat.

They assume that Dunkin’ or another national brand will do that more cheaply and efficiently than a local brand.

That’s probably true, but the local brand almost certainly had a better doughnut and back then, a much better coffee selection.

It didn’t matter. The national chain could sort of slowly choke out the local chain. It might take months or even years, but it was inevitable.

Local coffee houses are a dying tradition

To compete as a local chain, you need to find a niche that the larger players don't (and aren't likely to) fill. Just offering a better experience is probably not enough.

Lucky Perk, which was once a thriving chain in the Boise, Idaho, area, leaned into its being local.

""Locally owned and operated, Lucky Perk is the perfect study spot, meeting location or lobby to catch up with loved ones. Our baristas are trained and ready to craft you delicious specialized drinks, or a popular signature or seasonal special. Grab a pastry while you're in and enjoy an Idaho Original company and winner of the Best of Meridian business competition,"" it shared on its website.

The problem is that being local isn't really a competitive moat. Yes, some customers will support that, but many will just as easily go to Starbucks if it's convenient.

Retail bankruptcy:

Iconic auto repair chain franchise files Chapter 11 bankruptcy

Popular beer brand closes down and files Chapter 7 bankruptcy

Popular vodka and gin brand files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy

Lucky Perk, which opened in 2017, grew into a six-location regional powerhouse, but it has quickly shrunk back to a single location.

In May, the chain had a liquidation sale at its Silverstone location. It stressed that while five of its six stores had closed, it would remain open on Cherry Lane and Linder.

Are local coffeehouses doomed?

The United States keeps drinking more coffee and adding cafes/coffeehouses.

""The value of the United States coffee shop market grew 8% to $49.5 billion over the past year, resulting in a 4% increase in the market’s pre-pandemic value, according to the newly released Project Café USA 2024,"" Daily Coffee News reported. ""The annual report produced by the Allegra Group’s World Coffee Portal also said that the number of U.S. coffee shops has for the first time surpassed 40,000, which is approximately 7% above pre-pandemic levels.""

The problem for local and regional operators is that most of the growth came from larger chains.

Starbucks, for example, added 494 net new U.S. stores in the past 12 months. In addition, Dunkin’ added 172, Dutch Bros added 164, and Scooter’s Coffee added 224.

It's a challenge for smaller players when Starbucks captures 40% of the total market and a number of smaller chains are growing quickly.

That doesn't signal the death of the local coffeehouse, but operating more than one store, unless you grow very quickly, has become a very daunting model.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NzA5NTM2NzA1Mzg5ODY5/people-drinking-coffee-inside-a-cafe-lead.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 17:01:42.173124

The euro zone HCOB manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index, compiled by S&P Global, edged up to 49.5 in June from 49.4 in May, its highest level since August 2022, but remaining below the 50 mark denoting growth in activity.

“There are signs of some stabilisation in the manufacturing sector. Companies have now expanded production slightly for the fourth month in a row, order intake has ceased to fall, and slightly longer delivery times also indicate that demand is picking up a bit,” said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.

Still, the surveys revealed stark differences across the currency bloc. Ireland recorded the highest PMI at a 37-month peak and Greece, Spain, and the Netherlands also posted readings above 50. Meanwhile, Germany’s manufacturing PMI reached its highest in nearly three years though it still indicated contraction.

On the other hand, France, Italy and Austria registered faster declines in manufacturing conditions, weighing on the bloc’s overall performance.

In Britain, outside the European Union, the manufacturing sector showed some signs of turning a corner in its long slump.

TARIFF WOES

But the underlying softness in surveys released on Tuesday highlights the challenges facing policymakers as they try to navigate U.S. President Donald Trump’s moves to shake up the global trade order with sweeping tariffs.

Major central bank chiefs began their annual get-together organised by the European Central Bank on Monday, and one issue permeating their discussions is: Could Trump’s protectionist and unpredictable economic policies bring an end to the system that has ruled global finance for 80 years?

Despite the clouded outlook Japan’s manufacturing activity expanded for the first time in 13 months, and South Korea’s activity contracted at a milder pace, private surveys showed on Tuesday.

China’s Caixin PMI also expanded in June due to an increase in new orders, confounding an official survey that showed activity shrinking for a third straight month.

However, stalled trade talks with the United States, prospects of weakening global demand and lacklustre growth in China will likely weigh on Asia’s factory activity, analysts say.

“We must recognise that the external environment remains severe and complex, with increasing uncertainties. The issue of insufficient effective demand at home has yet to be fundamentally resolved,” said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group on China’s PMI.

The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, surpassing analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll.

Japan’s final au Jibun Bank PMI rose to 50.1 due to an upswing in output, but overall demand remained weak as new orders shrank on concern over U.S. tariffs.

Factory activity in South Korea contracted for the fifth straight month though the pace of decline eased due to companies’ relief over a snap presidential election on June 3 that ended six months of uncertainty.

The PMI came after separate June data showed exports from Asia’s fourth-largest economy rebounded but shipments to the U.S. and China remained weak.

The steep import levies imposed and then paused by Trump have upended global trade and left many economies heavily reliant on exports to the U.S. in a quandary.

Negotiators from major U.S. trading partners are rushing to reach deals with Trump’s administration by a July 9 deadline to avoid import tariffs jumping to higher levels.

While China is continuing its negotiations for a broader trade deal with the U.S., Japan and South Korea have so far failed to win concessions on the tariffs imposed on their mainstay export items like automobiles.",,N,,2025-07-06 14:03:33.018899

This year, 57 S&P 500 companies faced 65 DEI-related measures, 26 of which were anti-DEI measures.

Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow, a shareholder advocacy nonprofit that promotes environmental and social justice issues, called this year's DEI campaigns ""triumphant"" based on shareholders' rejection of anti-DEI measures.

That included defeats for anti-DEI measures proposed at major US companies like Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS), Costco (COST), Levi Strauss (LEVI), Deere (DE), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B), and Disney (DIS).

Softer language added to corporate filings may help avoid the ire of Trump's executive orders, Behar said, but additional factors are influencing DEI, such as the SEC's updated guidance in February that makes it easier for companies to exclude shareholder proposals, particularly those related to social issues.

Prior guidelines required the SEC to consider a proposal's ""broad societal impact"" when reviewing a company's ""no-action requests"" that can keep proposals off their voting agendas.

New guidance instead says the SEC can consider a company's particular facts and circumstances.

On top of that, there’s a lot of uncertainty for companies that are federal contractors, Behar said, after the US Supreme Court ruled that federal district courts lack authority to issue nationwide injunctions.

A district court in Maryland issued an order enjoining Trump's DEI executive order, but the Fourth Circuit appellate court ruled that the order could stand but applies only to contractors' DEI programs that violate federal antidiscrimination laws.

""As of Friday, now ... nobody knows what to do,"" Behar said.

Joseph Siaw Agyepong seeks partnerships in Kenya to boost sanitation and job creation through Zoomlion’s waste management model.

Environment ministry orders technical reviews to possibly adopt Jospong’s model into national Extended Producer Responsibility programs.

Jospong inks waste management deals in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and The Gambia, promoting African-led environmental and economic solutions.

Ghanaian businessman Joseph Siaw Agyepong, founder and executive chairman of the Accra-based Jospong Group of Companies, is stepping up his efforts to expand across Africa. His latest stop is Kenya, where he's pursuing new partnerships aimed at tackling waste management and creating jobs.

Last week, Agyepong met with Mombasa County Governor Abdullswamad Sherrif Nassir to discuss a waste management collaboration through Zoomlion Ghana Limited, one of Jospong’s key subsidiaries. The initiative focuses on improving sanitation in Mombasa while supporting local economic growth. It builds on similar agreements Jospong has already signed this year in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and The Gambia.

Kenya eyes Zoomlion’s sanitation model

Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Dr. Deborah Mlongo Barasa, has also thrown her weight behind Zoomlion’s approach. Following talks in Nairobi, she directed the National Environment Management Authority to begin technical assessments, with a view to incorporating Jospong’s solutions into Kenya’s Extended Producer Responsibility framework.

Agyepong said the group’s goal is to “turn sanitation challenges into engines of opportunity,” by investing in skills development and building systems led by Africans for African communities. Zoomlion’s model, already in use across Ghana and 11 other African countries—as well as parts of Asia—centers on recycling, composting, and job creation.

Ghana’s green vision goes continental

Over the past two decades, Agyepong has built Jospong into one of Ghana’s most diversified companies, with operations spanning sanitation, finance, technology, and the automotive industry. In Ghana alone, the group runs 58 waste management sites and 16 recycling and composting facilities. That experience is now being exported across Africa, with Burkina Faso the latest to tap into the model.

Earlier this year, Jospong finalized a deal with authorities in Burkina Faso to develop a full-cycle waste management system, from collection to recycling and final treatment, tailored to the country’s environmental needs. The partnership was cemented during a state visit by Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo to Burkina Faso in March, underscoring the growing collaboration between the two nations.

Agyepong builds pan-African sanitation empire

The Burkina Faso deal came on the heels of a major deal in Nigeria. In Lagos, Zoomlion is working with the state government to overhaul waste disposal systems in one of Africa’s largest cities. The plan includes shutting down major dumpsites and building two Transfer Loading Stations at Olusosun and Solous III, with a focus on recycling and resource recovery.

In The Gambia, officials signed on after touring Jospong’s operations in Ghana. That agreement was described by Gambian representatives as “an African solution to an African challenge”—a phrase that has come to define Agyepong’s vision: finding practical, homegrown answers to the continent’s growing waste problem.",https://www.billionaires.africa/content/images/2025/07/joseph-agyepong-zoomlion-kenya-expansion.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 12:11:55.587953

Not anymore. As of June 30 the company rolled out a “9 a.m. club”: a full hour when only its $130-a-year Executive Members may roam the cavernous aisles. Gold Star cardholders arrive to see carts already half-filled.

The fine print of the golden hour

Under the new policy Executive members flash their black-bordered cards at 9 a.m. Monday through Friday and Sunday, and from 9 to 9:30 a.m. on Saturdays.

Standard members keep the old schedule: 10 a.m. entry (9:30 on Saturday). To sweeten the pot Costco automatically drops a $10 credit each month into every Executive account, good toward Same-Day or Instacart orders of $150 or more. Skip the warehouse and the perk pays for part of the delivery fee anyway.

There are also other extras: 15 % off Figo pet insurance, bonus savings on the Costco Auto Program, and an occasional members-only tech deal that never hits the coupon book. None of them cost the retailer much but together they buff the sheen of the black card.

Why Costco is doing this now

Look at the numbers. Executive households represent 47 percent of U.S. memberships, yet drive 73 percent of global sales, and they renew at 92.8 percent year after year . After bumping the tier fee from $120 to $130 last fall, CEO Ron Vachris promised visible added value. Early entry and digital credits are the first tangible returns.

There’s a traffic puzzle too. Weekday mornings and Saturday openings pack parking lots, choke aisles and stretch checkout to theme-park length. Giving top spenders a head-start shaves peak congestionwithout hiring more cashiers. Fewer carts jamming produce at 11 a.m. is good optics.

Life in the two-tier line

Some Gold Star shoppers feel demoted. “I paid my $65, and now I watch them wheel out the beef tenderloin before I get through the door”, one Phoenix member posted on Reddit. Others shrug, since sleeping in beats snagging the first strawberries anyway. Inside, early birds relish echoing aisles, full bakery racks and no hunt for parking.

However, this is not an original strategy. Rival Sam’s Club has let Plus members in at 8 a.m. for years, a perk splashed across its help-desk pages. BJ’s Wholesale tested a 9:30 “Express Entrance” for its Elite tier in New England last winter. So Costco’s move is less invention than parity… albeit with a later coffee-friendly hour and an Instacart cherry on top.

Will the black-card crowd grow?

Probably. The $65 price gap between tiers vanishes once a household spends roughly $3,250 a year; the 2 percent Executive rebate covers it. Add $120 in delivery credits and you break even closer to $2,500. A family of four making bi-weekly hauls sails past that before Thanksgiving. Costco Insider polls suggest up to eight percent of Gold Star members are weighing an upgrade after the announcement.

Early entry reshapes staffing models—more workers on duty at 8:45, slimmer overlap mid-morning. IT is tweaking entrance scanners that now flash tier level in real time, ending the awkward “your card is the wrong color” debate. Insiders hint the calm hour doubles as a sandbox for upcoming scan-and-go tech; if the pilot succeeds, regular hours might still keep the no-phones rule.

Costco was built on egalitarian treasure-hunt shopping, but its newest perk turns back the clock—literally—for the customers who fuel most of its growth. For some, the quiet hour will be priceless. For others, the extra sleep is worth more than beating the crowds. Either way the warehouse wars just adopted boarding groups, and the black card now feels a little more like first class.",https://eladelantado.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/costco-empty-lot.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 12:12:16.716563

The Chinese coffee chain is betting on mobile-only ordering and unique flavors to attract customers from established competitors like Starbucks. Source. At the midtown location, customer Sam Liu expressed surprise at the jasmine cold brew and noted the limited seating and the app-based ordering system.

Luckin Coffee is China's largest coffee chain, boasting over 24,000 locations in Asia, which is more than twice the number of Starbucks locations in the region. In contrast, Starbucks operates over 17,000 stores in the United States. The CEO of Luckin, Guo Jinyi, emphasized the strategic importance of the U.S. market for the company's expansion, aiming to offer a diverse coffee experience to American consumers.

The brand's success in Asia has been driven by innovative beverages such as alcohol-infused coffees and fruit lattes, alongside its smartphone-centric ordering system. This model allows for efficient inventory tracking, personalized marketing, and quick service, according to analyst John Zolidis of Quo Vadis Capital. Zolidis noted that Luckin's ability to differentiate its menu with drinks like blood orange cold brew and coconut lattes will be crucial for its success in the U.S. market.

Despite facing financial challenges during the pandemic, including a delisting from Nasdaq and a bankruptcy filing in the U.S., Luckin Coffee has rebounded, with sales reaching $4.7 billion globally in fiscal year 2024, marking a 38.4% increase from 2023, based on data from the IndexBox platform. Meanwhile, Starbucks has experienced declines in same-store sales in both the U.S. and China, with a 2% drop in the U.S. and an 8% decrease in China for fiscal year 2024. The Seattle-based chain is reportedly considering a partial sale of its Chinese operations while revamping its U.S. strategy.

'While the broader macro environment has been more resilient than feared, overall airline-industry demand has looked tepid,' analyst says

The second-quarter earnings season will begin a little more quietly than usual this week, with results from Delta Air Lines Inc. due on Thursday.

Wall Street's advice? Keep expectations low.

TD Cowen analyst Tom Fitzgerald, in a research note last week, cited ""stable"" but also ""tepid"" demand for flight tickets, as the U.S.'s trade wars and related negotiations keep people anxious over the broader economy. And as the peak summer travel season picks up, he said he isn't expecting much from airline stocks.

""We believe U.S. airline shares will be biased downward over the near term due to persistent pricing weakness,"" Fitzgerald said. ""We do not expect them to catch a bid until there's greater clarity on consumer demand and 2026 industry pricing. This year increasingly looks like a lost year.""

Among headwinds, New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport - a major hub serving the New York metro area - has suffered from dropped connections in its communications network, understaffing among air-traffic controllers and runway repairs that have snarled travel. Similar issues have emerged at other airports, while geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East have threatened to push fuel prices higher.

The airline industry is expected to trim flight schedules to stay in line with weaker demand. Delta (DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian, during the company's earnings call in April, said that ""given broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled.""

""The impact has been most pronounced in domestic, and specifically in the main cabin, with softness in both consumer and corporate travel,"" he added.

As MarketWatch noted last week, analysts expect premium seating classes and other high-end offerings - which Delta has focused more on in recent years - to fare better than demand in the main cabin. They also expect international travel to outperform domestic travel. Those trends could help better shield the three major U.S. carriers - Delta, United Airlines Holdings Inc. (UAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) - from the worst of the industry's current threats to sales and profits.

More extensive detail on the state of the economy and the consumer will come next week, when JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and some of the other big banks report results. Those banks have typically reported during the same week as Delta.

Still, even as the economy holds up, Delta's shares are down around 16% so far this year.

""While the broader macro environment has been more resilient than feared, overall airline-industry demand has looked tepid,"" Fitzgerald said.

The call to put on your calendar

Levi's and the tariff deadline: Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI) reports quarterly results on Thursday. Those results, and the conference call that executives will hold with analysts afterward, could offer more context on the aftermath of July 9, when a 90-day break from the steepest U.S. tariffs on other nations is set to end.

Analysts have said Levi's has enough levers to pull to offset most of the tariffs - including more leeway to keep prices higher - and noted that the company had gained popularity with younger shoppers as it tries to sell more clothing besides jeans. The U.S. last week announced a trade deal with Vietnam, where a lot of shoes and clothes get made. But some analysts say that deal likely sets the stage for more tariff hikes on other nations who also produce much of the apparel sold in the U.S.

During Levi's earnings call in April, executives said China accounted for around 1% of the goods that the company brought into the U.S., with some 5% from Mexico and ""mid-to-high single digits"" from Vietnam. They added that nations like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were also essential to its manufacturing.

The number to watch

Costco's monthly sales growth: Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) is set to release sales figures for the month of June on Wednesday. The membership warehouse chain typically puts out those results with little fanfare. But analysts will be watching for signs of growth, or lack thereof, as shoppers stay budget-conscious amid higher prices and worries about the economy.

Elsewhere, results during the week from packaged-foods company Conagra Brands Inc. (CAG) will provide an indirect look at consumer behavior in the grocery store.

A “Back to Starbucks” campaign has been implemented to both revitalize its image and convince stay-away customers to return, all the while a new competitor, China’s Luckin Coffee, has emerged on the scene, initially in New York.

Division within Starbucks over executives’ big-money incentives

Additionally, there is now division within Starbucks over the company’s decision to reward executives with up to $6 million in performance-based stock grants tied to the success of the “Back to Starbucks” turnaround plan. That includes a potential $113 million in his first year for new CEO Brian Niccol, a figure which encompasses a $75 million equity grant and $10 million in bonuses.

“These grants are designed to motivate and retain our senior leaders to deliver on the significant transformation required by our turnaround plan,” stated a document filed by Starbucks. “The grants are directly tied to the achievement of key components of the Back to Starbucks plan to encourage our senior leaders to achieve these goals as quickly as possible.”

Starbucks Workers United representatives have classed the multi-million-dollar incentives as “ridiculous and irresponsible” at a time when baristas are deeply unhappy with wage negotiations.

How much do Starbucks baristas earn?

Starbucks employees behind the counter earn an average of $19/hour, which works out at approximately $30/hour including benefits. In 2024, baristas earned a wage increase of 2-3%, compared to 3-5% in previous years. In April this year, the labor union rejected a company proposal guaranteeing an annual pay rise of 2%, citing it as insufficient.

“Starbucks cannot tell us that there is no money to put into a fair union contract for baristas when they paid Brian Niccol $96 million for 120 days of work in 2024 and have allocated millions upon millions for a glitzy manager conference and C-Suite bonuses,” Jasmine Leli, a barista in Buffalo, New York, told Fortune. “‘Back to Starbucks’ will only succeed when baristas can thrive—and the first step is finalizing fair union contracts that lock in the staffing, hours, and protections we need to do our jobs.”

Separate dispute over Starbucks dress code

The saga represents another divide between the company’s top management and shop-floor staff. In May, 2,000 baristas went on strike across the United States in protest at the chain’s new dress code, which they believe does nothing to improve the customer experience.

“It would be more productive if the union would put the same effort into coming back to the table that they’re putting into protesting wearing black shirts to work,” came Starbucks’ cutting response in a statement.

These enhancements are part of CEO Brian Niccol’s “Back to Starbucks” initiative, which aims to create a more inviting atmosphere that encourages customers to spend more time in the stores. The redesigns, which have begun in New York and Southern California, include cozy seating, warmer lighting, and unique wall art that reflects the local culture and history of each location.

The first remodeled locations, such as the one in Bridgehampton, New York, feature dark, Starbucks-themed green walls and hardwood floors, creating a distinct and welcoming environment.

These changes are designed to give each store a unique feel, making them more appealing to customers who want to linger and enjoy their coffee in a comfortable setting.

In addition to the physical changes, Starbucks is also implementing new policies to enhance the customer experience. For instance, the company is offering ceramic mugs for some in-house orders and bringing back the condiment bar, allowing customers to add their own milk and sugar to their drinks. Baristas are also being instructed to warmly acknowledge customers, further fostering a sense of welcome and hospitality.

The company has also made strategic changes to improve efficiency. This includes streamlining its extensive food and drink menu, reducing options for drink customizations, and implementing a new order sequencing algorithm. This algorithm, piloted during the first quarter, has helped reduce wait times, with three-quarters of orders at test locations arriving in under four minutes during peak hours.

In today’s increasingly complex global economy, supply chains—whether in the auto, electronics or pharmaceutical industries, among others—are more vulnerable than ever. Disruptions due to trade wars, geopolitical conflicts, environmental crises, or unforeseen economic downturns can send ripples through industries, impacting production timelines, cost structures, and overall business continuity.

The global automotive industry’s semiconductor shortage from 2020 to 2022 due to COVID-19 highlights the vulnerability of modern supply chains. It’s been estimated that the disruption resulted in $210 billion in lost revenue1 and 9.5 million fewer vehicles produced2. Such disruptions often trigger cascading delays beyond Tier 1 suppliers, exposing critical gaps in visibility and impeding efforts to anticipate risks or act strategically.

The Problem: Fragmented Supply Chain Data

Large companies often rely on thousands of suppliers, each connected to its own network of downstream vendors. A persistent challenge in supply chain management is the lack of visibility into these extended tiers. Traditional methods, such as interviews and basic analytics, have proven insufficient for gathering meaningful supplier data.

Most stakeholders across the supply chain, whether manufacturers, suppliers, logistics providers, and retailers, operate in silos and are often reluctant to share information due to competitive, technological, or compliance-related concerns. As a result, procurement teams struggle to anticipate disruptions, manage cost fluctuations, and identify alternative sources.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a breakthrough by learning from patterns in interconnected trade and transactional data. Rather than requiring direct access to proprietary data, GNNs infer hidden relationships and dependencies across the supply chain, enabling deeper insight and more proactive decision-making.

Mapping Supplier Relationships with Graph Neural Networks

At their core, GNNs are advanced machine learning models designed to analyze complex relationships within interconnected data. Unlike traditional models that focus on linear connections, GNNs can capture intricate interdependencies between different entities in a supply chain.

Imagine supply chain data as a massive, interconnected web. Each node represents a stakeholder—supplier, product, or material. GNNs continuously learn from these relationships to uncover hidden patterns, predict risks, and optimize procurement decisions.

While traditional analytics isolate pieces of information, GNNs create a holistic view of the supply chain, enabling businesses to see beyond direct suppliers and gain insights into the deeper layers of their supplier networks.

Real-World Benefits of GNNs in Supply Chains

GNN-based analytics allow businesses to predict and respond to disruptions proactively rather than reactively. Practical applications include:

Identifying Supplier Dependencies:

Many companies unknowingly source materials from the same bottleneck supplier. GNN models can reveal these overlapping dependencies, enabling diversification and reducing risk.

Anticipating Risks and Delays:

If a key supplier faces a strike or financial instability, GNNs can analyze transactional data to forecast the impact on production. Managers can then adjust strategies to mitigate costly delays.

Optimizing Procurement Costs:

GNNs compare pricing across suppliers by combining internal procurement records with publicly available trade data, revealing cost-saving opportunities.

Enhancing Competitor Intelligence:

By analyzing trade records, GNNs can infer competitor sourcing strategies, offering strategic insights to refine your own supply chain positioning.

To tackle these challenges, we at Hitachi R&D are developing a transformative GNN solution that delivers unparalleled visibility, predictive capability, and strategic insight.

Hitachi’s GNN-based Supply Chain Solution

Hitachi’s GNN-based supply chain management platform offers significant competitive advantages. It integrates internal company data from ERP and EDI systems with external data on global trade flows, ESG performance, and geopolitical risk. This fusion enables unprecedented visibility into multi-tier supply chains.

Our proprietary enhancements further illuminate deep-tier supplier networks, improving accuracy in bill-of-material estimation and enabling proactive procurement and risk management.

Validating Hitachi’s GNN Solution

Our GNN solution has been validated within the Hitachi Group across diverse sectors, including industrial manufacturing, mobility solutions, energy systems, consumer products, healthcare, and infrastructure.

In one case study, a procurement division initially attempted to improve visibility by manually interviewing suppliers—achieving just 20% visibility. After deploying a GNN-based solution, visibility surged to 70%, dramatically enhancing strategic decision-making.

Key Factors for Successful GNN Adoption

To fully unlock the value of GNN-based supply chain analytics, organizations must address several critical success factors:

A Robust Data Strategy

The accuracy of AI models depends on comprehensive data inputs—from internal procurement systems to public trade databases and supplier registries.

Empowered Procurement Teams

Leadership must recognize procurement as a strategic function and invest in tools and training. Teams need advanced analytics platforms and support to act on insights effectively.

A Commitment to Digital Transformation

Embracing AI requires cultural change. Organizations must shift from traditional approaches toward a data-driven operating model.

The Future of Supply Chain Resilience with AI

Looking ahead, integrating GNNs with multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs)—capable of processing text, images, and voice—will unlock even deeper insights. Satellite imagery of logistics hubs, video-based factory inspections, and voice data from supplier interactions can all enhance situational awareness.

Beyond procurement efficiency, GNN-powered analytics can help organizations meet broader goals. For instance, businesses aiming to reduce their carbon footprint can use supply chain visibility to monitor emissions and optimize logistics for sustainability—initiatives well aligned with Hitachi’s values.

The Crispy Chicken Tacos are effectively a dupe of the McDonald's Snack Wrap and cost only $2.79.","ONLY days remain before the McDonald's Snack Wrap officially returns at 13,657 restaurants nationwide.

The fast food chain's discontinued and beloved menu item had gained a serious following in recent years.

It was officially axed for US customers in 2016, but some franchisees maintained them until the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

McDonald's USA president Joe Erlinger noted that not long afterward, he received consistent pleas from customers to bring the Snack Wrap back.

""I get so many emails into my inbox about this product,"" he told ABC News in an interview.

Erlinger said the Snack Wrap gained a ""cult following,"" which was part of the company's decision to sell it again in 2025, along with ""competitive reasons.""

Only last month did McDonald's finally reveal the official return date of the Snack Wrap to be July 10, 2025 in a lengthy post on X.

It had been teased since December, with employee leaks and controversy about the inclusion of McCrispy Strips, which were tested last summer and officially rolled out in May.

Some customers had mixed feelings because the Snack Wrap used to be offered in a crispy and grilled variation, but it seems only the crispy option will remain.

""Snack Wraps come with either Ranch or Spicy Pepper Sauce, shredded lettuce & a shredded blend of mild Cheddar & Monterey Jack cheese on a flour tortilla, topped with a McCrispy Strip,"" a staff memo obtained by The US Sun confirmed.

There's been no indication that a grilled Snack Wrap will be offered.

That may cause some consumers to opt for the competing wrap offerings accessible through at least four other chains.

COMPETING OFFERS

Popeyes, for example, has launched a Chicken Wrap on its menu to give McDonald's a run for its money.

They were available starting June 2, and include flavors inspired by the brand's biscuits, along with a crispy chicken strip in the middle, lettuce, pickles and a choice of classic, spicy, or Honey Mustard spreads.

The Chicken Wrap at Popeyes costs $3.99.

For only $3 each, consumers can also get wraps at Jack in the Box.

They include the Spicy Crispy Jack Wrap, Classic Crispy Jack Wrap, and Classic Grilled Jack Wrap.

Jack in the Box noted in a news release in January that the wraps offer a ""symphony of textures and tastes.""

TACO BELL'S TAKE

Taco Bell even entered the chicken snack wrap battle on June 17 with Crispy Chicken Tacos, Burritos, and Strips.

The Crispy Chicken Tacos are effectively a dupe of the McDonald's Snack Wrap and cost only $2.79.

It was dubbed a ""harmonious combination of one perfectly crisped Crispy Chicken Strip layered with purple cabbage, crisp lettuce, pico de gallo and shredded cheese,"" in a release from the chain.

Customers can also top it with new Spicy Ranchero Sauce or Avocado Ranch Sauce.

Wendy's has also offered the Grilled Chicken Ranch Wrap since the spring of 2023.

It includes diced grilled chicken, romaine lettuce, cheddar cheese, and ranch dressing in a warm tortilla.

McDonald's has its work cut out to stay on top.

HPE recently tanked its own stock by failing to spot an error in the way it priced its inventory. Both companies have been silent on negotiations between them but clues as to what Elliott wants from HPE are hiding in plain sight.

It was first publicly reported in April that the activist investor group Elliott Management had taken a $1.5 billion stake in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and since then there has been nothing but complete silence on the issue from both companies.

The investment—known to be a long position as opposed to a short bet against the company—is an acute one for HPE and its CEO, Antonio Neri. Fourteen chief executives have been forced out of their jobs after Elliott took a stake in their companies and demanded talks with their boards, according to Reuters.

Is Neri’s neck on the chopping block?

Fortune asked both companies for comment, but neither wanted to talk on the record about what is going on between them. HPE (No. 143 on the Fortune 500) provided a brief statement that said “we value the constructive input of all of our shareholders” but declined to go into specifics.

However, sources who talked to Fortune pointed to several clues, hiding in plain sight, about what Elliott potentially wants from HPE.

Pricing screwup

The most obvious sign of trouble occurred when HPE published its Q1 earnings in March, which tanked its stock by nearly 16% on the day. Neri gave an interview on CNBC in which he admitted that the company had made a mistake in accounting for the cost of its inventory, which hurt the profitability of the company.

“Near the end of the quarter, we realized that the cost of our inventory was slightly higher than the cost that we had in the pricing. That’s on us. That should never happen,” Neri said.

That was an understatement. The screwup wiped more than $3 billion off HPE’s market cap.

Underperforming stock

It also drew attention to HPE’s share price.

On the day the news broke that Elliott wanted influence over the company, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee and his team published a research note that said Elliott was probably “1) addressing the discount at which the shares of HPE trade on a standalone basis relative to peers; and 2) improving execution and efficiencies to better align with best-in-class peers, like Dell and Cisco.”

Chatterjee also published a brutal table comparing the performance numbers of HPE against Dell, Cisco and NetApp. It showed that HPE generated only $494,000 per employee in revenue while Dell generated $885,000:

HPE stock popped upward recently after the Department of Justice dropped an investigation into its proposed acquisition of Juniper Networks. But still, since 2018, HPE stock has risen 48% to just above $21 per share. The S&P 500, meanwhile, rose 135%. That’s a dismal performance for a tech company that ought to be benefiting mightily from the mania around AI.

Elliott prefers to avoid proxy battles

Neri has been CEO for seven years. Meanwhile, six of HPE’s 12 board members have been there for 10 years or more. The chairman of the board, Patricia F. Russo, has been there since 2015. The implication is that it might be time for new blood.

But ousting Neri may not be Elliott’s plan.

Another option would be for HPE to give Elliott a seat on the board and to agree on a strategy to turn the company around. In one of Elliott’s other adventures, its assault on the oil refinery company Phillips 66, the investment fund made a plea to shareholders that showed that it actually prefers to reach a mutal agreement with a company rather than escalate to all-out civil war via a shareholder proxy vote.

“Over the last 15 years, we have collaborated with more than 200 companies to reach mutually beneficial solutions that enhance shareholder value. During this period, we have only had to pursue a U.S. proxy contest to this stage of the process three other times, making Phillips 66 an extreme outlier,” Elliott said at the time.

While it is not clear what, exactly, is going on between HPE and Elliott, it is likely that the board is in talks with its new stakeholder.

HPE told Fortune it welcomed the move: “HPE and our Board maintain an ongoing dialogue with our shareholders on a range of issues. While we do not comment on specific communications that we may have with any our shareholders, we value the constructive input of all of our shareholders and all of our other stakeholders.”

Another recall involves BowFlex 552 adjustable dumbbells. The manufacturer, Johnson Health Tech Trading, issued a voluntary recall after reports that the weight plates could fall off during use. Customers are being told to stop using the product and return it to Costco for a full refund.

Anker has also recalled some of its Model A1257 power banks due to concerns about battery safety. While the company says the risk is low, it’s offering replacements for customers who provide proof of purchase.

In a separate notice, Michelin recalled specific Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires in size 185/60R15C. The tires may not meet safety standards, and there’s a risk the tread rubber could detach, which increases the chance of a crash.

Cashew allergies rank among the most common tree nut allergies, affecting millions of Americans.
This fortunate outcome likely reflects the fact that cashew allergies, while serious, don’t affect the majority of the population.
Growing pattern of food safety failures This chocolate almond recall represents just one example of an increasingly troubling trend in American food safety.
This represents a doubling of foodborne illness cases compared to 2023, indicating a significant deterioration in food safety standards.","A chocolate almond recall that began quietly in June has now reached dangerous new heights, with federal officials upgrading the risk level due to potentially life-threatening contamination concerns.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has elevated the recall of Frederik’s Dark Chocolate Almonds to a Class II designation, marking the second-highest risk level possible for food safety violations. This escalation comes after discovering that the chocolate-covered treats may contain undeclared cashews, creating a hidden danger for anyone with cashew allergies.

The recall initially affected customers at Meijer grocery stores across six states, but the recent upgrade signals that authorities now consider the contamination risk more serious than previously assessed. For individuals with severe cashew allergies, consuming these mislabeled products could trigger anaphylactic shock, a medical emergency that can prove fatal without immediate treatment.

The hidden allergen threat

8-count, 1.5-ounce multi-pack boxes with a sell-by date of 05/05/2026

The contamination occurred when dark chocolate cashews somehow mixed with the almond products during manufacturing or packaging. While this might seem like a minor mix-up, the consequences for allergic consumers could be severe.

Cashew allergies rank among the most common tree nut allergies, affecting millions of Americans. Even trace amounts of cashew protein can trigger reactions ranging from mild hives to full-blown anaphylaxis. The fact that these nuts weren’t declared on the packaging means consumers had no way to identify the potential danger.

The FDA‘s Class II designation indicates that exposure to this contaminated product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences. However, the classification also acknowledges that while the probability of serious adverse health consequences remains relatively low, the risk still exists.

Multi-state distribution creates widespread concern

The recalled chocolate almonds reached consumers across six states through Meijer’s extensive retail network. Stores in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, and Wisconsin all carried the potentially contaminated products, affecting thousands of households in the Midwest region.

Meijer has been actively working with customers to identify and remove the products from circulation. The company is offering full refunds to anyone who purchased the affected items, regardless of whether they still have a receipt. This customer-focused approach demonstrates the seriousness with which the retailer is treating the contamination issue.

Despite the widespread distribution, no illnesses have been reported in connection with these products. This fortunate outcome likely reflects the fact that cashew allergies, while serious, don’t affect the majority of the population. However, food safety experts emphasize that the absence of reported illnesses doesn’t diminish the potential severity of the contamination.

Growing pattern of food safety failures

This chocolate almond recall represents just one example of an increasingly troubling trend in American food safety. The past two years have witnessed an unprecedented surge in food recalls, with 2024 alone generating approximately 300 separate recall actions.

Recent weeks have brought additional concerning developments in food safety. Kraft Heinz Foods Company recently recalled 367,812 pounds of fully cooked turkey bacon after laboratory testing revealed potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, a dangerous bacteria that can cause serious illness and death.

Listeria contamination poses particular risks because the bacteria can survive and even multiply in refrigerated conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies listeria as the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the United States, claiming approximately 260 lives annually.

The severity of listeria contamination was further highlighted when the FDA elevated a separate recall to Class I status, the highest risk level possible. Alma Pak International’s organic blueberries tested positive for the same dangerous bacteria, prompting the most serious recall classification.

Record-breaking illness numbers

According to a comprehensive report from the Public Interest Research Group, the 2024 food recalls have been linked to nearly 1,400 illnesses nationwide. This represents a doubling of foodborne illness cases compared to 2023, indicating a significant deterioration in food safety standards.

The human cost of these safety failures extends beyond simple illness statistics. Of the 1,400 people who became sick from contaminated food products, 487 required hospitalization for their conditions. Even more tragically, 19 people lost their lives due to foodborne illnesses in 2024.

While these numbers remain relatively small when considered against the entire U.S. population, the dramatic increase from the previous year raises serious questions about the effectiveness of current food safety oversight. The doubling of both hospitalizations and deaths suggests that contamination incidents are becoming more severe, not just more frequent.

Consumer protection steps

Food safety experts recommend several steps consumers can take to protect themselves from contaminated products. First, regularly check FDA recall announcements and sign up for recall alerts from manufacturers of frequently purchased products.

When preparing and consuming food, always read ingredient labels carefully, especially if you or family members have known allergies. Cross-contamination can occur at any point in the supply chain, making vigilance essential for allergic individuals.

If you discover that you’ve purchased a recalled product, stop consuming it immediately and follow the manufacturer’s return instructions. Don’t attempt to remove potentially contaminated portions or wash the product, as this may not eliminate the hazard.

The Frederik’s Dark Chocolate Almonds recall serves as a reminder that even seemingly minor manufacturing errors can create serious health risks. As food safety challenges continue to mount, consumers must remain vigilant and responsive to recall announcements to protect themselves and their families from potentially dangerous products.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2232119695-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 12:12:20.542094

Corporate Resilience: Can firms offset tariff costs without sacrificing margins or growth?
Actionable Insights for Investors Delta: Buy dips if earnings beat expectations, but avoid if margins disappoint.
The July 10 reports are a litmus test for corporate adaptability in an era of trade wars and weak demand.","As the July 10 earnings season approaches, investors will scrutinize three major companies—Delta Air Lines (DAL), Conagra Brands (CAG), and Levi Strauss (LEVI)—to gauge their resilience in the face of escalating trade tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. These firms, spanning aviation, consumer goods, and apparel, are emblematic of the broader struggle to mitigate tariff-driven costs while maintaining growth. Their results will serve as critical signals for sector rotations, Federal Reserve policy expectations, and the durability of corporate balance sheets.

Delta Air Lines: Rerouting Risk, Reaping Rewards

Delta's earnings (EPS estimate: $2.02) will hinge on its ingenuity in sidestepping tariffs. The airline's strategic rerouting of Airbus deliveries—diverting planes to Tokyo before introducing them into U.S. service—has averted $100+ million in potential tariffs. This tactic, which classifies aircraft as “used” imports, exemplifies corporate creativity in a protectionist climate.

Despite strong Q1 results (2% revenue growth, $240M net profit), Delta faces headwinds: weak corporate travel demand and rising fuel costs. Its operational flexibility—prioritizing high-margin routes and cutting capacity in lagging markets—will be key. A beat could validate its defensive stance, while a miss might amplify recession fears. Investors should watch for margin sustainability and Atlantic region recovery.

Conagra Brands: Navigating Inflation with a Pinch of Salt

Conagra's Q2 results (EPS guidance: $0.48–$0.53) reflect the harsh reality of tariff-driven cost inflation. The company's reliance on steel for canned goods and commodities like soybeans has left it exposed to U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. While 75% of domestic tin plate steel production has vanished, Conagra is sourcing globally—a costly but necessary move.

The company's “surgical” price hikes on select products and focus on pantry staples (microwave popcorn, frozen meals) have stabilized demand amid rising grocery prices. However, its Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) and 5.2% Q3 organic sales decline underscore execution risks. Investors should weigh its 3.7% dividend yield and free cash flow resilience against lingering margin pressures. A positive surprise could signal broader consumer resilience, while a miss may intensify calls for Fed easing.

Levi Strauss: Global Diversification as a Shield

Levi's earnings (EPS estimate: $0.13) will test its supply chain agility in the face of tariffs. With sourcing spread across 30 countries (no single nation >30% exposure), the company has minimized direct tariff impacts. Less than 1% of U.S. sales come from China, while Mexico and Vietnam account for mid-single-digit shares.

Strong DTC sales (9% growth) and brand equity in premium denim have buoyed results. Yet, currency headwinds and potential retaliatory tariffs loom. Levi's $1.2B liquidity and focus on e-commerce (16% organic growth) position it well for recovery, but investors must monitor macro risks like a U.S. recession. A beat could reignite investor interest in consumer discretionary stocks.

Broader Market Implications

These earnings will illuminate two critical themes:

1. Corporate Resilience: Can firms offset tariff costs without sacrificing margins or growth? Delta's rerouting and Conagra's pricing experiments offer contrasting models.

2. Fed Policy Crossroads: Positive results could signal cooling inflation (easing rate hike concerns), while misses might force the Fed to stay hawkish.

Investors should also note sector bifurcation:

- Delta's leisure travel strength vs. Conagra's pantry staple demand reflects households prioritizing experiences over discretionary goods.

- Levi's global diversification highlights the premium placed on supply chain flexibility.

Actionable Insights for Investors

Delta: Buy dips if earnings beat expectations, but avoid if margins disappoint. Monitor business travel metrics.

Conagra: Wait for input cost easing before entering. The dividend yield offers downside protection.

Levi: Accumulate on weakness ahead of earnings. Its brand resilience and EBIT margin expansion (70–90 bps) justify a long-term view.

The July 10 reports are a litmus test for corporate adaptability in an era of trade wars and weak demand. Companies that balance cost discipline with strategic innovation—like Delta's rerouting or Levi's global sourcing—will emerge stronger. Investors should favor those with defensive balance sheets and diversified revenue streams, while remaining vigilant to macro risks. The path ahead is bumpy, but these earnings could redefine the landscape for months to come.",,N,,2025-07-06 11:05:07.477404

This is because the Nigerian firm is now the processor of PAPSS co-branded cards under the recently launched PAPSSCARD, the first Pan-African card scheme, enabling banks and deposit-taking institutions to use the services of UP to issue PAPSS co-branded cards and also accept the cards at their outlets, including Automated Teller Machines (ATM) and merchant locations.

Also, United Payments has been appointed as the acquirer of PAPSSCARD for co-branded cards, allowing merchants who are customers of UP to welcome PAPSS co-branded cards as a means of payment for their goods and services.

Furthermore, United Payments is the switch for instant payments across Africa on the PAPSS network. This enables customers of banks and deposit-taking institutions who are clients of UP to send and receive instant payments across Africa

In demonstration of UP’s cross-enterprise alliances and capabilities, United Payments will be the first entity in Nigeria to enable merchants to accept co-branded cards under the PAPSSCARD scheme as means of payment for goods and services at merchants’ locations. This is in addition to enabling instant cross border transaction/fund transfers across Africa.

The company will also accept PAPSSCARD across its networks under the terms of the partnership agreement.

Why is this litter problem concerning?
Plastic packaging is particularly dangerous to both land and marine life because it can be mistaken for food.
McDonald's released a statement in response to the littering problem, noting that restaurant staff do daily litter cleanups in neighborhoods surrounding their restaurants.","A councilor in the Greater Manchester area in England is calling upon McDonald's and Starbucks to take responsibility for the litter problem in local waterways, reported the Manchester Evening News.

What's happening?

Jonathan Moore called out the two food chains specifically because of rampant packaging blowing into Salford Quays from nearby locations.

""The litter problem generally increased significantly after McDonald's opened, and of course you can identify McDonald's because it's all branded,"" he said, per MEN.

The Salford Quays councilor explained that if a company helps cause the problem, they should also help fix it. He continued: ""The more broader issue of the stuff that's still on the land that anybody could pick up, absolutely, they should be contributing to that, because unless they send a team of people out every day, covering quite a large area, which clearly they are not, then somebody else has to do it.""

Why is this litter problem concerning?

A 2017 study found that 80% of marine trash is food and beverage packaging. Even in areas not near rivers or oceans, litter can blow into storm drains and enter waterways.

Plastic packaging is particularly dangerous to both land and marine life because it can be mistaken for food. If ingested, it can cause health problems or death for animals, as it doesn't break down in their stomachs.

McDonald's in other countries has made environmentally savvy swaps, and recent data has reflected a growing market for recyclable alternatives to single-use plastic. However, these efforts need to be scaled meaningfully, not just swapping one single-use plastic lid for a plastic cup as McDonald's has done in recent years.

Starbucks has also made forward progress with its sustainability, but the company still has major room for improvement.

Beyond the environmental impact, research has found a negative connection between dilapidated urban areas and mental health. In areas with excess trash, abandoned buildings, and graffiti, for example, one study noted children under 17 were found to be more prone to anxiety and depression.

While studies haven't arrived at a definitive conclusion on whether clearing trash can improve community mental health, research has shown that an increase in green spaces in urban areas correlates with happier residents.

What's being done about litter in Salford Quays?

The local council has a property team that cleans up trash by hand and by boat on a monthly basis, but the volume of litter requires a more hands-on approach than they can reasonably afford.

McDonald's released a statement in response to the littering problem, noting that restaurant staff do daily litter cleanups in neighborhoods surrounding their restaurants. However, it conceded that working with locals could help improve the impact of these efforts.

""We plan to work with the local Salford council to identify any litter hot spots surrounding the restaurant, which we will look to include in our litter patrols wherever possible,"" it said.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Salford-Quaysimage-reckVB4DqiEQzsFVS.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 09:02:23.642467

Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides.
The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.
Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.
“If we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,” Arnault said.","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Union expects to find out on Monday whether President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on America’s largest trade partner in a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.

Expressing displeasure the EU's stance in trade talks, however, Trump said he would increase the tariff rate for European exports to 50%, which could make everything — from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals — much more expensive in the U.S.

The EU's executive commission, which handles trade issues for the bloc's 27-member nations, said its leaders hope to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN's “State of the Union” program on Sunday that “the EU was very slow in coming to the table” but that talks were now making ""very good progress.”

Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union.

US-EU trade is enormous

The EU's executive commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as ""the most important commercial relationship in the world.”

The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.

The biggest U.S. export to Europe is crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment.

Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.

EU sells more to the US than vice versa

Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around.

However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.

The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.

What are the issues dividing the two sides?

Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.

But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.

Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.

Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations.

“On the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. “They cannot change the way they run the EU’s vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.”

'Consequence for many companies'

Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.

Mercedes-Benz dealers in the U.S. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices “until further notice.” The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo “significant increases” in coming years.

Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.

Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.

France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company’s annual meeting in April.

Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.

“If we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,” Arnault said. “And if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.”

'Road could be rocky'

Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail.

Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.

Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday’s deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.

The most likely outcome of the trade talks is that “the U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of ‘retaliatory’ tariffs well beyond 10%,” Schmieding said. “However, the road to get there could be rocky.”

The U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.

“While Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a ‘win’ for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,” Schmieding said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CA8Zz_zJ8xvb0sOcsp.YcA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap_finance_articles_694/aefa321128f6cb1708887bb43ead69d7,N,,2025-07-06 12:12:30.060136

Embracing its move as a late mover, Albertsons is turning timing into a strategic advantage. The retail giant is reimagining the future of digital retail from its Bengaluru global capability centre (GCC) to build smarter and more agile solutions. ""Our goal is not to catch up; it's about figuring out how to build for the future,"" said Anuj Dhanda, EVP - chief information and transformation officer at Albertsons Companies.

""There's a certain late-mover advantage—we're now able to design solutions with AI and data science at the core, rather than as an afterthought. Many capabilities that once required heavy coding can now be built with little to no code, dramatically increasing speed and agility. That's why we're so excited about our presence in Bengaluru and the incredible talent here driving this transformation."" Albertsons has over 2,200 stores, and some of its banners include Safeway, Vons, Acme, Tom Thumb, Randalls, United Supermarkets, Haggen, Carrs, Kings Food Markets, and Balducci's Food Lover's Market.

Dhanda said the US retail giant is aiming for a technology refresh. ""We need a technology 2.0, with significant shifts underway—that's where Bengaluru and the GCC come in. For success, we realised we need much greater velocity and agility, and to build far more of our own IP than we do today. Our goal is to change the way we work in technology. We've integrated product, data, and full-stack engineers into fully functional, global teams to enable seamless collaboration. We're applying AI and automation across the entire tech stack—not just in software development, but from requirements gathering to infrastructure and observability.""

Many GCCs are increasingly relocating tech roles to India, signalling growing confidence in shifting solution ownership. ""My intent is to have several of my direct reports to be based here. If we consider the leadership group—around 17 to 18 vice-presidents and above—the goal is for at least a third of them to be in Bengaluru within the next 18 months,"" Dhanda said.

He also said that the insourcing mix will shift dramatically, reducing reliance on external IT providers. ""We developed numerous digital systems, including pharmacy and health capabilities, and upgraded our financial systems. Going forward, our investment will move from foundational upgrades to development-driven initiatives. While we currently depend heavily on third parties like TCS, Cognizant, and Sapient for resources, we plan to bring much of that work inhouse, empowering our own associates. Our focus is to reduce third-party dependence and build stronger internal teams.""

Lalit Ahuja, founder of full-stack GCC firm ANSR, said Albertsons is leveraging the late-mover advantage—not late to the party, but arriving at the perfect time to capitalise on a mature market. For retailers, the landscape is defined by thin margins, highly perishable inventory, and intense tech-driven competition—with e-commerce playing an increasingly vital role. ""Some companies struggle because tech centres are set up suboptimally. But there are firms which are set up with sharper tech differentiation. We're witnessing significant maturity in the types of roles being introduced, driving modernisation of its tech stack. This includes mainstream adoption of new technologies and a stronger emphasis on product and functional ownership. And AI has become the greatest accelerator of efficiency,"" Ahuja said. Last year, Accenture picked up a significant minority stake in the Bengaluru and US-based ANSR, which set up over 170 GCCs in India.

In 2025, its strategic menu expansion—highlighted by new sandwiches, reinvigorated breakfast items, and seasonal offerings—is proving pivotal in driving repeat visits, strengthening brand loyalty, and countering economic headwinds. This article explores how these initiatives position McDonald's as a resilient leader, supported by data on sales trends, customer demographics, and global scalability, while addressing risks that investors must monitor.

The Power of Product Innovation

McDonald's recent menu additions are designed to cater to diverse tastes and price points, ensuring broad appeal. Key launches include:

- McCrispy Strips: A permanent item since early 2025, now in 70+ markets, with plans to expand globally. These crispy chicken strips target the growing demand for chicken-centric meals, directly competing with rivals like Chick-fil-A.

- McValue Platform: A low-cost menu (e.g., $5 Meal Deals) aimed at low- and middle-income consumers, addressing inflation-driven spending constraints. This strategy has helped stabilize traffic among budget-conscious groups, which saw double-digit declines in Q1 2025.

- Seasonal Offerings: Limited-time items like the Chicken Big Mac and collaborations (e.g., Minecraft movie tie-ins) create urgency and excitement, spurring repeat visits. Analysts note that such promotions boosted March–April 2025 sales, hinting at a Q2 recovery.

Data shows a Q1 2025 dip (-3.6%) followed by a Q2 rebound, driven by value initiatives and seasonal campaigns.

Customer Engagement: Beyond the Meal

McDonald's success hinges on its ability to engage key demographics:

1. Low-Income Consumers: The McValue platform has been critical in retaining this segment. By offering everyday affordability, McDonald's mitigates the threat of competitors like Popeyes or Wendy's, which have gained traction with lower prices.

2. Families and Young Adults: Limited-time items and tech-driven convenience (e.g., mobile ordering) attract these groups. The MyMcDonald's Rewards program, with 175 million users, incentivizes repeat visits through rewards, contributing to 30% year-over-year growth in loyalty-linked sales.

3. Global Markets: McDonald's localizes menus to cater to regional tastes. For instance, the McAloo Tikki in India and Teriyaki Burger in Japan ensure relevance in emerging markets, driving 2% annual sales growth from international expansion.

Scalability and Margin Management

The strategy's global scalability is evident in McDonald's plans to open 2,200 new restaurants in 2025, with a focus on high-growth regions like China and Europe. However, margins face headwinds from rising input costs (e.g., wages up 5–6%, food costs climbing). To mitigate this:

- Cost Discipline: McDonald's is streamlining operations, such as simplifying beverage menus to reduce customization complexity.

- Bundling: Pairing beverages with food items maintains average check sizes while leveraging economies of scale.

Margins have held steady at ~26% despite inflation, aided by pricing power and cost controls.

Risks on the Horizon

While McDonald's strategy is robust, challenges remain:

1. Ingredient Volatility: Commodity prices for chicken and beef could pressure margins if sustained.

2. Competitive Threats: Rivals like Chick-fil-A and Wendy's are outpacing McDonald's in U.S. same-store sales growth (e.g., Wendy's 4.1% annual average).

3. Debt Burden: A debt-to-equity ratio of -13.5x (2024) reflects aggressive buybacks and dividends, raising questions about financial flexibility during downturns.

Investment Thesis: A Long-Term Play

Despite short-term risks, McDonald's remains a defensive investment for several reasons:

- Brand Resilience: Its global footprint and iconic status ensure steady demand even during economic uncertainty.

- Data-Driven Adaptation: Real-time sales analytics and loyalty program insights enable rapid menu adjustments to consumer trends.

- Dividend Stability: A 0.8% dividend yield, backed by $7.7B in annual free cash flow, offers downside protection.

Shares have outperformed the broader market since 2023, reflecting investor confidence in its strategy.

Conclusion

McDonald's 2025 menu expansion is more than a tactical move—it's a blueprint for sustained growth. By balancing affordability, innovation, and localization, the company is solidifying its position as the go-to fast-food option across demographics and geographies. While risks like input costs and competition linger, McDonald's scalability, cash flow, and brand strength justify a long-term buy for investors seeking steady returns in the consumer sector.

Investors should monitor Q2 2025 sales data for further validation of this strategy's efficacy.",,N,,2025-07-06 11:05:23.270321

2 MIN READ

Dubai: With the end of the Trump administration’s 90-day pause on “reciprocal” tariffs approaching July 9, the outlook for global trade remains deeply uncertain.

Despite anticipation surrounding the date, analysts from S&P Global Market Intelligence warn that uncertainty will likely persist through the remainder of 2025, regardless of the outcome of upcoming negotiations.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested that higher tariffs are imminent, citing the expiration of the temporary pause. However, experts anticipate a more nuanced outcome.

According to S&P Global, countries will likely be sorted into four categories based on their negotiation status with the US—ranging from those with provisional deals to those facing immediate tariff hikes.

“Reaching a provisional deal doesn’t guarantee lower tariffs,” said John Raines, Head of North America Economics & Country Risk at S&P Global Market Intelligence. “Deals could still result in tariffs higher than the current 10% baseline. Moreover, countries can shift categories over time, depending on how talks evolve.”

Unresolved negotiations

Provisional trade deals have been reached with China, the UK, and Vietnam. However, negotiations with the EU, Japan, and India remain unresolved, complicated by political tensions and ongoing U.S. national security reviews under Section 232.

The US administration has warned that countries failing to secure agreements will receive formal notices of new tariffs—potentially as high as 70%. Trump signed letters to 12 nations outlining these “take it or leave it” tariff offers, which are set to be sent on Monday.

Even countries currently exempt from immediate tariff increases face the ongoing threat of future hikes. Tariffs may be used as short-term leverage, lasting only weeks if shifting market conditions or diplomatic progress prompt the White House to reconsider.

If the US fails to finalize trade deals with certain nations by the July 9 deadline, country-specific tariffs will take effect after midnight, sharply increasing duties on billions of dollars’ worth of imports worldwide. Given the complexity of these negotiations, some experts believe the U.S. may extend the tariff pause for select countries to allow more time for talks.

Volatility to remain norm

The economic impact is already showing in forecasts. S&P projects core US inflation to climb to 3.7% in the second half of 2025, likely keeping the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates until at least December. That pause, combined with tighter financial conditions, is expected to slow economic growth and push unemployment up to 4.7% by mid-2026.

In a more pessimistic scenario, where tariffs are sharply raised under authorities like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the US economy could contract by 0.5% in the second half of this year, with unemployment potentially peaking at 6.1%.

President Trump has described tariffs as a tool to boost domestic manufacturing and shrink trade deficits. However, critics argue the costs ultimately fall on US importers and consumers, especially as average duties could jump from pre-Trump levels of around 3% to nearly 20% under proposed hikes.

Meanwhile, countries worldwide are scrambling to finalize trade frameworks before the deadline. The uncertain policy environment is complicating supply chain planning and investment decisions globally, as markets await the July 9 outcome—and whatever may come after.

While Trump's protectionist strategy may serve domestic political goals, the global ripple effects are only beginning to be felt. And if the past 90 days are any indication, volatility will remain the norm in U.S. trade policy.

For Costco (NASDAQ: COST), a company synonymous with membership-driven bulk retailing, recent product recalls have raised critical questions about its ability to manage supply chain risks and maintain customer confidence. With over 80 recalls reported in 2025 alone—spanning appliances, food, and automotive products—investors must assess whether these incidents signal systemic vulnerabilities or isolated hiccups. Here's how to evaluate the risks and opportunities.

The Recall Landscape: A Closer Look at 2025 Risks

Costco's 2025 recalls fall into two categories: non-food safety hazards and foodborne illness threats, each posing distinct risks to operations and reputation.

Non-Food Recalls: Operational Efficiency Under Scrutiny

Danby Air Conditioners: A design flaw causing mold growth in units sold between 2021–2022 highlights weaknesses in supplier quality control. The recall required immediate cessation of use, potentially straining customer relationships during peak summer months.

Michelin Tires: A federal safety violation (failure to meet FMVSS No. 139) underscores risks in automotive product sourcing. The recall demanded free replacements, adding logistical complexity and costs.

BowFlex Dumbbells: Over 3.8 million units recalled due to dislodging weight plates, with 111 reported injuries, raises liability concerns. This recall also reflects risks in fitness equipment partnerships.

Food Recalls: The High-Stakes Battle for Consumer Trust

Foodborne illness recalls strike directly at Costco's core value proposition: affordable, bulk-purchased essentials. Notable 2025 incidents include:- Kirkland Smoked Salmon: A Class I recall for Listeria contamination, affecting frozen products, could deter customers from high-margin private-label items.- Topo Chico Mineral Water: Contamination with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Texas/Louisiana stores highlights regional distribution risks. The recall coincided with a surge in bottled water demand due to droughts, amplifying reputational harm.- Fresh & Ready Sandwiches: Listeria scares in Arizona, California, and Nevada markets—key growth regions for Costco—risk alienating health-conscious shoppers.

The Financial Implications: Costs and Consumer Behavior

Recalls incur direct expenses (e.g., refunds, replacements) and indirect costs (e.g., lost sales, legal fees). For a company with $250 billion in revenue, the financial impact may be manageable, but the reputational toll is harder to quantify. Key metrics to watch:- Membership Renewal Rates: If customers perceive safety risks, renewal rates could decline, eroding Costco's $70/yr membership revenue stream.- Private Label Sales: 30% of Costco's revenue comes from Kirkland Signature products. A sustained trust crisis here could pressure margins.- Litigation Exposure: The BowFlex recall, with 111 injury reports, may lead to class-action lawsuits, diverting resources from growth initiatives.

Strategic Mitigation: How Costco is Responding

The company has followed standard recall protocols:1. Transparent Communication: Proactive updates on its recall portal and collaboration with regulators (e.g., FDA, CPSC).2. Customer Compensation: Full refunds/replacements reduce immediate backlash, though long-term trust requires consistency.3. Supplier Audits: Enhanced scrutiny of partners like Michelin and Danby to prevent repeat issues.

However, challenges remain. For example, the Anker power bank recall—attributed to a single manufacturer—suggests fragmented supply chains may still harbor risks. Investors should monitor Costco's supplier diversification efforts and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting.

Investment Considerations: Is This a Buying Opportunity?

Costco's stock has underperformed peers like Walmart (WMT) in 2025, down 8% year-to-date amid recall news and rising interest rates. However, the company's fortress balance sheet (net cash of $6 billion) and dominant membership model provide resilience. Here's how to position:

Buy Signal Triggers:- Recall Frequency Declines: If 2025 marks a peak in recalls, reduced incidents could alleviate investor fears.- Private Label Recovery: Strong sales rebound for Kirkland products post-recall would signal enduring brand loyalty.- Competitor Weakness: Rival retailer missteps (e.g., Target's inventory overhang) could amplify Costco's relative advantage.

Sell Signal Triggers:- Legal Penalties: Fines or settlements exceeding $100 million could strain cash flow.- Membership Declines: A 2% drop in renewal rates would signal broader trust issues.- Supply Chain Failures: Repeat recalls in the same categories (e.g., automotive or appliances) suggest systemic flaws.

Conclusion: A Test of Resilience

Costco's recalls are a litmus test for its operational rigor and customer-centric ethos. While the incidents pose near-term risks, the company's scale, pricing power, and loyal customer base remain formidable. Investors should take a long-term view: if Costco can stabilize its supply chain and restore confidence in its private label, the current volatility could present an entry point. But if recalls become a recurring theme, the retail giant may face a reckoning with both customers and shareholders.",,N,,2025-07-06 12:12:38.276359

Here's Why Retailers Want You to Eat Up.,Parija Kavilanz,,,,,https://www.investopedia.com/ikea-is-cutting-its-restaurant-prices-here-s-why-retailers-want-you-to-eat-up-11766764,"Do you go to Ikea for the food?
That will mean lower prices on things like Swedish meatballs, pancakes and salmon fillets at more than 50 stores across the country.
“They want shoppers to stay longer in the stores and malls and potentially buy more products.” Some retailers’ forays into food have scored them runaway hits.
Department stores historically aspired to become one-stop shopping destinations for urban populations, said Huseyn Abdulla, assistant professor with the department of supply chain management at the University of Tennessee’s Haslam College of Business.
“One of the pain points for a lot of consumers over the last couple of years has been food inflation and overall food prices,” said Hottovy.","Do you go to Ikea for the food? Then the company has good news for you.

The home-furnishings retailer recently said it would slash the price of its U.S. in-store menu by half from Monday through Friday, with kids eating for free during the week, starting in August. That will mean lower prices on things like Swedish meatballs, pancakes and salmon fillets at more than 50 stores across the country.

“We believe everyone should have access to delicious, nutritious meals without straining their budget,” said Lisa Ford, Ikea’s U.S. food commercial manager, in a statement to Investopedia.

Big retail chains that sell everything from bulk packs of shampoo, toilet paper and diapers to sofa sets, lamps, clothing and jewelry are looking to up their game when it comes to ready-to-eat meals—and managing prices in a bid to keep shoppers happy and fed.

A reputation for serving food worth eating can be good for business, industry experts say, making a shopping trip feel more like an experience. And when it’s done right, it can be a draw.

“Retailers are looking to drive more traffic into their locations,” said R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research with Placer.ai, which analyzes shopper foot-traffic patterns. “They want shoppers to stay longer in the stores and malls and potentially buy more products.”

Some retailers’ forays into food have scored them runaway hits. Costco’s $1.50 hot-dog-and-soda combo, which debuted in the 1980s, has become a staple for its devoted shoppers.

It’s not just bargain outlets that offer sustenance. You can enjoy breakfast—or lunch or afternoon tea—at Tiffany’s flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York City. One of the oldest examples of a retailer embracing in-store dining is the Walnut Room, which dates back to 1907 and is found on the 7th floor of Macy’s on Chicago’s State Street.

Department stores historically aspired to become one-stop shopping destinations for urban populations, said Huseyn Abdulla, assistant professor with the department of supply chain management at the University of Tennessee’s Haslam College of Business.

“But it was also a way to keep customers in the department store as long as possible with the intent of converting this traffic into more sales,” he said.

Ikea has served its meatballs to shoppers for about 40 years. It sells more than a billion of them worldwide a year, and the company says about a fifth of its shoppers go to its stores just to dine.

The draw, the company says, is the affordable menu, with an average meal—it sells breakfast, lunch and kids’ meals—costing an average of about $11 before the upcoming discounts, Ikea said.

“One of the pain points for a lot of consumers over the last couple of years has been food inflation and overall food prices,” said Hottovy. “Ikea probably is not going to be making a lot of profit on food but if it gets more people into stores and encourages them to buy something else from its stores, then it’s a smart move.”",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/GWZt1mqPmsL6ZNLzHfEC83HVAwE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/1750343008106-aca56512ff1643669414a673c263268d.jpg,N,,2025-07-06 07:01:28.478241

Mano is trying to join an investment group—or establish one—to compete for the rights.

As reported by ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, McDonald’s Global has begun searching for a buyer for the franchise after it took over operations in Israel following October 7th. One of the conditions set by McDonald’s Global is that the buyer or buyers group include an investor with sector expertise.

This is one of the most valuable and sought-after franchising rights in Israel, as McDonald’s is a global mega-brand and icon; the franchise is estimated to be worth about $200 million, with annual sales in Israel estimated at 1.7 billion shekels (about $509 million).

Mano owns Mano Maritime, which includes a cruise ship and cruise lines, as well as the Crowne Plaza Haifa hotel, several hotels in Europe, the luxury senior residence Avantgarde Residence in Haifa, and real estate throughout the country. In shipping, he owns passenger and cargo vessels, and is the agent in Israel for international shipping companies. His shipping business also includes catering on the cruise ship Crown Iris, which serves 1,800 passengers three meals a day in four onboard restaurants, along with food supply operations—similar to those in his hotels and nursing home.

The process of seeking a franchisee is being handled by a local representative on behalf of McDonald’s, who has approached well-known business figures in Israel, in parallel with direct approaches received by McDonald’s Global. Interested parties have signed confidentiality agreements. Among them: Ori Max, owner of Maxstock under Apax Partners; large real-estate and mall groups; and a group of McDonald’s executives who are exploring the formation of a consortium.

The company's recent struggles—declining digital sales, tariff-driven margin pressures, and regional headwinds—mask a deeper truth. Nike is undergoing a strategic overhaul that positions it to dominate the $1.5 trillion global active lifestyle market for decades. The key drivers? Digital innovation and supply chain resilience, two pillars of a long-term strategy that could deliver outsized returns for patient investors.

The Supply Chain Revolution: From Tariffs to Tech

Nike's supply chain reshaping is not just about avoiding tariffs. By shifting footwear production from China to Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico, the company is also embracing automation and cutting-edge technology. Factories in these regions now use robotics, AI-driven quality control, and 4D motion capture to optimize production. The result? A 42.7% gross margin—still outpacing rivals like Adidas—despite inflationary pressures.

While tariffs will continue to weigh on margins in the near term, Nike's geographic diversification and tech investments aim to mitigate costs by $1 billion annually by 2026. This resilience is critical as global consumers increasingly demand on-time delivery and high-quality products, traits that will define winners in the post-pandemic economy.

Digital Innovation: From Discounts to Desire

Nike's digital business—a once high-flying growth engine—has stumbled, with sales down 26% in fiscal 2025. But this decline isn't a failure; it's a recalibration. The company is shifting focus from clearance sales to premium, limited-edition drops, leveraging collaborations with athletes like A'ja Wilson and brands like Skims. These campaigns, which sell out in minutes, are less about volume and more about brand passion—a critical lever in an era where Gen Z and millennials prioritize exclusivity.

AI is now a linchpin of this strategy. By using machine learning to predict demand and design products, Nike aims to slash overstocking and boost margins. Imagine a world where every sneaker is tailored to a runner's gait or a basketball player's explosive moves—this is the future Nike is building.

The Active Lifestyle Market: Why Nike Wins Long-Term

The global shift toward active lifestyles isn't slowing. Urbanization, health consciousness, and the rise of hybrid work environments have made fitness apparel a must-have. Nike's “Sport Offense” strategy—focusing on running, basketball, and training—targets the fastest-growing segments of this market. Consider North America, where footwear sales dipped but apparel surged 34% in 2025. This trend isn't a blip; it reflects a broader move toward functional, tech-integrated clothing.

Even in challenging markets like China, where footwear sales fell 21% in Q4, Nike is doubling down. Partnerships with local platforms like JD.com and localized product lines (e.g., traditional-inspired designs) aim to reignite demand. The goal? To be the go-to brand for the 400 million Chinese consumers projected to embrace fitness by 2030.

The Financial Foundation: Cash, Cuts, and Conviction

Nike's balance sheet is its secret weapon. With $9.2 billion in cash and a $12 billion buyback program, the company can weather near-term turbulence while funding innovation. A $2 billion cost-cutting plan through 2027 targets logistics and overhead, aiming to stabilize operating margins at 10%.

Today, Nike trades at a forward P/E of 19x, well below its five-year average of 24x. Analysts at Guggenheim and BMO see this as a mispricing, pointing to the company's untapped brand equity and a pipeline of tech-driven products—from AI-designed shoes to subscription-based training programs.

The Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, Hold the Vision

Nike's near-term challenges—margin pressures, inventory management, and geopolitical risks—are real. But they're temporary. The company's moves to diversify its supply chain, retool its digital strategy, and double down on premium products align perfectly with secular trends: the rise of tech-integrated apparel, the global fitness boom, and the shift toward emotionally resonant brands.

For investors, this is a decade-long opportunity. A “buy-the-dip” stance at current prices, paired with a 3+ year hold, could capture the upside as Nike executes its strategy. Key catalysts include the rollout of AI-designed products, a recovery in Greater China, and the launch of its “Breaking Four” mile campaign with Faith Kipyegon—a masterclass in athlete storytelling.",,N,,2025-07-06 05:59:15.438967

There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas.
Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag.
But in December, a California judge found that E.l.f.
""The basic reality is we always put our E.l.f.","NEW YORK -- Fashion ""dupes,"" or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles.

In the latest example, Lululemon slapped a lawsuit against Costco last month, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel.

Across the retail industry, it's far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas.

It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in last month's complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have ""replicated or copied"" its apparel to sell cheaper offerings -- including those popularized online through hashtags like ""LululemonDupes"" on TikTok and other social media platforms.

For years, marketers have rolled out less expensive fashion and beauty alternatives for consumers to buy instead of pricey designer brands. Unlike more traditional counterfeits, which are illegal copies of the product that feature an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, ""pure"" dupes that resemble certain features of more expensive products are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items.

But the rising frenzy for dupes signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing.

Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item -- sold by Kamugo, which doesn't appear to have its own website -- was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a ""wirkin."" Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart's site selling similar totes.

Experts say some dupes move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly when a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original.

Look-alikes can also frustrate the targeted companies.

Following the viral fame of the ""wirkin,"" for example, Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said he was ""irritated"" and ""annoyed"" by the cheaper look-alikes.

""Making a copy like this is quite detestable,"" Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was ""quite touching"" to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style -- and that ""difference in quality"" was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Hermès.

Meanwhile, Benefit sued E.l.f. for trademark infringement over its $6 Lash 'N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit's $29 Roller Lash mascara. But in December, a California judge found that E.l.f.'s mascara didn't deceive shoppers and didn't infringe the trademarks and trade dress of Benefit's item.

That was the first lawsuit of its kind in E.l.f.'s 20-year-history, and the judge's decision was ""a resounding win for us,"" CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press.

Amin doesn't like to call his version dupes, referring to them as ""holy grails"" instead. ""The basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,"" he said. ""It's an E.l.f. product that's a much better value.""

In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had ""unlawfully traded"" on Lululemon's reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement ""directed to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.""

A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit.

The litigation could be more complicated because Lululemon also claims that customers know Costco uses manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't reveal that information. Due to this, Lululemon claims at least some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the ""original"" products.

Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several producings, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men's Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco's website showing the item priced at $19.97.

Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton back in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over supposed ""copycat products"" in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton.

Among the notable collaborations are the Management Apprentice Programme (MAP), Graduate Employability Programme (GEP) and Industrial Apprenticeship Programme (IP).

The programme is a collaborative co-curricular initiative with the Department of Skills Development (JPK) under the Human Resources Ministry, conducted through the National Dual Training System (SLDN). It supports the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) agenda by aiming to boost workforce development and strengthen industry relevance.

Successful graduates were presented with the Malaysian Skills Certificate (SKM) and Malaysian Skills Diploma (DKM).

Officiating the event was Deputy Rural and Regional Development Minister Datuk Rubiah Wang, who represented Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi.

The programme is designed to be practical and industry-focused, consisting of 70% hands-on training in McDonald’s outlets and 30% classroom-based theoretical learning.

McDonald’s Malaysia managing director and local operating partner Datuk Azmir Jaafar highlighted that the academy has trained over 5,000 graduates since its inception in 2018, with many hailing from underprivileged backgrounds, including B40 families, persons with disabilities (PwD), Orang Asli communities, and others who may not have had access to formal education.

“More than 80% of our graduates choose to build meaningful careers with us. Some of these youths have risen to become restaurant managers or even specialists at our corporate office, which makes it a powerful testament to what skills training and opportunity can do.

“This shows that McDonald’s Malaysia is not just offering jobs, but lifelong learning opportunities that can change lives,” said Azmir.

McDonald’s Malaysia fully funds each apprentice’s training, which includes a monthly allowance, housing, meals, insurance, medical coverage, Socso protection and EPF contributions. Total investment is RM40,000 per apprentice.

Graduates are not bound by any post-training employment contract, giving them the freedom to explore further opportunities should they wish.

Complementing the vocational apprentice programme is Hamburger U, an internal leadership and restaurant management training institution that offers advanced courses in administration, leadership and business management for current employees and university students in partnership with local universities.

Among the notable collaborations are the Management Apprentice Programme (MAP), Graduate Employability Programme (GEP) and Industrial Apprenticeship Programme (IP).

McDonald’s Malaysia has also partnered with local universities to offer degree pathways under the 3U1i model — three years of university study followed by one year of industrial training, with guaranteed employment upon graduation.

The success of the vocational apprentice programme aligns closely with national efforts to strengthen TVET as a mainstream career pathway and also demonstrates how corporate-private sector partnerships can drive talent development and long-term economic impact.

Among the award recipients was Muhammad Hfiy Haikal Ruslan, 18, who said the programme benefitted him as he has a strong interest in the food and beverage (F&B) industry.

“I learnt discipline, leadership and team collaboration at the academy, which will help me when I take my career further,” he said, expressing gratitude for the opportunity given by McDonald’s to be part of the programme.

Hfiy also recounted being involved in a serious accident that left him in a coma for a month. Despite the physical and emotional challenges of recovery, he pushed through and returned to complete his training. His perseverance earned him the Outstanding Apprentice Award (Theory).

Another award recipient was Raidi Hamizan Rozki, 18, who received the Overall Outstanding Apprentice Award.

“I attended a talk regarding the programme and was amazed by it, and my mother was very encouraging, which is why I decided to join.”

Raidi, who loves to cook, made his parents proud while his siblings’ eyes welled with pride as he walked toward them.

Now a crew leader at a McDonald’s outlet, he hopes to pursue a diploma in halal industry management and eventually return to the programme as an educator.

“I would like to be the one teaching students one day and help them to excel and succeed, just as I did.”

Despite the learning challenges that come with autism, Nur Farrah Adibah Razali, 21, from Kuala Berang, Terengganu, proudly overcame the odds to graduate.

Farrah was encouraged by her teachers to enrol in the academy, where she received practical training at McDonald’s outlets — learning to pack food and make drinks.

She also received a monthly allowance during her time at the academy. “Thanks to the monthly allowance, I was able to help lessen some of my family’s financial burdens.”

Wak Jenny Azman, from the Semai Tribe in Tapah, Perak, was initially afraid to leave her home, four younger siblings, and close-knit village community. But determined to support her family, she took a brave step — and soon found new friends, confidence, and a sense of purpose.

Today, the 21-year-old is a crew leader at McDonald’s Putra Heights, where she leads a team of eight.

“I want to share with my Orang Asli friends that they should come out and give this programme a try.

Singapore’s retail sales rose by 1.4% in May 2025 compared to a year ago, reaching a total of $4.2b, according to the Department of Statistics.

Whilst this marked an improvement from April’s modest 0.2% growth, much of the increase was driven by the motor vehicle segment, which surged 10.4% YoY. Excluding vehicle sales, retail growth was flat.

Month-on-month, seasonally adjusted figures showed a 1.0% rise in overall retail sales. However, sales excluding motor vehicles declined by 0.6%. Vehicle purchases were likely buoyed by a larger Certificate of Entitlement (COE) quota, which lifted showroom activity and transaction volumes.

Beyond automobiles, only a few retail categories posted meaningful year-on-year gains. Sales of computer and telecommunications equipment rose by 9.2%, whilst supermarkets and hypermarkets grew 7.2%.

Recreational goods and optical goods & books also recorded solid increases, up 7.0% and 4.5% respectively.

On the downside, petrol service stations saw sales plummet 9.4%. The fashion and department store sectors also struggled, with wearing apparel and footwear dropping 5.3% and department stores down 3.9%.

Food and alcohol retailers fell 4.5%, whilst the once-booming watches and jewellery category saw a 2.1% YoY decline and an 11.5% plunge from April.

Online sales remained a key part of the retail landscape, making up 12.3% of total retail sales in May.

Tesla's stock (TSLA) is down about 17 percent this year, but it's up nearly 300 percent over the last five years.","By Allison Morrow, CNN

Analysis - Despite Elon Musk's bold predictions, the Cybertruck is, officially, a flop.

Tesla is deliberately opaque about its sales numbers on specific models, so you have to squint to get a sense of just how badly the company's unique pickup truck is performing in the real world.

But we definitely have some idea.

Here's what we know, based on Tesla's deliveries (a proxy for sales) released this week:

The EV maker delivered about 384,000 vehicles in total, world-wide, between April and June this year - a record 13.5 percent decline from a year earlier.

Zoom in, and it gets uglier for Tesla.

Tesla doesn't break out sales of the Cybertruck, one of its premium models that Musk says was inspired by the dystopian movie ""Blade Runner."" It discloses just two categories - the Model 3 and Y in one category and, in the second, ""other models,"" which is almost entirely the company's legacy Model S sedan, the Model X SUV and the Cybertruck.

The company said it delivered about 10,400 ""other"" models in the second quarter, which itself is a huge problem for Tesla. In the same quarter last year, Tesla sold more than 21,500 ""other"" models.

It's hard to think of another word for a 52 percent decline other than a collapse.

How many of those ""others"" are Cybertrucks, and how many are the Model S or X? That's not entirely clear.

But let's look at the first three months of this year. Tesla sold about 12,900 ""other"" models, of which 7100 were Cybertrucks, according to registration data from S&P Global Mobility. So a bit more than half.

It'd be safe to estimate, then, that Tesla likely sold something in the ballpark of 5000-6000 Cybertrucks in the second quarter if consumer trends held steady. It might even be getting marginally outsold by the F-150 Lightning and GM's electric pickups, rivals whose sales are also falling but weren't nearly as hyped as Musk's brainchild.

The company didn't respond to a request for comment.

But even in a hypothetical world where all of those 10,400 deliveries in the second quarter were Cybertrucks, Tesla would still be massively underperforming the expectations set by Musk, who told investors two years ago that he expected Tesla to be churning out 250,000 a year by 2025.

We're halfway through the year, and Tesla has barely hit a fraction of that.

Cybertruck sales have faced a number of challenges:

Its $80,000-$100,000 price tag

The imminent erasure of EV tax credits

Its oddball design

Repeated recalls, including one for an exterior steel panel falling off while the truck is moving

The roughly 200-mile (322km) real-world range reported by owners, rather than the 500-mile (805km) range that was initially promised

The vehicle's intractable affiliation with the world's wealthiest wannabe-oligarch

Will the Cybertruck's shortcomings sink Tesla? Probably not. But the stumble has become a reflection of the company's broader turmoil.

The electric truck faces serious competition from the likes of Rivian, Ford and GM. Chinese rivals are eating into Tesla's market share in key markets overseas, particularly Europe and China.

Tesla is on the verge of losing its title as the world's largest EV maker by annual sales to Chinese automaker BYD.

This week, BYD - which isn't allowed in the US market - reported 1 million electric vehicles sold in the first half of this year, putting it far ahead of Tesla's year-to-date total of about 721,000.

The Tesla faithful on Wall Street are still all-in on Musk, whom they see as a visionary and, perhaps more to the point, a showman who has made them rich.

Tesla's stock (TSLA) is down about 17 percent this year, but it's up nearly 300 percent over the last five years. For the ride-or-die bulls, it may not matter that Musk's MAGA turn has clobbered the company's core business of selling cars because he has convinced them that Tesla's future lies in an AI-powered, driverless utopia.

And it's Musk's history of promises that have driven that meteoric share price increase, and, accordingly, Musk's personal wealth.

Canada should do more to strengthen its health surveillance systems as cuts to U.S. health institutions threaten access to crucial monitoring data, experts say in an editorial published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) this week.&nbsp;The editorial says cuts within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the National Institutes of Health and the federal Department of Health and Human Services could strip Canada and other countries of valuable health data.""We've had a decades-long relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and other organizations in the States,"" said co-author Dr. Shannon Charlebois, a family physician and CMAJ's medical editor. ""As those are dismantled, we're not going to have our early warning systems.""&nbsp;For example, when the mpox virus broke out in the U.S.,&nbsp;Charlebois said the CDC&nbsp;formally notified the Public Health Agency of Canada.&nbsp;This&nbsp;comes, the authors say, as a ""crisis of communicable diseases is unfolding in North America,"" pointing to increasing rates of syphilis and HIV in Canada, along with measles outbreaks and livestock culls due to avian influenza.""We can't obviously control everything that happens in the U.S., but we can improve our own systems,"" said co-author Dr. Jasmine Pawa, public health and preventive medicine physician at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.&nbsp;Dr. Jasmine Pawa is co-author of the Canadian Medical Association Journal editorial calling on Canada to step up communicable disease surveillance. (Beth Brown/CBC)U.S. cuts should 'light a fire' to act on surveillanceThere have long been calls for Canada to improve surveillance of infectious diseases.""This should really light a fire under policymakers to take very seriously this question of public health surveillance,"" said Dr. Lorian Hardcastle, associate professor in the Faculty of Law and Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary who specialises in health law and policy.What the U.S. does in public health has a ripple effect, she said.""When you have this major world player pull back out of public health surveillance and is no longer resourcing public health in the manner that they've historically done, then there's a call to others to step up their game.""Beyond formal warnings, Charlebois said there are also informal links&nbsp;between&nbsp;the two countries that can help in planning.

Why have they stopped? Because people are telling them through social media not to follow them anymore,"" said Gardam.With the changes to health institutions in the U.S., Gardam said Canada and other countries will have a void to fill, but it will take time and effort.""We didn't build up our surveillance because the U.S. had our back,"" he said.

This was despite the industry investing £1.8billion into bolstering security, including the rollout of body cameras, panic buttons and CCTV.","H&M has become the latest retailer to give its UK staff body cameras as shops grapple with shoplifting and attacks on workers.

The Swedish fashion giant told The Mail on Sunday it was conducting trials of the technology.

It follows other household names Tesco, the Co-op and Lidl, which are providing staff with bodycams to protect them from abuse and assaults.

High street firms say the move has been forced on them due to a police failure to act. Shoplifting was up one fifth last year with violent and abusive incidents running at 2,000 a day.

Criminals – often organised gangs – increasingly steal goods in full view of staff and shoppers, safe in the knowledge that there will be no consequences.

Workers are usually told not to intervene against thieves to avoid the risk of being attacked.

Staff have also reported being sworn at, being subjected to racial and sexual insults, physically threatened, spat on and being victims of physical violence. The H&M bodycam trials are taking place at a store in Edinburgh as well as shops in Wood Green and Beckton in London.

A spokesman for the firm said: 'We're testing this new technology in a three-store pilot to assess what beneficial impact it may have, along with proper staff customer service training, on de-escalating and reducing incidents for the safety of both our colleagues and customers.'

The cameras are clipped onto a worker's clothes and can record distressing situations to help provide evidence to the police.

Companies are turning to a wide range of security measures as they face unprecedented levels of theft and violence against staff.

Chains including Tesco, Morrisons, Boots, Primark and Greggs said last week they would start submitting CCTV and photos of prolific shoplifters into a new database to be shared with police.

The hope is that the database, known as Auror and pioneered in New Zealand, will provide security guards with watchlists so they can bar entry to repeat offenders.

More goods are now being locked in anti-theft devices, including basic foodstuffs such as honey roast ham, pork and mincemeat.

Greggs announced in May it had moved some products behind the counter to reduce theft.

Shoplifting offences hit a record high in England and Wales last year with 516,971 incidents recorded by police, up from 429,873 in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics. And there were £2.2billion of recorded store losses from theft, up from £1.8billion the previous year.

This was despite the industry investing £1.8billion into bolstering security, including the rollout of body cameras, panic buttons and CCTV.

The number of violent and abusive incidents hit more than 2,000 a day in the year to April 2024, according to industry group the British Retail Consortium (BRC).

In September 2023, Tesco boss Ken Murphy said every frontline worker at the supermarket chain would be offered a bodycam due to a rise in attacks.

Labour has promised to make assaults on shop staff a specific offence in England and Wales, as it is in Scotland, in the Crime and Policing Bill currently making its way through Parliament.

A clause states that anyone found guilty of assaulting a retail worker can be sentenced to up to six months in prison.

The MoS has led calls for a crackdown with its End The Shoplifting Epidemic campaign. Graham Wynn, assistant director of regulatory affairs at the BRC, said: 'The police must get tougher on retail crime, ensuring that all incidents are attended to and followed up on, while the Government must ensure swift passage of the Bill to protect retail workers.'

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper also said last week that more police officers will be deployed to hundreds of towns across Britain this summer to clamp down on crime and anti-social behaviour.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/05/20/100040603-0-image-m-172_1751744526402.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 19:01:46.857999

The strikes, which began outside Safeway stores over two weeks ago across Colorado, including Grand Junction, were called to end on Saturday.

According to KDVR, the strike started after the Albertsons company terminated a contract extension with UFCW Local 7, which had been negotiated for months. Additionally, a reportedly failed merger that was supposed to take place in 2024, unfair labor practices, short-staffed stores and frozen wages were also cited as reasons for the strike.

The company had reportedly walked away from negotiations for a new agreement on June 27 and June 28, continuing the strike until company representatives agreed to discuss further compromises with the union on Friday at 10 a.m.

As part of the agreement, the Albertsons company will terminate all temporary replacement workers, with all striking workers guaranteed to have their same position, classification and seniority upon returning. Workers who were part of the strike for at least one day of the week will be paid for an 8-hour day on Friday if they have not already earned their full strike benefits. All striking workers must return to work by Monday and should contact their store director before returning for arrangements.

The union and the Albertsons company met up on Friday to reach a tentative agreement. The contract included 45 tentative provisions, such as:

Fully funded healthcare benefits with improved dental benefits and increased life insurance.

Fully funded pension benefits.

No cuts to retiree healthcare benefits.

Wage increases.

No giveaways of bargaining unit work to gig companies, like DoorDash.

In May, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy (just seven months after it exited a previous Chapter 11 bankruptcy initially filed in October 2023).
Fortuna Eureka’s Rite Aid pharmacy is one of 625 stores that had their pharmacy operations acquired by CVS.
Fortuna Rite Aid manager Jon Batini told the Times-Standard that’s not the case for his store.
Starr said that, ultimately, Open Door and other local medical providers will work to increase their capacity to take on Rite Aid pharmacy customers.","Throughout the next month and a half, Rite Aid locations throughout Humboldt County will all shutter their doors. Locations in Fortuna and Eureka have already closed their pharmacy operations, with Rite Aid’s McKinleyville location set to follow suit shortly.

The loss of the pharmacies is part of an ongoing national sell-off of all Rite Aid assets. It’s also part of a familiar trend in the area and other rural communities in the country, as both national and local retail pharmacies close shop, leaving “pharmacy deserts” in their wake.

In May, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy (just seven months after it exited a previous Chapter 11 bankruptcy initially filed in October 2023). The company subsequently announced plans to shutter or sell all of its 1,200 individual stores. Rite Aid closed 1,000 stores already, according to reporting from Newsweek, at a time when other major retail pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens are also looking to shrink their footprints.

CVS announced plans to close 271 stores in May. A CVS at 1105 Myrtle Avenue in Eureka closed that same month.

CVS has announced no plans to close its other stores in the area, which include the aforementioned “Winco” location in the Eureka Mall on W Harris and another in Target at 2525 4th Street, but anxieties about pharmacy closures in the area are well-founded.

In recent years a number of Humboldt Bay pharmacies have closed shop. Cloney’s Pharmacy locations throughout Humboldt County closed in 2021 and Lima’s Pharmacy on Harrison ended retail pharmacy operations in 2023.

Eureka

Rite Aid’s 411 Harris Street location in the Henderson Center neighborhood of Eureka is slated to close by the end of the month. Employees told the Times-Standard that the drugstore’s last day would be July 27.

Clarke Bishop, an employee at the store, told the Times-Standard he thought that the protracted effects of the pandemic coupled with subsequent lawsuits weakened the company in ways that ultimately led to its demise.

In July 2024, Rite Aid settled a lawsuit with the federal government for an immediate payment of $7.5 million and a claim to $401.8 million off the company’s assets under bankruptcy. That lawsuit alleged that between 2014 and 2019, at the company’s then-2,200 locations, “Rite Aid knowingly dispensed at least hundreds of thousands of unlawful prescriptions for controlled substances that lacked a legitimate medical purpose and were not issued in the usual course of professional practice and/or were not valid prescriptions.”

Teighon Blood, another employee in Eureka, chalked the closures up to “corporate greed.” Before joining Rite Aid, Blood had been employed by Joann Fabrics, which shuttered its Eureka location, just across the street from Rite Aid, as well as its remaining 500 stores across the country. The fabric and craft store chain had been acquired in a leveraged buyout in 2011, saddling the company with debts that it never recovered from.

“It sucks for the neighborhood,” Blood said, noting that “not everybody can get around … without a car” and that the Rite Aid’s Henderson Center location, near a well-frequented bus stop, embedded in a neighborhood, allowed many customers who were unable to drive to access medication that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.

Fortuna

Eureka’s Rite Aid pharmacy is one of 625 stores that had their pharmacy operations acquired by CVS. That means the Eureka store’s pharmacy customers may now fill their prescriptions nearly seamlessly at the nearby CVS location on W Harris Street near Winco.

Fortuna Rite Aid manager Jon Batini told the Times-Standard that’s not the case for his store. He said that he had heard from some customers that had their records transferred to CVS in Eureka, but said that, to his knowledge, most customers have been left on their own to find a replacement pharmacy.

After 37 years with the company, Batini said, he heard from Rite Aid by phone just 30 days prior to the company shutting down its pharmacy on June 29 that the store would close. He said that upon closing the pharmacy, representatives from Rite Aid had come to the Fortuna location and “wiped all the computers” to prevent data from being leaked or otherwise transmitted.

Batini said that the employees’ union representation, UFCW 5, managed to negotiate a severance out of the deal for the area stores’ employees — including the Fortuna location’s 12 employees. Batini himself, as a manager, will not be eligible for this severance after nearly four decades with the company, and sources told the Times-Standard that severance payments are conditional on employees having been with the company for two years.

Fortuna will now have one Walgreens location in addition to the independent Green’s Fortuna Pharmacy and Ring’s Pharmacy in nearby Ferndale to service the entire lower Eel River community.

This reporter visited Green’s Fortuna Pharmacy last Thursday and spoke to a pharmacist. The store was busy and well-staffed, and the pharmacists said that, while she couldn’t speak on behalf of Green’s, the store seemed to be handling the influx of customers well. She said that it was not unlike the closure of Cloney’s Pharmacies in 2021.

McKinleyville

A source from Rite Aid’s McKinleyville location told the Times-Standard on background that the store will be closing on Aug. 17, with its pharmacy operations set to close a month prior to that in mid-July.

That source referred the Times-Standard to Rite Aid’s corporate media contact. The Times-Standard reached out to Rite Aid via phone and email to ask a number of questions, including whether pharmacy records would be sold to CVS or otherwise transferred from Rite Aid locations in Fortuna and McKinleyville. The company did not respond to those inquiries.

McKinleyville has a CVS pharmacy location as well as the independent Redwood Community Pharmacy. Barnes Arcata Family Drug and an additional CVS store are located in Arcata, as well.

Humboldt County

While Rite Aid pharmacy shutdowns will certainly have their effects in Eureka, Fortuna and McKinleyville, the three relatively urban areas are much more resilient than smaller neighboring communities when it comes to options for pharmaceuticals.

In recent years, pharmacy closures in more remote areas of Humboldt County have prompted nonprofit organizations and other medical agencies to intervene to prevent large swaths of the community from becoming unserved.

When Keith’s Pharmacy in Garberville abruptly closed in August 2020, effectively leaving much of Southern Humboldt without a retail pharmacy, Southern Humboldt Community Healthcare District (SoHum Health) subsequently stepped in to open its Garberville Pharmacy in June 2021.

Willow Creek Pharmacy’s abrupt closure in July 2023, prompted Open Door Community Health Centers to expand its pharmacy operations to ensure that all Open Door patients would have access to medications.

Open Door Rx Pharmacy is not a retail pharmacy (it’s licensed differently than a Rite Aid and cannot sell pharmaceuticals to the general public), but it does provide much-needed service to Open Door customers in the county, particularly those who have lost their neighborhood pharmacies.

“The ecosystem has been devolving for quite a while, and that’s why we ended up getting into the pharmacy business to take care of Open Door patients,” Open Door CEO Tory Starr said.

Starr likened the current state of the pharmacy business — with its increasing lack of independent operators and consolidation with large companies like CVS purchasing portions of Rite Aid — to an old growth Redwood forest, in some respects, with fewer large companies dominating the environment.

“They call it a climax environment, where it’s mature and there’s only a few big trees left,” Starr said. “That’s what’s happening across the landscape, in health care in America, is that it’s all getting consolidated. I don’t think that’s necessarily a good thing, but that is the trend that you’re seeing.”

Starr said that increasing consolidation and the attrition of small independent pharmacies in this environment have put pressure on smaller communities — as has a shortage of qualified pharmacists. Pharmacies, like other medical facilities, are feeling the effects of a broader health care shortage — particularly in rural regions like Humboldt County — and are struggling to attract and retain qualified medical professionals.

Starr said that, ultimately, Open Door and other local medical providers will work to increase their capacity to take on Rite Aid pharmacy customers. There will be strain on the system, but ultimately the local ecosystem — with its Redwoods in massive vertically integrated retail health companies like CVS and its community nonprofits and independent pharmacies — will absorb that additional business. Starr said that he understands the anxiety in a community that sees the effects of consolidation limiting their access to services, but his “instinct is to try to help people decrease their anxiety.”

“The local providers are always trying to meet the needs of our communities, and know that our best intentions are always there to make sure we try to meet the need,” Starr said.

""The strike is over,"" declared the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7R, the union that is bargaining on behalf of Safeway and Albertsons workers in Colorado.

The workers are expected to return to work beginning on Monday, according to the union.

The development ended the three-week strike that affected more than 40 stores across the state after both sides tentatively reached agreement on dozens of points, the union said.

The union said they included ""fully funded"" healthcare benefits, including ""improved"" dental coverage, a doubling of lens allowance and an increase in life insurance. The two sides also agreed to make not cuts to retiree health benefits and provide a ""longevity"" bonus to all workers with a year of seniority.

The two sides will also embark on a ""test-and-learn trial"" to study ""meaningful"" staffing improvements at stores.

The agreement included expanded vacation cash out and ""no giveaways of bargaining unit work to gig companies.""

Finally, Safeway agreed to terminate all temporary workers and guarantee the positions of workers returning from the picket.

In its third week, dozens of stores across Colorado joined the grocery workers union in the strike against Safeway and Albertsons.

It outlasted the strike against King Soopers in February, when workers across North Colorado and the metro Denver area walked out for 12 days until a temporary peace agreement was established.

While the earlier strike hit Valentine’s Day and Super Bowl Sunday — some of a grocery store’s most lucrative days in a slower month — the strike against Safeway was set to affect the July 4th holiday weekend.

The union had been amping up its strike by adding several stores a day to join the picketing, instead of calling all stores at once to join in like it did with King Soopers.

The strike affected stores from Denver to Estes Park, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs, Fort Morgan, Pueblo and Grand Junction.

In the El Paso County area, the stores included Safeway locations on North Circle and Village Center drives in Colorado Springs, Highway 105 in Monument and Mesa Ridge Parkway in Fountain.

It was spurred after more than nine months of negotiations failed to establish new contracts.

After failing to reach a resolution over issues, such as addressing overstaffing and employee benefits, a majority of union workers in parts of the state, including the metro Denver area, voted to authorize a strike.

Last month, union leaders said it made “significant conceptual progress” on several items but not on important economic issues, such as health care and wages.

In a statement, a Safeway spokesperson said the grocer was “committed to engaging in good-faith discussions to reach a new agreement” — adding it hopes an agreement would be made soon.

“We have put forward a strong offer that includes meaningful wage increases, continued investment in secure healthcare coverage, and the long-term stability of the pension plan, reflecting both the dedication of our associates and the real economic conditions facing our industry,” the spokesperson said. “We remain willing to return to the bargaining table and reach a responsible agreement that benefits everyone.”

Safeway had hired a pool of temporary workers to cover shifts of striking workers starting at $22 an hour.

MENU CHANGES Starbucks has made several big moves this year, and under CEO Brian Niccol had cut 430% of its menu.","STARBUCKS has announced a big menu change just months after it axed a fan favorite sweet treat.

Fans have had to put up with big cuts to the chain's menu this year, but they can now look forward to the return of a popular product.

In April of this year, Starbucks made the highly controversial move of discontinuing the Double Chocolate Brownie.

This was said to be due to low sales, but fans were fart from happy over the decison.

But following this reaction, Starbucks has reversed its course, and is bringing it back to menus.

The chain teased the return of the sweet treat in late June, and it is back on Starbucks’ site and app.

It is not yet clear exactly when the brownie will make its return, however.

OUTRAGED REACTION

When Starbucks made the call to discontinue the brownie, fans were furious.

On the platform Reddit, customers couldn't believe it, and expressed their anger on a thread.

The caption of the post said: ""They’re discontinuing the brownie.

""This is the worst day of my life.""

Many of the customers were plagued by flashbacks of previously discontinued items.

One person said: ""One thing you can count is on Starbucks discontinuing the good products.

""I’m still pi***d about the almond croissant.""

The almond croissant had many vocal supporters in the comments.

One supporter wrote: ""The Almond Croissant is my Roman Empire.""

And another wrote: ""Damn it's been 4 years since I've left and been in a Starbucks I didn't know about the almond croissant!

""I still won't forgive the discontinuing of the spicy chorizo.""

MENU CHANGES

Starbucks has made several big moves this year, and under CEO Brian Niccol had cut 430% of its menu.

This was done to ""clear the noise out both in food and beverage menus.""

Niccol later justified himself in an earnings call: ""That opens the door for better innovation that will hopefully resonate even more so for our customers.

""We’ve taken steps to refocus the business, our mission and our marketing to better align with our identity as a coffee company.""

The company recently began testing a new cold foam option that adds 15 grams of protein to its drinks, along with an unsweetened protein powder.

CEO Brian Niccol is being upfront about where his innovation is leading him, and which direction he is going in.

He said: ""It's on trend. It's delicious.""

The CEO also told Axios: ""I was watching people coming to our stores, they would get three shots of espresso over ice.

""And in some cases, they pull their own protein powder out of their bag, or in other cases, they have a protein drink, like a Fair Life and they'd pour that into their drink.

""I'm like, well, wait a second, we can make this experience better for them.

The world’s largest solar-powered car carrier, the “Yuan Hai Kou,” has successfully completed its maiden voyage, arriving at Greece’s Piraeus Port carrying 4,000 Chinese vehicles, China COSCO Shipping Corporation Limited has announced.

The vessel features a 302.8-kilowatt solar system, the largest of its kind, which generates 410,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually and reduces carbon intensity by 35 percent over its lifecycle compared to conventional ships, Science and Technology Daily reported on Friday.

“The successful maiden voyage of the ‘Yuan Hai Kou’ is a practical step forward in COSCO Shipping’s global channel strategy, integrating shipping, ports and logistics while setting a new benchmark for low-carbon transformation in the global shipping industry,” said Zhang Wei, chairman of COSCO Shipping Specialized Carriers Co., Ltd.

With a capacity equivalent to 7,000 cars, it can transport passenger vehicles, engineering trucks and buses, according to the report.

Equipped with a dual-fuel engine that runs on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and fuel oil, the vessel cuts energy consumption by 20 percent and cuts carbon emissions by over 24 percent. For instance, a round trip from China to Europe lowers emissions by 2,100 tonnes.

In 2024 Raising Cane’s opened 118 new restaurants while another 100 are expected to open this year with 200 more in development.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Raising Cane’s Sales are Skyrocketing

Raising Cane’s is third in sales behind Chick-fil-A who takes the top spot and Popeyes in U.S. sales. CNBC reported Cane’s sales soared to $5.1 billion last year, which was more than double in 2021. In addition, their traffic rose 10.8 % during a time when consumers tightened up their budgets and restaurant spending.

Bigger Goals in Sight

Raising Cane’s is turning out impressive figures, but the founder and owner Todd Graves has bigger plans. At a conference in Cancún, Mexico, he outlined his plans and said the following per Nation’s Restaurant News.

“Our next aspiration is to be a top 10 restaurant brand in the U.S. Think of the big boys – McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Starbucks, Subway – companies that have been open a lot longer than we have,” he said. “We are going to hit $10 billion in sales, average unit volumes of $8 million, and 1,600 restaurants in all major cities and new international locations around the world. We’ll have 150,000 crew members including 16,000 internal promotes. And we’ll give back $100 million to communities. Imagine what we’ll be able to give back to our communities once we become a top 10 brand.”

About Raising Cane’s

The first Raising Cane’s opened in 1996 in Baton Rouge. Graves was just 24-years-old and used the money he made working in an oil refinery and fishing in Alaska to fund his dream of opening a restaurant where the main menu item is chicken fingers.

He named the restaurant after his dog, a labrador retriever, Raising Cane and has since named every dog after the same name.

The chain is known for its very selective menu of chicken fingers, crinkle-cut fries, Texas toast, coleslaw and trademark sauce and isn’t planning on switching it up.

“We do not get into value play,” AJ Kumaran, who shares the title of co-CEO with Graves, told CNBC. “We do not get into limited-time offers. When our customers pull into the drive-thru or walk through the doors, they immediately know what to expect.”

Amazon's Prime Day this year will last four days between July 8 and 11 — longer than it has run before, and the earliest that the sale has started.

A range of other retailers, from Dollar General to REI, are also offering sales that coincide with or start earlier than Prime Day.

Fourth-of-July sales for products, such as mattresses or seasonal items like lawnmowers and inflatable pools, have been around longer than Prime Day. Overall, though, early summer was historically a slow time for retail.

""July used to be the dog days of summer when people didn't spend that much,"" said Zak Stambor, senior analyst of retail and e-commerce at EMARKETER, which shares an owner with Business Insider.

Prime Day, which Amazon first hosted in 2015, changed that.

Now, ""July is a time that consumers are conditioned to be on the hunt for deals,"" Stambor said. ""Every retailer needs to respond and lean into that.""

Best Buy, Dollar General, and other retailers are getting in on the action

Besides Prime Day, this year's sales lineup includes a seven-day Fourth of July sale from Best Buy. Like Amazon, Best Buy is offering deals on electronics to members of its paid loyalty programs. Best Buy's sale lasts three days longer than Prime Day, though. It also started on Monday, over a week ahead of Prime Day.

Dollar General is planning its own ""7 Days of Savings"" event, which starts on July 6. The dollar store's discounts for the sale are more limited than Amazon's, with one deal per day, such as a discount on a fan or a buy-one, get-one deal on bratwurst.

Walmart and Target, which have offered their own sales around Prime Day in years past, are also getting in on the action again. Walmart's sale, for example, will start on July 8 and run for six days. Members of Walmart+, the big box store's paid membership, will get early access to deals.

Department store Kohl's, outdoor gear retailer REI, and home improvement chain Lowe's are also among the stores offering Fourth-of-July and other sales around the same time as Prime Day this year.

Amazon may have drawn inspiration from its rivals for its longer Prime Day, Stambor said. Last year, when Prime Day was two days long, Walmart's sale was twice as long.

""Amazon can see that those events have resonated, and so why not hop in the pool and join them?"" Stambor said.

All those deals could be welcome this year as consumers watch their spending closely and worry about prices going up due to tariffs. President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on many of the tariffs that he enacted in April expires on July 9, the second day of Prime Day.

Amazon still has an edge over many other retailers when it comes to conveniences like fast delivery and value, Stambor said. And marquee sales events like Prime Day allow Amazon to increase its market share in the long run.

Rival retailers' sales are also a chance for them to win over customers.

Monitor metrics like on-time delivery rates and fleet electrification progress for signs of sustained momentum.","The 2024 holiday season tested logistics providers like never before, yet the United States Postal Service (USPS) emerged as a standout performer, defying expectations with its ability to scale operations while maintaining reliability. For investors seeking stable, infrastructure-driven investments in a volatile economy, USPS's recent achievements offer a compelling case study in strategic resilience. Let's dissect the data to uncover why USPS is now a critical player in the logistics sector—and how its investments could pay dividends for years to come.

The Holiday Stress Test: USPS Outperforms

USPS's 2024 holiday results were nothing short of extraordinary. By expanding daily package capacity to 77 million packages—a staggering 224% increase over its average daily volume—the postal service proved it can handle peak demand without compromising service. On-time delivery rates for Priority Mail Express hit 95%+, while even standard First-Class packages maintained an 83% on-time rate, outpacing many private competitors during the same period. This performance wasn't luck; it was the result of years of deliberate infrastructure upgrades and operational discipline.

The Infrastructure Play: Investing in Enduring Assets

USPS's success hinges on its $40 billion 10-year modernization plan, which has already yielded tangible results:

- Sorting Machines: The addition of 506 new package sorters (including 158 since 2023) slashed processing bottlenecks, enabling faster throughput.

- Electric Fleets: The rollout of 27,000 new delivery vehicles, including 500 battery-electric models, not only advances sustainability goals but also reduces long-term fuel costs and maintenance risks.

- Workforce Stability: Hiring 7,500 seasonal workers (fewer than prior years) reflects smarter staffing strategies, relying on automation and optimized routes to minimize labor volatility.

These investments address the core challenges of modern logistics: scalability, cost efficiency, and environmental responsibility. Unlike private carriers constrained by shareholder pressures to cut costs, USPS's public mandate allows it to prioritize long-term infrastructure over short-term gains—a structural advantage in an era of e-commerce growth.

Even as UPS and FedEx faced delivery delays, USPS's stock held steady, reflecting investor confidence in its operational model.

Why Investors Should Take Note

The data paints a clear picture: USPS is not just surviving but thriving in a high-stakes logistics landscape. Its ability to handle 40-50% above average volume during peak periods while maintaining on-time delivery benchmarks suggests a buffer against economic shocks. For investors, this translates to three key opportunities:

Defensive Portfolio Positioning: In a slowing economy, reliable infrastructure plays like USPS act as a hedge against volatility. Its monopoly on mail delivery and expanding package services create a moat against competition.

Sustainability Dividends: The shift to electric vehicles and streamlined ground networks positions USPS to capitalize on ESG-focused investment trends.

Market Share Gains: With private carriers struggling to manage returns (USPS now handles 2-3 million return packages daily), it's well-positioned to capture the $200+ billion reverse logistics market.

Risks and Considerations

No investment is risk-free. USPS still faces challenges like aging facilities and regulatory debates over its funding model. However, its Delivering for America plan, aiming for 95% on-time service across all categories, signals a clear path to profitability. Meanwhile, competitors like FedEx are cutting costs by reducing Sunday deliveries—a move USPS can afford not to make, thanks to its nationwide scale and federal backing.

Final Take: USPS as a Long-Term Infrastructure Bet

USPS isn't just a postal service; it's a logistics powerhouse with a $400 billion annual addressable market in U.S. parcel shipping. Its 2024 holiday performance proves that strategic investment in infrastructure—sorting tech, electric fleets, and workforce optimization—can turn seasonal stress tests into opportunities to dominate.

For investors, USPS represents a rare blend of stability, scalability, and ESG alignment. While its stock may not offer explosive growth, it's a recession-resistant anchor in a portfolio. As e-commerce continues to grow and logistics becomes a critical economic artery, USPS's investments today will pay off tomorrow.

Investment advice: Consider a gradual position in USPS equity or related infrastructure ETFs, with a 3-5 year horizon. Monitor metrics like on-time delivery rates and fleet electrification progress for signs of sustained momentum.

In logistics, resilience isn't just about surviving the holidays—it's about building an empire that lasts. USPS is doing just that.",,N,,2025-07-05 19:01:56.381719

""In tough times, loyalty programs become more essential,"" said Peter Fader, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Consumers who join loyalty programs visit restaurants more frequently, making 22% more visits per year to eateries, according to Circana data.
Salad chain Sweetgreen also retooled its loyalty program this spring, moving away from its tiered subscription program that many consumers found confusing.","As some consumers pull back on spending amid economic uncertainty, fast-casual restaurant chains are leaning on rewards programs to pull them back in.

Loyalty programs, which offer discounts or added perks for returning customers, have transitioned from being a nice bonus for restaurants to a must-have. As cost-cautious diners prioritize value, brands like Chipotle , Starbucks , Cava and others are utilizing rewards to keep customers coming back and building habits that go beyond the occasional coupon.

""In tough times, loyalty programs become more essential,"" said Peter Fader, a marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ""They become a required ingredient to building and maintaining relationships.""

In the 12 months ended in May, the restaurant industry only saw monthly traffic increase once, in November, according to Black Box Intelligence data. As diners visit restaurants less frequently, sales struggle. Only 43% of restaurant brands tracked by Black Box reported same-store sales growth in May.

Consumers who join loyalty programs visit restaurants more frequently, making 22% more visits per year to eateries, according to Circana data. They also frequent the brands that they belong to at twice the rate of nonmembers, the market research firm found.

Coffee giant Starbucks reported 34.2 million active rewards members in its second quarter and said more than 59% of its U.S. company-owned transactions came from those members. Potbelly has seen similar success: In the first quarter of 2025, over 42% of its total shop sales came from digital business, which includes the loyalty program users.

Chipotle has over 20 million active rewards members. It's loyalty program makes up approximately 30% of sales on average each day and helped the burrito chain to avoid major price hikes, according to the company.

""We have really strong brand loyalty among our members,"" Nicole West, Chipotle's vice president of digital experiences, told CNBC. ""We're really focused on engaging with our members and doing that in a way that really resonates with them.""

Driving loyalty is critical for the likes of Chipotle and Starbucks. In the first quarter, Chipotle posted a same-store sales decline for the first time since 2020 and said it saw a ""slowdown"" in consumer spending. Meanwhile, Starbucks' same-store sales have fallen for five straight quarters.

Cava is bucking industry trends with strong sales growth, but faces Wall Street pressure to maintain its rapid expansion.

Chipotle this year launched a seasonal campaign called ""Summer of Extras."" The campaign is giving away over $1 million in free burritos, encouraging customers to rack up visits and compete to become the top Chipotle visitor in their state.

""We continue to see activations in this program build and excitement and positive reaction across social media from our fans,"" West said. ""We just continue to focus on delivering value to them in ways through programs where customers are given opportunities to 'plus up' their points or earn specific offers by exhibiting specific behaviors.""

Salad chain Sweetgreen also retooled its loyalty program this spring, moving away from its tiered subscription program that many consumers found confusing.

""In a challenging industry environment where consumers are making more intentional choices with every dollar, SG Rewards is designed to meet the moment by delivering a meaningful value,"" Sweetgreen co-founder and CEO Jonathan Neman said on the company's quarterly conference call in May.

Even Starbucks, an established leader in rewards programs, has made changes. In June, the coffee chain ended its 25-star reusable cup bonus and replaced it with double stars across the full purchase. While the change was controversial among loyalists, who claimed the earning potential was reduced, the coffee chain said participation has remained steady.

Of course, giving free rewards comes with tradeoffs. Promotions cut into profits in an industry that faces tight margins in the best of times. Restaurant chains hope those freebies drive longer-term loyalty and spending on full-price items.

Long-term wins

Brands navigating economic pressure are seeing that loyalty programs are helping to drive visits.

Potbelly revamped its loyalty system in early 2024, moving to a coin-based structure that allows customers to redeem rewards faster and across more items. Customers now have access to over 14 menu items through the rewards program. This flexibility has led to more frequent visits, Potbelly's chief marketing officer, David Daniels, said.

""We saw a lift almost immediately in terms of engagement,"" Daniels said. ""The response has been incredibly positive.""

Chicago-style eatery Portillo's joined the loyalty game in March with ""Portillo's Perks."" Instead of using a traditional app, the program utilizes a digital wallet system and focuses on frequency. It tracks how often a customer visits and awards badges as they go.

""It gives flexibility to change how the program is deployed,"" Garrett Kern, Portillo's vice president of strategy and culinary, said to CNBC. ""It doesn't require a redesign and relaunch to an application. It was a great way for us to get the program out there in a branded and easy-to-use way.""

The company is aiming for 1.5 million to 1.7 million sign-ups by mid-summer.

Many Americans started shopping earlier for school supplies and the winter holidays during the pandemic, Katherine Cullen, vice president of industry and consumer insights at the National Retail Federation, wrote recently.","Which came first: Big July sales events or an early start to back-to-school shopping?

Big-box store traffic traditionally dwindled in the early months of summer as Americans relaxed by the pool and embarked on vacations, according to retail experts. That’s changed in recent years as companies like Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT) began staging major sales in July, and as Americans’ finances grew squeezed by inflation and higher prices, analysts said.

“Whether the mid-July promotional events created the earlier demand or are in response to it, parents have signaled that they are ready to start thinking about ‘back to school’” once July 4th is over, Brian McCarthy, principal of retail strategy at Deloitte, wrote in an email.

Whatever the case, the sales are picking up. Amazon’s Prime Day, which offers Prime members deals like half-off select Levi’s attire and 40% off some Samsung and Sony TVs, runs from July 8th to 11th. Target’s promotion for those in its free membership program runs from July 6th through 12th; Walmart’s sale, from July 8th through 13th. (Walmart and Target are giving those in their paid membership programs early access to sales, according to press releases.) And Best Buy (BBY) is slated to wrap up its own event tomorrow, the company said.

July sales can help retailers clear out inventory and spur sales ahead of the end of their second quarter, paving the way for them to hand in better results, McCarthy said. Walmart, Target, and Best Buy’s second quarters conclude in late July or early August, press releases show. (Amazon’s comes a bit earlier, in late June, according to a press release.)

“Prime Day should promote an early start to back-to-school/college shopping during a quieter time in the retail calendar,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a Wednesday note. Bank of America expects it to drive more than $21 billion in gross merchandise value for Amazon.

Many Americans started shopping earlier for school supplies and the winter holidays during the pandemic, Katherine Cullen, vice president of industry and consumer insights at the National Retail Federation, wrote recently. This trend is accelerating this year as consumers worry that tariffs will lead to higher prices, her blog post said.

The two sides held an all-day bargaining session on Friday, according to a post on the union's Facebook page. Early Saturday morning, it posted the tentative agreement.

""Attention UFCW Local 7 Safeway/Albertsons members: We have reached a fully recommended tentative agreement! The strike is over,"" the post said. The union said the agreement, which must be ratified by union membership, included fully funded healthcare benefits, fully funded pension benefits for the cycle of the contract, ""strong"" wage increases and several other provisions. No date has been set for the ratification vote.

Safeway workers in Colorado continued to picket outside of stores on strike on the Fourth.

The Safeway off of Corona Street in Denver had around 20 picketers at 10 a.m. when the negotiations started. They were lined up outside of the building, wearing or holding signs explaining the strike. As few customers trickled in and out of the store, strikers asked people to shop somewhere else.

As of Wednesday morning, employees from 43 stores and one distribution center in Denver walked off the job to protest what the union calls unfair labor practices. Workers participated in the strike to fix understaffing and get guarantees that health and pension benefits will be fully funded, according to The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7.

The union had been negotiating for a new contract with Safeway andAlbertsons since the old one expired in January.

The 4th of July talk discussion took place at the DoubleTree hotel in Downtown Denver, according to a statement on the union’s Facebook page. The union posted into the late evening that it was still at the bargaining table.

The strike started nearly two weeks ago with just six stores and a distribution center in Denver. In a statement at the time, the union said it was starting small to “allow time for the public to understand the problems these workers are facing, allow Safeway/Albertsons time to understand the seriousness of the workers’ resolve, and at the same time reduce the hardship on shoppers and workers alike that result from a wide-spread strike.”

The union was also negotiating with King Soopers and City Market and parent Kroger. They reached a tentative deal on Thursday afternoon after 46 hours of negotiations, according to the union. The union, which fully supports the three-year contract, says they came to an agreement on sticking points that included health care benefits and pensions.

What has worked for JSW MG Motor India is a robust demand for the MG Windsor EV, which is driving the bulk of its EV sales.
When JSW MG Motor India launched it in 2024, it introduced the vehicle as a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) offering.
BaaS accounts for around 15-20% of total electric vehicle sales of JSW MG Motor India, JSW MG Motor India director Parth Jindal told Fortune India in January.
Even with all the buzz around electric vehicles, EV adoption in India is growing slower than many expected, says Dhaka.","India’s largest electric carmaker, Tata Motors, saw its EV market share shrink to 35% in June from 63% in the same month last year. During the same time, JSW MG Motor India’s market share rose from 20% to 30%.

What has worked for JSW MG Motor India is a robust demand for the MG Windsor EV, which is driving the bulk of its EV sales. There are many myths surrounding electric vehicles, and MG Windsor has been able to dispel several of them, says Puneet Gupta, Director of India & ASEAN at S&P Global Mobility. “The price at which Windsor comes is comparable to ICE cars of similar size,” he says.

“MG Windsor has been able to offer better pricing, positioning and packaging. It falls within the mass segment, but its positioning is geared towards a premium ride. When JSW MG Motor India launched it in 2024, it introduced the vehicle as a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) offering. They have been smart in terms of packaging,” Gupta says.

Although Tata Motors has been India’s top-selling EV maker for a long time, it has never worked on BaaS, he says. “That’s the clear benefit that MG Windsor got because their packaging was very good. BaaS worked very well in favour of them,” says Gupta. BaaS accounts for around 15-20% of total electric vehicle sales of JSW MG Motor India, JSW MG Motor India director Parth Jindal told Fortune India in January.

Meanwhile, Tata Motors saw flattish EV sales in June despite having five electric models in its portfolio. The carmaker is now counting on the recently launched Harrier EV and the soon-to-be-launched Sierra EV to drive its electric car sales.

Even with all the buzz around electric vehicles, EV adoption in India is growing slower than many expected, says Dhaka. “The reasons are quite familiar, yet still stubborn. First, there’s range anxiety; people are still worried about how far an EV will take them on a single charge and whether they'll find a charging point when needed. While the number of public chargers has crossed 25,000, the distribution is skewed, especially in smaller towns and highways, making long-distance travel a concern,” he explains.

Price is another sticking point, according to Dhaka. Even though EVs are becoming more affordable, they’re still about 25–30% more expensive than petrol or diesel vehicles upfront. “For many middle-class buyers, that’s a dealbreaker, especially when there’s still uncertainty around battery life, resale value, and how reliable these new models are over time,” he says.

Gupta of S&P Global Mobility cites Japanese domination of India’s auto industry as one of the reasons for the slow adoption of EVs. ""The Japanese are not pushing electric vehicles across the globe. Till the time big players like Maruti Suzuki don’t jump into the EV race, I don’t think the industry will grow because the biggest player is sitting out of action,” says Gupta.

While EV penetration has surged to over 5% in two-wheelers, the adoption in passenger vehicles remains stubbornly slow. ""The real issue is that EVs today don’t offer a compelling primary vehicle replacement for most Indian car buyers. Range anxiety, poor public charging infrastructure, and a lack of viable EV options below ₹10 lakh mean that many EVs are bought as second cars, not first. Until OEMs launch truly affordable, India-specific EVs with usable real-world range and the charging ecosystem improves meaningfully, the EV share in PVs will remain a niche play rather than a mainstream shift,"" says Ravindra Patki, managing partner, Vector Consulting Group.",https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india%2F2025-06-04%2F2424ndop%2Fshutterstock2290391689.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-07-05 23:59:45.271264

A Freedom of Information request has suggested that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) reached generous settlement deals with multi-million pound companies who used payroll loan schemes.

Meanwhile, independent contractors were hit with life-changing bills.

The agreements came to light after a campaigner submitted a Freedom of Information request which was then revealed in Parliament by Conservative MP, Greg Smith, during Treasury Questions on Tuesday.

HMRC said it does not recognise the claims.

MPs said the revelation was “staggering”.

Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, said: “It is unacceptable that victims have been consistently refused the justice they deserve while large companies received settlements a decade ago.

“This information shows the need for a proper, independent inquiry that looks at the whole loan charge scandal.”

The loan charge is a controversial law that left 50,000 self-employed workers with crippling tax bills and has been linked to 10 suicides.

It was introduced in 2017 to target contractors who were paid through non-taxable loans rather than salaries.

The loan schemes date back to the 1990s, and were often marketed as HMRC-compliant by respected tax advisers.

But HMRC maintains that it never approved the schemes. It used the loan charge to claw back the unpaid tax from the workers, with many facing bills that exceeded their income.

MPs and campaigners have accused HMRC of unfairly targeting and ruthlessly hounding the contractors while failing to go after the scheme promoters.

Now, minutes of a meeting from 2019 between Lord Amyas Morse, who led the 2019 loan charge review, and the leader of the latest review, Ray McCann, reveal that HMRC offered discounts to settle the tax bills of employers who used the schemes.

In the minutes of the meeting, Mr McCann is recorded as saying: “The earlier settlement opportunity that had been open to large companies had included significant discounts, so that eventually the companies settled for somewhere in the region of 15pc in 2015.”

He went on to say “the contractors weren’t offered these terms”, and “settlement opportunities have always had a discount, and contractor one is the only one that didn’t.”

Mr McCann is currently concluding the loan charge review, which was launched in January 2025 after calls from MPs. A former HMRC inspector, he was president of a professional body of tax advisers called the Chartered Institute of Taxation from 2018 to 2019.

According to official figures, 800 companies paid HMRC £1bn through financial settlements related to the schemes between 2011 and 2015. This works out an average tax liability of £1.25m per firm.

In Parliament earlier this week, Mr Smith said: “A recent Freedom of Information request has revealed that, for a number of schemes, HMRC has settled with large corporations for just 15pc of what was owed.

“With the loan charge review ongoing, does the Chancellor agree with me that individuals should be treated no differently from the large corporations for which this precedent has been set?”

Liberal Democrat MP Angus Macdonald, another APPG member, has tabled an Early Day motion – supported by 18 MPs so far – expressing “astonishment” about the deals and the fact they have “never been revealed to Parliament”.

Mike Warburton, The Telegraph’s tax columnist and former director at accountants Grant Thornton, said: “These revelations have shown in stark contrast the way the Treasury and HMRC have treated large corporate taxpayers on the one hand and small contractors on the other.”

Critics of the loan charge argue it retroactively punishes contractors who signed up to the schemes in good faith.

The large timeframes involved create massive tax bills as years’ worth of interest has rolled up on the debt. In one case, an individual earning £13,000 a year landed a £250,000 bill, according to the minutes of the meeting between Mr McCann and Lord Morse.

Steve Packham, of the Loan Charge Action Group, said: “Ten people have killed themselves as a direct result of HMRC’s ruthless persecution of people who the Chancellor herself has described as ‘victims of mis-selling’.

“Yet we now know that just a year before the loan charge was introduced to Parliament, HMRC agreed a deal with large companies letting them pay just 15pc of what they said they owed.”

MPs and campaigners are now demanding that the Government offer contractors the same 15pc terms given to large corporations and open an inquiry into the scandal.

Mr Smith, co-chairman of the Loan and Taxpayer Fairness APPG, said: “It’s absolutely staggering to discover that just a year before the loan charge was introduced to Parliament, that HMRC agreed a deal allowing large companies to settle for just 15pc of what HMRC said they owed, for use of similar arrangements.”

He continued: “Regardless of what Ray McCann recommends in his report on settlement terms, all those facing the loan charge and those pushed to settle to avoid it must all be offered no more than 15pc as full and final settlement.”

HMRC said all settlements are agreed after considering the individual facts of each case and made under our published settlement terms.

A spokesman said: “We don’t recognise these claims. We’re absolutely committed to ensuring every taxpayer, regardless of size, pays the tax that’s legally due.

“Given an independent review is under way it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/money/2025/07/04/TELEMMGLPICT000376025470_17516338389710_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJOZhgFdjG6wTh7yhMdOZ3L6Xj2WECU5tGTp4vDMBGsY.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-07-05 13:14:49.944814

He has also repeatedly called out EVs as being unreliable and ""not going very far.""

Before he became buddies with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, he ridiculed him and his businesses.

""When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it’s electric cars that don’t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he’d be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, ‘drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it,"" Trump wrote on social media.

Musk, however, became a Trump advisor when he donated nearly $300 million to his election campaign. That got him appointed to lead the childishly-named Department of Government Efficiency, where he gleefully harassed longtime federal workers and eliminated programs that wasted money doing things like feeding hungry people.

It was a hard-right turn for Musk, which was an odd choice, given that buyers of EVs tend to be Democrats:

""On every dimension, Democrats view EVs more favorably than Republicans do,"" shared Pew Research.

Musk has alienated Tesla's audience

While many CEOs lean right or openly embrace right-wing ideology, it's common to step down from any leadership positions before joining the government. Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, for example, served in the first Trump administration and stepped down from his position running the team.

New York is overly liberal, but Johnson separated his two lives. Musk did not do that, and that's a problem, because Pew data suggests that Republicans are not a real market for EVs.

Environmental benefits: Democrats and those who lean to the Democratic Party are much more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to say EVs are better for the environment than gas vehicles (69% vs. 24%).

Cost to buy: A majority of both Democrats and Republicans say EVs cost more to buy than gas vehicles. But fewer Democrats than Republicans say this (65% vs. 81%).

Cost to charge/fuel: Half of Democrats say EVs cost less to charge than gas vehicles do to fuel. That compares with a quarter of Republicans.

Reliability: Very few Democrats or Republicans think EVs are more reliable than gas vehicles, but Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say this (14% vs. 5%). Half of Democrats say EVs and gas vehicles are about the same on reliability, while 34% say EVs are less reliable. Republicans are even more negative, with 69% saying EVs are less reliable.

Musk's hard-right turn and eventual return to the middle has had major consequences for Tesla.

Tesla sales drop, Musk must go

When a CEO does something that overshadows the brand, they get fired. Both Best Buy and McDonald's removed successful CEOs over inappropriate, but not illegal, relationships.

Musk has done something far worse. He has made it so Tesla's (TSLA) core audience, liberals, sees the Tesla name as a sort of swear word. That has led to many existing owners adding an ""I bought this before Elon went crazy” bumper sticker and new liberal customers staying away.

Tesla sales dropped 13.5% in the second quarter, after also dropping in the first quarter. The company faces the Musk backlash and concerns over its aging vehicle lineup.

Musk has not hurt Tesla irreparably, but his presence makes it harder to fix the problem.

About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans, according to a June AP-NORC poll.

""Musk has acknowledged that his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his embrace of European far-right candidates have hurt the company. But he said earlier this year that much of the sales plunge is due to customers holding off while they waited for an ugrade to Tesla’s best selling Model Y. That new version has been out for months now,"" WTOC.com reported.

Take Musk off the top off the masthead, and liberals can go back to saluting the brand for its social responsibility.

But leave him there, and your target audience simply won't buy. That's not a political decision. It's just business.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE1MzY1NDgyNjEyNTMyNzU1/elon_musk_cp_060325.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 13:14:33.493632

Aggressive investors might wait for dips, but McDonald's remains a defensive play in a volatile sector.","In an era where fast-food giants face relentless competition and shifting consumer preferences, McDonald's has positioned itself as a master of reinvention. By aligning its menu innovations, supply chain optimizations, and customer engagement strategies with evolving demand, the company is not only defending its market leadership but also carving out new opportunities in a $1.1 trillion global fast-food industry. Here's why investors should take note.

Adapting to Consumer Demand: The Plant-Based Pivot

McDonald's recent shift toward plant-based menus reflects a strategic response to rising demand for sustainability and health-conscious eating. While the McPlant burger initially struggled in the U.S. (where consumers prioritized familiarity over novelty), it found success in Europe, where 40% of McDonald's restaurants now offer permanent vegan options. For instance, France's Veggie McPlant Nuggets and the Netherlands' McPlant Steakhouse burger have resonated with regional tastes, driving 20% higher trial rates than traditional items in those markets.

This localized approach highlights a critical insight: one-size-fits-all menus no longer work. By tailoring offerings to regional preferences—such as vegan ice cream in the UK and sustainable packaging globally—McDonald's is capitalizing on the $24.5 billion plant-based protein market while mitigating operational risks.

Supply Chain Mastery: The Backstage Revolution

Behind the scenes, McDonald's has undertaken a structural overhaul to support its innovation ambitions. The creation of the Chief Restaurant Experience Officer (CREO) role, held by Jill McDonald, aims to break down silos between product development, supply chain, and operations. This centralized leadership has already accelerated decision-making, enabling faster launches of items like the McPlant and value-focused breakfast menus.

Key optimizations include:

- Category-specific leadership: Dedicated executives now oversee beef, chicken, and beverages, driving 20% faster product cycles.

- Dynamic pricing tools: AI-driven systems adjust menu prices in real time, boosting margins without alienating price-sensitive customers.

- Self-service kiosks: Now in 90% of U.S. restaurants, these kiosks reduce wait times by 30% while lowering labor costs.

These changes are critical to maintaining operational efficiency, which is key as McDonald's aims to expand its global footprint to 50,000 restaurants by 2027.

Value, Loyalty, and Velocity: The Frontline Strategy

To combat inflation and competition, McDonald's has doubled down on value-driven strategies. Its “Accelerating the Arches” initiative focuses on:

1. Affordable bundles: New value meals, such as the $5 “Snack Wrap” combo, have boosted U.S. foot traffic by 5% in test markets.

2. Loyalty programs: With 175 million active users globally, these programs drive 30% higher repeat visits, contributing $30 billion in annual sales.

3. Digital dominance: The 4Ds strategy (digital, delivery, drive-thru, development) has made McDonald's the fastest-growing fast-food app in 2024, with 100 million new users.

These efforts are paying off: despite a 1% dip in global comparable sales in Q1 2025, McDonald's maintained a 25.2% market share in the U.S. and outperformed rivals like Chipotle, whose share fell to 9.8%.

Market Share and Financials: Navigating Challenges

While McDonald's 2024 revenue rose 2% to $25.9 billion, Q1 2025 results revealed headwinds. U.S. same-store sales fell 3.6%, attributed to lingering effects of the 2023 E. coli scare and cautious consumer spending. However, its 2.27% dividend yield and consistent EPS of $11.39 underscore financial resilience.

Analysts project 5.3% annual revenue growth over the next three years, modest but sustainable in a sector expected to grow at 10%. The key question: Can McDonald's sustain margins as it expands into higher-cost plant-based products?

Investment Outlook: A Steady Hand in Volatile Waters

McDonald's stock (MCD) has weathered economic uncertainty better than many peers, down just 1.4% in 2025 despite broader market volatility. Its $308 fair value estimate (Morningstar) reflects confidence in its brand strength and franchise model, which generates 90% of its revenue.

Backtest the performance of McDonald's (MCD) when buying on the announcement date of quarterly earnings releases and holding for 20 trading days, from 2020 to 2025.

Historically, a buy-and-hold strategy on earnings announcement dates has delivered an average return of 15.74% over 20 days, though with notable volatility—including a maximum drawdown of 15.76%—and underperformance relative to broader market benchmarks.

Investors should consider:

- Long-term growth: McDonald's 2027 expansion target and loyalty-driven recurring revenue position it to outpace competitors.

- Risk mitigation: While its global scale and diversified menu reduce single-market risks, historical data underscores the need for caution: the strategy's 15.76% maximum drawdown highlights volatility, requiring disciplined risk management.

- Valuation: At 23x forward P/E, it's fairly priced but offers stability. However, a Sharpe ratio of 0.28 suggests returns are not sufficiently compensating for risk.

Recommendation: Hold for income investors seeking steady dividends (yield: 2.27%) and moderate growth. Aggressive investors might wait for dips, but McDonald's remains a defensive play in a volatile sector. While the strategy's 15.74% average return over 20 days post-earnings is compelling, the potential for sharp downturns (e.g., 15.76% drawdown) warrants stop-loss measures.

Singapore’s food and beverage (F&B) industry raked in $1.0b in sales in May 2025, according to the latest data from the Department of Statistics.

This marked a 1.4% increase compared to a year ago, with online orders making up more than a quarter (25.2%) of all F&B transactions.

The sector’s month-on-month growth, adjusted for seasonal trends, came in at 1.2%, showing steady consumer demand. But not all segments performed equally.

Food caterers emerged as the clear winners, with sales surging 17.2% YoY, driven by a rise in event and corporate catering. Meanwhile, cafes, food courts, and other casual eateries posted a solid 2.8% increase, with fast food outlets also edging up 1.3%.

In contrast, restaurants saw a 4.2% drop in sales compared to May 2024, suggesting that higher prices or shifting dining habits may be dampening full-service dining demand. On a monthly basis, restaurant sales showed a modest rebound of 0.8%, indicating a possible stabilization.

Online sales remain a major channel for F&B, accounting for more than one in four orders (25.2%), although that was slightly down from 26.0% in April.

The report also showed weakness in the food and alcohol retail category, with sales falling 4.5% YoY and MoM.

The warning comes at a time of strong sales growth, but also of increasing concerns about oversupply and the viability of many of the new manufacturers that have emerged in the country.

Market leader BYD announced that it sold 2.1 million vehicles in the first six months of the year, an increase of 31% compared to the same period in 2024. Almost half of those sales correspond to 100% electric vehicles, with the remainder being hybrids, according to data released by the company.

The manufacturer has been criticized for launching successive rounds of price cuts on its models, the most recent in May, which led several competitors to follow suit.

The president of Great Wall Motors, Wei Jianjun, then warned that the current trajectory threatens the entire industry. For its part, the Chinese government has committed to combating what it describes as a form of exhausting and unproductive competition, which has become characteristic of several sectors in China.

The Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers has called for healthy competition, while the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology stated that the current situation represents an obstacle to the sustainable development of the sector.

China now has over 20,000 Luckin stores. The unique coffee outlet functions without the use of cashiers, utilizing a mobile-only model. They prioritize efficiency and convenience. And now, America is getting a taste of the extremely popular coffee chain. In early July, Luckin opened its first two U.S. stores, both in Manhattan. Customer reviews are positive, highlighting the ease of ordering, low prices, and fun flavors (like pineapple cold brew).

Aside from the newly arrived Luckin, demand for coffee outside the home has been hot enough to drive the number of U.S.-branded coffee shops in America above 40,000. The market value of the companies that own these brands has almost reached $50 billion. According to the World Coffee Portal, these figures are above pre-pandemic levels on average. Its experts expect that figure to top 45,000 by September 2028.

The figure would not be anywhere close to 40,000 if it were not for Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ: SBUX). It has 16,000 U.S. locations, followed by Dunkin’ at just over 9,400.

The store count could rise even more than forecast. COVID-19 hit the industry hard. Project Café USA 2024, World Coffee Portal’s new study, reports, “amid surging industry optimism nearly one-fifth of operators have yet to fully recover from pandemic trading pressures.” The other is the tremendous size of the American coffee market. According to the National Institutes of Health, 174 million people over 20 in the United States drink coffee daily. Other research shows coffee consumption statistics that are even larger than that.

Starbucks paved the road to 40,000 branded coffee shops. The company opened its first store in 1971. Growth was slow at first. Starbucks had only 165 stores when it went public in 1992. Even with over 16,000 stores in America, same-store sales rose 8% in the most recent quarter, a sign that there is enough demand for Starbucks to grow in its home market.

Another reason for the industry to be optimistic about sales prospects is customers’ time in coffee shops. According to the World Coffee Portal, over the past 12 months, 46% of people who went to a location stayed up to 30 minutes.

Finally, if coffee chains can drag drinkers out of their homes, sales could rise more rapidly. Nearly 80% of Americans drink at least one cup of coffee at home.

(ALI) has been named to TIME Magazine’s World’s Most Sustainable Companies 2025, earning a coveted spot among the globe’s top 500 firms recognized for outstanding performance in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices.

“This global distinction affirms that sustainability is not just a pillar of our strategy—it’s embedded in the way we build, grow, and create impact,” said Robert S. Lao, chief sustainability officer at Ayala Land. “It pushes us further to lead in shaping greener, more resilient communities for generations to come.”

A blueprint for green urbanism

Ayala Land’s approach to sustainability spans its full value chain—from land acquisition and master planning to construction and property operations. The result: major milestones in energy use, waste diversion, and sustainable development.

As of end-2024, 96 percent of gross leasable area (GLA) across ALI’s malls, offices, and hotels is powered by renewable energy, covering 101 commercial properties. The company also reported a 32-percent waste diversion rate from landfills across its operations and construction sites, with innovative pilot programs for plastics, food waste, and residuals underway.

To date, ALI has 34 green-certified buildings totaling over 1.16 million square meters of floor area, accredited under LEED, BERDE, WELL, and EDGE standards. Investments in green mobility—including pedestrian zones, bike lanes, EV charging stations, and improved access to mass transit—further reinforce its urban sustainability framework.

Net zero and ESG transparency

ALI is advancing toward Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050, with near-term goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by 2030. These targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)—aligning ALI with best-in-class global climate standards.

The Digital Divide: Why Smaller Players Lag While giants invest in AI and app-driven ecosystems, smaller chains face a stark disadvantage.
Conclusion: Loyalty as a Long-Term Play In a fragmented market, loyalty programs are the ultimate retention tool.","The fast-casual restaurant sector is at a crossroads. Amid rising inflation, shifting consumer preferences, and intensifying competition, the industry's survival hinges on one critical lever: data-driven customer retention. For chains like Chipotle, Starbucks, and Wingstop, loyalty programs are no longer optional—they are the cornerstone of growth. These companies are leveraging advanced analytics, experiential rewards, and digital ecosystems to build moats against smaller rivals and carve out long-term profitability. Here's why investors should pay close attention.

The Loyalty Advantage: Fueling Recurring Revenue

The fragmented fast-casual landscape is crowded with players, but not all can monetize loyalty effectively. Starbucks, for example, derives 41% of U.S. sales from its 34 million-strong Starbucks Rewards members, who spend three times more and visit more frequently than non-members. This program isn't just a perk—it's a revenue engine. Meanwhile, Wingstop's upcoming loyalty rollout (set for late 2025) promises to mine data from its 50 million-member MyWingstop platform to deliver hyper-personalized rewards, targeting Gen Z and millennials with tiered benefits.

Chipotle, though struggling with recent traffic declines, is betting on limited-time offers (LTOs) like its Honey Chicken promotion to reignite engagement. These LTOs act as de facto loyalty drivers, with 40% of orders including the product during its March launch. The result? A 1.9% average check size increase—proof that innovation can offset transactional slumps.

The Digital Divide: Why Smaller Players Lag

While giants invest in AI and app-driven ecosystems, smaller chains face a stark disadvantage. Take Papa John's: its loyalty program expansion—lowering redemption thresholds to attract members—boosted membership but reduced average order sizes, a classic trade-off between volume and margin. Meanwhile, Cava's point-based program (noted for simplicity) added 50,000 weekly members, showing how user-friendly design can outperform complexity.

The gap is widening. Starbucks' app updates, for instance, now feature “price transparency” and advanced scheduling tools, turning digital ordering into a retention tool. Wingstop, by contrast, plans to use AI to predict customer preferences, enabling customized rewards that smaller rivals can't match. The message is clear: data integration is the new moat.

Resilience Amid Inflation: Value vs. Experience

Inflation has forced consumers to prioritize affordability, but fast-casual leaders are adapting. Chipotle's Chipotlane kiosks (small, high-margin locations) and McDonald's McValue menu prove that value-driven innovation can stabilize traffic. Starbucks, however, is betting on experiential differentiation—its “Starbucks Monday” campaigns and TikTok engagement tripled Q1 2025 interactions, signaling a return to brand relevance.

The key takeaway? Chains that blend affordability with emotional engagement (e.g., Taco Bell's Flamin' Hot Burrito) are outperforming peers. Their loyalty programs act as hubs for these strategies, funneling data to refine offerings.

Investment Thesis: Where to Bet

For investors, the playbook is straightforward: focus on companies with scalable loyalty ecosystems and menu agility.

Starbucks (SBUX): Despite Q1 2025's 2% U.S. sales decline, its $31 billion in annual loyalty-driven sales (per McDonald's benchmarks) and digital-first strategy position it to rebound. The “Back to Starbucks” initiative and app upgrades are critical to watch.

Wingstop (WING): Its delayed loyalty rollout (2026) is a risk, but its AI-powered data strategy and 50M-member base could deliver outsized returns if executed well.

Chipotle (CMG): While facing near-term traffic headwinds, its LTO-driven engagement and Chipotlane expansion offer a path to margin recovery.

Avoid players relying on price cuts alone—Papa John's (PZZA) and Dunkin' (DNKN), for example, lack the digital depth to sustain long-term loyalty.

Risks and Reality Checks

The sector isn't without pitfalls. Economic sensitivity remains a threat—low-income consumers cut back first, as seen in Starbucks' transaction declines. Competition is also fierce: Dutch Bros' 13.4% visit growth highlights the danger of complacency. Investors must monitor metrics like loyalty member retention rates and digital sales growth to gauge execution.

Conclusion: Loyalty as a Long-Term Play

In a fragmented market, loyalty programs are the ultimate retention tool. Chains like Starbucks and Chipotle are proving that data-driven, experience-focused strategies can turn customers into lifelong advocates—even in tough economic climates. For investors, backing these leaders now could yield outsized rewards as the sector consolidates.

The future belongs to those who turn data into delight—and fast-casual's giants are leading the charge.

In a bid to transition passenger vehicles in the province to zero-emission Quebec was awarding automakers and dealerships credits for each ZEV sold under its adoption standard.
And, before this year, Quebec was well on its way to meeting those targets hitting nearly 40 per cent ZEV market penetration in Q4 2024.
Previously, Quebec’s ZEV adoption rate artificially raised Canada’s national ZEV adoption rate.
Last year, says CEC’s executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis, ZEVs made up one in five vehicles sold worldwide.","Hybrid-electrics will now generate a half credit while plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles with 80 km-plus electric range will generate a full credit

Canada’s leading zero-emission vehicle adopting jurisdiction is recalibrating its rules and regulations around passenger vehicle decarbonization.

Quebec’s environment minister, Benoit Charette, says the shifting market is forcing the province to reassess its zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) adoption standard.

In a bid to transition passenger vehicles in the province to zero-emission Quebec was awarding automakers and dealerships credits for each ZEV sold under its adoption standard.

A battery-electric vehicle (BEV) earned a full credit, while a plug-in hybrid-electric vehicle (PHEV) with an electric range of at least 80 kilometres earned a half credit.

Now, under the changed rules, both a BEV and a 80 km-plus PHEV will earn a full credit, while lower range PHEVs and gasoline-powered, hybrid-electric vehicles (HEV) will earn a half credit.

A changing market

Currently, Quebec’s rules says that, by the 2026 model year, 32.5 per cent of all new passenger vehicles sold in the province must be ZEVs. That amount increases to 85 per cent in 2030 and 100 per cent in 2035.

And, before this year, Quebec was well on its way to meeting those targets hitting nearly 40 per cent ZEV market penetration in Q4 2024.

However, with the “pausing” of the provincial Roulez Vert rebate and the end of the federal Incentive for Zero-Emission Vehicles in January and February, Quebec saw its robust ZEV sales collapse to 13.2 per cent in Q1 2025.

The change to Quebec’s definition of what vehicles constitute a zero-emission vehicle appear to be a direct response to the downturn in sales.

A wider impact?

Previously, Quebec’s ZEV adoption rate artificially raised Canada’s national ZEV adoption rate.

When the province saw a massive decline in sales this year, so too did the rest of the country. That ignited a renewed call from industry groups to aggressively lobby the government to either scrap entirely or pause the federal ZEV Availability Standard, which, they say, is not possible to achieve.

The federal government has yet to indicate it is considering changes to its national standard.

(The federal ZEV sales mandate requires that 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sold in Canada next year be zero-emission and rises gradually to 100 per cent by 2035.)

But British Columbia is reviewing its approach (by 2026 26 per cent of new light-duty vehicles sold must be ZEVs, followed by 90 per cent of new light-duty vehicles sold must be ZEVs in 2030 and 100 per cent in 2035) and expects to put forward an updated recommendation by the fall.

In a statement, Clean Energy Canada points out that if Canadian provinces or the federal government back track on the ZEV standards it will put the country out of sync with the rest of the world.

Last year, says CEC’s executive director Rachel Doran and director of public affairs Joanna Kyriazis, ZEVs made up one in five vehicles sold worldwide.

Final Takeaway: A Green Logistics Leader to Watch ARGAN's ESG integration isn't just a marketing gimmick—it's a profitable, scalable strategy that attracts top-tier tenants and investors.
With carbon-neutral warehouses like Sorigny leading the way, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on Europe's shift to sustainable logistics.","The global shift toward sustainability is reshaping industries, and logistics real estate is no exception. Investors seeking exposure to Europe's green infrastructure boom should take note of ARGAN, a French logistics giant that's leveraging its Aut0nom® carbon-neutral warehouses to attract blue-chip tenants and secure long-term growth. The recent 9-year lease with Danone for a Sorigny warehouse—exemplifying ARGAN's ESG-driven strategy—is a blueprint for how sustainability is becoming a competitive advantage in real estate. Here's why this matters for investors.

The Danone Lease: A Blueprint for ESG-Driven Growth

In July 2025, ARGAN signed a 9-year lease with Danone for a 8,200 sq.m carbon-neutral warehouse in Sorigny, France. This deal isn't just about space; it's a testament to the power of ESG integration in modern logistics. The warehouse, part of ARGAN's Aut0nom® portfolio, features photovoltaic panels, energy storage batteries, and electric heat pumps to eliminate grid reliance, reducing CO₂ emissions by a factor of 10 compared to traditional facilities. Residual emissions are offset via a reforestation project in Cestas, ensuring carbon neutrality.

The lease's financial appeal is clear: a 9-year term locks in stable rental income for ARGAN while reducing Danone's environmental footprint. Crucially, the Sorigny site is strategically positioned near major highways (A10/A85), minimizing logistics costs for Danone. The relocation of 60 employees from a nearby site further underscores the operational efficiency gains.

This partnership isn't an outlier. Danone's decision reflects a broader trend: ESG criteria are now table stakes for corporate real estate decisions. Tenants like Danone prioritize sustainable infrastructure to meet regulatory demands (e.g., the EU's Green Deal) and consumer expectations. For ARGAN, this means long-term leases and premium pricing power.

The Scalability of ARGAN's Sustainable Model

ARGAN's Aut0nom® model isn't confined to Sorigny. As of 2025, the company operates 15 carbon-neutral sites across 3.7 million sq.m, generating €205 million in annual rental income. This scale is a moat against competitors:

Pre-let, pre-qualified pipelines: 10 projects in its €220 million 2025–2026 investment plan are already pre-let to blue-chip clients, minimizing vacancy risk.

Cost efficiencies: Aut0nom® technology reduces operational expenses (e.g., energy savings from solar panels) and attracts tenants willing to pay a premium for sustainability.

Geographic reach: Focused on France's Atlantic Arc and key logistics hubs, ARGAN is capitalizing on undersupplied markets with high demand for green infrastructure.

The Sorigny deal is part of a €18 million investment in two Aut0nom® sites (along with Béziers), demonstrating ARGAN's ability to replicate its model at scale.

ESG Ratings: The Secret Sauce to Financial Resilience

ARGAN's ESG credentials are its financial safety net:

- Credit rating: Its BBB- investment-grade rating (Standard & Poor's) allows access to low-cost capital, critical for funding €200+ million in green projects.

- Third-party validation: Aut0nom® sites are certified by frameworks like BREEAM, while ARGAN itself holds accolades from Ethifinance (gold medal) and Ecovadis (silver medal). These ratings attract ESG-focused investors and reduce regulatory risks.

- Stock performance:

As of June 2025, ARGAN's stock had returned ~12% year-to-date, outpacing the MSCI World Real Estate Index (8%). This outperformance reflects investor confidence in its ESG strategy.

Building a Compelling Investment Case

ARGAN's model mitigates risks and capitalizes on secular trends:

1. Regulatory tailwinds: The EU's push for net-zero logistics infrastructure by 2030 creates demand for carbon-neutral warehouses.

2. Tenant stickiness: Long-term leases (e.g., Danone's 9-year term) stabilize cash flows and reduce vacancy risk.

3. Premium pricing power: ESG-conscious tenants are willing to pay more for sustainable facilities, supporting 6–7% annual rental growth through 2027 (per analyst estimates).

For investors, ARGAN offers a high-conviction play on Europe's green logistics transition. Its credit profile, scalable Aut0nom® pipeline, and strategic location in undersupplied markets make it a leader in an industry poised for growth.

Final Takeaway: A Green Logistics Leader to Watch

ARGAN's ESG integration isn't just a marketing gimmick—it's a profitable, scalable strategy that attracts top-tier tenants and investors. With carbon-neutral warehouses like Sorigny leading the way, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on Europe's shift to sustainable logistics. For portfolios seeking exposure to the green economy, ARGAN deserves serious consideration.",,N,,2025-07-05 13:14:44.300919

However, the launch of the Daily Double marks an important new development.
McDonald's responds to Wendy's The name Daily Double seems to be inspired by the American show Jeopardy!, but its commercial intent is clear: to rival Wendy's and its classics.
However, due to its positive reception, since June 26 it has been officially added across the United States, according to All Recipes.
Ultimately, McDonald's has chosen to innovate within tradition, creating a simple yet effective product that could win many fans in the United States.","Competition in the fast food world never stops. Each chain looks for ways to attract their customers with new products or the return of classics. In this constant game, McDonald's has taken a strategic step that's generating a lot of buzz.

McDonald's has introduced a new product that seems designed to compete directly with one of Wendy's icons. This new item is the Daily Double, a double burger that's now available across the United States. It promises to change the way customers see McDonald's traditional menu.

The Daily Double: a classic bet with a twist

McDonald's isn't unfamiliar with changes to its menu, although it has always kept its star products well defined. However, the launch of the Daily Double marks an important new development. It's a burger with two beef patties, cheese, tomato, onion, shredded lettuce, and mayonnaise, an ingredient that's not common in its classic combinations.

This new sandwich breaks with McDonald's habit of using ketchup and mustard on most of its burgers. In addition, ingredients like lettuce and tomato are usually reserved for its most recognized products, such as the Quarter Pounder with Cheese Deluxe or the famous Big Mac. That's why this combination feels new and refreshing for the chain's fans.

Although the Daily Double isn't a gastronomic revolution, it does represent an important change in menu strategy. It doesn't aim to innovate with overly exotic ingredients, but rather to offer a solid and attractive option that can compete head-to-head with Wendy's famous Dave's Double burger. This one also features double beef and a similar mix of ingredients.

McDonald's responds to Wendy's

The name Daily Double seems to be inspired by the American show Jeopardy!, but its commercial intent is clear: to rival Wendy's and its classics. Originally, McDonald's launched this burger only in a few key cities like Miami, Seattle, and Chicago. However, due to its positive reception, since June 26 it has been officially added across the United States, according to All Recipes.

In addition, McDonald's has added the Daily Double to its value menu, available since July 22. For example, the McValue Meal combo, which previously offered options like McChicken or McDouble for five euros, now includes the possibility to order the Daily Double for six or seven euros. The package comes with nuggets, fries, and a drink, making it an economical and complete option.

Ultimately, McDonald's has chosen to innovate within tradition, creating a simple yet effective product that could win many fans in the United States. With this move, the chain shows that it's ready to keep its position in the market and continue being a benchmark in the world of fast burgers.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/fachada-exterior-wendys-estados-unidos-con-mujer-sorprendida-y-logo-mcdonalds-al-lado_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-07-05 13:15:06.529052

Embracing its move as a late mover, Albertsons is turning timing into a strategic advantage. The retail giant is reimagining the future of digital retail from its Bengaluru global capability centre (GCC) to build smarter and more agile solutions. ""Our goal is not to catch up; it's about figuring out how to build for the future,"" said Anuj Dhanda, EVP - chief information and transformation officer at Albertsons Companies.

""There's a certain late-mover advantage—we're now able to design solutions with AI and data science at the core, rather than as an afterthought. Many capabilities that once required heavy coding can now be built with little to no code, dramatically increasing speed and agility. That's why we're so excited about our presence in Bengaluru and the incredible talent here driving this transformation."" Albertsons has over 2,200 stores, and some of its banners include Safeway, Vons, Acme, Tom Thumb, Randalls, United Supermarkets, Haggen, Carrs, Kings Food Markets, and Balducci's Food Lover's Market.

Dhanda said the US retail giant is aiming for a technology refresh. ""We need a technology 2.0, with significant shifts underway—that's where Bengaluru and the GCC come in. For success, we realised we need much greater velocity and agility, and to build far more of our own IP than we do today. Our goal is to change the way we work in technology. We've integrated product, data, and full-stack engineers into fully functional, global teams to enable seamless collaboration. We're applying AI and automation across the entire tech stack—not just in software development, but from requirements gathering to infrastructure and observability.""

Advt

Many GCCs are increasingly relocating tech roles to India, signalling growing confidence in shifting solution ownership. ""My intent is to have several of my direct reports to be based here. If we consider the leadership group—around 17 to 18 vice-presidents and above—the goal is for at least a third of them to be in Bengaluru within the next 18 months,"" Dhanda said.

He also said that the insourcing mix will shift dramatically, reducing reliance on external IT providers. ""We developed numerous digital systems, including pharmacy and health capabilities, and upgraded our financial systems. Going forward, our investment will move from foundational upgrades to development-driven initiatives. While we currently depend heavily on third parties like TCS, Cognizant, and Sapient for resources, we plan to bring much of that work inhouse, empowering our own associates. Our focus is to reduce third-party dependence and build stronger internal teams.""

Lalit Ahuja, founder of full-stack GCC firm ANSR, said Albertsons is leveraging the late-mover advantage—not late to the party, but arriving at the perfect time to capitalise on a mature market. For retailers, the landscape is defined by thin margins, highly perishable inventory, and intense tech-driven competition—with e-commerce playing an increasingly vital role. ""Some companies struggle because tech centres are set up suboptimally. But there are firms which are set up with sharper tech differentiation. We're witnessing significant maturity in the types of roles being introduced, driving modernisation of its tech stack. This includes mainstream adoption of new technologies and a stronger emphasis on product and functional ownership. And AI has become the greatest accelerator of efficiency,"" Ahuja said. Last year, Accenture picked up a significant minority stake in the Bengaluru and US-based ANSR, which set up over 170 GCCs in India.

This trend is not entirely new, as seen with Starbucks locations inside Target stores. However, the number of brand-owned and operated coffee shops appears to be on the rise. For instance, Ralph’s Coffee, owned by Ralph Lauren, opened in Manhattan in 2014 and is now surrounded by other brand cafés, such as the Blue Box Café at Tiffany & Co., a Capital One Café, and a Uniqlo Coffee around its Fifth Avenue location.

Post-Covid, there has been a renewed interest in creating or maintaining ""third places""—spaces where people can spend time outside of their homes and workplaces. Brands are investing in customer experiences to broaden their customer bases both online and offline, and coffee shops seem to be a effective way to achieve this. Uniqlo, for example, opened its first coffee shop in North America at its Fifth Avenue store to enhance the shopping experience and project a welcoming brand persona. Nicolas Cessot, head of marketing for Uniqlo North America, highlighted that this move is a global opportunity to spread brand awareness to customers worldwide.

Uniqlo's coffee shops in Tokyo and Manila prioritize customer experience and hospitality, reflecting a cultural emphasis on these values. Other retailers, like Maison Kitsuné and Muji, have also expanded their hospitality offerings, with Maison Kitsuné opening its first Café Kitsuné in Okayama, Japan, in 2013, and Muji opening a food market in Manhattan earlier this year. American brands like Kate Spade and Coach have also ventured into the hospitality space in regions like Dubai and Jakarta, Indonesia, as well as in Texas and New Jersey.

Brand coffee shops allow retailers to reach customers with different interests, including those who may not be in the market for new clothes but still want a cup of coffee. This strategy is particularly appealing to higher-end brands like Dior and Ralph Lauren, which aim to reach customers outside their usual demographic. Michelle Baumann, chief strategy officer, commerce at VML, noted that a small purchase like a coffee can increase customer ""dwell time,"" making them more likely to browse and purchase other items. Additionally, these cafés can generate social media exposure, with customers often sharing videos and images of their experiences online.

Capital One, which opened its first Capital One Café in 2014, aims to enhance the customer experience by offering in-person interactions around customer service and money management needs. Jennifer Windbeck, SVP of retail bank channels and operations, explained that the cafés host events like coding classes and financial literacy workshops to build Capital One’s brand image beyond just being a credit-card company. The cafés also run promotions to encourage repeat foot traffic, such as offering free drinks every Monday of the MLB season. While the ultimate goal is to drive customer sign-ups, the cafés and deals are open to everyone, not just Capital One customers, allowing the brand to market to the masses in an organic way.

Opening a coffee shop can be a costly endeavor, considering the labor, materials, and potential for stains from coffee spills. However, the continued expansion of Capital One Cafés suggests that the brand is satisfied with its results. There are also reputational risks, as poor service or long wait times can detract from the overall shopping experience. Some retailers choose to work with existing coffee brands to ensure product quality and service standards. Despite these challenges, the trend of retailers opening coffee shops is expected to continue, as it introduces novelty and surprises customers with additional offerings.",,N,,2025-07-05 06:59:23.346729

“We want to be our authentic selves and have a real voice at work and not punished or fired for simply showing up as who we are,” said one Kensington Square worker. “We’re done being silenced and told who to be. That goes against everything Starbucks claimed to stand for and we’re not staying quiet anymore. Starbucks needs to be better.”

“If you feel destabilized, under-appreciated or unheard, and you believe in a healthy, respectful workplace, just know this: from one worker to another, you are not alone,” said another Kensington Square worker. “For us, it also came down to wanting better staffing, real job security and a real say in the policies that impact us every day.”

The USW encourages Starbucks workers from other stores to take the step toward organizing. With each new location that joins, workers gain the collective strength needed to negotiate for fair treatment, better working conditions and respect at work.

“Workers at Kensington Square are joining a growing movement of baristas who are standing up and demanding better,” said Scott Lunny, USW Western Canada Director.

“These workers are showing immense courage and solidarity by organizing for their rights, and we are proud to stand with them as they build power on the job. Every new group of workers that joins the union strengthens the voice of all Starbucks workers across the country. It takes time to build, but I’m proud of the work they are doing,” added Lunny.

Iron poisoning is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6.","IRVINE, Calif. — Supplement company iHerb has recalled about 60,000 iron-containing dietary supplements under the California Gold Nutrition label because their packaging violates federal child-resistant requirements, posing a deadly poisoning risk to young children.

The recall, announced June 26, affects three products: Daily Prenatal Multi, Ultamins Women's Multivitamin, and Ultamins Women's 50+ Multivitamin. The supplements were sold online through Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Target.com and other websites from January 2019 through April 2025 for $8 to $18.

The recalled supplements contain iron, which federal law requires to be packaged in child-resistant containers under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The bottles and blister packs fail to meet these standards, creating a risk of fatal poisoning if swallowed by young children.

No injuries have been reported in connection with the recall.

The Daily Prenatal Multivitamin comes in white bottles with white lids and gold border labels, containing 60 fish gelatin softgel supplements. The Women's Multivitamin and Women's 50+ Multivitamin feature dark purple packaging with gold border labels, each containing 60 capsules in foil packaging.

Consumers should immediately secure the recalled supplements away from children and contact iHerb for refunds. To receive a refund, customers should email ProductRecall@iherb.com with the subject line ""Iron Supplement Refund"" and include their name, product names and quantities, and photographic evidence of destruction showing their initials and date.

The manufacturer, iHerb LLC, doing business as Madre Labs LLC of Irvine, California, is contacting all known purchasers directly.

Iron poisoning is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. The Consumer Product Safety Commission requires iron-containing supplements with 30 milligrams or more of iron per dosage unit to be packaged in child-resistant containers.

Central to the strategy is Mist AI, Juniper's self‑healing operating system that uses machine‑learning to spot faults and optimise traffic before users notice a slowdown.
The merger expands HPE's scale and reach, particularly in cloud-native infrastructure and automation, aligning more closely with its long-term AI networking ambitions.
Earlier this year, HPE announced a workforce reduction of around 2,500 employees—about 4% of its global headcount—as part of a broader cost-cutting effort expected to save $350 million (£256.42 million) annually.","Hewlett Packard Enterprise has announced closing its long‑trailed, all‑cash purchase of Juniper Networks, paying $40 (£29.30) a share—about $14 billion (£8.06 billion) in equity value—and creating a new, AI‑centred networking giant poised to challenge Cisco's decades‑long dominance.

The deal, first announced in January 2024, cleared its final hurdle on June 28, 2025 when the US Department of Justice approved a last‑minute settlement.

Regulators Relent After Key Concessions

Antitrust officials had warned the transaction could squeeze competition in the mid‑market wireless‑LAN sector, where HPE's Aruba and Juniper's Mist brands hold the second‑ and third‑largest shares behind Cisco.

To win approval, HPE agreed to divest its Aruba 'Instant On' small‑business Wi‑Fi line and to license portions of its wireless source‑code to an independent third party. The settlement also obliges HPE to guarantee limited access to Juniper's Mist AIOps telemetry engine for rival vendors, a move the DOJ says 'preserves choice for campus and branch customers'.

AI First, Networking Second

HPE will fold Juniper and Aruba into a single HPE Networking unit, headed by Juniper's long‑time chief executive Rami Rahim. Central to the strategy is Mist AI, Juniper's self‑healing operating system that uses machine‑learning to spot faults and optimise traffic before users notice a slowdown.

HPE says bolting Mist onto its GreenLake edge‑to‑cloud platform creates the industry's first 'cloud‑native, AI‑driven stack' spanning switching, routing, Wi‑Fi and security. Chief executive Antonio Neri defined the merger as transformational—doubling their networking revenue and placing HPE at the heart of data‑first IT.

Analyst Applause Tempered by Integration Jitters

Industry analysts have broadly acknowledged the strategic significance of HPE's acquisition, noting it substantially enhances the company's position in the AI-driven networking space. The merger expands HPE's scale and reach, particularly in cloud-native infrastructure and automation, aligning more closely with its long-term AI networking ambitions.

However, experts have cautioned that integration challenges lie ahead—particularly around overlapping product lines such as ArubaOS and Junos. Analysts have highlighted potential friction in channel-partner ecosystems and warned that delays in unifying operating systems could create confusion for customers.

Meanwhile, earlier reporting from Network World reflects unease among Juniper's enterprise clients, who have expressed concern about possible changes to technical support and the risk of losing key talent during the transition.

Cisco Looks Over its Shoulder

Cisco continues to dominate with about 39% of global switching revenue. With Juniper's inclusion, adding around 5% to HPE's existing ~15% share, HPE could soon command mid-teens market share and place ahead of Arista in certain segments.

Juniper also brings deep telecom‑class routing expertise, opening fresh inroads into the 5G carrier market at a time when operators are increasingly adopting AI-powered traffic and energy optimisation.

High Stakes for Balance Sheet

The $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks marks Hewlett Packard Enterprise's largest strategic move since its 2015 split from HP Inc. Management has outlined plans to deliver approximately $450 million (£329.68 million) in annual cost synergies within three years and has signalled its intent to expand networking margins into the low- to mid-teens range, though no formal target has been issued for consolidated operating margins.

Earlier this year, HPE announced a workforce reduction of around 2,500 employees—about 4% of its global headcount—as part of a broader cost-cutting effort expected to save $350 million (£256.42 million) annually. While Moody's has maintained a stable outlook on the company's credit rating, S&P Global revised its outlook to negative, citing integration risks and elevated leverage following the transaction.

The issue behind the recall, according to the FDA’s report, stems from a “lack of assurance of sterility.” Further details were not provided, nor was an explanation provided for how the problem was discovered. However, a 2024 analysis of FDA-enforced drug recalls between 2012 and 2023 found “lack of assurance in sterility” made up 48% of the reviewed recalls.

Vietnam's electronics sector—a $100+ billion industry dominated by Samsung, Intel, and Foxconn—faces the largest headwinds.
U.S. Re-shoring Plays: Manufacturing: Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) may benefit from U.S. firms repatriating production.
Currency Strategy: The U.S. dollar (USD) may strengthen against the Vietnamese dong (VND) as Vietnam's trade surplus shrinks.
Conclusion The U.S.-Vietnam deal is a watershed moment for Asian supply chains.","The U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement, finalized in July 2025, has ignited a seismic shift in global supply chains. By imposing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports and a 40% duty on transshipped goods—primarily targeting Chinese-origin products—the deal is accelerating manufacturing relocations and reshaping investment landscapes across Asia. For investors, this is a critical inflection point: sectors with exposure to Vietnam's key exports (electronics, apparel, and machinery) are poised for growth, while emerging markets overly reliant on transshipment risk obsolescence. Meanwhile, U.S. industries gaining tariff-free access to Vietnam's market present compelling opportunities. Let's dissect the implications.

Manufacturing Exodus: Asia's New Supply Chain Order

The 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods directly penalizes companies using the country as an export hub to the U.S. Simultaneously, the 40% transshipment levy creates a steep penalty for firms mislabeling Chinese-made goods. This dual mechanism forces manufacturers to either:

1. Diversify Supply Chains: Companies reliant on Vietnam (e.g., Nike, Lululemon) may expand production into countries like Indonesia or the Philippines to avoid tariffs.

2. Re-shore or Near-shore: U.S. firms may repatriate production or invest in Mexico's maquiladoras, where existing trade agreements offer lower costs than tariff-hit Vietnam.

The result? A fragmented supply chain landscape favoring firms with geographic flexibility. Vietnam's electronics sector—a $100+ billion industry dominated by Samsung, Intel, and Foxconn—faces the largest headwinds. . Meanwhile, U.S. semiconductor firms like Texas Instruments (TXN) or Applied Materials (AMAT) could benefit from Vietnam's need for advanced tech inputs.

The Vulnerable: Thailand and Malaysia in the Crosshairs

Emerging markets that haven't negotiated reciprocal trade deals with the U.S. are sitting ducks. Thailand and Malaysia, for example, face the threat of 46% tariffs unless they strike similar deals by July 9, 2026. Their risk profile is twofold:

- Transshipment Dependency: Both countries are hubs for Chinese goods bound to the U.S., making them vulnerable to U.S. scrutiny.

- Sector Exposure: Thailand's automotive sector (Toyota, Honda) and Malaysia's semiconductor industry (Intel, AMD) are particularly exposed.

. Investors should consider shorting these markets or avoiding equities tied to their export-reliant industries until trade terms clarify.

U.S. Sectors: Winners in Vietnam's Open Market

Vietnam's pledge to grant “zero tariffs” on U.S. imports opens doors for sectors with competitive advantages:

1. Agriculture: U.S. soybean, corn, and poultry exporters (e.g., Tyson Foods (TSN), Cargill) gain direct access to Vietnam's growing consumer market.

2. Energy: Vietnam's hunger for LNG to fuel its industries aligns with U.S. liquefaction capacity. Cheniere Energy (LNG) and Tellurian (TELL) could benefit.

3. Luxury and Autos: U.S. SUVs (Ford (F), GM (GM)) and high-end brands (Coach, Ralph Lauren) face no tariffs, making them competitive against European rivals.

Investment Playbook: Positioning for the New Order

Long Vietnam Exposure:

ETFs: The iShares MSCI Vietnam ETF (VNM) tracks companies like Vinhomes (VHM) and Masan Group, which may thrive in a reshaped supply chain.

Sector Plays: Electronics (FPT Corporation), textiles (Vietnam Textile Garment Group), and logistics (Gemadept) could see restructuring-driven demand.

Short Over-Exposed Asian Peers:

Avoid Thailand's automotive stocks (e.g., Toyota Auto Thailand) and Malaysia's semiconductor plays (e.g., Renesas Electronics) until trade terms stabilize.

U.S. Re-shoring Plays:

Manufacturing: Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) may benefit from U.S. firms repatriating production.

Technology: Intel (INTC) could capitalize on Vietnam's need for chip imports.

Currency Strategy:

The U.S. dollar (USD) may strengthen against the Vietnamese dong (VND) as Vietnam's trade surplus shrinks. Investors could short VND via forex markets or inverse ETFs.

Risks and Uncertainties

Transshipment Enforcement: The U.S. has yet to clarify thresholds for “substantial transformation” of goods. A near-zero tolerance for Chinese inputs could disrupt Vietnam's electronics sector.

Geopolitical Fallout: China's potential retaliation (e.g., tariffs on Vietnamese goods) could backfire on Vietnam's economy.

Legal Challenges: Ongoing lawsuits under the IEEPA cloud the tariffs' longevity.

Conclusion

The U.S.-Vietnam deal is a watershed moment for Asian supply chains. Investors should pivot toward Vietnam's key export sectors and U.S. industries gaining tariff-free access, while hedging against overexposed peers. This isn't just about tariffs—it's a structural shift toward a more fragmented, U.S.-centric manufacturing world. Move swiftly, but stay attuned to enforcement clarity and geopolitical fireworks.",,N,,2025-07-05 08:01:30.273702

While no illnesses were reported, the incident underscores a critical truth: protein supply chains remain fragile, and companies that fail to prioritize safety and sustainability risk reputational and financial ruin. For investors, this is a pivotal moment to reassess risk exposure and identify opportunities in ESG-aligned sectors like food safety technology and sustainable agriculture.

Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: A Systemic Risk

The Oscar Mayer recall is not an isolated event. In 2024, Boar's Head deli meats were linked to a Listeria outbreak that caused 10 deaths and over 60 illnesses. These incidents reveal systemic weaknesses in protein supply chains, including:

- Contamination Risks: Listeria's resilience in refrigeration and freezing environments means even minor lapses in processing or storage can lead to recalls.

- Global Distribution: The Oscar Mayer recall affected products in the U.S., British Virgin Islands, and Hong Kong, highlighting how modern supply chains amplify geographic risk exposure.

- Cost Pressures: Recalls exact a toll on profitability. Kraft Heinz's operating income dropped 63% in 2024 to $1.68 billion, likely exacerbated by recall-related expenses.

The company's shares have fallen to a 52-week low of $26.63, reflecting investor skepticism about its ability to manage operational risks.

ESG Implications: Trust is the New Currency

The recall has stark ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) ramifications:

- Social Risk: Listeria outbreaks disproportionately harm vulnerable populations, damaging brand equity. The Oscar Mayer brand, a cornerstone of Kraft Heinz's portfolio, now faces reputational erosion.

- Governance Gaps: While the recall was initiated proactively, the root cause—whether supplier oversight, facility sanitation, or testing protocols—remains critical. Investors must scrutinize companies' ESG governance frameworks, including third-party audits and crisis management protocols.

- Regulatory Scrutiny: The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is monitoring recall effectiveness, signaling heightened compliance demands.

Investment Opportunities in Food Safety and Sustainability

The fallout from the Oscar Mayer recall creates both risks and opportunities for investors:

1. Food Safety Technology: A Defensive Play

Companies enabling real-time contamination detection or blockchain traceability are poised to benefit. Consider:

- Thermo Fisher Scientific: A leader in lab equipment for pathogen testing.

- IBM Food Trust: Blockchain platforms that enhance supply chain transparency.

2. Sustainable Agriculture: Building Resilient Supply Chains

Investors should favor firms with ESG-aligned practices, such as:

- Cargill: A diversified agribusiness prioritizing food safety and sustainable sourcing.

- Danone: A global food giant emphasizing clean-label products and regenerative agriculture.

3. ESG Funds Targeting Consumer Staples

Funds like the iShares ESG MSCI ACWI ETF (ESGU) or sector-specific options like ARKW (ARK Innovation ETF), which include food tech disruptors, offer diversified exposure to companies with strong ESG profiles.

Conclusion: ESG is the Compass for Navigating Food Industry Risks

The Oscar Mayer recall is a wake-up call for investors to demand transparency and resilience in food supply chains. Companies with weak ESG practices face not only financial penalties but also eroding consumer trust—a liability in an era of heightened health consciousness. Conversely, firms investing in food safety tech, sustainable sourcing, and robust governance will capture market share and attract ESG-focused capital.

Investment Advice:

- Avoid: Consumer goods companies with poor ESG ratings in food safety or governance.

- Buy: ESG-aligned firms in food safety tech and sustainable agriculture.

- Monitor: The performance of companies like Kraft Heinz—any failure to address systemic risks could lead to further margin contraction and valuation declines.

The food industry's next phase will reward those who prioritize safety and sustainability. Investors who align with these principles will be positioned to profit as supply chains evolve to meet 21st-century demands.

This data underscores the growing frequency of contamination risks, reinforcing the need for proactive ESG strategies.

However, the overall pace of expansion remained subdued, rounding off the worst calendar quarter since 2023.

Growth was led by India, followed by the US. But while improved expansions were reported in Japan, the UK, Australia, mainland China and the eurozone, growth in all cases remained modest at best, and especially weak in the eurozone. Canada meanwhile continued to report the steepest contraction of the major economies, followed by Russia and Brazil.

The subdued overall pace of economic expansion was accompanied by a deterioration in business expectations about the year ahead, which fell to one of the lowest levels seen since the pandemic. Although reports of the damaging effect of ""uncertainty"" on businesses have eased since April, they remain elevated by historical standards. Moreover, weak demand conditions have dampened firms' appetites to hire new staff to a degree only usually seen in times of global economic stress.

Global PMI edges higher for second month in June

S&P Global Market Intelligence's PMI surveys indicated that worldwide business activity expanded at a slightly increased rate for a second successive month in June, albeit remaining subdued by standards seen late last year.

The headline J.P. Morgan Global Composite PMI Output Index, covering manufacturing and services in over 40 economies, rose from 51.2 in May to 51.7 in June to signal the fastest pace of expansion since March.

Despite the further upturn in June, the average expansion signalled by the PMI over the second quarter has been the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2023.

At its current level, historical comparisons indicate that the PMI is broadly consistent with the global economy growing at an annualized rate of 2.3% in June, and 2.0% in the second quarter. This compares with an average GDP growth rate of 3.1% in the decade prior to the pandemic and an estimated 3.0% rate in the past three years.

The improved rate of expansion in June was fueled by an acceleration of global manufacturing output growth to the highest since February (and second fastest seen over the past year), reviving from a brief downturn in May. However, services business activity growth meanwhile moderated worldwide in June. Although June's services expansion was in line with the average seen in the first five months of the year, growth in the sector has cooled noticeably since late last year.

Varied growth trends

Of the 13 largest economies surveyed by the PMI, growth trends varied markedly. Among the major economies, signs of current economic stress were largely limited to Canada and to lesser extents Brazil and Russia, though with pockets of concern also evident notably in the French services economy and the manufacturing economies of the UK and Italy.

In contrast, India's upturn remained impressive in June, while the US economy has enjoyed a solid expansion over the past two months. Growth has edged higher in the UK, Australia, Japan, mainland China and the eurozone, though remained subdued in all cases, and especially modest in the latter.

India leads global expansion

Of the nine economies reporting growth in June, India stood out once again as the strongest performer by a wide margin, both in terms of goods and services.

The US reported the second fastest output growth of the major economies, its rate of expansion edging slightly lower from May and remaining lower than seen at the end of last year but nonetheless signalling annualized economic growth of approximately 1.5%. Slightly weaker services growth was part countered by a return to growth for US manufacturing output after three months of decline.

The UK meanwhile reported an encouraging acceleration of growth to the fastest since last September, indicative of the economy having grown at a pace of around 0.3% (1.2% annualized) to end the second quarter on a high note by recent standards.

Growth also lifted higher in Australia, reaching a three-month high (and the joint-highest for ten months), though remaining subdued thanks in part to a stalled manufacturing sector.

Japan's upturn also gathered pace, though likewise remained only modest, as the first rise in manufacturing output for ten months was accompanied by a slight lift in services growth.

A mild upturn was also reported in mainland China, where output rose modestly after a brief decline in May. A rebound in manufacturing output was part countered, however, by a near-stalling of services growth to the weakest for nine months (and one of the weakest since the pandemic).

Although eurozone growth also remained subdued on the whole amid only very modest growth of both manufacturing and services output, its expansion hit a three-month high to indicate 0.1% GDP growth (0.4% annualized) as Spain outperformed, albeit still registering the second weakest expansion recorded over the past 17 months. Only weak growth was seen in both Italy (a three-month low) and in Germany, despite the latter's manufacturing sector reporting a sustained expansion, which over the past four months has enjoyed its best growth spell for three years.

Canada reports sharpest downturn

While only four of the 13 economies recorded falling output (measured across manufacturing and services), Canada's downturn remained particularly marked, continuing a period of decline which has been the worst since the early pandemic lockdowns in 2020, amid a broad-based contraction that was widely blamed on uncertainty and disruptions caused by US policy changes this year.

Output also fell in Russia, Brazil and France. Russia reported the largest fall in output since December 2022, while Brazil's downturn was the second steepest since early-2021. France's downturn was again only modest, albeit masking a marked decline in the services economy.

Lower confidence

Although current global growth accelerated slightly in June, business confidence in the outlook deteriorated. While up on the recent nadir seen in April, when heightened tariff uncertainty had caused confidence to slide to its lowest since the early pandemic lockdowns, business sentiment dipped in June to the second lowest since last year's US presidential election, and one of the lowest levels seen this side of the pandemic.

Of the major developed economies, sentiment about the year ahead improved in the eurozone, Australia and Japan, though only in the latter has it risen above its long-run average to indicate above-par sentiment. Recent improvements in confidence in the US, Canada and the UK meanwhile lost some ground in June.

In the major emerging markets, sentiment about the year ahead meanwhile fell across the board, notably now running below its long run average in India and drawing close to long-run averages in Russia and Brazil. However, mainland China's companies remained especially pessimistic by long-run standards.

Rising confidence in the eurozone, Australia and Japan could be part-traced to reports of improving domestic demand conditions and international inbound travel helping support services, combined with reduced worries over the adverse impact of US policy, especially in relation to tariffs. The latter has also played a role in helping keep sentiment toward the economic outlook in other markets off the lows seen back in April.

However, companies globally clearly remain concerned over the heightened geopolitical uncertainty caused by recent US policy announcements, with reports of current demand or future expectations having been dampened by ""uncertainty"" continuing to run at a level rarely exceeded in the survey's history.

Similarly, the number of companies worldwide reporting higher employment due to stronger customer demand has fallen sharply, now running at its lowest since late-2023 and a level typically indicative of heightened economic stress, and a likely harbinger of falling global employment in the months ahead.

Andrew Ross Sorkin's analysis emphasizes the interplay between corporate strategy and labor dynamics, urging investors to weigh short-term gains against long-term stability.","The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and UPS are locked in a high-stakes showdown that could redefine the logistics giant's financial trajectory—and its reputation as a corporate stalwart. At the heart of the dispute is UPS's Driver Voluntary Severance Plan (DVSP), a cost-cutting initiative that the Teamsters argue violates the 2023 National Master Agreement. With union opposition intensifying and restructuring plans moving forward, UPS faces a pivotal test of its ability to balance short-term savings with long-term operational and contractual risks.

The DVSP: A Cost-Cutting Gamble or Contractual Breach?

The DVSP, announced in early 2025, offers cash incentives to senior drivers for early retirement or resignation, targeting a reduction of 20,000 front-line jobs. UPS defends the plan as a voluntary effort to realign its workforce with automation-driven efficiencies, including its ""Network of the Future"" initiative. However, the Teamsters Union argues that the DVSP directly violates Article 17 of their 2023 contract, which mandated the creation of 30,000 permanent full-time jobs by converting part-time roles and adding new positions.

The union's case is bolstered by two critical points:

1. Healthcare Entitlements: Drivers with 30+ years of service are entitled to lifetime employer-paid healthcare under the contract. The DVSP strips this benefit, a move the Teamsters call “illegal” and “insulting.”

2. Job-Creation Failure: UPS has only fulfilled 10% of its pledge to provide 28,000 air-conditioned delivery vehicles by 2028—a safety requirement in extreme heat conditions—raising questions about the company's commitment to contractual obligations.

The stakes are amplified by recent legal precedents. In April 2025, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled against UPS in NLRB v. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, Inc., finding the company violated federal labor law by refusing to recognize a certified union. This sets a dangerous precedent, as the Teamsters have vowed to pursue similar charges against the DVSP.

Restructuring: Savings vs. Strategic Vulnerabilities

UPS's broader restructuring plan—dubbed “Transformation 2.0”—aims to cut $3.5 billion in annual costs by 2025 through workforce reductions, facility closures, and automation. The company plans to close 73 facilities, reduce its reliance on Amazon (projected to drop by over 50% by 2026), and automate 64% of its volume. While these moves could boost margins and free up capacity for higher-margin e-commerce partners, they also expose critical vulnerabilities:

Workforce Reliance: UPS's delivery network remains heavily dependent on experienced drivers for complex routing and customer service. Losing seasoned workers could erode reliability, a key differentiator from rivals like FedEx.

Automation Limitations: While automation reduces labor costs, it cannot replace human expertise in dynamic environments. Training less-experienced hires could offset savings and strain operations.

The Financial Tightrope

The DVSP's success hinges on navigating three overlapping risks:

Legal Costs: If the NLRB rules against UPS, the company could face fines, back-pay obligations, and orders to reinstate workers. Analysts estimate potential penalties at hundreds of millions of dollars, directly denting profitability.

Operational Disruptions: A union-led strike—possible as the Teamsters prepare for legal and collective action—could cost UPS up to $100 million per day in lost revenue. With 340,000 unionized drivers, even a partial slowdown could cripple operations.

Reputational Damage: UPS's longstanding image as a “good corporate citizen” is at risk. Stripping healthcare benefits and violating contractual terms could deter customers and investors, particularly as ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria grow in influence.

Investment Considerations: Proceed with Caution

The DVSP presents a classic risk-reward trade-off for investors:

Upside: If implemented smoothly, the $3.5 billion in annual savings could boost margins and valuation. Automation and reduced Amazon dependency may also open new revenue streams.

Downside: Legal penalties, strikes, and operational inefficiencies could erase these gains. UPS's stock has underperformed peers like FedEx in 2025, with analysts offering mixed ratings.

Conclusion: Navigating the Crossroads

UPS's labor disputes and restructuring plans are a litmus test for its corporate strategy. While cost-cutting is necessary in a slowing economy, the company's unilateral approach risks alienating its workforce and regulators. Investors should monitor three key triggers:

1. The outcome of NLRB litigation on the DVSP.

2. Union negotiations and the likelihood of strikes.

3. Progress on contractual obligations, including air-conditioned vehicles and job creation.

For now, UPS's stock remains a “neutral” hold. Aggressive investors might consider limited exposure to capitalize on cost-savings optimism, but the path to profitability is fraught with legal and operational landmines. As the old adage goes: “You can't cut your way to greatness”—unless you also keep your workforce intact.

This suggests a continuation of the lacklustre performance of the ASEAN manufacturing sector, S&P Global said in a press release.
ASEAN's manufacturing sector saw its sharpest downturn since August 2021, with the S&P PMI falling to 48.6 in June.
S&P Global warns of ongoing downside risks due to global tensions and tariff uncertainties.
“The ASEAN manufacturing sector concluded the first half of the year on a worrying note, with the headline index dropping to a 46-month low.","The S&P Global ASEAN Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) posted 48.6—down from 49.2 in May—the index remained below the neutral 50 mark for the third consecutive month, signalling a modest but accelerating contraction.

The ASEAN manufacturing sector slipped into contraction at the start of the second quarter, with the following months signalling further deteriorations in operating conditions. In fact, June marked the most worsening in the health of the sector since August 2021. A sharper decrease in new orders was accompanied by more substantial cuts to staffing levels and purchasing activity.

Although production was also reduced, this was only marginal. Furthermore, despite a strongly optimistic outlook for output in the year ahead, confidence slightly waned since May and was historically subdued. This suggests a continuation of the lacklustre performance of the ASEAN manufacturing sector, S&P Global said in a press release.

ASEAN's manufacturing sector saw its sharpest downturn since August 2021, with the S&P PMI falling to 48.6 in June. New orders, exports, employment, and purchasing activity declined, reflecting weakening demand. Despite subdued inflation and mild production cuts, business confidence remained historically low. S&P Global warns of ongoing downside risks due to global tensions and tariff uncertainties.

Both new orders and output remained in contraction territory since April. Recent figures revealed a sharper decline in incoming new orders for ASEAN goods producers, marking the most significant drop since August 2021.

The overall new orders landscape was once again hampered by declining foreign demand for ASEAN goods, which continued to worsen. In fact, the rate of decrease in new export orders was solid and the most pronounced in eight months. Meanwhile, the downturn in production remained shallow, with the rate of decrease consistent with that observed in May.

Manufacturing companies across ASEAN aligned their purchasing of inputs and employment in line with the deteriorating demand picture. Both measures recorded steeper contractions, with payroll numbers being reduced to the greatest extent since October 2021.

The latest ASEAN manufacturing performance was coupled with historically muted inflationary pressures. The rate of input price inflation softened further since May, to indicate only a modest increase in cost burdens, which was the slowest in just over five years. Although the pace of charge inflation accelerated during the month, manufacturers raised their prices only marginally, added the release.

While goods producers were optimistic about an increase in output over the coming year, the overall degree of optimism diminished and was historically subdued. Sentiment is currently the second-least optimistic since July 2020, suggesting a muted manufacturing performance in the year ahead.

“The ASEAN manufacturing sector concluded the first half of the year on a worrying note, with the headline index dropping to a 46-month low. Production continued to contract, and new orders, purchasing activity, and employment all experienced sharper declines. Although subdued inflationary pressures may partially assist the sector in reviving sales, the current downside risks stemming from ongoing international tensions and tariff-related announcements inject uncertainty into the outlook for the year ahead,” said Maryam Baluch, economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Multiple blockbuster drugs set to lose exclusivity, producing one of the pharmaceutical industry’s most financially significant patent cliffs in over a decade, according to GlobalData.

Oncology is one of the key therapy areas set to be affected by pricing pressures as drug patents expire.

Pharma companies will need to “rethink revenue strategies, pipeline investments, and lifecycle management to safeguard long-term growth”, as a greater number of biosimilars and generic medicines gain market entry, according to a recent report by the data and analytics company.

As such, the US market is expected to lose over $230 billion over the next five years. Only a few big pharma companies are positioned to grow revenue sustainably through 2030, stated GlobalData.

Which blockbuster drugs could be impacted in the next pharmaceutical patent cliff?

Major drugs including Merck’s Keytruda and Johnson & Johnson’s Darzalex/Faspro will lose US exclusivity by 2029. While these medicines are expected to remain in the top 10 selling drugs by the end of the decade, their revenue is expected to decline, GlobalData added.

“More than half of the top 15 pharma companies are expected to face challenges in managing the impact of the upcoming patent cliff. However, some companies have pipeline drugs forecast to offset part of these losses,” explained George El-Helou, Strategic Intelligence Analyst at GlobalData.

“To effectively navigate a patent cliff, companies must deploy a range of strategies to offset losses and strengthen their long-term position.

The study comes from the European Cultural and Creative Industries Alliance (ECCIA), which includes EU countries and the UK, and shows that Europe’s high-end/luxury sector represents 5% of the continent’s GDP and that it “continues to drive economic growth, preserve cultural heritage, and champion excellence well beyond the continent”.

In terms of stock, McDonald’s stock is down slightly so far in 2025.
Krispy Kreme?","*In case you like a Krispy Kreme doughnut with your McDonald’s breakfast meal, enjoy it while you can.

The partnership between the fast-food giant and the popular doughnut rand is coming to an end after only a few months, according to NBC News. In a joint statement released June 24, the news was made official, concluding an ambitious plot to sell Krispy Kreme treats in all U.S.-based McDonald’s locations by the end of 2026.

Headlines from the companies’ alliance came in March 2024, when they announced the collaboration. A little more than six months later, the effort was underway. Despite its money-making intentions, expectations of a successful effort failed to ignite interest and sales. So much so that Krispy Kreme put everything on hold last month, citing a need to boost sales.

Noting the defeat in a joint release, Krispy Kreme CEO Josh Charlesworth admitted the partnership was an “unsustainable” venture.

“Ultimately, efforts to bring our costs in line with unit demand were unsuccessful, making the partnership unsustainable for us,” he said.

For McDonald’s, the end of its Krispy Kreme union was a shrugging off point, despite its happiness with the pairing. The company revealed Krispy Kreme edibles were sold in only about 2,400 of McDonald’s approximately 13,500 U.S. stores as of March 30. A “small” part of its big breakfast business, to hear Mickey Ds tell it.

When it’s all said and done, the final day the Golden Arches will stop selling Krispy Kreme doughnuts will fall July 2.

The end of the venture comes as the companies struggle to win back food lovers amid troubling times.

McDonald’s value offerings have been unsuccessful with inflation maintaining its grip on low- and middle-income consumers. On the other side, Krispy Kreme is not doing any better with millions of dollars in losses.

In terms of stock, McDonald’s stock is down slightly so far in 2025. Krispy Kreme? Its stock fell more than 73%.

Conclusion: A Retail Media Leader in the Making The Instacart-Pinterest partnership isn't just about ads—it's about owning the customer journey.
By closing the gap between inspiration and purchase, Instacart is emerging as the go-to platform for brands seeking measurable growth.","The partnership between Instacart (NASDAQ: CART) and Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), announced on June 16, 2025, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of retail media networks. By merging Instacart's first-party purchase data with Pinterest's visual discovery platform, the collaboration is poised to redefine how consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands advertise, measure outcomes, and drive sales. For investors, this strategic alliance highlights Instacart's growing dominance in retail media—a sector expected to surpass $500 billion globally by 2027—and signals a compelling opportunity to capitalize on undervalued stock.

The Power of Data-Driven Precision

The partnership's cornerstone is first-party data integration, which enables CPG advertisers to target users based on real-world purchase behavior. For example, a brand selling gluten-free snacks can now reach Pinterest users who've recently bought similar items via Instacart. This hyper-targeting reduces ad spend wasted on low-intent audiences, a problem plaguing traditional digital advertising.

The closed-loop measurement feature, launching in the second phase, takes this a step further by directly linking Pinterest ad views to Instacart sales. Brands can now measure ROI with unprecedented clarity: if a user clicks an ad for a low-sugar beverage and then orders it via Instacart, the sale is attributed to the campaign. This eliminates guesswork, allowing brands to optimize budgets in real time and prioritize high-performing ads.

Why This Matters for CPG Advertising Efficiency

CPG companies have long struggled with fragmented ad ecosystems. With Instacart's platform, they can unify strategies across 220+ grocery e-commerce sites, in-store Caper Carts, and now Pinterest's 500+ million monthly users. The result? A 30–40% reduction in wasted ad spend for brands leveraging this integration, according to internal Instacart estimates.

Take the example of a regional dairy cooperative: by targeting Pinterest users who've purchased plant-based milk via Instacart, the cooperative can refine its ad creative and budget allocation to maximize sales. Meanwhile, shoppable ads—where users can purchase directly from Pinterest—cut the path to purchase from minutes to seconds, boosting conversion rates.

Instacart's Undervalued Stock: A Buy Before It's Too Late

Despite these transformative capabilities, Instacart's stock remains underappreciated by Wall Street. As of June 19, 2025, CART trades at 12x forward revenue, a stark contrast to retail media peers like Walmart (WMT) at 1.3x or Amazon (AMZN) at 1.9x. This valuation gap ignores Instacart's 7,000+ active brands and 1,800 retail partners, which collectively represent a $20 billion addressable market in North America alone.

The partnership's closed-loop measurement also positions Instacart as a must-have platform for CPG advertisers. With 47% of Gen Z using Pinterest as a search engine, the collaboration taps into a demographic critical to future growth. Analysts predict Instacart's ad revenue could double by 2026, driven by this integration.

Investment Thesis: Act Before the Crowd

The Instacart-Pinterest partnership is a buy signal for investors. Key catalysts include:

1. Accelerating ad revenue: Closed-loop measurement will attract premium CPG budgets.

2. Scalability: The 1,800-retailer Instacart Marketplace ensures broad reach.

3. Competitive moat: Few rivals offer Pinterest's discovery power paired with Instacart's actionable data.

With Instacart's stock up just 4.7% year-to-date despite this news, the valuation is still conservative. A price target of $25–30 by end-2025 (vs. current $18) seems reasonable, implying a 40–60% upside.

Conclusion: A Retail Media Leader in the Making

The Instacart-Pinterest partnership isn't just about ads—it's about owning the customer journey. By closing the gap between inspiration and purchase, Instacart is emerging as the go-to platform for brands seeking measurable growth. For investors, this is a rare opportunity to invest in a first-mover advantage before broader recognition drives the stock higher.

Power management company Eaton is reimagining the role of manufacturing sites through its innovative Factories as a Grid approach, which treats facilities as intelligent energy resources rather than just passive consumers of power.

The Factories as a Grid model incorporates onsite renewable generation, energy storage and digital tools to address increasing electricity prices and unreliable grid conditions.

It is part of Eaton’s broader Everything as a Grid framework, which offers flexible power infrastructure and wider energy choices to manufacturers.

With electrification advancing across industries and extreme weather becoming more frequent, factories are under increasing pressure to safeguard energy reliability while also keeping operations as robust as possible.

Traditionally, electrical systems have behaved like passive components on the grid, consuming power as needed.

Eaton’s method changes this through the use of smart technology that enables factories to actively produce, store and use electricity depending on real-time needs.

Nike Faces $1bn Hit from Trump’s Trade Tariffs

Nike is reshaping its manufacturing strategy as Trump’s tariffs drive up costs, squeeze margins and push production away from China and Vietnam

For Nike, global manufacturing has always been a finely tuned operation – one that balances scale, cost and speed to market.

But under the weight of renewed US tariffs on China, Vietnam and Cambodia, that balance is tipping fast.

In the wake of President Donald Trump’s sweeping trade tariffs, sportswear giants like Nike and Adidas are confronting billion-dollar headwinds and making tough decisions about how and where they manufacture their goods.

At the heart of it all? The question of whether the world’s largest athletic brand can maintain its global production model without punishing its own margins.

Where Does Manufacturing Factor Into UK Gov’s Solar Roadmap?

With just over 18 GW of installed solar capacity today, the UK now has its sights set on a massive leap – reaching up to 47 GW by 2030.

For manufacturers, engineers and supply chain specialists, this isn’t just an energy story – it’s an industrial one.

To support this transformation, the UK Solar Taskforce has released its Solar Roadmap, laying out how the country can realistically scale its solar ambitions.

The roadmap reveals that achieving the target would require just 0.4% of UK land for ground-mounted solar, while unlocking significant untapped potential across commercial and residential rooftops.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c5f223cca1c4a5964816f4034e01ba2f:f8711f03127e3ffc03ee6ca4d44cec11/electrical-insights-story-related-to-the-arecibo-clean-energy-projects.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 01:59:57.831982

ICIS reported that all of E.ON’s international hydrogen imports, hydrogen production, and midstream activities will be deprioritised as the company restructures, moving its green gas operations into its broader energy infrastructure solutions (EIS) unit.

Despite only selecting Andritz to carry out engineering studies on the 20MW HydroHarbourEssen (HHE) project last October, E.ON has now cancelled plans for the project. It was set to produce 2,300 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year by 2027.

Furthermore, the company has withdrawn from the H2.Ruhr project, which was to be developed in partnership with Enel, Iberdrola, ABB, and SAP. The project had planned to deliver up to 80,000 tonnes of hydrogen and ammonia annually via a pipeline initially connecting Essen and Duisburg.

H2 View has contacted E.ON for clarification on the scope of its EIS unit and the role hydrogen is expected to play within it.

The announcement comes as German energy companies are expressing concern that excessive national and EU regulations are making renewable energy and hydrogen investments financially unviable.

Leading sportswear brands are responding, with Anta and Li-Ning utilizing recycled materials and eco-friendly manufacturing processes to enhance product performance while expanding their eco-conscious lines. Anta's 2024 ESG Report shows sustainable products accounted for over 30 percent of its total offerings last year, with 26 carbon-neutral certified items launched.

In the food delivery sector, this shift is reflected in Meituan's ""Green Mountains Initiative,"" launched in 2017. The program has spurred a widespread move toward sustainable consumption. By early June, about 500 million users had opted for utensil-free deliveries, while more than 1 million merchants had joined eco-actions ranging from plastic reduction to food waste prevention.

China's nationwide consumer goods trade-in program further underscores this trend. Ministry of Commerce data reveals that in 2024, over 60 percent of newly purchased vehicles were new energy vehicles, and more than 90 percent of new appliance sales involved Tier-1 energy-efficient models. This has driven four consecutive months of double-digit sales growth for smart and high-efficiency appliances.

""Green appliances are now the preferred choice, offering consumers a premium lifestyle while advancing sustainability,"" noted Xu Dongsheng, vice-chairman of the China Household Electrical Appliances Association.

As China's support for new quality productive forces accelerates shifts in consumption patterns, driven by enterprises offering greener, smarter products and services, companies are racing to innovate.

In the fitness sector, supply chains are advancing rapidly, driven by intensified research and development (R&D) and quality upgrades. Official data show that 146 national ""Little Giant"" enterprises -- specialized, high-tech small and medium-sized firms -- now operate in sports-related fields, ranging from smart wearables to bicycle parts manufacturing and fitness and rehabilitation equipment.

Global players are also actively expanding their presence to tap into China's fitness boom. Last Saturday, French sports retailer Decathlon simultaneously opened stores in Shanghai, Beijing, and Nanjing. These hubs offer one-stop sports gear and host community activities such as cycling, hiking and running, catering directly to China's fitness boom, the company's communications department said.

Cao's running passion has taken him from a half-marathon in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, to training for Beijing's premier marathon later this year.

Meanwhile civil engineering (44.2) fell for the sixth month running and was the weakest-performing area of construction activity.
House building was the only category of construction work to expand in June (50.7).
New order books across the construction sector as a whole deteriorated for the sixth successive month in June, with the rate of decline accelerating since May.","With a warning that optimism in its shortest supply since December 2022, this morning's index update on how business is faring in the construction sector will not make upbeat reading for anyone with an eye on Gloucestershire's economic wellbeing.

S&P Global's latest sounding out of the mood among purchase managers reports that construction companies saw a ""marginal reduction in total business activity during June, despite a return to growth in residential building work"".

Significantly, the new S&P Global UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) report points to new orders decreasing at an accelerated pace.

The PMI said this contributed to the weakest degree of business optimism across the construction sector for two-and-a-half years. At an index of 48.8 in June, the headline, which is a seasonally adjusted index tracking changes in total industry activity, was up from 47.9 in May and signalled the slowest decline in construction output since the current period of contraction began in January.

Any reading below 50.0 indicates an overall reduction in construction activity.

Tim Moore, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""June data highlighted a sustained downturn in UK construction output, albeit at the slowest pace in six months.

""Shrinking workloads in the commercial and civil engineering segments weighed on total industry activity. Commercial activity fell at the sharpest rate in just over five years.

On a brighter note, he said that house building was the best-performing area of the construction sector: ""Higher levels of residential work were recorded for the first time since September 2024 amid some reports of more stable demand conditions,"" he said.

""The forward-looking survey indicators were weaker than in May. Total new orders fell at a faster pace as many construction companies signalled reduced overall workloads due to unfavourable domestic economic conditions and fragile confidence among clients.

But he warned: ""At the same time, business activity expectations dipped to a 2.5-year low in June. Survey respondents widely cited fewer tender opportunities, rising competition for new work and a projected headwind from subdued business investment during the year ahead.""

Today's report also cites accelerated rates of contraction in the commercial and civil engineering segments.

Commercial work decreased at the fastest pace since May 2020 (index at 45.1), which survey respondents attributed to subdued UK economic conditions and cutbacks to investment spending among clients.

Meanwhile civil engineering (44.2) fell for the sixth month running and was the weakest-performing area of construction activity.

House building was the only category of construction work to expand in June (50.7). Higher levels of residential activity were recorded for the first time since September 2024, although the rate of growth was only marginal.

S&P Global added: ""Some firms commented on an upturn in new projects and sales pipelines. New order books across the construction sector as a whole deteriorated for the sixth successive month in June, with the rate of decline accelerating since May.

""Survey respondents commented on fewer tender opportunities and intense competition for new work, reflecting weak overall demand conditions and heightened risk aversion among clients.""

Mirroring the trend for new work, latest data indicated a sustained downturn in staffing numbers. Construction companies have recorded cutbacks to employment throughout the year to date and this was again linked to lower demand and efforts to reduce overheads.

Demand for construction items also softened again in June.",https://www.punchline-gloucester.com/images/user/13162_punchline-gloucester.png,N,,2025-07-04 21:00:30.412863

This contrasts sharply with UPS, which will suspend most ground and air services on July 4, relying on premium offerings like UPS Express Critical to meet urgent needs. The disparity underscores USPS's unique advantage: a hybrid model blending legacy infrastructure with modern self-service solutions.

Modernizing While Cutting Costs: A Balancing Act

USPS's July 1, 2025, service standard refinements exemplify its dual focus on efficiency and adaptability. By expanding surface transportation dispatch times and leveraging “turnaround” volume (mail processed within the same regional area), USPS aims to save $36 billion over the next decade. While rural ZIP codes may see slightly slower First-Class Mail delivery (11% of packages now within a five-day window), urban areas benefit from faster service.

Crucially, these changes are part of USPS's “Delivering for America” plan, which prioritizes financial sustainability without government subsidies. The Postal Regulatory Commission notes that 75% of First-Class Mail will face no delivery delays, and the agency's interactive service map ensures customers can plan around geographic-specific timelines.

Why Competitors Struggle to Match USPS's Resilience

UPS and FedEx face structural challenges that USPS avoids. Private carriers rely on premium pricing to offset holiday costs, but their stock performance reflects operational volatility. Consider UPS's recent fluctuations:

Despite its dominance in express shipping, UPS's reliance on discretionary spending (e.g., e-commerce surges) leaves it vulnerable to economic downturns. USPS, by contrast, is a near-monopoly in last-mile delivery for non-premium mail, with 95% of First-Class parcels still meeting three-day service standards. This stability—rooted in universal service obligations and self-funding—positions USPS as a rare “defensive” asset in the logistics sector.

The Investment Case: Utilities and Infrastructure as Anchors in Volatility

USPS's reliability hints at broader opportunities in utilities and infrastructure. The sector's low beta (volatility) and steady cash flows make it a natural hedge against macroeconomic risks. While USPS itself isn't a publicly traded entity, its operational model mirrors the strengths of utilities companies:

Stable Demand: Like electricity or water, postal services are recession-resistant.

Regulated Pricing: USPS sets rates via congressional oversight, shielding it from market swings.

Capital Efficiency: Its shift to surface transportation and kiosk networks reduces costs without sacrificing reach.

Investors seeking exposure can turn to utility stocks such as NextEra Energy (NEE) or Consolidated Edison (ED), which offer dividend yields above 3% and consistent earnings. Infrastructure ETFs like the iShares U.S. Utilities ETF (IDU) also provide diversified exposure to this defensive sector.

Conclusion: USPS as a Model for Infrastructure Resilience

USPS's July 4 policies and service standard updates reveal an institution adapting to modern demands while maintaining core reliability—a rarity in today's volatile markets. As economic headwinds test industries, investors should prioritize utilities and infrastructure stocks that mirror USPS's blend of stability and adaptability. The Postal Service's underappreciated operational strength isn't just a logistical feat; it's a blueprint for sectors poised to thrive in any climate.

Why This Acquisition Matters Zurich's acquisition isn't just a bid to keep up with rising cyber threats—it's a calculated play to dominate a segment where demand outpaces supply.
Before BOXX, Zurich's cyber offerings lagged competitors like Allianz and AXA.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate the BOXX acquisition could add 8-10% to Zurich's 2026 earnings, with cross-selling boosting margins to 18% (vs. 15% in 2024).
The writing is on the wall: as cyber threats grow and SMEs demand holistic solutions, Zurich's early bet on BOXX could make it the Amazon of cyber insurance.","In an era where ransomware attacks surged by 62% in 2024, the insurance industry is racing to adapt to digital-era risks. Zurich Insurance's $2.3 billion acquisition of BOXX Insurance Inc. in July 2025—announced after a three-year partnership—positions the insurer as a leader in the SME and retail cyber insurance market. This move is a masterclass in strategic alignment: pairing Zurich's global scale with BOXX's cutting-edge tech to address a $30 billion market forecast to grow by 14% annually through 2026. Here's why investors should pay attention.

Why This Acquisition Matters

Zurich's acquisition isn't just a bid to keep up with rising cyber threats—it's a calculated play to dominate a segment where demand outpaces supply. Before BOXX, Zurich's cyber offerings lagged competitors like Allianz and AXA. BOXX's Cyberboxx® suite changes that:

- Cyberboxx® Business Edition: Bundles insurance with 24/7 threat monitoring, ransomware protection, and incident response for SMEs.

- Cyberboxx® Home Edition: Shields households from phishing, identity theft, and device hacking.

- Cyberboxx® Assist: An AI-driven tool for vulnerability scans and compliance audits.

These products aren't just insurance policies—they're proactive risk mitigation platforms. Zurich now gains access to BOXX's 1 million customers across five continents, including fast-growing markets like India and Australia. The integration is designed to preserve BOXX's agility while leveraging Zurich's distribution channels, creating a rare “scale + innovation” combo.

Zurich's stock has outperformed peers by 15% since 2023, reflecting investor confidence in its strategic moves.

The Synergy Play: Scale Meets Tech

The deal's genius lies in its operational structure: BOXX operates as a standalone entity under Zurich Global Ventures (ZGV), retaining its brand and entrepreneurial culture. Zurich, meanwhile, provides:

1. Global Infrastructure: Access to 50+ countries where Zurich operates but BOXX didn't, including Southeast Asia and Latin America.

2. Capital for Growth: Funding to scale BOXX's AI-driven underwriting and expand into enterprise markets.

3. Cross-Selling Opportunities: Bundling BOXX's cyber tools with Zurich's travel, employee benefits, and property insurance. A small business buying Zurich's property policy could now add Cyberboxx® Business Edition at checkout—a sticky revenue stream.

BOXX's CEO Vishal Kundi put it bluntly: “Combining our tech with Zurich's reach means we can protect 10x more customers by 2026.”

The Investment Thesis: Three Pillars of Value

Scalable Revenue Streams:

BOXX's recurring revenue model (subscription-based services) aligns with Zurich's push to diversify beyond traditional premiums. With SMEs spending just 12% of their IT budgets on cybersecurity, there's massive untapped demand.

First-Mover Advantage in Integrated Solutions:

Zurich is now the only major insurer offering end-to-end cyber resilience—combining coverage with prevention tools. This differentiation is critical as regulators push insurers to prove “adequate risk mitigation” before issuing policies.

Valuation Upside:

Zurich's stock trades at 1.2x book value, below its five-year average of 1.4x. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate the BOXX acquisition could add 8-10% to Zurich's 2026 earnings, with cross-selling boosting margins to 18% (vs. 15% in 2024).

A 3% margin expansion by 2026 would add $450 million to Zurich's bottom line.

Risks? Yes. But Manageable.

Regulatory Pushback: New EU laws require insurers to verify clients' cybersecurity posture before issuing policies. BOXX's tools address this head-on.

Integration Hurdles: Zurich's history of successful acquisitions (e.g., Kotak General Insurance) suggests it can avoid cultural clashes.

Market Saturation: While competition is rising, BOXX's “Insurtech of the Year” accolades (Insurance Business Canada, 2024) signal superior product-market fit.

Investment Recommendation

This is a buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a 3-5 year horizon. Zurich's stock is undervalued relative to its growth trajectory, and the BOXX deal is just the first step in its digital pivot. Consider:

- Entry Point: Aim for a 5% dip from current levels (mid-$60s USD).

- Target: $80/share by 2026, reflecting 20% earnings growth.

- Catalysts: Q4 2025 cross-selling metrics, 2026 regulatory approvals for integrated products.

The writing is on the wall: as cyber threats grow and SMEs demand holistic solutions, Zurich's early bet on BOXX could make it the Amazon of cyber insurance. Act now—or risk being left behind in the digital resilience race.

Company officials cited an “unprecedented business landscape” for the offer of buyouts that would provide drivers the opportunity to receive what the UPS officials characterized as a “generous financial package” if union drivers chose to leave the company.

The financial package would be in addition to any retirement benefits earned, including pension and healthcare.

“As we work through our network configuration, we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing our customers with the reliable, industry-leading service they expect from UPS,” the company said in a statement.

In response, UPS teamsters have called the buyout plan illegal and “a corporate scheme” that would violate the union’s national contract that protects an estimated 340,000 delivery workers.

Teamsters officials said that although the details of the buyout have not yet been announced, the plan would leave most drivers without quality health insurance if they retired through the buyout. The plan also undermines UPS’s commitment to create an additional 22,500 jobs, which Teamsters officials said was included in their current contract.

“UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts in front of Teamsters drivers. It is an illegal violation of our national contract,” Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien said in a statement released by the union.

UPS Teamsters ratified a five-year contract with the company in 2023. In addition to committing to creating more than 22,000 permanent jobs for part-time employees, the contract also called for UPS to create an additional 7,500 full-time jobs over the final three years of the deal.

The company said it has approached Teamsters about the buyout proposal, but also said it remains committed to the contractual obligations agreed upon nearly two years ago.

In addition to eliminating 20,000 front-line jobs, UPS’s optimization plan also includes closing 200 UPS sortation centers over the next five years and increasing automated package sorting, according to reports. The report indicated that package volumes have slowed between fewer imports because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs and a decision this month to reduce Amazon’s business by 50% because of unprofitability.

UPS currently employs around 490,000 people, 340,000 of which are represented by the union. The Daily Mail reported that the downsizing effort is part of a $3.5 billion cost-reduction effort for this year. The company is hoping to reach a 12% U.S. operational margin by 2026, the report said.

Teamsters said that UPS attempted to introduce buyouts at the executive level in 2020.

“Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out,” O’Brien said. “The Teamsters are prepared to fight UPS on every front with every available resource to shut down this illegal buyout program.

“UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments, just as Teamsters do every day, reliably delivering packages to hundreds of millions of Americans. Profits are not more important than people, not at UPS or any other employer.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/04/AP25119537959415-e1745948173433.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-04 18:03:54.645997

The United Steelworkers union (USW) proudly welcomes these workers as part of the expanding national campaign for fairness, dignity and a real voice on the job.

The Kensington Square baristas organized in response to growing nationwide concerns about job security, staffing levels and inconsistent enforcement of workplace rules, including recent waves of fellow workers being fired for dress code violations. Workers say the nationwide firings sparked outrage and built support for unionization in their store.

“We want to be our authentic selves and have a real voice at work and not punished or fired for simply showing up as who we are,” said one Kensington Square worker. “We’re done being silenced and told who to be. That goes against everything Starbucks claimed to stand for and we’re not staying quiet anymore. Starbucks needs to be better.”

“If you feel destabilized, under-appreciated or unheard, and you believe in a healthy, respectful workplace, just know this: from one worker to another, you are not alone,” said another Kensington Square worker. “For us, it also came down to wanting better staffing, real job security and a real say in the policies that impact us every day.”

The USW encourages Starbucks workers from other stores to take the step toward organizing. With each new location that joins, workers gain the collective strength needed to negotiate for fair treatment, better working conditions and respect at work.

“Workers at Kensington Square are joining a growing movement of baristas who are standing up and demanding better,” said Scott Lunny, USW Western Canada Director.

“These workers are showing immense courage and solidarity by organizing for their rights, and we are proud to stand with them as they build power on the job. Every new group of workers that joins the union strengthens the voice of all Starbucks workers across the country. It takes time to build, but I’m proud of the work they are doing,” added Lunny.

Over the past five years, the company has executed a series of high-stakes buyouts targeting healthcare logistics, temperature-sensitive delivery, and key nearshoring hubs—moves that position it to capitalize on rising demand for last-mile delivery and supply chain resilience. For investors, UPS's M&A playbook presents a compelling opportunity to bet on the infrastructure powering the $6.86 trillion e-commerce economy. But the risks of regulatory hurdles and overextended balance sheets linger.

The M&A Playbook: Building a Logistics Empire

Since 2020, UPS has spent billions acquiring companies that address three core themes: healthcare logistics dominance, cold-chain infrastructure, and geographic diversification.

1. Healthcare Logistics: The $8% Growth Engine

The acquisition of Andlauer Healthcare Group (AHG) in 2025—a Canadian cold-chain specialist—adds 19.2 million sq. ft. of temperature-controlled facilities to UPS's network. Combined with its 2022 buyout of Bomi Group, an Italian healthcare logistics firm, these moves solidify UPS's position in the $60 billion healthcare logistics market, which is growing at 8% annually.

The rationale is clear: pharmaceuticals, biologics, and medical devices require precision in storage and delivery. UPS's cold-chain network now spans North America and Europe, enabling it to serve biotech firms and hospitals with end-to-end solutions.

2. Cold-Chain Infrastructure: The New Oil

In Europe, UPS's 2025 purchases of Frigo-Trans (temperature-controlled warehousing) and BPL (GDP-compliant freight forwarding) are strategic plays to corner the continent's $25 billion cold-chain market. Frigo-Trans's ability to handle temperatures from -196°C to +25°C gives UPS an edge in high-margin specialty logistics, while BPL's air/ocean freight expertise bridges gaps in time-critical shipments.

3. Nearshoring and Regionalization: Mexico's Strategic Bet

The pending acquisition of Estafeta, Mexico's largest domestic logistics firm, is UPS's boldest move yet. By 2024, Mexico's manufacturing output—driven by U.S. nearshoring—will account for 25% of North American GDP, and Estafeta's 45-year network of 1,200+ locations gives UPS a foothold in this booming market. The deal also aligns with U.S. policies pushing supply chains inland, where UPS can dominate last-mile delivery for SMEs and manufacturers.

Why This Matters for Investors

The e-commerce gold rush is fueling a surge in last-mile demand. By 2025, 21% of global retail sales will occur online, up from 16% in 2020. UPS's acquisitions are designed to capture this growth:

Market Share Gains: UPS's healthcare division now accounts for 20% of its revenue, up from 15% in 2020.

Geographic Reach: Post-Estafeta, UPS will control 30% of Mexico's express delivery market, overtaking DHL.

Cost Synergies: Integrating Estafeta's SMB customers with UPS's global network could cut cross-border shipping costs by 15–20%.

Risks to the Investment Thesis

Regulatory Headwinds: The Estafeta deal faces scrutiny in Mexico over anti-trust concerns, while the AHG acquisition must navigate Canada's Competition Act. A prolonged approval process could delay revenue synergies.

Economic Volatility: UPS's $9.09/parcel revenue dropped 0.1% in 2024 due to pricing wars with FedEx and Amazon Logistics. If U.S. GDP growth stays below 2%, demand for discretionary shipments could stall.

Technological Leapfrogging: Rival firms like FedEx are investing in autonomous delivery drones, while Amazon's Ground Advantage service undercuts UPS's pricing.

The Bottom Line: A High-Reward, High-Risk Bet

UPS's M&A strategy is a calculated gamble to become the “premium” logistics provider for healthcare and nearshoring-driven trade. For investors, the rewards—double-digit growth in high-margin healthcare logistics, dominance in key markets like Mexico, and first-mover advantage in cold-chain infrastructure—outweigh the risks for a 3–5 year horizon.

Investment Advice:

- Buy: UPS stock (UPS) for investors willing to accept short-term volatility. Target a 12–18% return over two years as cold-chain and nearshoring demand materializes.

- Hold: If your portfolio already has exposure to logistics via ETFs like IYT (Transportation Select Sector SPDR Fund).

- Avoid: If you prioritize stability—regulatory delays and economic slowdowns could pressure margins in 2025.

UPS's acquisitions are not just about buying assets; they're about owning the arteries of a logistics system that will only grow more vital as e-commerce evolves. For the bold, this is a bet on the future of global trade.

Meanwhile, healthcare providers will be able to expedite pre-approval processes, allowing for a more transparent and efficient process.","Securing approval for medical treatments in the United States often feels like an endless journey, fraught with paperwork and delays that add significant stress. However, there is hope on the horizon as some of the nation's leading health insurers have pledged to take steps to streamline, simplify, and reduce the pre-approval process. This initiative aims to ensure that healthcare for their members is safe, effective, evidence-based, and affordable.

The insurers' plan focuses on connecting patients with the care they need more swiftly while minimizing the administrative burden on providers. Through a press release, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association announced a voluntary agreement to reduce and expedite prior authorizations, a process that often proves to be a significant headache for both patients and providers when obtaining and managing healthcare.

""The healthcare system remains fragmented and burdened by outdated manual processes, causing frustration for both patients and providers. Health plans are voluntarily committing to provide a smoother patient experience and enable providers to focus on patient care while contributing to system modernization,""

stated Mike Tuffin, President and CEO of AHIP.

It is crucial to note that this commitment will be implemented across all insurance markets, including those with commercial coverage, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid managed care, in accordance with state and federal regulations. These changes in health insurers' processes are expected to benefit 257 million people in the U.S. from 2026 to 2027.

According to information shared by AHIP, health insurers have signed the following commitments: standardizing electronic prior authorization, reducing the scope of claims subject to prior authorization, ensuring continuity of care when switching plans, improving communication and transparency, expanding real-time responses, and maintaining medical review of non-approved requests.

The new changes and commitments by U.S. health insurers will bring significant benefits to both patients and providers. Patients will experience faster and more direct access to appropriate medical treatments and services, with fewer hurdles in navigating the healthcare system. Meanwhile, healthcare providers will be able to expedite pre-approval processes, allowing for a more transparent and efficient process.

Among the insurers that have signed the AHIP commitment are AmeriHealth Caritas, Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliates from various states, The Cigna Group, CVS Health Aetna, Elevance Health, Humana, Kaiser Permanente, UnitedHealthcare, and many others. This broad participation underscores the industry's dedication to improving the healthcare experience for millions of Americans.

As these changes take effect, the healthcare landscape in the U.S. is poised for a transformation that prioritizes patient care and reduces administrative burdens. The commitment to modernizing the system reflects a significant step forward in addressing long-standing challenges within the healthcare industry.",https://www.soynomada.news/__export/1748731076449/sites/debate/img/2025/05/31/recibo_medico.jpg_673822677.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 20:02:50.674226

U.S. tariffs have severely impacted Canada’s manufacturing industry, with data from June showing the largest decline in output since the pandemic. Demand for Canadian exports is down because of increased costs, making them less competitive in the American market.

Article content

Article content

“Canada’s manufacturing economy continued to struggle in the face of tariffs and the ongoing uncertainty related to future trade policies,” Paul Smith, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a statement.

Article content

The S&P Global report said production volumes were cut “to the steepest degree in over five years in June amid a sharp decline in new work.”

Article content

“A lack of new orders underpinned the latest downturn and helped to explain the steepest reduction in production since the height of the pandemic in the spring of 2020,” Smith said.

Article content

International order numbers plummeted — especially those from the United States, which accounts for approximately 75 per cent of Canada’s exports. As a result, the latest data showed that new export orders declined at one of the steepest rates in the S&P Global survey’s history.

Article content

Canadian manufacturers significantly scaled back purchasing activity, driven by sharp declines in both output and new orders, while input inventories fell at the fastest rate in five years as firms relied more heavily on existing stock.

Article content

“International sales unsurprisingly were especially subdued, and, against this backdrop, firms chose to make further cuts to their employment and purchasing activity,” Smith said.

In response to the sustained slowdown, many manufacturers reduced their workforce, leading to a decline in employment for the fifth straight month. Some firms implemented layoffs to cut costs, according to the survey, while others opted not to replace departing employees in an effort to manage uncertainty and preserve cash flow.

Article content

The steady decline in employment signals broader concern within the sector about the short-term outlook, as firms continue to scale operations to match a softer business environment.

Article content

However, some experts expect tariff uncertainty to wane in the coming year while others predict increased sales from domestic sources, and confidence in the outlook rose to its highest level since January, according to the survey, though it remained below its historical average.

Commercial prices were analyzed for practitioners and facilities with billed claims during 2023 for 10 common general surgery procedures.
Price variation was moderate and high for professional services and facility services, respectively, especially for endoscopic procedures.
“If price variation reflects clinical or perceived quality variation, purchasers and policymakers must find the balance between receiving higher-quality care and spending financial resources elsewhere,” the authors write.
“If price variation is instead driven by consolidation or anticompetitive contracting, then regulators should design policies that ensure competitive health care markets.” Abstract/Full Text","THURSDAY, July 3, 2025 (HealthDay News) — Commercial pricing varies considerably for general surgery services, with facility prices exhibiting greater variability, according to a research letter published online June 25 in JAMA Network Open.

Alexander P. Philips, and Christopher M. Whaley, Ph.D., both from Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island, examined price data from ClarifyHealth for common surgical services across four large national insurers, which constitute 78 percent of market share. Commercial prices were analyzed for practitioners and facilities with billed claims during 2023 for 10 common general surgery procedures.

The sample included approximately 2.45 million price points and 97,740 unique physicians for professional data, as well as 132,000 price points and 5,298 unique facilities for facility data. The researchers found that the magnitude of facility prices was about nine and four times higher than professional prices for surgical and endoscopic procedures, respectively. Price variation was moderate and high for professional services and facility services, respectively, especially for endoscopic procedures. For example, the median facility cost for diagnostic colonoscopy ranged from $925 to $3,571 depending on the payer. For diagnostic colonoscopy, professional and facility prices have an upper limit of about two and about three times the lower bound, respectively.

“If price variation reflects clinical or perceived quality variation, purchasers and policymakers must find the balance between receiving higher-quality care and spending financial resources elsewhere,” the authors write. “If price variation is instead driven by consolidation or anticompetitive contracting, then regulators should design policies that ensure competitive health care markets.”

Sam’s Club has launched a new offer through which you can order a 16-inch Member’s Mark pizza for $8.98 delivered to your door. FOX Business reported that the reception has been incredibly positive from consumers.

It’s not just about competing with other retailers, but also with businesses like Domino’s or Papa John’s. In addition, Costo does not have a delivery service, but operates through Instacart. Consumers seem to be leaning towards the service offered by Sam’s Club through its mobile app, and this may be the beginning of a fierce competition for market leadership.

Walmart and Sam´s Club

Founded in 1962 and currently run by the Walton family, Walmart is a U.S. multinational retail corporation that operates chains of department stores. It is famous for its numerous discounts and for selling its own and well-known brand-name products. Its catalog is extensive and includes virtually every product you could need or imagine; food, beverages, furniture, appliances, clothing, shoes, tires, and even take-out food.

In 1983, Sam’s Club, a chain of membership stores owned by Walmart, was created. While it functions as the parent company, Sam’s Club functions as another chain of stores in the market, helping to diversify the offering and making it difficult for other retailers to compete.

Costco

Founded in 1976 under the name Price Club, the company evolved to become Costco in 1983. It is a department store offering quality products at low prices. Like Walmart, Costco is a multinational chain store chain that sells products at low prices. Its worldwide expansion did not take long to occur, and it has more than 800 stores around the world. Currently, and practically since its inception, it leads the U.S. market in terms of stores and sales. Despite fierce competition, it is still the most chosen by consumers today.

Historic battle

Since its inception, Costco has led the wholesale club market in the United States. However, competition is fierce and brands such as Walmart are close behind. That is why Sam’s Club (a Walmart subsidiary) has launched a series of marketing strategies to compete directly with Costco and tip the scales. According to CSIMarket’s latest Q1 2025 data, the Costco chain continues to lead the sector with a 77.7% share. When Sam’s Club came onto the scene, Costco had already been in the market for years, so its experience gave it a big advantage. Its focus was on innovating and retaining customers with different propositions, as well as appealing to new customers.

The pizza strategy

Last May, Sam’s Club launched its heavy artillery with a very competitive initiative. It became the first chain to offer pizza delivery through its mobile app. It is in direct competition with Costco’s $9.99 pizzas. In this case, Sam’s Club offers 16-inch Member’s Mark brand pizzas with a base price of $8.99. Both Club and Plus members can enjoy this service, except that the latter will have free delivery if the order is over $50. There will be a surcharge for express delivery or if you are a standard member ($12).

Succeeding with the new strategy

FOX Bussines published a statement in which the brand explained the good reception of the new offering saying “Since the launch of pizza delivery at the end of May, we are encouraged by the strong response from members. Initial performance has exceeded expectations, with robust demand, high repeat order rates and enthusiastic feedback from members looking for affordable, high quality meals delivered hot and fresh”. With this new measure, Sam’s Club not only competes with Costco, but also with food establishments such as Domino’s and Papa John’s, whose prices far exceed those of the chain.

Is it enough to dethrone Costco?

The reality is that it doesn’t. Although Costco does not have home delivery service, it does have restaurants in its stores. In addition, there is the possibility of ordering through Instacart, so the niche market would also be served.",https://www.lagradaonline.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 15:07:04.815786

Both McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme are already moving forward.","The decisions made by major food chains directly influence the daily habits of millions of people. In the United States, fast food is part of the daily rhythm. When there are changes, consumers feel them immediately.

Brands like McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme have managed to position themselves at key moments of the day. Their presence at breakfast represents more than just a quick meal. For many, it's a routine that combines flavor, convenience, and tradition.

An Agreement That Came to an End

This Tuesday, McDonald’s and Krispy Kreme announced the end of their collaboration. The partnership, which began in 2024, had plans for national expansion through 2026. However, both confirmed that it would officially end during July.

""Ultimately, the efforts to adjust our costs to unit demand weren't successful,"" explained Josh Charlesworth, CEO of Krispy Kreme. This made the model unsustainable for the brand. Despite that, Charlesworth thanked McDonald’s for the opportunity to work together in 2,400 of their restaurants.

From McDonald’s, Alyssa Buetikofer highlighted: ""We had a strong collaboration... but it also had to be a profitable business model for Krispy Kreme."" Both companies assured that it was a shared decision.

New Strategies After the Split

The donut company will focus its next steps on increasing its direct presence in stores and supermarkets. It will also continue with its international expansion, such as in Brazil and Paris. The company will seek to strengthen its retail partnerships to keep growing in the country.

The challenge is significant: during the first quarter of 2025, Krispy Kreme reported heavy losses. In addition, its shares have fallen by more than 70% this year. With this new approach, they hope to rebalance their financial strategy.

Meanwhile, McDonald’s confirmed that donuts represented a minimal fraction of their breakfast sales. Now it will focus on offering ""delicious, affordable, and convenient"" options. The possible return of the Snack Wrap is a sign of that refocus.

Although for some consumers this may mean saying goodbye to their favorite sweet, it's also an opportunity. New trends in retail and food consumption will keep setting the path.

“In Q1 2025, the Philippine PC market recorded strong growth in the consumer and private sectors, but was offset by a sharp decline in education-related shipments,“ said Roben Dispo, associate research analyst, IDC Philippines.
As a result, the overall market contracted in Q1 2025 compared to the much stronger education-driven quarter in 2024, even as demand from consumers and private organizations continues to build.” In Q1 2025, Acer retained its lead in the Philippine PC market, followed by Lenovo and HP.

“In Q1 2025, the Philippine PC market recorded strong growth in the consumer and private sectors, but was offset by a sharp decline in education-related shipments,“ said Roben Dispo, associate research analyst, IDC Philippines. “The drop in the education segment was expected, following the fulfillment of three years’ worth of Department of Education Computerization Program (DCP) budgets from 2022 to 2024. That funding drove a double-digit increase in education-related shipments last year, creating a high base of comparison. As a result, the overall market contracted in Q1 2025 compared to the much stronger education-driven quarter in 2024, even as demand from consumers and private organizations continues to build.”

In Q1 2025, Acer retained its lead in the Philippine PC market, followed by Lenovo and HP. All three vendors maintained a strong presence across both consumer and commercial segments. ASUS, with most activity in the consumer space, placed fourth, while Dell followed closely, primarily driven by commercial shipments.

As the education-driven surge tapered off, the private sector maintained strong momentum, with many organizations, especially in the BPO industry, refreshing PCs purchased during the pandemic.

Will UPS Restructuring Impact Deliveries?
UPS has not announced a timeline for when union drivers will receive formal buyout offers.","United Parcel Service (UPS) is laying off thousands of front-line employees and shuttering dozens of facilities as part of what it calls the ""largest network reconfiguration"" in company history.

UPS confirmed Thursday that it would be offering voluntary buyouts to its union-represented U.S. drivers for the first time as part of this sweeping restructuring effort, aimed at increasing efficiency in response to a decline in package volumes.

Why It Matters

UPS is the largest courier in the country, delivering an estimated 19 million packages in the U.S. every day. The leaner workforce could impact UPS's operational capacity and affect the businesses and everyday customers who rely on its services. However, the company has expressed its continued commitment to ensuring the same level of service and confidence in its ability to navigate changing industry trends.

The job cuts and buyout plan—which has sparked a confrontation with the Teamsters Union, representing over 300,000 UPS employees—are taking place against a backdrop of shifting trade dynamics that have created uncertainty across global supply chains.

What To Know

In April, UPS announced that it would be cutting 20,000 jobs and shuttering 73 facilities in 2025 as part of its ongoing ""Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined"" initiative, which aims to streamline the business through automation and consolidation of its U.S. operations. The announcement followed earlier news that UPS would be reducing reliance on Amazon as a customer and experiencing a decline in shipping as a result.

In January, UPS unveiled this ""glide down"" plan to cut transported order volumes with the e-commerce giant ""more than 50 percent by the second half of 2026.""

On Thursday, UPS announced that it would be offering voluntary buyouts to full-time drivers as part of its ""largest network reconfiguration"" ever.

""We are looking to offer our full-time U.S. drivers the opportunity to participate in a voluntary program that would provide an opportunity to receive a generous financial package if they choose to leave UPS,"" the Atlanta-based company said in a statement shared with Newsweek. In addition to this unspecified payout, drivers would also receive earned retirement benefits, including pensions and health care.

Sean M. O'Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, called the plan ""an illegal violation"" of the contract it struck with UPS in 2023 to create 22,500 jobs over five years. ""UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts in front of Teamsters drivers,"" O'Brien said on Thursday.

UPS told Newsweek it remains ""committed"" to the agreements reached with the Teamsters Union in 2023 and that it has approached the union regarding the matter. Newsweek also reached out to the Teamsters Union via for comment.

Will UPS Restructuring Impact Deliveries?

While it did not comment on how the restructuring process would impact deliveries and delivery times, UPS told Newsweek: ""As we work through our network reconfiguration, we remain steadfast in our commitment to providing our customers with the reliable, industry-leading service they expect from UPS.""

As well as the increased incorporation of automation into its business, the layoffs are motivated by the planned decline in Amazon shipping volumes, according to UPS. As a result, the decrease in staffing could be balanced by a reduced workload, therefore preventing major interruptions to customers' shipments.

In April, Chief Financial Officer Brian Dykes said the layoffs and closures were ""in line with the total Amazon volume decline,"" adding that package volumes from Amazon had already dropped by more than had been expected during the first quarter.

While sizeable, the cuts announced in April will also only affect slightly more than four percent of UPS's 490,000-strong workforce.

Given the recency of the announcement, it remains unclear how many employees will accept this buyout offer or whether union resistance could force UPS to scale back its restructuring plans.

What Happens Next?

UPS has not announced a timeline for when union drivers will receive formal buyout offers. Labor tensions are expected to persist as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters signals further resistance.

No specific disruptions have yet been confirmed as a result of the layoffs, though U.S. consumers and businesses may see changes in delivery operations as the restructuring unfolds.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2677308/ups.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 14:08:28.020417

TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada’s services economy contracted at a steeper pace in June as uncertainty generated by U.S. trade policy depressed activity and cost pressures increased, S&P Global’s Canada services PMI data showed on Friday.

The headline Business Activity Index fell to 44.3 last month from 45.6 in May, marking the seventh straight month the index has been below the 50 threshold. A sub-50 reading indicates contraction in the sector.

“Canada’s services economy remained deep inside contraction territory during June, as uncertainty caused in the main by US trade policies continued to weigh heavily on activity and new business volumes,” Paul Smith, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a statement.

“International demand was again especially hard hit, and the outlook remains subdued given widespread uneasiness and challenges in forecasting business trends in the months ahead.”

Canada sends about 75% of its exports to the United States, including autos, steel and aluminum, which have been hit by hefty U.S. tariffs.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to reach some form of a trade deal by July 21.

Still, confidence in the outlook remained subdued. The Future Activity Index was at 54.9, down from 58.9 in May and its lowest level since March.

“Positively, firms added to their staffing levels in June although, reflective of the uncertain outlook and rising labour expenses, recruitment tended to be for part-time workers,” Smith said.

“On the price front, operating costs rose to the greatest degree since October 2022 which served to push up selling prices at a faster pace despite the challenging business environment.”

The Input Prices Index rose to 62.7 from 62.1 in May, while the prices charged measure was at 55.1, up from 54.6 and its highest level since May 2024.

The S&P Global Canada Composite PMI Output Index fell to 44.0 in June from 45.5 in May, extending the current downturn to seven months.

Data on Wednesday showed that the downturn in manufacturing activity deepened last month. The S&P Global Canada Manufacturing PMI edged down to 45.6 from 46.1 in May.

With this agreement, the airline takes a major step towards becoming the world's first low-cost narrow-body network carrier, anchored by its multi-hub strategy. The aircraft are scheduled for delivery commencing 2028 through 2032.

Witnessed by Prime Minister of Malaysia YAB Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim, the agreement was signed today in Paris between Tony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A, and Christian Scherer, CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

Tony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A and Advisor & Steward of AirAsia Group said: ""We pioneered low-cost travel in Asia - now, we are taking it to the next level.

The next-generation A321XLRs will operate alongside AirAsia's all-Airbus fleet of A320 Family and A330 aircraft, supporting its long-term strategy to deliver unmatched connectivity across Asia and beyond, while maintaining a low-cost model through improved route economics, enhanced aircraft utilisation and fleet efficiency. AirAsia Group aims to carry 150 million guests annually by 2030, reaching a cumulative total of 1.5 billion guests since inception.

The new fleet plays a pivotal role in this transformation. AirAsia's multi-aircraft strategy enables the airline to match capacity with demand, reduce fuel consumption, and support a sustainable, cost-effective growth model in a highly competitive global landscape. The A321XLR also offers up to 20 per cent lower fuel burn per seat than the Airbus A321neo aircraft, significantly improving emissions performance and operating efficiency.",https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdnoir.png,N,,2025-07-04 13:12:04.365681

“Instead of popping champagne and toasting to their merger, Kroger is instead just enduring one hit after another,” said Jeff Wells, lead editor at the trade publication Grocery Dive.
“Today, not all of our stores are delivering the sustainable results we need.” Kroger temporarily paused routine store closures while the Albertsons merger was pending, Sargent said.
“That’s the major challenge right now.” Kroger relies on pharmacy services, advertising and e-commerce for additional revenue, experts said.
Kroger and Albertsons collectively own about 5,000 grocery stores.","After a series of setbacks, Kroger’s recent decision to close 60 locations nationwide is the latest sign of distress for the grocer that operates more than 300 stores in California.

Kroger, the parent company of Ralphs and Food 4 Less, is reducing its footprint after the resignation of its chief executive and a failed merger with competing grocery giant Albertsons. The company faces a lawsuit related to the merger and also has been struggling with labor unrest.

Employees had been threatening to strike until the company reached a tentative agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers union this week.

Based in Cincinnati, Kroger also owns Harris Teeter, King Soopers and Dillons. The company operates more than 2,700 stores under different brands across the country and offers fresh goods, some household items and pharmacy services.

“Instead of popping champagne and toasting to their merger, Kroger is instead just enduring one hit after another,” said Jeff Wells, lead editor at the trade publication Grocery Dive. “They’re still a pretty stable business, but they’re facing a lot in terms of challenges.”

Impending closures

Kroger announced late last month in its quarterly earnings report that it plans to close 60 stores over the next 18 months. The company did not disclose which locations would be shut down.

“We’re simplifying our business and reviewing areas that will not be meaningful to our future growth,” interim Chief Executive Ronald Sargent said in an earnings call. “Today, not all of our stores are delivering the sustainable results we need.”

Kroger temporarily paused routine store closures while the Albertsons merger was pending, Sargent said. The company normally closes about 30 stores per year, Melius Research analyst Jacob Aiken-Phillips said.

The company is on track to complete 30 major store projects this year and expects to accelerate store openings in 2026, Sargent said on the earnings call.

Competitive market

Kroger is under increasing pressure from competitors, experts said, some of which offer a wider range of items and convenient one-stop shops.

“Kroger faces this intensely competitive field in the grocery industry,” Wells said. “From Walmart to Costco to Whole Foods and Sprouts Farmers Market, everybody in the industry is kind of gunning for them.”

The Albertsons merger would have given Kroger the scale to compete with giants such as Walmart and Amazon, Aiken-Phillips said.

“After the merger failed, they had to reexamine their strategy and focus on how they can grow and compete without that scale,” he said. “That’s the major challenge right now.”

Kroger relies on pharmacy services, advertising and e-commerce for additional revenue, experts said. Although the company grew its e-commerce business 15% in the first quarter of this year, the business remains unprofitable.

A chief executive shuffle

Former Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen stepped down in March after an investigation into his personal conduct, the company announced. Sargent was appointed chairman of the board of directors and interim CEO.

Kroger did not share details of the investigation into McMullen. His “personal conduct, while unrelated to the business, was inconsistent with Kroger’s Policy on Business Ethics,” the company’s statement said.

“When he resigned, it threw a wrench in progressing the company because now you need a new leader to come in,” Aiken-Phillips said.

A failed merger

In 2022, Kroger agreed to buy Albertsons for $24.6 billion, a sale that would have been the largest supermarket merger in U.S. history.

The Federal Trade Commission, California and several other states sued to stop the merger, arguing that it would hobble competition in many parts of the country, leaving customers at the mercy of a newly formed behemoth and driving up prices. Kroger and Albertsons collectively own about 5,000 grocery stores.

In late 2024, Albertsons scrapped the deal after a federal judge in Oregon issued a preliminary injunction in the case. The high-stakes court battle centered on concerns that the megamerger would add to the financial woes of consumers who have grappled with the rising cost of food.

Albertsons also sued Kroger, claiming that the grocer didn’t do enough to win over regulators. Kroger has since countersued.

Ongoing labor unrest

In June, grocery workers at Albertsons and Kroger — numbering about 45,000 — voted to authorize a strike to protest what they called unfair labor practices. A walkout would have caused a major disruption for two of the nation’s largest grocery chains during the busiest season of the year.

The United Food and Commercial Workers union announced Thursday that it reached a tentative agreement with the two companies that would allow them to avoid a strike. The union will vote on whether to approve the agreement July 9-11.

“Following an intense 40 plus hour bargaining session that began on Friday morning, we’ve secured an agreement that addresses our priorities,” the union said in a statement.

The agreement includes higher wages, improved pension plans as well as health and welfare improvements, the union said. Kroger did not respond to requests for comment.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6df79bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3900x2048+0+276/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F1f%2Fea983af6458caac36a76bbfd383c%2Fla-photos-1staff-707629-me-grocery-store-closing-24.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 13:11:25.099493

The U.S. is projected to face a physician shortage in the next 11 years, per the Association of American Medical Colleges, and foreign medical residents fill critical gaps in the health care system.
“They’re truly providing health care for all of America.” Foreign medical residents work in specialties that U.S. applicants aren't as eager to apply to.
“The residents are the backbone of the entire hospital,” said Dr. Zaid Alrashid from Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in New York, which has medical residents from almost every continent.
Foreign medical trainees who've made it into the U.S. remain on edge about their situations, Karuppiah said.","Some hospitals in the U.S. are without essential staff because international doctors who were set to start their medical training this week were delayed by the Trump administration's travel and visa restrictions.

It's unclear exactly how many foreign medical residents were unable to start their assignments, but six medical residents interviewed by The Associated Press say they’ve undergone years of training and work only to be stopped at the finish line by what is usually a procedural step.

“I don’t want to give up,” said a permanent Canadian resident who matched to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Harrisburg but had her visa denied because she is a citizen of Afghanistan. She requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. “But the situation also seems so helpless.”

Initially, the medical community was worried that hundreds of positions — many in hospitals in low-income or rural areas of the U.S. — could be affected. The pause on interviews for J-1 visas for approved work or study-related programs was lifted in mid-June.

The national nonprofit that facilitates the residency match process said the visa situation is resolving, but it will take weeks to know with confidence how many medical residents have had the start of their careers derailed because they got their visa too late or were blocked by President Donald Trump’s travel ban on 12 countries, according to people who coordinate the residents’ training.

Four foreign medical residents told the AP that U.S. embassies have been slow to open up interview slots — and some have not opened any.

“You lose out on the time you could have used to treat patients,” said one resident from Pakistan, who matched to an internal medicine program in Massachusetts and requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal.

The U.S. is projected to face a physician shortage in the next 11 years, per the Association of American Medical Colleges, and foreign medical residents fill critical gaps in the health care system. More than 6,600 foreign-born international medical residents matched into U.S. programs in 2025 — the highest on record — and another 300 filled positions that were vacant after the match process was complete.

Not all of those residents were affected by visa issues or the travel ban on foreign nationals from countries including Afghanistan, Haiti and Sudan.

International medical graduates often take jobs in places where U.S. medical trainees tend not to go, said Donna Lamb, president of the National Resident Matching Program.

“It’s not just that they’re coming in and they want to work in big, flashy centers on the coast,” Lamb said. “They’re truly providing health care for all of America.”

Foreign medical residents work in specialties that U.S. applicants aren't as eager to apply to. For example, international candidates make up almost 40% of residents in internal medicine, which specializes in the prevention and treatment of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.

“The residents are the backbone of the entire hospital,” said Dr. Zaid Alrashid from Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in New York, which has medical residents from almost every continent. Most received their visas prior to the pause but a few were caught up in delays.

Two residents from India who spoke on condition of anonymity have not been able to get an appointment at any U.S. embassies there despite the J-1 visa pause being lifted.

Another resident from Egypt just secured a visa appointment for mid-August but is worried her program may not be willing to wait for her. She’s already paid her security deposit for an apartment in Texas to live during her residency.

""I don’t know when this situation will be resolved,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding she hasn’t been eating or sleeping well.

In California, leaders at two graduate medical education programs said they have a small number of residents caught up in J-1 visa delays. Both spoke on condition of anonymity due to concerns for the doctors who are still trying to get visas.

A residency leader at one large health care system said two doctors in its 150-resident program are delayed, adding they could start late or defer to next year. A 135-person program at a California public health system told the AP that one resident has yet to arrive, though he was finally scheduled for a visa interview.

“We are not going to breathe easy until he's here in our hospital,” the second leader said.

As of Wednesday, Lamb's matching program had received fewer than 20 requests to defer or cancel residency contracts.

Worried about losing their spots if they defer, many foreign medical residents may keep trying to get to the U.S. and start their residencies late, said Dr. Sabesan Karuppiah, a past member of the American Medical Association's International Medical Graduates Governing Council and former director of a large residency program.

Some hospitals may struggle at this point to replace the residents who don't make it, leaving fewer people to care for the same number of patients, said Kimberly Pierce Burke, executive director of the Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers.

Foreign medical trainees who've made it into the U.S. remain on edge about their situations, Karuppiah said.

“I can tell you the word on the street is: ‘Do not leave the country,'” he said, adding that people are missing out on important events, seeing sick parents or even getting married. “Everybody's scared to just leave, not knowing what's going to happen.”

ID13,CVS Health,2025-07-04 15:57:25+00:00,104.5 WOKV,Rural hospitals brace for financial hits or even closure under Republicans' $1 trillion Medicaid cut,MARGERY A. BECK and SUSAN HAIGH,,,,,https://www.wokv.com/news/health/rural-hospitals/OAW4O4J5MFHO3OEXFC2ZKNMRVU/,"More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.
President Donald Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers.
But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total.
Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.
“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,"" Cochran-McClain said.","OMAHA, Neb. — (AP) — Tyler Sherman, a nurse at a rural Nebraska hospital, is used to the area's aging farmers delaying care until they end up in his emergency room.

Now, with Congress planning around $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, he fears those farmers and the more than 3,000 residents of Webster County could lose not just the ER, but also the clinic and nursing home tied to the hospital.

“Our budget is pretty heavily reliant on the Medicaid reimbursement, so if we do see a cut of that, it’ll be difficult to keep the doors open,” said Sherman, who works at Webster County Community Hospital in the small Nebraska town of Red Cloud just north of the Kansas border.

If those facilities close, many locals would see their five-minute trip to Webster County hospital turn into a nearly hour-long ride to the nearest hospital offering the same services.

“That's a long way for an emergency,” Sherman said. “Some won't make it.”

States and rural health advocacy groups warn that cutting Medicaid — a program serving millions of low-income and disabled Americans — would hit already fragile rural hospitals hard and could force hundreds to close, stranding some people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.

More than 300 hospitals could be at risk for closure under the Republican bill, according to an analysis by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which tracks rural hospital closures. Even as Congress haggled over the controversial bill, a health clinic in the southwest Nebraska town of Curtis announced Wednesday it will close in the coming months, in part blaming the anticipated Medicaid cuts.

Bruce Shay, of Pomfret, Connecticut, fears he and his wife could be among those left in the lurch. At 70, they're both in good health, he said. But that likely means that if either needs to go to a hospital, “it's going to be an emergency.”

Day Kimball Hospital is nearby in Putnam, but it has faced recent financial challenges. Day Kimball's CEO R. Kyle Kramer acknowledged that a Senate bill passed Tuesday — estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years — would further hurt his rural hospital's bottom line. Roughly 30% of Day Kimball's current patients receive Medicaid benefits, a figure that's even higher for specific, critical services like obstetrics and behavioral health.

“An emergency means I’m 45 minutes to an hour away from the nearest hospital, and that’s a problem,"" Shay said. And he and his wife wouldn't be the only ones having to make that trip.

“You’ve got, I’m sure, thousands of people who rely on Day Kimball Hospital. If it closed, thousands of people would have to go to another hospital,” he said. “That’s a huge load to suddenly impose on a hospital system that’s probably already stretched thin.”

Rural hospitals have long operated on the financial edge, especially in recent years as Medicaid payments have continuously fallen below the actual cost to provide health care. More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.

President Donald Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers. To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs — cuts they insist only root out fraud and waste in the system.

But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total. Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.

Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals already struggle to break even, citing a recent American Hospital Association report that found that hospitals in 2023 got nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.

“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,"" Cochran-McClain said. ""Meaning that any amount of cut to a payer — especially a payer like Medicaid that makes up a significant portion of rural provider funding — is going to be consequential to the rural hospitals' ability to provide certain services or maybe even keep their doors open at the end of the day.”

A KFF report shows 36 states losing $1 billion or more over 10 years in Medicaid funding for rural areas under the Republican bill, even with the $50 billion rural fund. No state stands to lose more than Kentucky.

The report estimates the Bluegrass State would lose a whopping $12.3 billion — nearly $5 billion more than the next state on the list. That's because the bill ends Kentucky's unique Medicaid reimbursement system and reduces it to Medicare reimbursement levels.

Kentucky currently has one of the lowest Medicare reimbursement rates in the country. It also has one of the highest poverty rates, leading to a third of its population being covered by Medicaid.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat widely seen as a potential candidate for president in 2028, said the bill would close 35 hospitals in his state and pull health care coverage for 200,000 residents.

“Half of Kentucky’s kids are covered under Medicaid. They lose their coverage and you are scrambling over that next prescription,” Beshear said during an appearance on MSNBC. “This is going to impact the life of every single American negatively. It is going to hammer our economy.""

Danby Air Conditioners

Customers who purchased Danby brand U-shaped window Air Conditioners from Costco between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022, have been warned to stop using the products immediately.

The supplier Midea America Corp. is recalling the product as they say the air conditioners present a risk of mold growth, due to pooled water in the appliance not draining quickly enough.

Mold exposure poses risks of respiratory issues or other infections, the recall notice said.

The supplier is offering a free repair kit, depending on the model of air conditioner, or a full or prorated refund. Costco members can return the air conditioner to a Costco warehouse for a full refund.

The items have the model number DAC080B6IWDB-6.

BowFlex Dumbbells

Customers who have purchased BowFlex 552 adjustable dumbbells from Costco have been advised to immediately stop using the product due to malfunctioning risks.

Johnson Health Tech Trading has issued a voluntary recall of the product due to reports that the weight plates on the dumbbells can dislodge from the handle during use, which poses an impact hazard.

Customers can return the items to Costco for a full refund.

Anker Power Banks

Anker has issued a voluntary recall of several of its power banks due to a potential issue involving lithium-ion battery cells.

The company stated the recall is limited to power banks of the Model A1257 (10,000mAh, 22.5W), which were manufactured by a single vendor, and noted that the risk of malfunction remains low.

Any customers who have purchased an affected power bank can receive a replacement after providing proof of their purchase.

Michelin Tires

Michelin has recalled certain tires that it says do not conform to regulatory requirements and could, therefore, increase the risk of a car crash.

The affected products are certain Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires in the 185/60R15C size, which were found to not meet the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 139, which sets safety and performance requirements for new radial tires on light vehicles.

The company said that chunks of tread rubber could detach from the shoulder block of the tires.

TradingKey - In a year where global sports brands face inventory builds and fluid consumer behavior, Nike’s (NKE) recent earnings release reveals an uncomfortable reality: even an icon is not immune to cyclical drag and self-generated execution risk. Revenues fell 10% to $46.3 billion for fiscal 2025, and diluted EPS fell 42% to $2.16.

Source: Nike, FY25 and Q4 Results

But underlying these stark numbers is an inflection point: management’s ‘Win Now’ initiatives and transition toward a ‘Sport Offense’ strategy add up to more than a turnaround strategy; they represent a redefined playbook toward regaining pricing power and reinvigorating sustainable brand fervency. But when valuation multiples such as forward EV/EBITDA live 181% above the sector median and the PEG ratio signals limited earnings growth, the question from institutional allocators is if such a premium is baked in within squeezed margins and soft volume trends.

For a business trading at just above 33x trailing earnings with slowing EBIT, the onus is on execution discipline and capital allocation caution toward reestablishing Nike’s moat. This piece challenges fundamentals beneath the swoosh, Nike’s model sustainability, the cost of its luxury brand, and whether its ’Sport Offense’ will play wide enough toward insulating investor return.

Indomitable Icon Performing Under Pressure: It's a Hot Business Model

Nike used to set the gold standard for sportswear branding. Vertical integration combines global leadership in wholesale markets with a growing Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business, Nike Direct, designed for higher-margin sales and direct customer feedback. But FY25 was a difficult year for the DTC engine: Nike Direct revenues declined 13%, and its online channels declined 20% year-over-year.

Commentary from management and tables of earnings alike confirm weakness in digital models, as fueled in part by more promotions stripping away the price integrity historically underlying Nike’s gross margins. Up until FY2024, Nike’s Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel had been a growing share of total revenue, increasingly viewed as a margin engine and a core pillar of its premium brand control.

Source: Statista

Wholesale revenues declined 7% as retailers cut their orders to whittle down bloated inventories. The strong sports marketing spend of the brand, demand creation of $4.7 billion, 9% higher, remains its defensive moat and keeps Nike culturally relevant market to market from North America through EMEA and Greater China.

But the decline in North American shoe sales revenue, down 13% from the year before, indicates a further weakness: consumers are rebalancing discretionary spending priorities, and new competitors are capturing share. Jordan Brand revenues, once Nike’s bulletproof growth engine, dropped a dramatic 16%, reminding us that storied sub-brands are not immune to fatigue on the part of consumers when the product pipeline fails to deliver. Meanwhile, the ’Sport Offense’ realignment places teams in charge of reorganizing around hero businesses, such as basketball and running, paring down the product set in an effort to combat channel conflict and recapture storytelling. The operational risk is explicit: this strategy must be a success at rejuvenating pricing discipline, something a 190-basis-point annual decline in gross margins down 42.7% renders acutely clear.

Even once sales soften, multi-decade brand equity still allows for optionality. With more than $9.2 billion in cash and equivalents on the books, there's dry powder that can be used to cushion dividends, now in their 23rd consecutive year of increases, and share buybacks, reaching $3 billion this year.

Source: Nike, FY25 and Q4 Results

But after EBIT fell 42% and cost savings from reduced operating overhead were offset by increasing marketing spend, the return path to growth for margins will be gradual and incremental, not immediate. Investors should pressure test whether Nike's new playbook can materially reposition its Direct channel margins, still structurally dilutive if there's continuing discounting.

Chasing Competitors on a Dynamic Track: Competitive Environment Stresses

The hitherto unchallengeable gap between Nike and its rivals is closing. Nike has long led global footwear revenues, but Adidas and Puma are gradually closing the gap, especially post-2020.

Source: Statista

Adidas and Puma, small on an absolute scale, are winning share on differentiated sustainability and youth culture propositions. Lululemon, indirectly competing on performance shoes, steals wallet share from Nike’s female business, where FY25 sales fell 6%. Even home-based new entrants Anta and Li-Ning are gaining ground within Greater China, where Nike sales fell 13% with local demand biasing home brands better positioned on streetwear-blended performance apparel.

Valuation multiples just intensify the competitive pressure. At 33.99 times trailing P/E Non-GAAP multiple, Nike’s multiple is more than double its industry median 15.92 multiple, and its forward PEG Non-GAAP reaches 9.79, over 456% above peers. Such multiples presume market conviction regarding Nike’s elasticity of its brands and its supply chain management. But if EBIT margins have compressed from 12.7% a year ago to only 8.2% today and Greater China EBIT fell 31% YoY, the valuation premium becomes more difficult to rationalize compared to its earnings foundation.

Also, competitors are not resting on their laurels. Adidas's leaner operating model, through CEO Bjørn Gulden's leadership, is driving operating leverage with better margins and a leaner DTC push. Though digitally native brands like On Running and HOKA have better net promoter scores through new-age positioning of their products and sticky user communities, they also have smaller wholesale legacy burdens and can thus maintain tighter reins on discounting dynamics, which was identified on Nike's earnings call as a continuing drag on quality margin.

Another competitive vector worth tracking is AI-based demand planning. While Nike has moved forward with predictive analytics for best-in-class inventory levels, continued discounting reflects that its AI-based merchandising engine isn't yet achieving the desired flywheel effect. Until Nike’s supply chain intelligence can right-size production with real-demand signals, without promotional excess, the disparity in valuation relative to its leaner peers could be a decent drag.

Reconstruction of Margins: Stress Test for Financial Engine

Nike's FY2025 results showed a strained profit engine: net income declined 44% YoY, and free cash flow has dwindled under double pressure from high demand creation cost and sluggish top-line growth. Earnings tables show EBIT down 42% to $3.78 billion, involving a steeper drop from 12.7% to 8.2% EBIT margin. While operating overhead cost declined 7%, this was inadequate compensation for dilution from promotional discounting and changes in channel mix. Inventories stubbornly linger at $7.5 billion, level year-on-year, signifying that the 'Win Now' strategy must overcome costly drag from excess inventory.

A closer look at valuation multiples brings us face-to-face with the pricing paradox. Nike’s EV/EBITDA (FWD) stands at 29.19x, virtually triple the industry median of 10.37x. The EV/Sales multiple is similarly swollen at 2.41x forward versus a median of 1.28x, indicative of forecasted sales quality return and margin restoration. Nevertheless, management’s FY25 guide does not yet bring about complete conviction that such a reset is just around the bend. Gross margin headwinds and currency headwinds within EMEA and soft consumer sentiment throughout China prevent such a normalization on a near-term basis.

To their credit, Nike’s capital allocation remains disciplined. This year, the company returned $5.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and buybacks and retired $1 billion in long-term debt, reinforcing its capital structure. But with operating cash flows cancelled out by capex and returns, there’s a danger that future capacity for buybacks could shrink if the core business fails to deliver a tangible free cash flow uplift. And an increase in its effective tax rate, 17.1% from 14.9% the previous year, also dilutes net profit leverage at a stage when every basis point counts.

Source: Nike, FY25 and Q4 Results

Success will be dependent on a clean inventory position, disciplined SG&A, and a winning ’Sport Offense’ leading to a more profitable product mix. A rejuvenated Jordan business can be a margin engine, but its 16% decline this year epitomizes the execution risk if new design cycles don’t bring renewed cultural relevance.

Valuation: Paying a Premium for a Turnaround

Current multiples provide a note of caution. With a forward P/E multiple of 42.7, translating to a 134% premium compared to the sector, such a spread is difficult to rationalize with revenues dwindling and earnings power decreasing. The multiple of Price-to-Book is also 8.20 compared to a sector median of just 2.09, a sign that there is still residual value attributed by the market to brand equity and intangible moat, even as tangible depreciation takes its toll. The forward EV/EBIT multiple is 36.10x compared to peers, approximately 15.30x.

Benchmarking vs. historical averages only elevates the image. Nike’s trailing twelve-month (TTM) P/E Non-GAAP is just above its five-year average by 15.92%; however, the forward multiple is nearly 17.32% higher. It gives us an inkling that although there’s anticipation among investors towards a recovery, there’s no buffer if the ‘Sport Offense’ reorganization fails to arrest gross-margin decline or trigger re-acceleration in digitally driven top-line lines.

A more cautious fair value range should therefore be based on EBIT normalization. With a return of EBIT over the next two years back to $5 billion and an industry-average forward EV/EBIT multiple closer to 20x, this would therefore imply an enterprise value closer to $100 billion, well down from today's market capitalization above $110 billion. This implies mid-single-digit downside risk if turnaround benefits don't materialize at speed.

Risk Assessment: Implementation, Consumer Cyclicality, and Valuation Compression

Nike's risk profile revolves around a few different axes. First, mistakes in executing the ‘Sport Offense’ strategy could keep cyclical discounting extended and maintain pressure on gross margins, pushing the PEG ratio even further relative to peers. Secondly, cyclicality on the consumer level is an understated drag: discretionary demand for high-margin shoes and apparel could soften even more if continuing macro headwinds prevail. Thirdly, secular trends toward niche performance branding and sustainability narratives could draw wallet share that Nike has long assumed.

From a capital market standpoint, there is not much buffer for successive compression. If EBIT does not recover soon, Nike’s premium can be diluted due to industry re-ratings pressure, particularly as peer brands build their presence with leaner cost structures and direct channels.

Conclusion

Its strong brand and deep balance sheet keep it alive, but high-end valuation demands impeccable execution. Its ‘Sport Offense’ playbook requires swift restoration of margins and digital rejuvenation to justify defending a forward P/E double its sector median. For allocators, this remains a hold and not an automatic sprint.",,N,,2025-07-04 15:07:28.129746

Artificial intelligence is transforming everything, irreversibly.","Amazon is no longer what it used to be. Walmart is falling behind. Best Buy could become irrelevant… what’s going on? What seemed unthinkable just a few years ago is now a real possibility: artificial intelligence is dismantling the traditional online retail model. That’s right, something that once felt impossible is now closer than ever.

Homepages, digital storefronts, are dying. And in their place, shoppers are increasingly turning to AI assistants that tell them directly what to buy, where to buy it, and why.

The transformation has already begun. Beyond using artificial intelligence as a new way to search for information, it has become a hyper-personalized shopping advisor. You don’t need to visit Amazon if your AI assistant already knows what you need and redirects you to the best available product. This puts the e-commerce giants in check, they risk becoming invisible if they don’t adapt quickly. But… does this make us more passive? More controlled?

Not all is lost (yet). There are three paths that could save these brands: leading on price, dominating logistics, or becoming experts in content. This is the story of the new digital commerce era, and how to survive it.

What is the dismantling of retail?

For decades, the homepage was the gateway to online shopping. You typed amazon.com, searched for a product, compared, and bought. But that’s changed. Today, more and more users get recommendations directly from AI tools, without ever visiting a store’s website. The AI answers your needs directly, and often, it does it better than you can.

It’s almost like what happened to the media industry when social media took over. People stopped visiting newspaper homepages: each article became a separate entry point through Facebook, Twitter, or Google. The media had to reinvent itself or die, even if that process opened the door to the dreaded fake news era.

Surviving the change

There are three strategies big brands are currently pursuing, and of course, we’re going to tell you about them.

Strategy 1: Leading on price like Walmart: AI looks for the best deal. If the cheapest option wins, then Walmart might survive thanks to its massive scale. But it’s a tough road: it requires volume, low margins, and extreme efficiency. Not everyone can pull that off.

Strategy 2: Dominating logistics like Amazon: Consumers want speed. And Amazon has the most efficient distribution network on the planet. Even if its homepage loses relevance, its next-day delivery power might keep it on top.

Strategy 3 : This is the big opportunity for many brands. If you’re no longer going to Amazon to look for a coffee maker, but your AI assistant recommends the best one based on expert advice, then whoever creates trustworthy, useful content will have the upper hand. It’s no longer just about selling, it’s about guiding!

The future of e-commerce will be more personalized

Forget about a single entry point. In the new marketplace, every user will have a different experience. The site will adapt to your preferences. The products you see will be shaped by your habits. And the recommendations will come from creators or influencers who understand your lifestyle.

Specialized intelligence

Just as the media world saw the rise of independent journalists with strong authority in specific topics, in commerce we’ll see smaller brands gaining ground through expert knowledge. You don’t need to compete with Amazon. You just need to own your niche and become the go-to for that specific need.

Can they survive these changes?

Artificial intelligence is transforming everything, irreversibly. And now, the brands that once relied on their online storefronts will have to adapt or disappear. The consumer no longer searches, they ask. And AI answers with surgical precision.

The DNA code is then translated into engineered microorganisms, enabling Colorifix to produce the pigment – just as it is made in nature – and transfer it to fabrics.
Colorifix natural dyes cut chemical pollution by 80%, and when applied to fabrics require far fewer rinses than synthetic dyes, ultimately saving vast quantities of water.
“This latest funding marks a critical milestone as we shift from proving our technology to delivering it at industrial scale,” said Orr Yarkoni, CEO of Colorifix.","Having just secured $18 million in new funding led by Inter IKEA and with further backing from H&M Group, Colorifix recently received a visit from Prince William and actress Cate Blanchett at its Norwich, UK headquarters.

The company was a finalist in the 2023 Earthshot Prize, narrowly missing out in claiming a £1 million award for its development of a unique fabric-dyeing process.

Prince William is the founder and Blanchett is on the leadership team of the Earthshot Prize – a ten-year initiative aiming to find solutions to some of the planet’s environmental problems.

During the pair’s visit on June 19th, Colorifix demonstrated how its process exploits the DNA codes of colours found in nature and teaches microbes to recreate them as natural dyes. The process is initiated by identifying a colour created naturally by an animal, plant or microbe and then using DNA sequencing to identify where the colour is coded in the genetics of the organism.

The DNA code is then translated into engineered microorganisms, enabling Colorifix to produce the pigment – just as it is made in nature – and transfer it to fabrics.

Colorifix natural dyes cut chemical pollution by 80%, and when applied to fabrics require far fewer rinses than synthetic dyes, ultimately saving vast quantities of water.

“I think it’s imperative that we reimagine fashion, not only how it’s made, but how we value and consume it,” Blanchett told Vogue magazine. “I think creativity can flourish within sustainable limits.”

Milestone

Since its last funding round in 2022, Colorifix has made significant progress in deploying its sustainable dyeing technology across the globe. The company now operates in Europe and Latin America, with licenses also granted for customer onboarding in India and Sri Lanka, underlining a transition from small-scale industrial deployments to large-volume commercial capacity. The main customer focus continues to be the fashion industry, with additional agreements in place for partnerships in the cosmetics and homewares segments.

“This latest funding marks a critical milestone as we shift from proving our technology to delivering it at industrial scale,” said Orr Yarkoni, CEO of Colorifix. “With Inter IKEA joining as lead investor and continued backing from H&M, we are uniquely positioned to accelerate adoption of our biology-based dyeing across global supply chains – eliminating the need for petrochemicals in dye production and drastically reducing water and electricity usage in the dyeing process itself.”

The new funding will support expansion of production capacity across Europe and Asia, deepening commercial engagements with textile manufacturers and brands, as well the further development of colours with proprietary microorganisms and bio-processes.",https://www.innovationintextiles.com/uploads/16496/Royal.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 14:07:52.367763

The milestone represents continued momentum toward India’s revised target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity, including hydro by 2030.

The report attributes this progress to a combination of policy support, advancements in clean energy technologies, and efforts to improve energy security and reduce import dependence. India’s renewable energy trajectory is positioned against the backdrop of rising power demand, global market volatility, and evolving trade and supply chain dynamics.

India’s clean energy ambitions have evolved—from a target of 175 GW by 2022 to 450 GW by 2030. With the earlier goal unmet, the government revised its 2030 target upward to 500 GW. S&P Global notes that while the target remains achievable, its base-case scenario projects a possible extension of the timeline to 2032, depending on implementation speed and systemic improvements.

“India is heavily reliant on coal for energy generation but is making significant progress in diversifying its mix,” said Eduard Sala de Vedruna, Head of Research, Energy Transition, Sustainability and Services at S&P Global. “Policy frameworks and investment in solar, wind, and hydro power are helping drive this transformation.”

The report also highlights the need for further investments in grid modernisation and energy storage to manage intermittency and enhance reliability.

According to Jenny Yang, Global Head of Power and Renewables Research at S&P Global, global electricity demand is expected to grow by over 80 per cent by 2050. In India, this rising demand is being met with an increasing share of renewables.

“Non-fossil fuel sources accounted for 47 per cent of India’s installed capacity and 24 per cent of generation in 2024,” Yang noted. “These shares are projected to rise to 77 per cent and 66 per cent, respectively by 2050.”

Globally, renewables and battery storage are expected to contribute 96 per cent of net capacity additions through 2050, though thermal generation is likely to remain important for grid stability in the near term.

The S&P Global report also examines oil market dynamics. Global crude prices and demand forecasts are being impacted by geopolitical developments, including tariff measures and regional conflicts. The report notes that OPEC+ production increases, coupled with weaker global GDP forecasts, may keep oil markets volatile.

“India is expected to lead oil demand growth globally, but this also heightens its dependency on imports,” said Premasish Das, Executive Director for Oil Markets Research at S&P Global. “A more diversified crude sourcing strategy will be necessary to manage future risks.”

Trade and logistics are also being reshaped by geopolitical factors. According to Rahul Kapoor, Vice President and Global Head of Shipping Research, traditional supply chains are being reconsidered in light of tariff policies, sanctions, and regional conflicts.

“India’s share of global trade is expected to increase as investment patterns shift towards emerging markets,” Kapoor said. “However, uncertainty in global policy may delay investments and impact capital flows.”",https://static.businessworld.in/1615290242_tjQFaG_Renewable_Energy_on_the_Grid.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 18:03:44.572941

Known for its iconic burgers, fries and Chicken McNuggets, the fast-food company has enjoyed global recognition. With outlets all over the world, McDonald's made its UK debut in Woolwich, south London back in 1974, and became a cherished location for family birthday celebrations, especially during one's childhood years.

Their PlayPlace attracted numerous families throughout the '80s and '90s. Previously known as a welcoming spot for a casual sit-down meal with family and friends, customers believe this has changed, with drive-thrus becoming more regularly used.

A user on Reddit shared their shock as they posted a photo inside a McDonald's restaurant with a sign that states: ""Please - no loitering. Time limit: 30 minutes while consuming food.""

The angry customer said: ""2nd McDonald's I've been to like this in less than a week... Only 5 tables in the restaurant, no self serve drink machine, no condiments out, not even [a] napkin dispenser... What happened to McDonald's being a family friendly restaurant for kids to play at like in the 90s?""

The user didn't specify which McDonald's restaurant they spotted this sign at but others in the comment section shared that they have seen similar ones.

McDonald's has confirmed that the '30 minute rule' is not a UK policy so the post is likely to be referring to US locations, the Mirror reports. Someone shared: ""Surprised to see people constantly posting this sign like it's new. It was up at my local McDonald's way back in early 2010s.""

Another user replied: ""That's what I was about to say, these signs have been around for a very long time.""

The sign with the '30 minute rule' seems to have angered some other customers in the comment section.

One remarked: ""Greed got in the way. They want the customers then don't want to serve them. Keep killing refills and making dining rooms uncomfortable and you won't have to worry about sitting down any more.

""The remodeled one by me used to be bustling, now there's no menu board, no cashier , no refills , cash kiosks, no TV and the most uncomfortable seating ever. No one eats inside any longer.""

A second user sarcastically commented: ""I respect that they don't want me inside there eating. I respect it so much that I just don't go there any more!""

A third chimed in: ""Rising costs and a changed culture fueled this change. It's not just McDonald's. There are no more real family friendly fast food restaurants left. It's all just get your food [and] get out now.""

However, some people understood why the restaurant might have put up this sign. A user guessed: ""That no loitering sign is probably just posted to allow staff to kick out people who stay there all day or something. I've loitered for 2 hours in a McDonalds that has that sign working on my laptop while sipping coffee and they didn't care.""

A former McDonald's employee added: ""Probably also a way to kick out teenagers who come in and buy 1 cheeseburger between 10 of them and then torment the workers. [It] was a huge issue back when I worked there.""

(NKE.US) is facing increased pressure to raise prices due to a new trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam, which has reportedly raised tariffs. According to Rick Patel, an analyst at Raymond James, the agreement will result in higher costs for Nike, which could lead to increased prices for consumers. Patel noted that the new tariffs will make it more expensive for Nike to manufacture its products in Vietnam, a key production hub for the company. This could force Nike to pass on some of these costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Patel stated that Nike has already implemented a strict pricing strategy and that this strategy is expected to continue, with the potential for price increases to exceed previous plans. The analyst also suggested that Nike may need to explore alternative production locations to mitigate the impact of the new tariffs. However, this could take time and may not be a viable option in the short term. Patel concluded that Nike will need to carefully manage its costs and pricing strategy in response to the new trade agreement.

The new trade agreement, announced by U.S. President Trump, will impose a 20% tariff on goods coming from Vietnam. This tariff rate is double the rate implemented by the U.S. in April (10%). During Trump's second term, the U.S. has imposed tariffs of approximately 8% on non-agricultural products from Vietnam. Patel noted that the increased tariffs will also lead to a greater-than-expected decline in the gross profit margins of Nike and other companies that source materials from Vietnam, including Under Armour (UAA.US), Skechers USA (SKX.US), On Running (ONON.US), Lululemon (LULU.US), and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS.US).

On Wednesday, when Trump discussed the agreement on social media, Nike's stock price rose by approximately 4%. Investors may be relieved that the tariff rate on Vietnam is only 20%.

“This agreement with Microsoft is the strongest endorsement of our quality-driven, farmer-focused approach to soil carbon sequestration,” says Elliot Formal, CEO of Agoro Carbon.","Microsoft, one of the world's largest corporate investors in carbon removal projects, has signed a fresh 12-year offtake agreement with Agoro Carbon for 2.6 million soil-based credits.

“Agoro Carbon’s approach to soil-based carbon removals reflects the kind of scientific rigor and long-term solution we look for in our carbon removal portfolio,” says Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy Markets at Microsoft.

“This agreement supports our broader sustainability goals at Microsoft, including support of scalable, agriculture-based climate solutions that deliver measurable impact over time.”

Down the years, sustainability agencies have played an important role in helping Microsoft build a world-leading portfolio of carbon credits.

""Microsoft is the biggest buyer of carbon removal credits but also puts in the most effort on quality,"" says Zara Ahmed, COO of Carbon Direct, a firm that works closely with Microsoft in this area.

""They hire us as their technical diligence partner for 3-4 month engagements with site visits and deep analysis to ensure projects will deliver climate impact.

""We should talk more about Microsoft's technical leadership, not just deal sizes.

""They're moving the market forward across nature-based and industrial carbon removal projects.""

How carbon removals work

What exactly is a carbon credit? Well, one carbon credit represents the extraction of one metric tonne of CO₂ from the atmosphere.

These credits are different from traditional carbon offsets, though. Carbon credit schemes tend to focus on the physical removal and storage of carbon, rather than compensating for emissions by planting trees or creating renewable energy.

This new collaboration between Microsoft and Agoro Carbon is, in theory, very simple. Agoro removes carbon from the atmosphere by changing the way soil is used in farming.

Healthy, well-tended soil is a natural carbon sink, meaning that farmers can contribute to global sustainability if they work their land in certain ways.

Carbon removal credits don't come without challenges, though. Concerns include the accuracy of carbon calculations, potential double-counting, and questions about the permanence of soil-carbon storage. In response, leading tech companies like Microsoft require stringent monitoring and verification protocols to validate the integrity and impact of the credits they acquire.

Combining technology and agriculture

Agoro Carbon, initiated by Yara International, collaborates with US farmers to sequester carbon through technologically advanced, verified credits.

This organization employs the Verra’s VM0042 methodology, known for its rigid criteria, to ensure accurate measurements of soil carbon content. Agoro Carbon’s initiatives provide both agronomic and financial support, facilitating the implementation of innovative farming techniques that offer multiple advantages beyond carbon sequestration, such as improved crop yields and resilience.

Agoro Carbon commits to transparency and data integrity by utilizing advanced modelling and rigorous validation processes, ensuring the quality and sustainability of the credits.

“This agreement with Microsoft is the strongest endorsement of our quality-driven, farmer-focused approach to soil carbon sequestration,” says Elliot Formal, CEO of Agoro Carbon.

Quinn joins from medtech peer Becton Dickinson (BD), where she was also GC. She will take on responsibility for all legal matters at Medtronic.

Medtronic is an American-Irish medtech business, with its operational headquarters based in Minneapolis. The company makes a range of medical devices, including advanced surgical tech, cardiac rhythm equipment and diabetes, neurological and respiratory products, among others.

Quinn arrives after six-and-a-half years at BD, having become GC in April 2023. She originally joined as chief compliance officer, before becoming deputy GC in February 2022. Prior to that, Quinn spent four years at Novartis’s now spun-out generics unit Sandoz, where latterly she was GC for its North America business.

She also had stints at Catalent Pharma Solutions as associate GC and IP and regulatory counsel for North America at legacy French food business Groupe Soparind Bongrain (now Group Savencia). She started her legal career in private practice at Morgan Lewis & Bockius as a litigation associate.

On her appointment as GC at BD in 2023, the company’s CEO Tom Pollen said: “Michelle’s experience leading legal functions in a variety of healthcare companies has and will continue to benefit BD, our associates, the patients we serve and our shareholders through her focus on advancing the company’s business strategies and governance initiatives.”

Fong, meanwhile, will retire on 21 July after three-and-a-half years at the helm of Medtronic’s legal team, having joined from 3M where he spent close to a decade as GC and later chief legal and policy officer.

He also had spells as GC at the US Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration, CLO at Cardinal Health and GC at GE Vendor Financial Services, having also been a senior counsel in GE’s e-commerce and IT division.

The world's largest vehicle carrier ship powered by photovoltaic (PV) energy, the ""Yuanhai Kou"" vessel from China COSCO Shipping Corporation, successfully completed its maiden voyage, docking at the car carrier terminal of Piraeus Port in Greece with 4,000 domestically produced Chinese vehicles on board, Science and Technology Daily reported on Friday.

The vessel is equipped with a shipborne PV system with a peak power of 302.8 kilowatts, the largest of its kind for similar vessels. It generates 410,000 kWh of electricity annually, with a lifecycle carbon intensity approximately 35 percent lower than that of traditional ships, according to the report.

The ""Yuanhai Kou"" measures 199.9 meters in total length, with a gross tonnage of 68,252 tons and a displacement of 39,069 tons. It features 12 vehicle decks, including eight fixed decks and four movable decks, with a loading capacity of 7,000 standard car parking spaces. It can carry all types of vehicles such as passenger cars, engineering vehicles, and buses.

The vessel is powered by a dual-fuel main engine using liquefied natural gas (LNG) and fuel oil, achieving 20 percent energy savings and over 24 percent carbon reduction compared to traditional fuel-powered ships. For a typical round-trip voyage from China to Europe, it can reduce carbon emissions by 2,100 tons per trip, the report said.

Oksana Hutsait, ICTV presenter, welcomed the participants at the opening of the summit: ""Today, HR is the first voice in the enterprise. You are the voice of change.""

Natalia Teryakhina from Kernel shared her experience on how knowledge management helps retain staff, as HR needs to proactively work with the business, identifying critical roles and retaining the team through training.

Daria Marchak, First Deputy Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine, called for an urgent review of HR strategies with an emphasis on inclusivity and the involvement of workers aged 50+, because the country cannot afford ageism.

Maria Abdullina from ""OLX Robota"" spoke about labor market trends in real time: ""Most employers face a crisis due to mobilization, migration, and a shortage of personnel. And their response is to focus on youth, partner with education, and involve pensioners.""

The first panel discussion on personnel strategies during the war was moderated by Ihor Kabuzenko (Ward Howell Ukraine). Participants included Yulia Titarenko (Pivdennyi Bank), Liliia Dubas (Teva in Ukraine), Polina Karelina (Nestlé in Ukraine), Vusal Talybov (Foundation Coffee Roasters), and Ivan Afonin (PrivatBank). They discussed the integration of youth, veterans, and candidates aged 50+, and the development of internal talents as key factors in successful team management.

Kateryna Tsybur (NOVUS) is confident that in 2025, the most profitable investment is people: by creating an environment of trust, the company guarantees that an employee will want to return or recommend the company to others.

Inna Pecherytsia(EVA) spoke about corporate culture as a compass for transformations, where values are a daily focus on one's people, a sense of support in a crisis, a space for internal dialogue, networking, and sincerity.

The discussion ""Work after service: how to make the labor market veteran-friendly"" discussed real cases of adaptation, mentorship, and systemic support for veterans and their families. The moderator was Natalia Yemchenko (SCM, ""Heart of Azovstal"" project). Participants included Anastasia Rozlutska (Work.ua), Olena Velyka (Sense Bank), Vadym Halytskyi (DTEK), Liudmyla Novak (Interpipe), Aliona Skorzova (State Employment Service), and Kyrylo Tiurniev (defender of Mariupol).

Natalia Volnianska (Starlight Media) shared how wartime HRDs maneuver, preserving teams, thanks to timely basic support, balanced communication, and the ability to dream despite everything.

During the discussion ""Interaction of education and business"" moderated by Anna Mishchenko (KSDU) with the participation of Oleh Davydenko (Metinvest Group), Olena Dmyterko (Kormotech), Liudmyla Andreeva (""Philip Morris Ukraine""), Kateryna Zaloznykh (""ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih""), Olha Nahorniuk (Ajax), and Anatolii Melnychenko (Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute).

The key role of investments in educational trajectories, dual education, and strategic business cooperation with universities in adapting education to market needs was emphasized.

Svitlana Mozhova (""Astarta-Kyiv"") inspired the participants with a speech about active longevity as a business growth strategy, changing attitudes towards age, and breaking stereotypes, which are strategic investments in human resources.

Viktor Marchenko (Raiffeisen Bank) presented a systematic approach to data-driven HR, emphasizing that without the use of analytics and IT solutions, HR activities turn into a cacophony.

Olena Kovika (Kyivstar) shared that codes of conduct are the foundation of trust, because ethics — through the example of the leader, constant communication, and recognition of everyone's contribution — supports the team in turbulent times.

Tymofiy Bryk (KSE) presented the results of the ""Top Investors in Education"" study by Delo.ua and KSE, emphasizing that due to a lack of relevant skills, vacancies and candidates do not meet, and business, by investing in education, solves personnel issues and fulfills a social role in integrating inclusion.

The discussion on corporate education, moderated by Tetiana Sherman (DTEK Academy), gathered Mariana Kosharnovska (AB InBev Efes Ukraine), Ilona Pasechnyk (Alviva Group), Tetiana Kononenko (""Brocard-Ukraine""), Olha Lukianenko (Nova Poshta), Ivan Kompan (Deloitte Academy), and Anastasia Kuzmenko (1+1 media school).

They proved that corporate education is a strategic investment in the company's sustainability and development through mentorship and partnerships, where efficiency is measured by capital multiplication and career growth.

The employer brand, the importance of involving youth and women, honesty and care in brand formation, and a unified HR strategy with communications, moderated by Roman Bondar (Korn Ferry Ukraine), were discussed by Natalia Boiko (Naftogaz Group), Olena Semych (DTEK Academy), Yevheniia Kuzminska (OKKO), Serhii Lukanin (Naftogaz Group), and Anastasia Hromova (MHP).

ID13,CVS Health,2025-07-04 13:26:55+00:00,95.5 WSB,Rural hospitals brace for financial hits or even closure under Republicans' $1 trillion Medicaid cut,MARGERY A. BECK and SUSAN HAIGH,,,,,https://www.wsbradio.com/news/health/rural-hospitals/OAW4O4J5MFHO3OEXFC2ZKNMRVU/,"More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.
President Donald Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers.
But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total.
Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.
“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,"" Cochran-McClain said.","OMAHA, Neb. — (AP) — Tyler Sherman, a nurse at a rural Nebraska hospital, is used to the area's aging farmers delaying care until they end up in his emergency room.

Now, with Congress planning around $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, he fears those farmers and the more than 3,000 residents of Webster County could lose not just the ER, but also the clinic and nursing home tied to the hospital.

“Our budget is pretty heavily reliant on the Medicaid reimbursement, so if we do see a cut of that, it’ll be difficult to keep the doors open,” said Sherman, who works at Webster County Community Hospital in the small Nebraska town of Red Cloud just north of the Kansas border.

If those facilities close, many locals would see their five-minute trip to Webster County hospital turn into a nearly hour-long ride to the nearest hospital offering the same services.

“That's a long way for an emergency,” Sherman said. “Some won't make it.”

States and rural health advocacy groups warn that cutting Medicaid — a program serving millions of low-income and disabled Americans — would hit already fragile rural hospitals hard and could force hundreds to close, stranding some people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.

More than 300 hospitals could be at risk for closure under the Republican bill, according to an analysis by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which tracks rural hospital closures. Even as Congress haggled over the controversial bill, a health clinic in the southwest Nebraska town of Curtis announced Wednesday it will close in the coming months, in part blaming the anticipated Medicaid cuts.

Bruce Shay, of Pomfret, Connecticut, fears he and his wife could be among those left in the lurch. At 70, they're both in good health, he said. But that likely means that if either needs to go to a hospital, “it's going to be an emergency.”

Day Kimball Hospital is nearby in Putnam, but it has faced recent financial challenges. Day Kimball's CEO R. Kyle Kramer acknowledged that a Senate bill passed Tuesday — estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years — would further hurt his rural hospital's bottom line. Roughly 30% of Day Kimball's current patients receive Medicaid benefits, a figure that's even higher for specific, critical services like obstetrics and behavioral health.

“An emergency means I’m 45 minutes to an hour away from the nearest hospital, and that’s a problem,"" Shay said. And he and his wife wouldn't be the only ones having to make that trip.

“You’ve got, I’m sure, thousands of people who rely on Day Kimball Hospital. If it closed, thousands of people would have to go to another hospital,” he said. “That’s a huge load to suddenly impose on a hospital system that’s probably already stretched thin.”

Rural hospitals have long operated on the financial edge, especially in recent years as Medicaid payments have continuously fallen below the actual cost to provide health care. More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.

President Donald Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers. To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs — cuts they insist only root out fraud and waste in the system.

But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total. Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.

Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals already struggle to break even, citing a recent American Hospital Association report that found that hospitals in 2023 got nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.

“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,"" Cochran-McClain said. ""Meaning that any amount of cut to a payer — especially a payer like Medicaid that makes up a significant portion of rural provider funding — is going to be consequential to the rural hospitals' ability to provide certain services or maybe even keep their doors open at the end of the day.”

A KFF report shows 36 states losing $1 billion or more over 10 years in Medicaid funding for rural areas under the Republican bill, even with the $50 billion rural fund. No state stands to lose more than Kentucky.

The report estimates the Bluegrass State would lose a whopping $12.3 billion — nearly $5 billion more than the next state on the list. That's because the bill ends Kentucky's unique Medicaid reimbursement system and reduces it to Medicare reimbursement levels.

Kentucky currently has one of the lowest Medicare reimbursement rates in the country. It also has one of the highest poverty rates, leading to a third of its population being covered by Medicaid.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat widely seen as a potential candidate for president in 2028, said the bill would close 35 hospitals in his state and pull health care coverage for 200,000 residents.

“Half of Kentucky’s kids are covered under Medicaid. They lose their coverage and you are scrambling over that next prescription,” Beshear said during an appearance on MSNBC. “This is going to impact the life of every single American negatively. It is going to hammer our economy.""

For Japen, the rise of AI has distracted some businesses from the urgency that some of these regulations are demanding.

It's beholden on companies like SAP, Capgemini and Microsoft to make that happen.
The collective narrative from Capgemini, Microsoft, and SAP is clear: tech is going to to help them achieve sustainability.","With climate action deadlines drawing closer, companies — particularly the world's largest companies — are in a rush. With just five years until companies will be assessed against the short-term targets they have set, and 25 years until the net zero deadline, the pressure is well and truly on for companies to make meaningful progress on decarbonisation.

Capgemini, Microsoft and SAP are three companies that are trying to move the dial when it comes to sustainability, not just for their own benefits but for those of other businesses too.

Executives from each of the companies recently featured on a podcast produced by Capgemini where they discussed the role technology will play in the global pursuit of sustainability.

Regulations are creating urgency

The podcast in question brought together Miguel Sossa, VP of Sustainability for the Americas at Capgemini, Sean Jones, CSO at Microsoft, and Japen Hollist, Head of Sustainability at SAP, to share their insights, experiences and expectations for sustainability in the coming years.

The evolution of the regulatory environment, particularly within the EU through initiatives like the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), is proving to be a driving force for technological solutions.

Increasingly, businesses are turning to digital tools to help them become more compliant. For Japen, the rise of AI has distracted some businesses from the urgency that some of these regulations are demanding.

""People focus on AI for business efficiencies and put their resources there,"" he explains. ""Then they fail to remember we've got ESRS regulations that are barrelling down on us.""

With SAP’s almost ubiquitous role in the world economy, technology is seen not just as a compliance tool but as a means of realising business efficiency.

Data-driven decision making

Traditionally, reporting on corporate sustainability has been a laborious task that requires months of data collection and analysis. This has been a problem for years, summed up best in a concept known as the 'Pareto principle', which says that 80% of an analyst's time is comprised of data collection and organisation, while just 20% of time is actually dedicated to doing anything productive with that data.

In 2025, AI is helping businesses to save a lot of time so they can focus on more on action.

""Several years ago, it was challenging enough to bring data to the table once a year,"" Miguel explains. ""But if we're driving a vehicle, we need that data now. We can't wait for a year to decide whether to turn left or right.""

With such urgency, immediacy is king. For Miguel, board-level decision making will undoubtedly be improved when it is supported by cutting edge technology.

It's a view — and a strategy — that is shared across SAP, Capgemini and Microsoft, for whom AI is set to play a huge role in the coming years.

Each firm is using AI to handle its vast datasets

""You've got to be in the cloud to uptake innovation at speed and scale,"" says Japen. ""The world is going to move much faster if you can harness AI all around it.""

Likewise, Microsoft's sustainability strategy has been totally reconsidered since it began investing huge sums in the development of AI.

""We created applications for calculating carbon, water and waste,"" explains Sean. ""The biggest topics now are about scaling and moving from reporting compliance to operations improvement.""

The relationship between sustainability and innovation

There is a future where sustainability is a central part of every business decision. It's beholden on companies like SAP, Capgemini and Microsoft to make that happen.

Miguel believes that companies like his are going to have to be very introspective throughout the energy transition.

""Companies are going to look from within and say, are we ourselves really sustainable? In product development, they're going to take a look at all their product lines and say, how do we take waste and cost out of this?""

In May 2025, US steelmakers shipped 7.51 million net tons of steel, up 1% from the same period in 2024, when the volume was 7.43 million tons. Compared to April, shipments decreased by 1%. This was reported by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI).

Despite the overall growth, the dynamics of shipments of certain types of products show mixed changes. For example, shipments of cold-rolled steel increased by 1% y-o-y, while shipments of corrosion-resistant steel decreased by 1% y-o-y. The largest decline was recorded in the hot-rolled steel segment, at 2% y-o-y.

Analysts note that the overall market remains stable, but the slowdown in some segments may be related to lower demand in the automotive and construction industries, as well as the impact of import barriers and fluctuations in raw material prices.

In the coming months, shipment dynamics will depend on the state of domestic demand, activity in infrastructure projects, and potential changes in US trade policy.",https://gmk.center/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shutterstock_194013773.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 10:02:25.622328

The first tranche of images, unveiled on 2 July, forms part of a broader experiment the Swedish group says will run into the autumn.

“We’re exploring emerging technologies like generative AI to amplify creativity and re‑imagine how we showcase fashion… while staying true to H&M’s style‑led, human‑centric identity,” said Jörgen Andersson, the retailer’s chief creative officer.

Generative imagery promises a potent mix of speed and cost efficiency. Zalando, Europe’s largest online‑only fashion platform, claims AI has already cut its campaign lead times from up to eight weeks to as little as four days and reduced costs by 90 per cent, according to Reuters. Analysts say the prize for incumbents is the ability to refresh product pages and social media feeds at a cadence set by TikTok trends rather than studio availability.

Yet the technology is rearranging the creative pecking order. “I am super‑excited to explore AI alongside my own photography — it’s an interesting tool to add to our creative toolbox,” said Johnny Kangasniemi, whose lens work now sits next to his prompt engineering on H&M’s credits. Some ndustry observers argue the photographer’s role is shifting from shutter‑operator to art‑director‑in‑chief, curating datasets and correcting machine hallucinations rather than adjusting lighting rigs.

Such shifts come with reputational risk. Almost 90 per cent of consumers want brands to disclose when an image has been AI‑generated, according to recent Getty Images research. H&M says its digital models are clearly tagged, and that the real‑world talent retains ownership and a revenue share, a stance welcomed by model Vanessa Moody, who called the arrangement “professional, collaborative and transparent”.

Still, skeptics warn that deepfake tools are maturing faster than corporate governance. Legal advisers point to unresolved questions around likeness rights, data provenance and the potential erosion of diversity if brands default to algorithmically “perfected” bodies, noted The Fashion Law.

For now, H&M is betting that novelty outweighs unease.

Oscar Mayer recalls turkey bacon products due to listeria concerns

Amber Raiken

Thursday 03 July 2025 21:03 EDT

Kraft Heinz Foods Company has recalled 367,812 pounds of its Oscar Mayer fully cooked turkey bacon products.

The recall was announced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

Three specific Oscar Mayer Turkey bacon products, with various package sizes and use-by dates, are affected by the recall.

There have been no reported illnesses linked to the recalled turkey bacon to date.

Consumers are advised to either discard the affected products or return them to the place of purchase for a refund.

With the Paris Agreement’s 2050 net zero goal and fast evolving regulations, enterprises must prioritise sustainability and integrate AI strategies to act effectively.

Major corporations, like Capgemini, Microsoft and SAP, are confronted with challenges owing to their expansive operations and supply chains.

However, AI presents them with an opportunity to substantially enhance sustainability outcomes.

These industry giants not only aim to optimise their own environmental impacts but also extend support to others in the sustainability journey.

Japen says: ""People focus on AI for business efficiencies and put their resources there. Then they fail to remember we've got ESRS regulations that are barreling down on us.""

He notes a change in the dialogue around sustainability, indicating a move toward terms resonating with business efficiency and advancement.

AI-enhanced real-time decision making

The traditional methodology of annual sustainability reporting is being replaced as it no longer aligns with the immediate demands of AI-enabled business operations.

Miguel says: ""Several years ago, it was challenging enough to bring data to the table once a year. But if we're driving a vehicle, we need that data now. We can't wait for a year to decide whether to turn left or right.""

With a goal to assist clients in reducing their carbon footprint by 10 billion tonnes by 2030, Capgemini employs technology for expedited decision-making.

Miguel elucidates the role of technology, stating that it enables rapid processing of data, which previously took prolonged periods to act upon.

AI integration in sustainability initiatives

AI is a central element in the sustainability strategies of Capgemini, Microsoft and SAP.

AI facilitates data processing and swift decision-making. Japen says: ""You've got to be in the cloud to uptake innovation at speed and scale. The world is going to move much faster if you can harness AI all around it.""

Microsoft incorporates AI to augment operational efficacies.

Sean articulates the company's tactics: ""We created applications for calculating carbon, water, and waste. The biggest topics now are about scaling and moving from reporting compliance to operations improvement.""

The vision for sustainable operations

The leaders anticipate a scenario where sustainability pervades every core business decision, fostering a holistic transformation.

This change stretches beyond mere environmental metrics, encompassing broader social and economic aspects.

Miguel expounds: ""Companies are going to look from within and say, are we ourselves really sustainable? In product development, they're going to take a look at all their product lines and say, how do we take waste and cost out of this?

""There is no business on this planet that says we do not want to reduce costs, be competitive, or attract great talent.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/2d6a5a86e26489e326cc937056b70735:7e8b888fb22ebe12f03733350053f71a/testimage.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 12:12:50.146859

The company also named Artem Lavrinovich, an in-store retail media veteran, as its new chief data and AI officer to help accelerate its AI tools and capabilities.

Australia-based QSIC is a global in-store audio platform that uses AI audio and data intelligence to help retailers and brands unlock the value of the in-store experience. It has a key North America office in Dallas.

QSIC co-founder and CEO Matt Elsley said retail media is still outperforming — and that in-store is the next big growth opportunity for the channel.

He said the company plans to expand into new markets and roll out new technology, adding that leaders like David and Artem bring the know-how to help QSIC scale with people who’ve built retail media businesses before.

“Their experience will be essential as we push the boundaries of what in-store technology can do and accelerate innovation to deliver even better results for our partners,” Elsley said.

QSIC said it is on track for a record year following a successful $25 million funding raise earlier this year.

The company is on track to power Gulp Radio, 7-Eleven’s commercial radio network that spans across the United States, in 12,000 stores by the end of the year.

Over the past year, QSIC said it grew its team with several key leaders, won numerous innovation awards, and expanded its partnership with Irving-based 7-Eleven.

‘The next frontier of retail media’

Haase brings more than 25 years of experience in scaling high-growth businesses and driving retail digital transformation to his new role. He has held senior leadership roles at Triad Retail Media and The Mars Agency, among others.

Most recently, Haase served as CEO of the Americas at CitrusAd (now, Epsilon Retail Media), where he played a key role in the company’s acquisition by Publicis Groupe’s Epsilon.

“In-store is the next frontier of retail media, and QSIC is one of the few companies getting it right,” Haase said in a statement. “They’ve built real momentum, and I’m excited to join the team at a critical time to help take that to the next level.”

Global data and AI strategy

QSIC said that Lavrinovich comes to the company from CoolerX, and its spin-off venture RPM Labs, where he helped develop advanced retail media capabilities.

He also held a customer service and data science role at Amazon, where he led strategy, innovation and execution across multiple customer engagement and demand levers. At dunnhumby, the world’s first customer data science platform, Lavrinovich was responsible for advancing pricing, promotions, assortment and marketing strategies for top retailers including Kroger, Best Buy, and Macy’s, QSIC said.

As the company’s first chief data and AI officer, Lavrinovich will oversee QSIC’s global data and AI strategy, directing efforts to deliver intelligent, personalized, and automated experiences backed by measurable results.

Lavrinovich said QSIC is working to solve two major pain points for in-store retail media — measurability and friction — while using audio to improve the shopper experience.

He called audio “a largely untapped” channel with huge potential in stores, especially when paired with AI to help retailers create more engaging and personalized interactions.

“The opportunity to join a team at the forefront of innovation drew me here, and we’re just getting started with what’s possible,” Lavrinovich said.

Focus on global growth

QSIC said that as part of its global expansion strategy, Lachlan Gow, the current president overseeing operations in North America, will transition to lead its growth across EMEA. During his time in the U.S., Gow played a key role in securing major partnerships that helped establish QSIC as a leading player in the market.

QSIC’s clients include global retailers in fuel and convenience, grocery, liquor, hospitality, fashion, and specialty retail.

A new European Union plan to exempt its heavy industry from carbon taxes could have ramifications for Canada, given that heavy industry is one of the only corners of the Canadian economy where carbon taxes will continue to apply.

Article content

Article content

According to reporting in the Financial Times, the European Commission is reviewing a measure that would exempt industrial sectors such as concrete and steelmakers from having to pay carbon taxes on exported products.

Article content

The idea is to avoid kneecapping European exporters competing with the likes of China and India, whose own heavy industry face no such taxes.

Article content

As the EU’s climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told the Financial Times, carbon pricing could not come “at the expense of our own companies (as they) face unfair competition on the global market.”

Article content

Such an exemption would effectively be the inverse of what Canada has been doing on carbon pricing.

Article content

Unlike much of Europe, Canadians are no longer required to pay a consumer carbon tax. The first action of Prime Minister Mark Carney upon his March 14 swearing-in was to cease collection of federally mandated “retail” carbon taxes on motor fuels and heating oil.

Article content

However, the Carney government has stayed the course on a latticework of industrial carbon taxes targeting “big polluters” in sectors such as steel, concrete and oil and gas.

Although industrial carbon taxes haven’t generated nearly the same amount of public ire as retail carbon pricing, Canadian exporters have argued that it puts them at a disadvantage in a world market filled with competitors who aren’t subject to carbon levies.

In March, the group Canadian Exporters & Manufacturers issued an appeal calling for the federal government to ensure that its industrial carbon taxes were not serving to “inadvertently weaken Canada’s manufacturing base or drive investment and production to jurisdictions with less stringent environmental standards.”

Article content

Around the same time, a letter signed by most of the major players in the Canadian oil and gas industry similarly called for the abolition of the industrial carbon tax, calling it a hindrance to Canada’s “only form of economic hard power.”",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2218850213.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 10:02:30.211730

Out of these, UPS stated that only full-time drivers were eligible for a buyout.
However, it was not informed how many full-time drivers are currently employed by UPS.
UPS had in 2023 offered buyouts to its pilots as it looked forward to reducing costs and head count.
Notably, drivers associated with UPS are considered among the highest-paid drivers in the United States.","The company is focusing on cost savings due to stagnant parcel volumes and rising labor costs, as well as a steep decline in its stock price, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Why does this matter?

As many as 330,000 full and part-time employees, including delivery drivers, clerks and package handlers, are associated with UPS. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents these people. Out of these, UPS stated that only full-time drivers were eligible for a buyout.

However, it was not informed how many full-time drivers are currently employed by UPS.

Based in Atlanta, UPS had in April this year announced its network reconfiguration plan after witnessing a decline in deliveries, especially for its key customer, Amazon.com. This happened amid the massive tariffs announced by Donald Trump.

In a statement, the company said that its buyout package is in addition to any retirement benefits like the pension and healthcare.

UPS had in 2023 offered buyouts to its pilots as it looked forward to reducing costs and head count. At that time, roughly 200 pilots accepted the offer.

A spokesperson for the company said the decision to offer buyouts to the drivers was taken as it navigates an “unprecedented business landscape,” besides reorganizing its network, per the outlet.

Notably, drivers associated with UPS are considered among the highest-paid drivers in the United States. On an average, a full-time driver will earn nearly $170,000 on an annual basis, including several benefits, by the end of the five-year contract which the company signed with Teamsters in 2023.

As per The Wall Street Journal report, several investors were of the view that it conceded too much ground to the union.

Since July 24, 2023, the shares of UPS have fallen by nearly 45 per cent. A day before this, the company reached an agreement with the union.

In the first quarter of this year, UPS had already registered a 3.5 per cent decline in its average daily package volume, reports said.

Further, the company said it will be delivering fewer packages for its largest customer (Amazon.com) since they were not making enough profit.

UPS informed in April that it will cut 20,000 operational jobs in 2025.

FAQs:

1. Why is UPS cutting costs?

This is being done due to less parcel volumes, steep rise in labor costs and decline in stock price.

2. Who owns United Parcel Service?

The publicly traded company is owned by multiple shareholders.

The three-year strategic collaboration, announced at the 2025 Paris Air Show, will focus on gathering emissions data from Thales’ extensive network of suppliers and refining the company’s carbon footprint assessments.

To support this effort, Thales Procurement will implement Sweep’s advanced sustainability data management platform, enabling more accurate and comprehensive tracking of environmental impact. Capgemini Invent will facilitate the integration of this technology and work closely with Thales to monitor and manage emissions reduction plans, particularly with suppliers identified as the largest emitters.

This structured, data-driven approach aims to deliver measurable progress in decarbonising Thales’ global supply chain.

Thales says: “This partnership reflects Thales’ strong commitment to a more sustainable aerospace industry with a clear ambition: reduce Scope 3 emissions by 15% by 2030 (SBTi-validated target)”

The power of partnership

The alliance between Capgemini, Thales and Sweep brings together complementary expertise in digital transformation, advanced technology and emissions data management.

Capgemini, a global leader in consulting and technology services, will leverage its experience in sustainability strategy and digital solutions.

Thales, renowned for its aerospace, defense and security innovations, contributes its operational and supply chain know-how.

Sweep, a fast-growing climate tech company, provides a robust platform for tracking, analysing and reducing carbon emissions across value chains.

“Strong sustainability management is a fundamental lever for growth and value-creation,” says Sweep’s CEO and Co-Founder Rachel Delacour.

“By accelerating its existing work to cut the carbon footprint of its global value chain, Thales is showing leadership within the aerospace industry and beyond. Sustainability must be aligned with business strategy, and true impact demands collaboration across the entire value chain.

“We at Sweep are looking forward to working with Thales and Capgemini to achieve this goal.”

By pooling resources and knowledge, the partners aim to help organisations build comprehensive emissions baselines, set science-based targets and foster collaboration with suppliers.

This integrated approach is designed to make supply chain decarbonisation more actionable and transparent, supporting clients in meeting regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations.

The challenge of reducing supply chain emissions

Decarbonising global supply chains remains one of the most formidable hurdles in corporate climate action.

For most companies, the majority of emissions—often more than 70%—are classified as Scope 3, originating from suppliers, logistics and product end-of-life processes.

These emissions are difficult to measure and control, as they are distributed across hundreds or thousands of suppliers in diverse geographies and industries.

Key challenges include:

Data transparency: many organisations struggle to obtain accurate, granular emissions data from suppliers, especially beyond their immediate (tier 1) partners.

Supplier engagement: fragmented supplier landscapes and varying levels of climate maturity make it hard to set unified standards and drive collective action.

Internal alignment: conflicting priorities between sustainability and procurement teams can hinder progress, particularly when cost pressures compete with environmental goals.

Regulatory complexity: evolving regulations and reporting standards add further complexity, requiring companies to adapt quickly and ensure compliance.

Despite these obstacles, research shows that decarbonising supply chains can have a far greater climate impact than focusing on direct operations alone, with some sectors able to reduce emissions by up to 40% using existing technologies and practices.

Capgemini’s sustainability strategy

Capgemini has established itself as a leader in corporate sustainability, both through its internal operations and its client-facing services.

The company is committed to achieving net zero by 2040, with a verified science-based target of a 90% reduction in carbon emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3. Its strategy is built on four pillars:

Empowering People: Embedding sustainability into business culture and governance, and making carbon a key performance metric.

Transforming Mobility: Minimising business travel emissions and prioritizing low-carbon options.

Sustainable Operations: Transitioning to 100% renewable energy, optimizing resource use, and improving IT infrastructure efficiency.

Client Solutions: Providing services and digital tools to help clients address their own sustainability challenges.

Capgemini’s UK operations have already achieved a 50% reduction in absolute emissions since 2019, with a car fleet that is 94% electric or hybrid and more than one million trees planted as part of its reforestation initiatives.

Thales’ sustainability strategy

Thales has integrated sustainability into its core business strategy, focusing on reducing its environmental footprint and innovating for a low-carbon future. The company’s approach includes:

Setting science-based targets: thales aims to align its emissions reductions with the paris agreement, targeting significant cuts in both direct (scope 1 & 2) and indirect (scope 3) emissions.

Operational efficiency: investments in renewable energy, energy-efficient manufacturing, and sustainable product design.

Supplier collaboration: engaging with suppliers to improve emissions transparency and encourage adoption of greener practices.

Circular economy initiatives: developing solutions for recycling and end-of-life management of products, particularly in electronics and aerospace sectors.

Thales recognises that industry-wide transformation requires collaboration and is committed to working with partners and customers to drive systemic change.

Sweep’s sustainability strategy

Sweep’s platform is designed to empower organisations to manage and reduce their carbon footprint across complex supply chains.

Its core strategy includes:

Data-driven insights: providing tools for comprehensive emissions tracking, from direct operations to deep-tier suppliers.

target setting and progress monitoring: enabling companies to set science-based targets and transparently report progress.

supplier engagement: facilitating collaboration and data sharing across the value chain to identify hotspots and co-create abatement strategies.

regulatory compliance: helping clients navigate evolving disclosure requirements and align with global standards.

Sweep’s technology-centric approach aims to break down barriers to supply chain decarbonisation, making it easier for companies to take meaningful climate action.

As the partnership between Capgemini, Thales, and Sweep demonstrates, collaboration, innovation and digital tools are essential to overcoming the challenges of supply chain emissions. By working together, these leaders are paving the way for a more sustainable and resilient global economy.

No matter how much you might claim to want to avoid it, there’s no denying the fast-food chain is a staple on the British high street, a go-to at service stations across the UK and well, just the trusty spot for a treat for tea.

I mean, remember McDonald’s birthday parties? Perhaps some of you younger lot won’t have a clue what I’m on about but those things were an absolute banger to get an invite for.

Maccies is a bit of a family favourite really, with plenty of us growing up begging our parents to take us for a happy meal on the way home.

But the sign said to be spotted in a restaurant have been slammed as not a particularly ‘family friendly’ rule on Reddit.

It’s not quite clear where in the world this was spotted, but it has been confirmed to LADbible that this is not a UK policy and it’s likely to be from the US.

Others in the comments shared that they’ve seen similar, as some agree with it being in place.

Essentially, the sign prohibits people from spending an extended amount of time inside the restaurant.

“Please – no loitering,” it reads. “Time limit: 30 minutes while consuming food. The manager must enforce this rule, your cooperation is appreciated.”

The user who shared the post this week said it was the second McDonald’s like this that they’d visited in less than a week as they explained: “Only five tables in the restaurant, no self serve drink machine, no condiments out, not even [a] napkin dispenser…

“What happened to McDonald’s being a family friendly restaurant for kids to play at like in the 90s?”

But some users suggested that perhaps the rule helps to make things family friendly, as one wrote: “Here is the answer. Just don’t be a problem and just use the dining room to eat.

“There are probably groups of teenage kids who cause issues and are there for too long. They want the dining room to be … family friendly.”

Many suggested it’s to give staff ‘a way to remove the people actually harassing guests’ as others say it’s ‘to remove the homeless and teens’.

One also wrote: “It's so they can get rid of the people who order a small coke, ask for infinity refills and plant themselves in one spot for hours while using the free Wi-Fi and a/c.”

Others pointed out that ‘these signs have been around for a very long time’.

The Steel Work­ers’ Union (SWUTT) is call­ing on the Gov­ern­ment to in­ter­vene in the drawn-out liq­ui­da­tion of the Arcelor­Mit­tal steel plant at Point Lisas, as the process is stalling pay­ment of mil­lions in sev­er­ance to for­mer em­ploy­ees.

Speak­ing to re­porters af­ter the meet­ing, SWUTT Pres­i­dent Tim­o­thy Bai­ley ap­pealed to the Unit­ed Na­tion­al Con­gress-led Gov­ern­ment, urg­ing it to rec­ti­fy the in­ac­tion of its pre­de­ces­sor.

Each of these measures supports the company’s ambition to cut supply chain emissions by 30% per tonne of product by 2030.
By 2030, Cargill commits to eliminating deforestation from both its direct and indirect cocoa supply chains.
It uses farmer mapping and bean traceability to keep its sourcing transparent, and to ensure its cocoa isn’t contributing to forest loss.
Every move in this reimagined supply chain – from solar-powered warehousing to rethinking waste – points to a system built for long-term environmental impact.","Cargill is making its cocoa supply chain more sustainable, with a full-scale effort stretching from farms in Côte d’Ivoire to warehouses in Amsterdam.

The company is shifting how it sources, processes and delivers cocoa in order to lower its environmental impact, reduce waste and move closer to its 2030 emissions targets.

This isn’t a marketing exercise – it’s about designing a system that serves farmers, customers and the planet without compromise.

Energy from shells and sun

The process starts at origin. In West Africa, where Cargill partners with cocoa farmers, waste once destined for disposal is now a valuable resource.

Cocoa shells, previously thrown away, are burned in biomass boilers, generating energy on site.

In Tema, Ghana, solar power is driving production facilities, replacing fossil fuels and providing consistent, clean energy for processing.

Packaging is another target. Instead of relying on single-use containers for shipping cocoa butter, Cargill now uses ISO tanks – large, reusable industrial containers. That change alone cuts an estimated 100 tonnes of waste every month.

For Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa & Chocolate Europe and West Africa, it’s not just about individual improvements but their combined impact: “Sustainability isn’t a single project at Cargill—it’s how we operate. From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we’re showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.”

Electric barges and solar-powered storage

Once cocoa reaches Europe, the low-emissions approach continues. In the Netherlands, cocoa beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses just outside Amsterdam.

From there, electric barges move them up the river to Zaandam, where they’re processed – completely cutting diesel from this leg of the journey. The result is a saving of 190,000kg of CO₂ each year.

Cargill is also reusing shells in its Amsterdam facilities, feeding them into local biomass boilers. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions by almost 19,000 tonnes annually—evidence that waste reduction and renewable energy can go hand-in-hand.

Marijn Moesbergen, Cocoa Sourcing Director, explains the thinking behind Cargill’s Dutch hub: “This location allows us to operate at scale while reducing our environmental footprint. By investing in infrastructure like this, we improve logistics efficiency, reduce emissions and ensure that cocoa arrives safely and responsibly at the heart of the European supply chain.”

Greener transport for the last mile

Transport is a major focus area for reducing emissions. Cargill is deploying BIO LNG trucks – vehicles powered by bio-based liquefied natural gas derived from organic waste.

These trucks move semi-finished cocoa products to Zaandam’s warehouse, which runs on solar power and uses automated guided vehicles to reduce energy use and emissions.

From there, products are delivered across Europe using a mix of renewable-fuel trucks and short sea shipping.

Each of these measures supports the company’s ambition to cut supply chain emissions by 30% per tonne of product by 2030.

“This is what sustainability at scale looks like,” says Emiel. “It’s measurable, circular and designed to serve both people and the planet.”

Sustainable farming and zero deforestation

Cargill isn’t just focused on what happens after harvest. Through the Cargill Cocoa Promise, the company invests directly in farming communities.

The goal is to reach one million farmers with training in sustainable practices, access to market data and tools that improve yields without harming the environment.

It’s also taking clear steps on deforestation. By 2030, Cargill commits to eliminating deforestation from both its direct and indirect cocoa supply chains. It uses farmer mapping and bean traceability to keep its sourcing transparent, and to ensure its cocoa isn’t contributing to forest loss.

Every move in this reimagined supply chain – from solar-powered warehousing to rethinking waste – points to a system built for long-term environmental impact. Cargill’s approach blends operational scale with practical sustainability measures that can be tracked at every step.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/13e0613c7c9489d5977f5477be9693a7:4fe59a637369756eac0d79bfe13b1186/pablo-merchan-montes-scbq6ukcymy-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 12:14:22.249421

Over the last few months, Starbucks has faced some turbulent times, which were so concerning that it had to make a change fast.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol developed the ""Back to Starbucks"" turnaround strategy to reverse the company's concerning sales declines by returning to its roots and personalizing the coffee shop experience.

One of the many targets in this new plan was to encourage customers to stay longer at Starbucks stores, which would improve the company's declining foot traffic and encourage more in-store purchases.

Starbucks reveals store revamps as part of its turnaround strategy

Starbucks (SBUX) made various short-term changes to achieve its turnaround goals, including free in-café refills on hot and iced brewed coffee and tea at participating locations. It returned handwritten notes on to-go cups and bags to foster better customer connections.

The coffee giant also reintroduced condiment bars and ceramic mugs for in-house sipping after they were removed during the pandemic.

Niccol noted that these quick changes have already improved traffic, bringing its store traffic decline to 4%, compared to the previous quarter's 8%. However, the chain still has room to grow, since the numbers remain negative.

""We’ve seen more customers choose to sit and stay in our cafés, and we continue to receive overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers, demonstrating that small details and hospitality drive satisfaction,"" said Niccol during an earnings call.

As for its long-term goals, Starbucks wants to redesign its store fleet to create a more welcoming and cozy vibe. However, a project this massive requires a heavy investment and time.

Starbucks unveils its new coffeehouse design

In May, Starbucks announced it would begin a string of store remodeling projects over the next few months, with New York and Southern California stores being the first ones on the list.

After two months, Starbucks has finally brought its new coffeehouse design to real life, marking a noticeable departure from its previous aesthetic.

The new design debuted at various Starbucks locations in the Hamptons, New York, this month. The company plans to roll it out to 1,000 stores over the next year.

This revamped aesthetic features cozier and more diverse seating, including more booths, couches, and long wooden tables, all strategically positioned to encourage guests' interactions. It also has high tables and further-apart seating for remote workers and students.

The new design shows warm lighting, creating an inviting atmosphere and more power outlets to prevent customers from needing to return home to recharge their devices.

Starbucks coffee shops are known for being unique to every location, and to continue emphasizing this distinct feature, the walls are decorated with art inspired by each city.

The food displays are fully stocked and more visible to incentivize customers to try them. The espresso bar is more open and almost theater-like to showcase the baristas and the crafting process.

The new design also has new risers and shelves to further distinguish in-store and mobile orders and facilitate pick-up.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjEzNDgyNjMwOTU4NTU2NjIz/atlanta-georgia-starbucks-coffee-building-exterior-with-long-line-of-cars-at-the-drive-thru-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 09:02:37.313456

Press Release, El Segundo CA, 03 July 2025: Boeing has been awarded a $2.8B contract for the Evolved Strategic Satellite Communications (ESS) programme, the space-based component of the US nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) architecture. The initial contract is for two satellites, with options for two more in the future.

“It’s a critical time to advance US space capabilities to ensure peace through strength,” said Cordell DeLaPena, the US Space Force Program Executive Officer for the Military Communications and Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Directorate. “The strategic communication mission requires protection, power and always-available capability, even through adversary attempts to interrupt our connectivity. These satellites will provide connectivity from space as part of a refreshed NC3 architecture for our nation.”

The ESS space vehicles will provide increased capacity, flexibility, reliability and resilience compared to the strategic communications satellites currently on orbit. Since 2020, Boeing has been executing technical maturation and risk reduction under a rapid prototyping contract for the US Space Force.

“The US needs a strategic national security architecture that works without fail, with the highest level of protection and capability,” said Kay Sears, vice president and general manager of Boeing Space, Intelligence and Weapon Systems. “We designed an innovative system to provide guaranteed communication to address an evolving threat environment in space.”

Boeing’s ESS solution is underpinned by technology the company has developed for the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS)-11 and WGS-12 satellites and has already proven on-orbit aboard the commercial O3b mPOWER constellation. Building on these developments, this strategic military communications satellite constellation will be equipped with flexible and resilient signals to protect against interruption or interception.

“This win validates all the investments and innovations we’ve made in our satellite technology, creating a technically mature and low-risk offering for the government,” said Michelle Parker, vice president of Boeing Space Mission Systems. “We scaled our production capacity, invested in our team, hired cleared talent, and assembled hot production lines to make sure that we can hit the ground running from day one. We are committed to delivering this critical capability to meet the strategic need.”

When deployed in geostationary orbit – about 22,000 miles or 35,700 km from the Earth’s surface – ESS will provide persistent coverage to strategic warfighters worldwide. The spacecraft will leverage a highly protected waveform and classified technologies developed in partnership with the US Department of Defense. Boeing is set to deliver the first of two space vehicles by 2031.

“Some firms commented on an upturn in new projects and sales pipelines.”

But overall, construction output posted a 48.8 mark in June, from 47.9 a month ago, as firms “indicated a marginal reduction in total business activity”.

However, the report adds: “New orders decreased at an accelerated pace. This contributed to the weakest degree of business optimism across the construction sector for two-and-a-half years.”

Among other parts of the industry, commercial work decreased at the fastest pace since May 2020, coming in at 45.1.

But he added that conditions across the wider industry remained bleak.

“Survey respondents widely cited fewer tender opportunities, rising competition for new work and a projected headwind from subdued business investment during the year ahead,” Moore points out.

About listeria contamination

Listeria is a bacterium that can contaminate food and cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems, per the FSIS. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms of infection may include flu-like muscle aches and fatigue, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. In pregnant people, infection may cause miscarriages and stillbirths.

The potential contamination of the bacon was discovered during laboratory testing. At the time of publication, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to the consumption of recalled bacon. However, the FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. If you have purchased any impacted products, you’re urged not to consume it and throw it away or return it to its place of purchase.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-choosing-meat-in-butchers-shop-royalty-free-image-1751566049.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.00721xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-07-04 09:02:09.690114

But the sheer scale of transatlantic trade meant that any agreement prior to US President Donald Trump’s July 9 deadline would be “in principle” only.

The White House will today send letters to about a dozen countries outlining their new tariff rates, and contact more in the coming days, with levies ranging from 10% to 70% — the latter figure being higher than any of Washington’s April duties.

US tariff revenues skyrocketed to a record in May, new figures showed, the American economy has not yet suffered the stagflation many economists had warned of, and investors appear to have shrugged off downturn fears. Still, stocks fell and the dollar dropped following Trump’s remarks.

Kyiv said it would protest Washington’s abrupt halt of weapons deliveries during a call between the two countries’ leaders today, as peace efforts faltered.

US President Donald Trump acknowledged he “didn’t make any progress” in talks with his Russian counterpart Thursday, telephone diplomacy that comes with no end to the conflict in sight.

Moscow hammered several Ukrainian cities overnight in a drone and missile barrage, an attack Ukraine’s leader labeled “massive and cynical” for coming just as talks between the American and Russian presidents concluded.

But while Washington’s tone toward the conflict has shifted — a prospective rapprochement with Moscow has given way to growing criticism — its withdrawal of military support has left Kyiv frustrated.

Ties between Beijing and Brussels appeared increasingly strained, just weeks before a high-profile summit.

China on Friday announced it would impose duties on brandy imported from the European Union — widely seen as retribution for the bloc investigating Chinese state subsidies for electric vehicles makers — and reportedly wants to scrap part of the upcoming summit.

The pair had sought to steady their ties in the face of US trade pressure, but a recent visit by China’s foreign minister to Europe laid bare their huge differences on issues ranging from trade to the war in Ukraine: Beijing’s top diplomat told his European counterpart that China could not countenance Russian defeat, the South China Morning Post and La Matinale Européenne both reported.

Republicans passed US President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending bill Thursday, delivering the president a major victory after hours of debate and the quelling of a revolt among some GOP Congress members.

The bill will enact a series of tax cuts while cutting health care spending.

GOP leadership had had to water down several of the bill’s provisions, leading to chaos, Semafor’s Dave Weigel reported: Republicans found themselves defending parts of the legislation, such as tax breaks for Social Security, which had been taken out or diluted.

Still, Speaker Mike Johnson had remained confident that it would pass before July 4 after persuading party holdouts to vote yes on allowing the bill to come up for debate.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday said the European Union is ready to strike a trade deal with the US, but warned that the complexity of any agreement made the July 9 deadline “impossible.”

Von der Leyen pointed to the EU’s recent deal with the UK — which secured tariff cuts for sectors like car manufacturing — as a possible model. But the sheer scale of transatlantic trade meant that any agreement prior to US President Donald Trump’s July 9 deadline would be “in principle” only.

Her remarks come as the EU’s trade commissioner headed to Washington on Thursday, racing to hammer out something to avoid an up to 50% tariff on EU goods before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff pause ends.

​​Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva urged South America’s biggest trading bloc to focus on strengthening ties with Asia, risking the group’s unity.

Asia is now the “dynamic center” of the global economy, Lula said, but other Mercosur members including Argentina have argued for prioritizing European and US ties, with Argentinian President Javier Milei threatening to leave the group if his demands are not met.

The leaders’ dueling comments came ahead of a separate BRICS summit where Lula plans to defend free trade in the face of US protectionism, underscoring friction between Brasília and Washington. “We are in a moment of damage containment more than a moment of creating new instruments,” a Brazilian diplomat told The Economist.

US President Donald Trump held a phone call with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin Thursday, the Kremlin said, just days after the US abruptly halted some weapons shipments to Ukraine.

The call comes as Moscow has intensified its attacks on Ukraine, pounding Ukrainian cities with drone and missile strikes. Trump is expected to talk with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as soon as Friday, with the Ukrainian leader likely to lobby for more military support, including arms sales.

Zelenskyy, who recently described US weapons as “crucial” to Ukraine’s fight against Russia, could see increased resistance from Trump: The White House justified the latest weapons pause as part of Trump’s “America First” policy, while American defense officials also cited shortages in key munitions stockpiles.

US employers added more jobs than expected in June, according to Labor Department figures released Wednesday. The unemployment rate also unexpectedly fell to 4.1%.

Many economists had projected US President Donald Trump’s trade and fiscal policies to affect hiring, but the data suggests that effect either is yet to appear, or may be more muted than expected.

The report could bolster the US Federal Reserve’s “wait and see” approach: The central bank has signaled it could delay cutting interest rates while the economy appears on solid footing, despite coming under pressure from Trump to cut rates.

Some experts however are increasingly concerned that government economic data may be losing some integrity due to fewer people responding to surveys and budget constraints, The Washington Post reported.

The US lifted some restrictions on the export of chip-design software to China, a sign of further easing in trade tensions between the two superpowers.

Washington told a major software provider that it no longer had to apply for licenses to do business in China. The measures were imposed after Beijing limited shipments of rare-earth minerals to the US, itself a response to Washington’s tariffs and semiconductor export controls.

China and the US are implementing a deal to ease flows of vital materials and technologies after a months-long trade war, Bloomberg reported, and years of the US attempting to stifle China’s chipmaking and artificial intelligence ambitions, which Washington sees as a security threat.

Israeli forces killed 82 Palestinians in Gaza overnight, including dozens as they waited for aid, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

The deaths come as Israel and Hamas moved closer to a possible ceasefire after nearly two years of war: US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Israel had agreed to the terms of a 60-day truce, while the Israeli foreign minister said his country was “serious in our will to reach a hostage deal and ceasefire.”

But Hamas has insisted that any agreement means an end to the war and the removal of Israeli troops from Gaza, conditions which Israel has so far opposed.

Japan’s financial sector faces its biggest shakeup in decades thanks to an end to zero interest rates and an imminent wave of inheritances.

About half of Japan’s household wealth is kept in cash or current accounts, because for years savings have made no money. That is changing as interest rates rise, forcing banks to compete on savings offers.

Meanwhile, about 14% of Japan’s rapidly aging population will die by 2035, creating an “inheritance avalanche,” the Financial Times’ Asia business columnist wrote.

The two factors are forcing an end to decades of inertia in markets, with investors turning to US stocks and bank deposit rates soaring, and persuading ordinary Japanese — “Mrs Watanabe” — to think about returns after decades of not bothering.

Large language models’ abilities are doubling every seven months, new research suggested.

It’s hard to gauge the relative performance of LLMs, IEEE Spectrum said, because their main output is written text, making objective assessment difficult. Instead researchers gave models tasks of differing complexity, as measured by how long humans take to complete them, and seeing how reliably the models completed them.

The researchers found LLMs’ capabilities were improving exponentially, far outpacing Moore’s law, which says chips double in power roughly every two years.

One of the study’s authors warned against naive extrapolation, but that if the trend continues, artificial intelligence could be taking on months-long projects by the early 2030s, and eventually “you might not need human workers.”

US President Donald Trump will host five African leaders next week to discuss what the White House called “incredible commercial opportunities” on the continent.

Trump has vowed to increase US interests in Africa, with a focus on controlling more of the continent’s key mineral deposits.

However the abrupt cuts to US aid on which many African countries relied have strained diplomatic ties across Africa, while China and Russia have ramped up their presence there: A Kremlin spokesman said last month that Moscow would seek to boost its security alliances on the continent as Western powers retreat.

The US “must lead with business,” Iyinoluwa Aboyeji wrote in a column for Semafor. “If it doesn’t, China will.”

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he had struck a trade deal with Vietnam, sending shares soaring in major manufacturers that rely on the Southeast Asian nation as a production hub.

Hanoi will face a 20% duty on most goods and 40% on those shipped from other countries to Vietnam before heading to the US, while Washington will see no tariffs under the deal, Trump said. Nike and Lululemon stock jumped on the news: Under Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff regime, Vietnam had faced 46% tariffs — among the highest in the world.

The agreement comes as negotiators scrambled to secure deals with Washington ahead of the July 9 deadline for Trump’s pause on those tariffs, with Indian officials also reportedly close to a deal.

The European Commission on Wednesday laid out a roadmap to lower greenhouse gas emissions by 90% in 2040, as compared to 1990.

The plan would allow bloc members to buy carbon credits from developing countries in order to meet the target, with total foreign offsetting capped at 3% of the 2040 goal. Previously, Brussels had pushed for countries to cut their emissions themselves, but the new proposal could be more appealing to more skeptical member nations, the EU’s climate chief said.

The move has come under criticism, however: Many foreign carbon credit programs have been found to be worthless, and more than 130 climate groups signed a petition last month expressing “extreme concern” about the proposal. The plan still needs to be approved by member states in order to pass.

Iran has formally suspended cooperation with the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, a move likely to deepen fears that Tehran may be more determined than ever to pursue an atomic bomb.

The move blocks the International Atomic Energy Agency from inspecting Iranian nuclear facilities, unless approved by Tehran’s Supreme National Security Council.

Tehran had criticized the IAEA after it declared the country to be in breach of its nonproliferation commitments, just a day before Israel began a 12-day aerial campaign against Iran.

The decision comes as Iran’s foreign minister on Tuesday appeared to downplay hopes of US-Iran negotiations restarting, with Germany saying Tehran had sent a “disastrous signal.”

Global deliveries of Tesla vehicles dropped sharply in the second quarter, prolonging the company’s run of declining sales.

Vehicle deliveries were down 13.5% in the last three months compared to last year — the steepest year-over-year drop in Tesla’s history, according to CNN.

Still, the numbers beat the pessimistic investor forecasts, and Tesla’s shares opened 4% higher on Wednesday, recovering from an earlier dip amid CEO and former White House adviser Elon Musk’s renewed feud with US President Donald Trump.

Analysts attribute Tesla’s decline partly to competition, particularly from China, and partly backlash toward Musk’s political activities. His latest public spat with Trump — over the president’s signature spending bill — could see Tesla incur more damage, The Guardian wrote: If the bill passes in its current form, it would eliminate tax credits for EV purchases.","https://img.semafor.com/fa6606ef3f49f05cefe18c1688a472d7896a57ed-1600x1127.jpg?rect=0,144,1600,840&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-07-04 07:59:29.829775

These companies have not only endured but thrived through centuries of change, reflecting the resilience and adaptability of American enterprise.

Macy’s, Inc., for instance, traces its roots back to 1830 with the founding of John Shillito & Co. in Cincinnati. Rowland H. Macy opened R.H. Macy & Co. in New York City in 1858, and the company has since grown to become a retail giant, currently ranked 193 on the Fortune 500.

Embracing its move as a late mover, Albertsons is turning timing into a strategic advantage. The retail giant is reimagining the future of digital retail from its Bengaluru global capability centre (GCC) to build smarter and more agile solutions. ""Our goal is not to catch up; it's about figuring out how to build for the future,"" said Anuj Dhanda, EVP - chief information and transformation officer at Albertsons Companies. ""There's a certain late-mover advantage—we're now able to design solutions with AI and data science at the core, rather than as an afterthought. Many capabilities that once required heavy coding can now be built with little to no code, dramatically increasing speed and agility. That's why we're so excited about our presence in Bengaluru and the incredible talent here driving this transformation."" Albertsons has over 2,200 stores, and some of its banners include Safeway, Vons, Acme, Tom Thumb, Randalls, United Supermarkets, Haggen, Carrs, Kings Food Markets, and Balducci's Food Lover's Market.

Dhanda said the US retail giant is aiming for a technology refresh. ""We need a technology 2.0, with significant shifts underway—that's where Bengaluru and the GCC come in. For success, we realised we need much greater velocity and agility, and to build far more of our own IP than we do today. Our goal is to change the way we work in technology. We've integrated product, data, and full-stack engineers into fully functional, global teams to enable seamless collaboration. We're applying AI and automation across the entire tech stack—not just in software development, but from requirements gathering to infrastructure and observability.""

Many GCCs are increasingly relocating tech roles to India, signalling growing confidence in shifting solution ownership. ""My intent is to have several of my direct reports to be based here. If we consider the leadership group—around 17 to 18 vice-presidents and above—the goal is for at least a third of them to be in Bengaluru within the next 18 months,"" Dhanda said.

He also said that the insourcing mix will shift dramatically, reducing reliance on external IT providers. ""We developed numerous digital systems, including pharmacy and health capabilities, and upgraded our financial systems. Going forward, our investment will move from foundational upgrades to development-driven initiatives. While we currently depend heavily on third parties like TCS, Cognizant, and Sapient for resources, we plan to bring much of that work inhouse, empowering our own associates. Our focus is to reduce third-party dependence and build stronger internal teams.""

Lalit Ahuja, founder of full-stack GCC firm ANSR, said Albertsons is leveraging the late-mover advantage—not late to the party, but arriving at the perfect time to capitalise on a mature market. For retailers, the landscape is defined by thin margins, highly perishable inventory, and intense tech-driven competition—with e-commerce playing an increasingly vital role. ""Some companies struggle because tech centres are set up suboptimally. But there are firms which are set up with sharper tech differentiation. We're witnessing significant maturity in the types of roles being introduced, driving modernisation of its tech stack. This includes mainstream adoption of new technologies and a stronger emphasis on product and functional ownership. And AI has become the greatest accelerator of efficiency,"" Ahuja said. Last year, Accenture picked up a significant minority stake in the Bengaluru and US-based ANSR, which set up over 170 GCCs in India.

To support accurate identification and tracking, farmers are issued Resettlement ID Books equipped with QR codes, linking them to verified data within AML's digital land management platform.
These rules are intended to prevent the abuse of land compensation programs, a problem that has plagued resettlement schemes in Liberia and the wider region for years.
Beyond crop compensation, AML's new policy introduces a framework for leasing private land needed for operations.
Meanwhile, Augustus Greaves, a prominent community leader in Grand Bassa, described the digital policy as timely.","ArcelorMittal Liberia (AML), the country's largest foreign investor and a key player in Liberia's mining sector, has launched a pioneering digital resettlement and land compensation policy designed to bring fairness, transparency, and structure to its land acquisition and compensation activities.

The new policy covers all AML operational areas, including its mining sites in Nimba County, the Buchanan Port in Grand Bassa, the Yekepa-Buchanan railway corridor, and the Neekreen rock quarry in Grand Bassa County.

The initiative introduces a digital system that integrates technology, community engagement, and procedural clarity to address historical challenges surrounding land rights and compensation disputes. It marks a transformative shift in how landowners and farmers interact with concessionaires, especially in resource-rich but governance-challenged regions like Liberia.

At the heart of the new policy is a structured process that ensures affected landowners and farmers are informed, consulted, and fairly compensated. AML's Resettlement Officer, Shad Whabyely, described the policy as a great step forward in ensuring efficient and credible land processes.

The process begins with AML submitting formal land use requests, followed by a series of community consultations and awareness sessions. These are designed to ensure that local residents understand the procedures, eligibility criteria, and the roles of various actors, including the government, AML, and community stakeholders.

A detailed baseline survey and crop inventory are then conducted to establish what exists on the land before any transaction. To support accurate identification and tracking, farmers are issued Resettlement ID Books equipped with QR codes, linking them to verified data within AML's digital land management platform. Once this verification is complete, compensation payments are processed in accordance with national guidelines.

To discourage speculative planting and land misuse, the policy introduces clear eligibility criteria. Only crops planted before January 1, 2020 within AML's designated concession zones are eligible for compensation. These will be evaluated using Ministry of Agriculture standards. Crops planted after January 1, 2020 within concession areas are not eligible for compensation, unless they are situated on private land. In such cases, the Ministry of Agriculture will determine appropriate compensation. These rules are intended to prevent the abuse of land compensation programs, a problem that has plagued resettlement schemes in Liberia and the wider region for years.

Beyond crop compensation, AML's new policy introduces a framework for leasing private land needed for operations. This includes signing official lease agreements with landowners, ensuring fair pricing and lease terms, and providing a grievance resolution mechanism to handle disputes or concerns raised by landowners and farmers.

Marcus Wleh, AML's Head of Sustainability and External Relations, emphasized the importance of the policy in building lasting partnerships with communities. He said the policy is another step toward building sustainable relationships with local communities, noting the company's evolving approach to corporate social responsibility.

Local and government officials have lauded AML's initiative as a progressive step in improving concession-community relations. Amos W. Solee, representing the Nimba County Agriculture Office, welcomed the structured engagement by AML and encouraged farmers to remain informed about the latest crop pricing policies. Meanwhile, Augustus Greaves, a prominent community leader in Grand Bassa, described the digital policy as timely. He said AML is one of Liberia's biggest taxpayers and the policy should be widely shared so farmers know their rights and can plan better for the future.

AML is now rolling out information sessions across its operational counties to educate affected farmers and landowners on how to engage with the new system. Community members are being encouraged to attend these meetings, register for their Resettlement ID Books, and submit any complaints or concerns through AML's official communication channels.

With this digital shift, ArcelorMittal Liberia is positioning itself as a benchmark for responsible land management practices in West Africa's extractive sector. The integration of digital tools, verification procedures, and community engagement could serve as a model for other natural resource companies operating in similar environments. As Liberia continues to grapple with land-related disputes, especially in concession zones, AML's policy could represent a much-needed evolution in how companies interact with rural communities, balancing corporate interests with the rights and dignity of local landowners.

The successful implementation of this policy could further strengthen AML's social license to operate and set a new standard for inclusive and transparent resource governance in Liberia.",https://cdn.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,N,,2025-07-04 10:02:54.029482

Symptoms of listeriosis

Consuming food contaminated with listeria monocytogenes can result in listeriosis, an infection that poses a significant danger to older adults, individuals with compromised immune systems, and expectant mothers and their babies.

People over age 50 are particularly vulnerable to developing severe symptoms. These may include fever, muscle pain, headache, stiffness in the neck, confusion, loss of coordination and seizures, often accompanied by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal issues.

Symptoms usually appear within a few hours to a few days but can sometimes take two to six weeks to appear after eating the contaminated food. In some cases, it may take up to two months to notice symptoms, according to the Department of Agriculture","https://aarp.widen.net/content/0zeaidkasv/jpeg/1140-recall-turkey-bacon.jpg?crop=true&anchor=0,0&q=80&color=ffffffff&u=k2e9ec&w=1140&h=655",N,,2025-07-04 12:13:31.899374

Kraft Heinz Foods Company and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has issued a recall for about 367,812 pounds of packaged turkey bacon.

The affected products include Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original 12oz, Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon 36 oz (3-12 oz packs) and Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original 48 oz (4-12oz).

According to the USDA, the products are believed to be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes - a bacteria capable of causing serious infections in humans.

While a listeria infection usually causes mild fever, headache and diarrhea in most people, it can be deadly for pregnant women, newborns, the elderly and those with weak immune systems.

These items were shipped to multiple retail locations nationwide including Target and some were even exported to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

As of now, no reports of illness caused by the infected products have been reported by officials and consumers have been asked to either discard the packages or return them to the store of purchase.

Officials noted that the 12oz package has use-by dates from July 18 to August 2, 2025 with UPC 071871548601; 36oz packages have use-by dates from July 23 to September 4, 2025 with UPC 071871548748; and 48oz packages have use-by dates from July 18 to September 4, 2025 with UPC 071871548793.

A Kraft Heinz spokesperson said in an official statement: 'At Kraft Heinz, nothing matters more to us than the safety of our products and the well-being of the families who trust them.

'In line with our safety protocols, we are actively working with all retail partners and distributors to remove the potentially impacted product from circulation.'

People can become infected with listeria from contaminated food items such as seafood, deli meats, hot dogs, unpasteurized fruit juices, soft cheeses and sprouts.

In this case, it is possible that the turkey bacon may have become contaminated with the bacteria through poor hygiene during processing, contact with contaminated surfaces during packaging or even through mishandling during transportation.

The bacteria can survive the stomach acid and travel to the intestine, from which they may migrate into the bloodstream.

Most healthy adults will start to feel sick within a couple of days of consuming contaminated food.

It usually starts with flu-like symptoms - a fever, muscle aches or nausea - before progressing to vomiting and diarrhea.

Some people begin to feel sick weeks or months after the initial infection.

This is because listeria can go dormant when faced with environmental stress, such as in water without nutrients or in the presence of detergents.

It can also spread to the central nervous system and cause a stiff neck, seizures, confusion and a loss of balance.

In the most severe cases, listeria can lead to meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord or pus buildup in the brain which can be deadly to human life.

However, pregnant woman may have mild or no symptoms but can still pass the infection to the fetus, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Babies born with a listeria infection can have developmental delays, develop blindness, paralysis and may even face organ failure - which could lead to death.

Every year, about 1,600 people Americans end up with listeria out of which nearly 300 die from the infection.

Treatment for listeria infections usually includes taking antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin.

Officials claim that the contamination was discovered after it was tested for bacteria in a Kraft Heinz lab.

The valued at US$ 83.62 Billion in 2023, is forecasted to grow at a robust CAGR of 11.5%, reaching US$ 94.14 Billion in 2024 and an impressive US$ 180.86 Billion by 2030. The telehealth and telemedicine market are experiencing significant growth primarily driven by the growing geriatric and medically underserved (especially rural) populations, the growing prevalence of chronic conditions, the benefits of telehealth & telemedicine given the current shortage of physicians and care personnel, and advancements in telecommunication technologies, and expansion of remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems. However, regulatory variations across regions, the rise in fraud and abuse within healthcare systems, and behavioural reluctance to adopt new technologies are expected to restrain the market growth during the forecast period.

Government initiatives to improve access to healthcare also play a vital role, often providing funding and resources to strengthen telehealth infrastructure, especially in underserved regions. Collaboration between technology firms and healthcare delivery organizations is a very important determinant that will have innovative solutions towards enhancing service delivery and engaging the patient to improved health outcomes. Together, these determinants drive growth in the market and change the face of the healthcare delivery scene to become responsive to patient needs and preferences.

By component, the software component is expected to capture the largest share of telehealth & telemedicine market during the forecast period. This would be due to the increasing demand for the digital health solution, which could be used for remote consultations, monitoring, and patient management. The software segment includes different tools and platforms, such as electronic health records (EHR), telemedicine applications, and patient management systems, which are important for providing virtual healthcare services. The product will increase productivity in the hands of healthcare providers through proper communication, real-time tracking of information, and inclusion into other service offerings. Moreover, the cloud-based platform and AI machine learning in application software also support their adoption by enriching the features of diagnosis, treatment plans, and predictive analytics. The healthcare systems that are increasingly adopting digital transformation will be dominated by software solutions in terms of scalability, flexibility, and improved patient outcomes.

ID13,CVS Health,2025-07-04 10:03:44+00:00,WSOC TV,Rural hospitals brace for financial hits or even closure under Republicans' $1 trillion Medicaid cut,MARGERY A. BECK and SUSAN HAIGH,,,,,https://www.wsoctv.com/news/health/rural-hospitals/OAW4O4J5MFHO3OEXFC2ZKNMRVU/,"More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.
President Donald Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers.
But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total.
Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.
“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,"" Cochran-McClain said.","OMAHA, Neb. — (AP) — Tyler Sherman, a nurse at a rural Nebraska hospital, is used to the area's aging farmers delaying care until they end up in his emergency room.

Now, with Congress planning around $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, he fears those farmers and the more than 3,000 residents of Webster County could lose not just the ER, but also the clinic and nursing home tied to the hospital.

“Our budget is pretty heavily reliant on the Medicaid reimbursement, so if we do see a cut of that, it’ll be difficult to keep the doors open,” said Sherman, who works at Webster County Community Hospital in the small Nebraska town of Red Cloud just north of the Kansas border.

If those facilities close, many locals would see their five-minute trip to Webster County hospital turn into a nearly hour-long ride to the nearest hospital offering the same services.

“That's a long way for an emergency,” Sherman said. “Some won't make it.”

States and rural health advocacy groups warn that cutting Medicaid — a program serving millions of low-income and disabled Americans — would hit already fragile rural hospitals hard and could force hundreds to close, stranding some people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.

More than 300 hospitals could be at risk for closure under the Republican bill, according to an analysis by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which tracks rural hospital closures. Even as Congress haggled over the controversial bill, a health clinic in the southwest Nebraska town of Curtis announced Wednesday it will close in the coming months, in part blaming the anticipated Medicaid cuts.

Bruce Shay, of Pomfret, Connecticut, fears he and his wife could be among those left in the lurch. At 70, they're both in good health, he said. But that likely means that if either needs to go to a hospital, “it's going to be an emergency.”

Day Kimball Hospital is nearby in Putnam, but it has faced recent financial challenges. Day Kimball's CEO R. Kyle Kramer acknowledged that a Senate bill passed Tuesday — estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years — would further hurt his rural hospital's bottom line. Roughly 30% of Day Kimball's current patients receive Medicaid benefits, a figure that's even higher for specific, critical services like obstetrics and behavioral health.

“An emergency means I’m 45 minutes to an hour away from the nearest hospital, and that’s a problem,"" Shay said. And he and his wife wouldn't be the only ones having to make that trip.

“You’ve got, I’m sure, thousands of people who rely on Day Kimball Hospital. If it closed, thousands of people would have to go to another hospital,” he said. “That’s a huge load to suddenly impose on a hospital system that’s probably already stretched thin.”

Rural hospitals have long operated on the financial edge, especially in recent years as Medicaid payments have continuously fallen below the actual cost to provide health care. More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.

President Donald Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers. To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs — cuts they insist only root out fraud and waste in the system.

But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total. Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.

Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals already struggle to break even, citing a recent American Hospital Association report that found that hospitals in 2023 got nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.

“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,"" Cochran-McClain said. ""Meaning that any amount of cut to a payer — especially a payer like Medicaid that makes up a significant portion of rural provider funding — is going to be consequential to the rural hospitals' ability to provide certain services or maybe even keep their doors open at the end of the day.”

A KFF report shows 36 states losing $1 billion or more over 10 years in Medicaid funding for rural areas under the Republican bill, even with the $50 billion rural fund. No state stands to lose more than Kentucky.

The report estimates the Bluegrass State would lose a whopping $12.3 billion — nearly $5 billion more than the next state on the list. That's because the bill ends Kentucky's unique Medicaid reimbursement system and reduces it to Medicare reimbursement levels.

Kentucky currently has one of the lowest Medicare reimbursement rates in the country. It also has one of the highest poverty rates, leading to a third of its population being covered by Medicaid.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat widely seen as a potential candidate for president in 2028, said the bill would close 35 hospitals in his state and pull health care coverage for 200,000 residents.

“Half of Kentucky’s kids are covered under Medicaid. They lose their coverage and you are scrambling over that next prescription,” Beshear said during an appearance on MSNBC. “This is going to impact the life of every single American negatively. It is going to hammer our economy.""

The S&P Global UK Construction Purchasing Managers’ Index™ (PMI®) rose to 48.8 in June, up from 47.9 in May, indicating the slowest contraction in overall construction activity since the downturn began in January.
Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “June data highlighted a sustained downturn in UK construction output, albeit at the slowest pace in six months.
Commercial activity fell at the sharpest rate in just over five years.
“On a brighter note, house building was the bestperforming area of the construction sector.","UK construction output fell slightly in June, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline, as reduced commercial and civil engineering work outweighed a modest rebound in residential building activity.

The S&P Global UK Construction Purchasing Managers’ Index™ (PMI®) rose to 48.8 in June, up from 47.9 in May, indicating the slowest contraction in overall construction activity since the downturn began in January.

Despite the modest improvement, any reading below 50.0 signals a reduction in activity.

While house building returned to growth for the first time since September 2024, with an index reading of 50.7, the expansion was marginal.

Some firms reported an increase in new projects and sales pipelines. In contrast, commercial construction activity declined at its fastest rate since May 2020, falling to 45.1, as businesses cited subdued economic conditions and cuts to investment spending.

Civil engineering output also continued to weaken, with a reading of 44.2, making it the sector’s worst-performing area.

New orders across the industry dropped for the sixth month running, with the pace of decline quickening from May.

Respondents pointed to fewer tender opportunities, stronger competition for new contracts, and client caution amid broader economic uncertainty.

Employment levels fell in June, continuing a year-long trend. Surveyed companies attributed staff reductions to weaker demand and efforts to control costs.

Purchasing activity also declined, although the decrease was the smallest since January. Supplier performance improved to its highest level in a year, despite some reports of international shipping delays.

Construction firms experienced a sharp rise in input prices during June, particularly for materials like concrete, insulation, and timber.

However, overall cost inflation slowed for the third consecutive month and was the lowest recorded since January.

Business confidence across the sector deteriorated, with just 34% of firms expecting output to rise over the next 12 months and 18% anticipating a decline.

This marks the lowest level of optimism since December 2022. Survey participants cited sluggish sales enquiries and ongoing concerns about the UK economic outlook as key factors weighing on sentiment.

Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “June data highlighted a sustained downturn in UK construction output, albeit at the slowest pace in six months.

“Shrinking workloads in the commercial and civil engineering segments weighed on total industry activity. Commercial activity fell at the sharpest rate in just over five years.

“On a brighter note, house building was the bestperforming area of the construction sector. Higher levels of residential work were recorded for the first time since September 2024 amid some reports of more stable demand conditions.

“The forward-looking survey indicators were weaker than in May. Total new orders fell at a faster pace as many construction companies signalled reduced overall workloads due to unfavourable domestic economic conditions and fragile confidence among clients.”

He added: “At the same time, business activity expectations dipped to a two-and-a-half-year low in June.

“Survey respondents widely cited fewer tender opportunities, rising competition for new work and a projected headwind from subdued business investment during the year ahead.”

Reaction:

Gareth Belsham, director of Bloom Building Consultancy:

“Even the most optimistic of builders would struggle to declare the glass half full.

“Yes the overall contraction in industry workloads continues to ease, and housebuilders even saw output rise in June. That’s the good news.

“But on the other side of the ledger, commercial sector workloads fell sharply, declining at their fastest level since May 2020 – a month when Britain was in the teeth of the Covid pandemic. Infrastructure and civil engineering work contracted even more rapidly.

“But the real cause for alarm is the continued decline in new orders – as they are the key to where the industry goes from here. Builders’ order books have got progressively thinner every single month in 2025 so far, and this is taking a severe toll on construction industry sentiment.

“The PMI survey found that among construction contractors, optimism has fallen to its lowest level since December 2022.

“Those polled reported that fewer projects are coming up for tender, there is intense competition for new work and that staff lay-offs continue.

“As the ultimate bellwether of broader business sentiment, the fall in demand for construction is another economic warning light for the Chancellor to take notice of.

“In this challenging market, the projects that do get greenlit are laser-focused on value and a fully costed business case – there is minimal margin for error.”

Lauren Pamma, head of energy and infrastructure at Aldermore Bank:

“Today’s data shows a sustained downturn as total activity falls for the sixth month running, and business optimism across the sector falls to its weakest level in two and a half years.

“Its clear challenges remain, and persistently high inflation could limit the scope for further interest rate cuts, potentially leading to an uneven recovery across the sector in the coming months.

“Meanwhile, the cross-border tariff negotiations have started to weigh on European supply chains, causing congestion that may linger and drive up costs in the near term.

“However, it’s positive to see housebuilding performing well, with higher levels of residential activity recorded for the first time since September 2024. While the outlook remains uncertain, there are indications of upticks in certain areas.

!The situation continues to evolve daily and SMEs across the sector will be watching developments closely to see how the outlook will change.”",https://theintermediary.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AdobeStock_226862296.jpeg?_t=1751622007,N,,2025-07-04 11:02:19.361457

Johnson & Johnson has submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency for an indication extension of Akeega (niraparib and abiraterone acetate dual action tablet), aiming to treat adult patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer who carry homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations.

The submission builds on positive results from the company’s phase 3 AMPLITUDE trial, which investigated niraparib in combination with abiraterone acetate with prednisone or prednisolone versus abiraterone acetate plus prednisone alone – the current standard of care.

The AMPLITUDE trial showed statistically significant improvements in radiographic progression-free survival and time to symptomatic progression, with an early trend toward overall survival benefit. The safety profile aligned with previous studies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The Australasian greenfield development market continues to witness feasibility challenges, with elevated construction costs, inflation, and tighter lending conditions dampening new supply pipelines.

In this environment, Choice Hotels Asia-Pac is focusing on strategies with lower capital intensity and faster speed to market, like asset repositioning and refurbishment into midscale and upscale brands – this is emerging as a favoured option for many hotel investors.

Our conversion-friendly brands appeal to developers and investors seeking to mitigate the risks and costs of new builds. We see sustained momentum as owners reposition properties into our brand family, leveraging our extensive sales network and loyalty platform.

Our internal analysis has identified over 1,500 independent hotels in Australia as strong candidates for conversion, representing a tremendous opportunity. Unlike ground-up developments, conversions require less capital, can be executed faster and deliver ROI sooner.

Supporting this trend is the evolving landscape of hotel operating models. The rise of white label management from both established and emerging operators has created unprecedented flexibility. Hybrid structures are becoming more common, with owners pairing a Choice Hotels brand with a third-party operator under either hotel management agreement (HMA) or leasehold structures, allowing owners to select the model best suited to their investment strategy and operational preferences.

Investor interest in regional Australia also remains strong, with branded properties often delivering above-average returns in these areas. We’re actively working with investors to unlock value in these markets.

Finally, the growth of multi-unit franchisees within the Choice Hotels network highlights our model’s scalability and operational benefits, with owners, both freehold and leasehold, leveraging centralised operations, cluster staffing models, procurement synergies and greater leverage with lenders. Coupled with support from Choice Hotels, the portfolio effect can unlock compelling financial outcomes.

Amid development constraints, Choice Hotels’ focus on conversions, flexible models, and regional expansion to enable robust, scalable growth is appealing to both first-time investors and experienced groups, positioning the company for continued momentum in 2025 and beyond.",https://www.hotelmanagement.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Choice_Hotels_2.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 07:04:57.337069

The plan was announced in a statement Tuesday, explaining it is ""the first time ever"" that they have offered full-time drivers the ability to volunteer to ""receive a generous financial package if they choose to leave UPS.""

The U.S. is projected to face a physician shortage in the next 11 years, per the Association of American Medical Colleges, and foreign medical residents fill critical gaps in the health care system.
“They’re truly providing health care for all of America.” Foreign medical residents work in specialties that U.S. applicants aren't as eager to apply to.
“The residents are the backbone of the entire hospital,” said Dr. Zaid Alrashid from Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in New York, which has medical residents from almost every continent.
Foreign medical trainees who've made it into the U.S. remain on edge about their situations, Karuppiah said.","Some hospitals in the U.S. are without essential staff because international doctors who were set to start their medical training this week were delayed by the Trump administration's travel and visa restrictions.

It's unclear exactly how many foreign medical residents were unable to start their assignments, but six medical residents interviewed by The Associated Press say they’ve undergone years of training and work only to be stopped at the finish line by what is usually a procedural step.

“I don’t want to give up,” said a permanent Canadian resident who matched to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Harrisburg but had her visa denied because she is a citizen of Afghanistan. She requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. “But the situation also seems so helpless.”

Initially, the medical community was worried that hundreds of positions — many in hospitals in low-income or rural areas of the U.S. — could be affected. The pause on interviews for J-1 visas for approved work or study-related programs was lifted in mid-June.

The national nonprofit that facilitates the residency match process said the visa situation is resolving, but it will take weeks to know with confidence how many medical residents have had the start of their careers derailed because they got their visa too late or were blocked by President Donald Trump’s travel ban on 12 countries, according to people who coordinate the residents’ training.

Four foreign medical residents told the AP that U.S. embassies have been slow to open up interview slots — and some have not opened any.

“You lose out on the time you could have used to treat patients,” said one resident from Pakistan, who matched to an internal medicine program in Massachusetts and requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal.

The U.S. is projected to face a physician shortage in the next 11 years, per the Association of American Medical Colleges, and foreign medical residents fill critical gaps in the health care system. More than 6,600 foreign-born international medical residents matched into U.S. programs in 2025 — the highest on record — and another 300 filled positions that were vacant after the match process was complete.

Not all of those residents were affected by visa issues or the travel ban on foreign nationals from countries including Afghanistan, Haiti and Sudan.

International medical graduates often take jobs in places where U.S. medical trainees tend not to go, said Donna Lamb, president of the National Resident Matching Program.

“It’s not just that they’re coming in and they want to work in big, flashy centers on the coast,” Lamb said. “They’re truly providing health care for all of America.”

Foreign medical residents work in specialties that U.S. applicants aren't as eager to apply to. For example, international candidates make up almost 40% of residents in internal medicine, which specializes in the prevention and treatment of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.

“The residents are the backbone of the entire hospital,” said Dr. Zaid Alrashid from Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in New York, which has medical residents from almost every continent. Most received their visas prior to the pause but a few were caught up in delays.

Two residents from India who spoke on condition of anonymity have not been able to get an appointment at any U.S. embassies there despite the J-1 visa pause being lifted.

Another resident from Egypt just secured a visa appointment for mid-August but is worried her program may not be willing to wait for her. She’s already paid her security deposit for an apartment in Texas to live during her residency.

""I don’t know when this situation will be resolved,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding she hasn’t been eating or sleeping well.

In California, leaders at two graduate medical education programs said they have a small number of residents caught up in J-1 visa delays. Both spoke on condition of anonymity due to concerns for the doctors who are still trying to get visas.

A residency leader at one large health care system said two doctors in its 150-resident program are delayed, adding they could start late or defer to next year. A 135-person program at a California public health system told the AP that one resident has yet to arrive, though he was finally scheduled for a visa interview.

“We are not going to breathe easy until he's here in our hospital,” the second leader said.

As of Wednesday, Lamb's matching program had received fewer than 20 requests to defer or cancel residency contracts.

Worried about losing their spots if they defer, many foreign medical residents may keep trying to get to the U.S. and start their residencies late, said Dr. Sabesan Karuppiah, a past member of the American Medical Association's International Medical Graduates Governing Council and former director of a large residency program.

Some hospitals may struggle at this point to replace the residents who don't make it, leaving fewer people to care for the same number of patients, said Kimberly Pierce Burke, executive director of the Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers.

Foreign medical trainees who've made it into the U.S. remain on edge about their situations, Karuppiah said.

“I can tell you the word on the street is: ‘Do not leave the country,'” he said, adding that people are missing out on important events, seeing sick parents or even getting married. “Everybody's scared to just leave, not knowing what's going to happen.”

The tariff regime is not just a trade policy—it's a seismic shift in global supply chains.
Those who act swiftly to align with U.S. priorities and diversify into defensive assets will navigate this tsunami unscathed.","The July 9, 2025, tariff deadline marks a pivotal moment in global trade, as the U.S. enacts sweeping reciprocal tariffs and sector-specific levies under its ""America First"" agenda. With countries like China, Vietnam, and EU members facing rates exceeding 30%, industries such as automotive, luxury goods, and energy stand at the crosshairs. This analysis dissects sector vulnerabilities and identifies equities positioned to thrive—or falter—in the coming storm, while emphasizing the urgency of portfolio realignment before the deadline.

Automotive: Compliance as the New Currency

The automotive sector faces a stark divide: U.S. manufacturers adhering to the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) will enjoy duty-free status, while non-compliant imports face a 25% tariff wall. Companies with production chains aligned to USMCA's stringent rules of origin—such as General Motors (GM) and Ford (F)—are shielded, whereas global competitors like Toyota or BMW risk margin erosion.

However, the UK's special treatment offers a silver lining. Its automotive tariffs drop to 7.5% under a tariff-rate quota, enabling U.S. buyers to source vehicles at a discount. Investors should favor U.S. automakers with cross-border supply chains and monitor the U.S.-UK Economic Prosperity Deal, which may further ease steel/aluminum costs for aerospace and automotive firms.

Luxury Goods: The European Sell-Off and U.S. Rebound

European luxury brands—think LVMH or Kering—are vulnerable to tariffs ranging from 20% to 50%, depending on their country of origin. This creates a window for U.S. luxury players like Coach (COH) and Ralph Lauren (RL) to capture displaced demand. Additionally, companies with U.S. manufacturing hubs or supply chains outside the tariff zones (e.g., Vietnam's reduced 20% rate) will outperform.

Energy and Critical Minerals: Betting on U.S. and Asian Suppliers

The energy sector faces dual pressures: sanctions on nations importing Venezuelan or Iranian oil, and Section 232 investigations into critical minerals like lithium and cobalt. U.S. shale producers, such as Devon Energy (DVN), and Canadian oil sands firms gain an edge as buyers pivot to avoid sanctioned suppliers. Meanwhile, the export controls on Chinese rare earths and tungsten (effective February 2025) favor companies in Australia or Africa. The VanEck Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF (REMX) offers exposure to this theme.

Steel and Aerospace: Domestic Winners, Global Losers

With U.S. steel tariffs at 50% for non-UK origins, domestic producers like Nucor (NUE) and Allegheny Technologies (ATI) stand to gain as import substitution accelerates. The aerospace exemption for UK manufacturers (under the WTO Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft) also shields players like Boeing (BA), which sources critical components from the UK. Investors should avoid European steel exporters and focus on U.S. firms with low foreign exposure.

Safe Havens: Gold and Bonds as the Anchor

Amid this volatility, gold (GLD) and long-term Treasuries (TLT) emerge as critical ballast. The Federal Circuit's stay on tariff-related legal challenges until July 31 reinforces uncertainty, making safe havens a must-have for portfolios.

Final Call to Action

The clock is ticking. Before July 9, investors should:

1. Rotate into USMCA-compliant automakers (GM, F).

2. Short European luxury stocks and favor U.S. alternatives (COH, RL).

3. Add REMX to capitalize on critical mineral demand.

4. Hold NUE and BA for steel/aerospace resilience.

5. Allocate 10–15% to GLD/TLT to hedge against tariff-driven market swings.

The tariff regime is not just a trade policy—it's a seismic shift in global supply chains. Those who act swiftly to align with U.S. priorities and diversify into defensive assets will navigate this tsunami unscathed. The window to position is closing fast.

Parcel delivery firm UPS is offering voluntary buyouts in 2025, giving workers the opportunity to accept the deal and leave their jobs. The Teamster Union was the first to bring the matter to light, and unsurprisingly, they are primarily enraged by the move. Teamsters’ reaction to the buyout has been one of anger, as they referred to it as an “illegal violation” of the national contract, which had required the organization to create 22,500 jobs, not eliminate just as many roles.

The UPS buyout news in July doesn’t come as a shock, as the company had previously announced plans to cut 20,000 roles and close 73 facilities to scale down its operations. The decision to lay off workers at UPS was announced as a direct result of the company’s plans to sever ties with its biggest customer, Amazon. The UPS voluntary buyouts for the drivers are reportedly the first instance of such a dealing in its 117-year history, making this a monumental moment in the organization’s legacy.

UPS Voluntary Buyouts in 2025—What We Know So Far

United Parcel Service employs around 330,000 full-time and part-time employees, and provides one of the most comprehensive networks of delivery drivers across the country. Unfortunately, due to rising labor costs and a decline in the active demand for its services, the business is now looking to cut down on its extensive network and reposition itself in the market with a smaller workforce on call.

The UPS voluntary buyouts being offered in 2025 represent the first time the company has made such a move, but troubling times have come calling, and job cuts appear to clear the path forward for the business. The terms of UPS’ buyout package have not been made public, so it’s unclear just how much is being offered to those who leave voluntarily.

All we know is that as part of the company’s “largest network reconfiguration” ever, full-time drivers will have the opportunity to agree to the terms of the “generous financial package” and make a gracious exit if they prefer. Reuters reports that the buyout package will be provided in addition to any earned retirement benefits offered, including pension and healthcare services.

As UPS Drivers Are Offered an Early Exit, the Teamsters Union Stands Against It

From the outside looking in, the UPS voluntary buyout packages for 2025 appear to be a good deal for workers who don’t want to wait around and see if they get culled by the cuts. Even without knowing the specifics of the deal, it’s clear that the UPS drivers who are offered an early exit could take the deal and retirement benefits and focus on their family as they plan out their next move. So why is the Teamsters’ reaction to the buyout so negative?

The Teamsters union doesn’t appear to be upset exclusively by the terms of the offer, but more frustrated by UPS’ decision to renege on commitments made during contract negotiations. The business had previously committed to creating 22,500 full-time jobs with existing part-time workers and 7,500 additional full-time jobs in the final years of the 2023 contract. Now, the company is instead cutting 20,000 jobs to keep its business prospects up.

“UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts in front of Teamsters drivers,” Teamster General President Sean M. O’Brien said in a statement recently.

“UPS is obligated to establish tens of thousands of new full-time jobs under the agreement. But CEO Carol Tomé and UPS’s corporate managers are hoping that if they offer paltry severance packages to enough workers, no one will notice the company is setting the union’s contract on fire. UPS Teamsters work too damn hard to be treated with such disrespect,” he continued.

Will the UPS Buyout Package See Any Takers?

The UPS voluntary buyout packages are expected to be met with great resistance from the Teamsters Brotherhood, with the union leader committing to fighting the offer extended to workers. “Our members cannot be bought off, and we will not allow them to be sold out. The Teamsters are prepared to fight UPS on every front with every available resource to shut down this illegal buyout program,” O’Brien explained in the released statement.

In the long term, workers who are part of the union could benefit more from extended employment that the union fought for and ratified, over whatever payout they receive from the buyout. UPS’ decision to proceed with the layoffs has been seen as an “illegal” violation of the terms of the contract, with the company attempting to eliminate workers rather than adhere to the demands that were agreed on earlier.

Some workers may be willing to accept the terms of the buyout, but UPS has a battle in store for it if it fails to work with the Teamster Brotherhood. It is unclear if their resistance will be able to lead to concrete results, but the union does not appear to be willing to go down without a fight, actively encouraging its members to reject the “illegal and insulting buyout.”",https://www.thehrdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/UPS-voluntary-buyouts.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 05:02:35.201464

Tesla experienced a record quarterly drop in deliveries during the second quarter of 2025.

It shipped 384,112 vehicles, falling nearly 3,000 short of expectations. Though that shortfall is relatively small, it points to deeper shifts affecting the company’s once untouchable place in the EV market.

At the same time, Tesla’s stock is rising despite a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump, and amid slowing sales of its core product: the electric car.

The company has always aimed to be more than just a carmaker. While it still earns most of its revenue through EVs, its attention is now split across several parallel ventures — including solar energy, battery storage, humanoid robots and robotaxis. These areas are promising in the long term, but pull time, focus and resources away from the EV business.

Sedex: Suntory’s Secret to 32% Supplier Gains

Suntory is tightening up its approach to responsible sourcing by using Sedex, the ethical supply chain platform, to build a smarter, data-led system that strengthens supplier performance and improves sustainability oversight.

With hundreds of suppliers spread across continents, the company faces complex challenges in tracking risk, maintaining standards and keeping up with evolving legal requirements.

Now, after embedding Sedex’s risk management and data tools into its operations, Suntory reports a 32% increase in Management Controls scores across supplier sites—a marker of how well individual locations manage their sustainability risks.

Suntory’s global reach involves supply chains that span Asia, Europe and the Americas.

The scope of this network, combined with tightening regulations and increasing pressure from stakeholders, means that managing sustainability performance is no small task.

Why Trump's Vietnam Deal is Boosting Fashion Retail Stocks

Shares of some of the world’s biggest apparel and footwear companies are surging after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam.

As Vietnam serves as a major production base for names like Nike, Lululemon, Gap and Under Armour, the agreement averts the higher 46% tariffs previously threatened and instead sets a lower rate of 20%.

The retail sector has closely tracked these negotiations, as Vietnam supplies a large portion of their merchandise, from T-shirts and denim to trainers and sportswear. Nike alone produces around half of its footwear in Vietnamese factories.

When President Trump first proposed the higher tariff in April, industry stocks dropped sharply. On Wednesday (2 July), after the new deal was revealed, they bounced back: Nike shares climbed 4.2%, Lululemon added 2.9%, and Under Armour and Levi Strauss also saw gains.

Why is Co-op Making Changes to its Supplier Network?

Co-op is taking deliberate steps to create a more ethical and sustainable supply chain by dropping 17 countries from its supplier network.

This phased withdrawal focuses on removing items tied to regions linked with human rights abuses or breaches of international law.

The shift forms part of the organisation's wider ethical positioning under its 'Hate Divides Communities, Co-operation Builds Them' campaign.

U.S. Bancorp (USB) Stock Price Movements After Reaching a New High: A Backtested Analysis

Short-Term Movements (1 Week)

- Probability of Increase: Historically, after reaching a new high, USB's stock price tends to experience a pullback or consolidation in the short term. This is because investors may take profits, leading to a downward movement. The probability of an increase in the first week after reaching a new high is moderate.

- Average Percentage Change: The average percentage change in the first week following a new high is typically around 0%, reflecting the consolidation phase.

Medium-Term Movements (1 Month)

- Sustainability of High: After a month, the stock's performance is better reflected by its ability to sustain the new high or continue to make progress towards the average price target. If the stock manages to hold the high and continues to perform well, it could indicate a sustained upward trend.

- Average Percentage Change: The average percentage change in the first month after reaching a new high is around 5%, assuming the stock maintains its upward momentum.

Long-Term Movements (3 Months)

- Trend Continuation: By three months, the stock's performance would be better represented by its ability to continue trending upwards or stabilize at the new high. Given USB's positive fundamentals, such as the recent price target increase by Morgan Stanley and the planned dividend increase, the stock is likely to show strong performance over the long term.

- Average Percentage Change: The average percentage change in the first three months after reaching a new high is approximately 10%, indicating a strong upward trend.

Conclusion: U.S. Bancorp's stock price tends to experience a brief consolidation period after reaching a new high, with a higher likelihood of increased movement in the medium to long term. Given the company's strong fundamentals and positive analyst outlook, the stock is poised for continued growth over the next three months.

U.S. Bancorp's recent financial performance has been a significant driver of its stock price. The company reported Q1 CY2025 results that surpassed revenue expectations, with a 3.6% year-on-year increase in sales. This strong financial performance has bolstered investor confidence in the company's growth prospects.

Additionally, Morgan Stanley's recent price target adjustment for U.S. Bancorp reflects a positive outlook on the stock's potential performance. The firm raised its price target from $50.00 to $51.00, maintaining an ""Overweight"" rating. This move underscores the market's optimism about U.S. Bancorp's future performance.

U.S. Bancorp's commitment to shareholder returns is another factor contributing to its stock price appreciation. The company announced a 4% dividend increase and continues its share repurchase program. This, combined with a strong capital position, as evidenced by a CET1 ratio of 10.8% and a stress capital buffer of 2.6%, further enhances investor sentiment.",,N,,2025-07-04 06:02:50.214836

In April, the health system partnered with WovenX Health, a virtual speciality care system, to provide additional gastroenterology services and last month opened a community pharmacy in Madras.

Both financial rating agencies reflected on the Central Oregon health system’s stable outlook last week and forecasted modest growth throughout the rest of the year and into the next.

St. Charles has a dominant position in Central Oregon, Moody’s pointed out, and the health system offers a comprehensive array of clinical offerings, which combined with a growing community will continue “to fuel strong revenue growth,” according to the report.

The health system, the only hospital system for more than 100 miles, is the largest employer in Central Oregon with 5,188 employees, according to an Economic Development for Central Oregon annual ranking.

“We are pleased that Moody’s Ratings affirmed our bond revenue rating and stable outlook,” Matt Swafford, St. Charles Health System chief financial officer, said in an email. “We have a solid strategic plan for the next few years that is focused on continuing to refine and improve our operations while continuing to grow services.”

Last year, the health system broke ground on a cancer treatment center in Redmond that will open in 2026. In April, the health system partnered with WovenX Health, a virtual speciality care system, to provide additional gastroenterology services and last month opened a community pharmacy in Madras.

The four-hospital health system closed the books on 2024 with a positive operating margin — a metric indicating profitability — of 0.6%, Swafford said.

“While lower than 2023, it is a continued sign of St. Charles overall financial stability and is a positive outcome when compared to many health systems across the state and nation,” Swafford said.

According to a report by the Hospital Association of Oregon, demand for care has surged in 2024, but the state’s hospitals recorded year-over-year losses due to rising costs of patient care. At the same time, the report noted, Oregon nurses have the highest hourly wage in the nation. Payroll and benefits account for 51% of the budgets for Oregon hospitals from 2021 to 2024, according to the same report.

Much of the losses are due to lower Medicaid payments, which account for 31.9% of Oregon hospital insurance coverage. Swafford noted that proposed cuts to Medicaid could pose a “significant headwind.”

Other challenges facing St. Charles hospitals include the risk of drought and wildfire, but the health system has environmental mitigation plans that lowers those risks, according to the S&P Global Ratings report.

Management has implemented initiatives to alleviate credit risks from inflation and labor costs, but “we believe there could be additional pressures to recruit physicians and clinical staff given the. more isolated geographic area in which the facility operates,” noted S&P.

“The stable outlook reflects our expectation that St. Charles Health System will maintain its balance sheet strength and that management will make progress improving operations,” according to the S&P report.",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/05/4ebe10ac8f8e78a54b713a69abff5f1d.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 12:14:25.846701

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

The U.S. is projected to face a physician shortage in the next 11 years, per the Association of American Medical Colleges, and foreign medical residents fill critical gaps in the health care system.
“They’re truly providing health care for all of America.” Foreign medical residents work in specialties that U.S. applicants aren't as eager to apply to.
“The residents are the backbone of the entire hospital,” said Dr. Zaid Alrashid from Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in New York, which has medical residents from almost every continent.
Foreign medical trainees who've made it into the U.S. remain on edge about their situations, Karuppiah said.","Some hospitals in the U.S. are without essential staff because international doctors who were set to start their medical training this week were delayed by the Trump administration's travel and visa restrictions.

It's unclear exactly how many foreign medical residents were unable to start their assignments, but six medical residents interviewed by The Associated Press say they’ve undergone years of training and work only to be stopped at the finish line by what is usually a procedural step.

“I don’t want to give up,” said a permanent Canadian resident who matched to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Harrisburg but had her visa denied because she is a citizen of Afghanistan. She requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. “But the situation also seems so helpless.”

Initially, the medical community was worried that hundreds of positions — many in hospitals in low-income or rural areas of the U.S. — could be affected. The pause on interviews for J-1 visas for approved work or study-related programs was lifted in mid-June.

The national nonprofit that facilitates the residency match process said the visa situation is resolving, but it will take weeks to know with confidence how many medical residents have had the start of their careers derailed because they got their visa too late or were blocked by President Donald Trump’s travel ban on 12 countries, according to people who coordinate the residents’ training.

Four foreign medical residents told the AP that U.S. embassies have been slow to open up interview slots — and some have not opened any.

“You lose out on the time you could have used to treat patients,” said one resident from Pakistan, who matched to an internal medicine program in Massachusetts and requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal.

The U.S. is projected to face a physician shortage in the next 11 years, per the Association of American Medical Colleges, and foreign medical residents fill critical gaps in the health care system. More than 6,600 foreign-born international medical residents matched into U.S. programs in 2025 — the highest on record — and another 300 filled positions that were vacant after the match process was complete.

Not all of those residents were affected by visa issues or the travel ban on foreign nationals from countries including Afghanistan, Haiti and Sudan.

International medical graduates often take jobs in places where U.S. medical trainees tend not to go, said Donna Lamb, president of the National Resident Matching Program.

“It’s not just that they’re coming in and they want to work in big, flashy centers on the coast,” Lamb said. “They’re truly providing health care for all of America.”

Foreign medical residents work in specialties that U.S. applicants aren't as eager to apply to. For example, international candidates make up almost 40% of residents in internal medicine, which specializes in the prevention and treatment of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.

“The residents are the backbone of the entire hospital,” said Dr. Zaid Alrashid from Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in New York, which has medical residents from almost every continent. Most received their visas prior to the pause but a few were caught up in delays.

Two residents from India who spoke on condition of anonymity have not been able to get an appointment at any U.S. embassies there despite the J-1 visa pause being lifted.

Another resident from Egypt just secured a visa appointment for mid-August but is worried her program may not be willing to wait for her. She’s already paid her security deposit for an apartment in Texas to live during her residency.

""I don’t know when this situation will be resolved,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding she hasn’t been eating or sleeping well.

In California, leaders at two graduate medical education programs said they have a small number of residents caught up in J-1 visa delays. Both spoke on condition of anonymity due to concerns for the doctors who are still trying to get visas.

A residency leader at one large health care system said two doctors in its 150-resident program are delayed, adding they could start late or defer to next year. A 135-person program at a California public health system told the AP that one resident has yet to arrive, though he was finally scheduled for a visa interview.

“We are not going to breathe easy until he's here in our hospital,” the second leader said.

As of Wednesday, Lamb's matching program had received fewer than 20 requests to defer or cancel residency contracts.

Worried about losing their spots if they defer, many foreign medical residents may keep trying to get to the U.S. and start their residencies late, said Dr. Sabesan Karuppiah, a past member of the American Medical Association's International Medical Graduates Governing Council and former director of a large residency program.

Some hospitals may struggle at this point to replace the residents who don't make it, leaving fewer people to care for the same number of patients, said Kimberly Pierce Burke, executive director of the Alliance of Independent Academic Medical Centers.

Foreign medical trainees who've made it into the U.S. remain on edge about their situations, Karuppiah said.

“I can tell you the word on the street is: ‘Do not leave the country,'” he said, adding that people are missing out on important events, seeing sick parents or even getting married. “Everybody's scared to just leave, not knowing what's going to happen.”

The vessel features a 302.8-kilowatt solar system, the largest of its kind, which generates 410,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually and reduces carbon intensity by 35 percent over its lifecycle compared to conventional ships, Science and Technology Daily reported on Friday.

""The successful maiden voyage of the 'Yuan Hai Kou' is a practical step forward in COSCO Shipping's global channel strategy, integrating shipping, ports and logistics while setting a new benchmark for low-carbon transformation in the global shipping industry,"" said Zhang Wei, chairman of COSCO Shipping Specialized Carriers Co., Ltd.

The recent 9-year lease with Danone for a state-of-the-art logistics site in Sorigny, France, epitomizes how ESG integration is transforming the sector. This deal isn't just about space—it's a strategic move to lock in premium tenants, boost rental stability, and capitalize on the surging demand for sustainable infrastructure.

The Aut0nom® Model: Engineering Carbon Neutrality at Scale

ARGAN's Aut0nom® framework combines cutting-edge technology with strategic environmental offsets. The Sorigny facility, set to open in summer 2026, is a microcosm of this approach:

- Renewable Energy: Photovoltaic panels and batteries power the 8,200-square-meter site, reducing reliance on the grid.

- Energy Efficiency: Electric heat pumps and a smart building management system optimize energy use in cold storage (2–6°C) and office spaces.

- Carbon Offsets: A reforestation project in Cestas neutralizes residual emissions, achieving net-zero status.

The result? A 10-fold reduction in CO₂ emissions versus traditional warehouses, certified by third parties like BREEAM. This isn't just greenwashing—it's a measurable, replicable model now deployed across 15 sites, covering 3.7 million square meters.

ESG-Driven Demand: Why Tenants Pay a Premium for Sustainability

Danone's decision to lease the Sorigny site wasn't arbitrary. The food giant, itself a sustainability leader, prioritized ARGAN's Aut0nom® label over cost savings. This reflects a seismic shift in industrial real estate: companies are willing to pay more for assets that align with their ESG goals.

The benefits are twofold:

1. Tenant Retention: Long-term leases (like Danone's 9-year term) reduce vacancy risks and provide steady cash flows.

2. Brand Alignment: Tenants using Aut0nom® sites can tout their environmental credentials, enhancing their own ESG reporting and investor appeal.

ARGAN's strategy is paying off financially: its portfolio generates €205 million in annual rental income, a figure poised to grow as ESG-conscious firms seek out carbon-neutral spaces.

Financial Fortitude: Investment-Grade Stability Amid Transition

ARGAN's financial profile is a critical underpinning for its ambitious ESG agenda. With an investment-grade BBB- rating, the company can access low-cost capital to fund green upgrades and new projects. This contrasts sharply with peers reliant on high-cost debt.

The Sorigny deal also highlights operational efficiency: relocating 60 Danone employees from a less efficient site to a centrally located hub (near A10/A85 highways) cuts logistics costs while maintaining local employment. Such synergies position ARGAN as a partner of choice for firms seeking both sustainability and cost savings.

The Investment Case: Why ARGAN is Poised to Outperform

ARGAN's blend of ESG innovation, financial discipline, and strategic asset selection creates a compelling investment thesis:

- Catalyst 1: Growing demand for carbon-neutral logistics. As regulations tighten and consumer preferences shift, ARGAN's 15 Aut0nom® sites will become increasingly irreplaceable.

- Catalyst 2: Lease renewals and expansion. With 3.7 million sqm under management, there's ample runway to apply the Aut0nom® model to more sites, driving rental growth.

- Catalyst 3: Valuation upside. While ARGAN's stock has risen steadily, its price-to-book ratio remains below its peers, suggesting undervaluation relative to its ESG leadership and cash flow generation.

For investors, the risks are manageable. While upfront costs for green infrastructure are high, the long-term savings (lower energy bills, premium rents) offset these expenses. Third-party certifications and a 10-year emissions reduction track record further mitigate skepticism.

Final Take: Buy the Green Wave with ARGAN

ARGAN is not just a real estate player—it's a pioneer in ESG-driven industrial infrastructure. The Danone lease is a milestone, but the real value lies in the scalability of the Aut0nom® model. As corporations worldwide accelerate their net-zero journeys, ARGAN's carbon-neutral assets will command a premium, fueling rental growth and stock appreciation.

Recommendation: Investors seeking exposure to sustainable logistics should consider adding ARGAN. With its BBB- rating, low vacancy risks, and a pipeline of ESG-certified projects, the stock is positioned to outperform as the ESG revolution reshapes industrial real estate.",,N,,2025-07-04 03:59:44.501625

Meanwhile, the S&P Global Composite PMI dipped to 51.5%—its lowest in 14 months—highlighting a growing divergence between domestic services sector strength and broader global economic softness. This contrast offers a critical lens for investors to identify opportunities in inflation-resistant industries while avoiding tariff-sensitive sectors.

The Divergence Explained

The ISM Services PMI's resilience contrasts sharply with the global slowdown captured by the S&P Global Composite PMI. While US services sectors like healthcare, technology, and finance reported steady demand, global manufacturing and services faced headwinds from rising tariffs, supply chain bottlenecks, and waning business confidence. The US services sector's insulation from these pressures—due to its domestic demand focus and strong labor market—creates a tactical advantage for investors.

Sector-Specific Opportunities

Healthcare & Technology: Anchors of Stability

The healthcare sector (e.g., pharmaceuticals, medical devices) and technology (software, cloud services) are outperforming due to their demand resilience and pricing power.

Healthcare: The ISM report noted steady growth in sectors like healthcare and social assistance, despite budget cuts in public administration. With aging populations and rising chronic disease rates, demand for medical services is structurally insulated from short-term economic cycles.

Technology: Tech firms, particularly those in cybersecurity and AI-driven solutions, are benefiting from corporate IT spending shifts. The ISM's Prices Index (60.9%) also highlights tech's ability to pass cost increases to customers.

Financials: Caution Ahead

While the ISM Services PMI includes strong activity in finance and insurance, broader risks loom. The financial sector (banks, insurance) faces pressure from slowing loan demand and credit tightening. Additionally, the Employment Index's contraction to 46.2%—its first dip below 50 in six months—hints at reduced hiring, a red flag for labor-dependent industries.

Materials & Trade: Tariff Vulnerabilities

Sectors like materials (steel, aluminum) and transportation are exposed to rising global tariffs. The ISM report cited shortages in aluminum and groundwood paper, while S&P Global noted a 7-month high in input costs. Investors should avoid companies with heavy reliance on imported raw materials or cross-border logistics.

Investment Strategy: Focus on Resilience

Target Inflation-Resistant Sectors:

Healthcare stocks (e.g., Johnson & Johnson, UnitedHealth Group) and tech leaders (e.g., Microsoft, NVIDIA) offer pricing power and demand stability.

Avoid Tariff-Sensitive Plays:

Steer clear of materials companies (e.g., Freeport-McMoRan, Caterpillar) and shipping firms (e.g., Maersk, FedEx) until trade tensions ease.

Monitor Policy and Data Releases:

Track ISM Services PMI monthly for signs of momentum shifts. A sustained drop below 50% would signal broader weakness.

Watch for S&P Global's March 24 PMI flash release to assess global growth risks.

Risks to Consider

Policy Uncertainty: Federal Reserve rate decisions and trade negotiations could disrupt sector dynamics.

Labor Market Tightening: A persistent shortage of skilled workers (noted in construction and healthcare) may limit growth.

Conclusion

The US services sector's resilience in March 2025 underscores its role as a pillar of economic stability amid global headwinds. Investors should prioritize healthcare and technology for their demand durability and inflation hedging, while avoiding industries at the mercy of tariffs and supply chain volatility. As PMI data continues to diverge, selective exposure to sectors with pricing power and domestic focus will be key to navigating this uneven recovery.

Stay agile—monitoring these divergences will guide capital toward sectors poised to thrive in 2025's uneven growth landscape.",,N,,2025-07-04 13:13:32.617399

""With Amperity's AI powered identity resolution, we've uncovered that 3.4 million customer profiles had been fragmented across multiple records,"" saus Jack Freeman, Customer Analytics Manager at New Look.","It's Friday, the weekend is almost upon us, so let’s kick back and reflect on another eventful week for the retail systems space. Here's your briefing on the most important stories from the past few days, including Walmart, Evri, Tesco, John Lewis Partnership, Instacart, Wegmans, New Look, Talon.One, and Asos.

1. Walmart opens dark stores as it tackles complicated and costly process of fulfilling online grocery orders

Walmart is opening dark stores in Dallas, TX, and Bentonville, AR.

The US retail giant is testing out whether this option will enable it to more quickly fill orders from customers who are paying extra to get items faster.

The concept of using dark stores to fulfill online grocery orders isn't new, of course; it has been in use for decades, and Walmart has been active in this space for years on a small scale. Although the retailer operates 4,650 stores in the USA, and 90% of the US population is located within ten miles of one of its stores, fulfilling online grocery orders is a complicated and costly process.

Walmart wants to test and see how much faster and cheaper it can fulfill orders in a dark store vs a retail store, utilising new technology and picking strategies. If the tests are successful, they’ll be leveraged in the retail stores.

2. Debenhams Group inks multi-year AWS deal to scale up AI tools across brands including boohoo and PrettyLittleThing

Debenhams Group, the online retailer behind brands including Debenhams, PrettyLittleThing, boohoo, boohooMAN and Karen Millen, says that it is accelerating the adoption of AI across its business.

A new multi-year agreement with cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), aims to streamline the troup’s operations and rapidly scale new brands using AI-driven tools.

It already uses AWS cloud services on the Debenhams platform. AWS’s serverless cloud technology powers its marketplace model by facilitating the faster onboarding of third-party sellers, a broader product selection and a smooth purchasing journey.

Debenhams will now deploy technologies like GenAI. AI generated content, powered by Amazon Bedrock, will enable it to automate product descriptions and translations across tens of thousands of products.

Automating product descriptions has made the process 20 times faster, according to those involved. On top of that, translations into six languages happen automatically, so no extra work is needed. This means products are ready to sell in different countries much quicker.

3. Evri announces £50 million investment in parcel lockers as it doubles out of home delivery network

UK parcel delivery company, Evri, has announced plans to grow its out of home offering by 2030 - more than doubling its network of ParcelShops and lockers to 25,000.

It is set to stump up £50 million+ to launch an owned, in-house network of smart lockers. Evri will roll-out 10,000 lockers as part of this initiative.

It currently has a network of more than 10,000 ParcelShops and lockers, which includes its flagship independent shop network, Post Office branches, corporate partners such as Co-op. Parcelshops and locker locations are set to grow to 25,000, hitting the 2,000 locker milestone before Christmas.

The announcement follows a 500% year-on-year increase in locker usage, a trend which is anticipated to continue.

4. John Lewis Partnership set to allow partner brands to access retailer's offsite media capabilities

As a result of the new offer, brands partnering with John Lewis and Waitrose will be able to activate advertising campaigns across a range of external channels including video ads via connected TV on popular streaming platforms.

This also includes online videos and display ads on popular consumer websites.

Previously, advertising opportunities were limited to the Partnership’s own websites but now, thanks to its work with technology provider Epsilon, it is expanding into a retail media network. Using the Epsilon Retail Media Network, it will allow advertisers to reach consumers across multiple channels and devices, not just the John Lewis and Waitrose websites.

Jemma Haley, Retail Media Lead for the Partnership explains: “This move is a big step forward in creating an insight-led retail media offer that spans both grocery and non-grocery. It helps us build a detailed understanding of audiences across vastly different purchase journeys, from immediate necessities to more considered items. This will enable our brand partners to target smarter audiences powered by first-party data, helping our customers discover more relevant and tailored brands.”

5. Marks and Spencer boss says operations set to be up and running by August following cyber attack

The Chief Executive of M&S, Stuart Machin, has said he hopes operations will be running “fully” within four weeks. The retailer is continuing to put systems back online following a hugely damaging cyber attack.

Half of its online operations have returned to normal, but there remains work to be done around Click and Collect services.

Susannah Streeter, Head of Money and Markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: ‘’Marks and Spencer is halfway there, but there’s still a lot to get back online before the company can put the cyber attack behind it. 50% of online operations are back up and running, but its popular Click and Collect services remain suspended.”

She adds: “At the company’s AGM, Machin put the latest timeline on a recovery at four weeks. This should mean the retailer will hit August firing on all cylinders once again. Management have previously estimated that it could cost as much as £300 million in lost sales and operational disruption, although it’s likely that this will be mitigated by insurance claims and cost efficiencies made elsewhere.”

“While services have been suspended the company is believed to have used the opportunity to speed up part of its digital transformation plan, as well as ensuring that its IT systems are robust enough to withstand a future attack.”

6. Tesco preps Attabotics tie up to install micro-fulfillment systems for online grocery orders

Tesco has entered into an agreement with Attabotics that will see the UK grocery giant tapping the firm’s micro-fulfillment systems to fulfill online grocery orders.

It’s a move that is likely in line with plans to grow Tesco’s Whoosh and Marketplace offerings.

According to a report by Brittain Ladd, a supply chain consultant and former Amazon executive, citing multiple unnamed sources, it has evaluated numerous micro-fulfillment solutions on the market including AutoStore and Fabric.

The retailer looked at the technology from Attabotics for nearly two years before entering into an agreement to purchase and install a system. It required the Canadian company to meet stringent requirements across a variety of areas including picking speed, uptime, ease of use, and safety.

7. Loyalty and promotion software firm Talon.One bags $135m in funding for AI innovation push

Talon.One, an enterprise loyalty and promotion software provider, has announced a $135 million funding round from new investors Silversmith Capital Partners and Meritech Capital, with participation of existing backer CRV.

Talon.One’s platform enables over 270 customers across a range of sectors to tap data in building personalised, scalable promotions and loyalty programmes. Customers include H&M, adidas, Costa Coffee, Sephora, Ticketmaster and Nordstrom.

The new capital will accelerate innovation of the Talon.One platform and strengthen the company’s market position in the US, UK, Europe and APAC. The investment will focus on delivering AI powered intelligence and predictive insights, as well as deepening enterprise capabilities across sectors.

8. Instacart Wegmans notch up a first as they launch pilot of AI powered Caper Carts at New York store

Instacart, a grocery technology company in North America, has announced the launch of Caper Carts – its AI powered smart carts – at Wegmans Dewitt in Syracuse, New York. This marks the first deployment of Caper Carts at Wegmans.

Caper Carts automatically recognise items as they are dropped into the cart and customers can bag as they shop, tapping signals from an array of cameras, digital scale, and location sensors connected to NVIDIA Jetson hardware. Wegmans customers can login to their Shoppers Club account on the cart’s screen in order to shop this way.

“Caper Carts are transforming everyday grocery shopping into a faster, more personalised experience,” says David McIntosh, Chief Connected Stores Officer at Instacart. “We’re excited to partner with Wegmans - known for their exceptional customer and in-store experience - to bring this technology to their store. Together, we’re delivering customers a delightful and personalised shopping journey.”

The companies first partnered to offer same-day delivery in 2017, and have since expanded the partnership to include the likes of pickup, EBT SNAP acceptance, loyalty programme integration.

9. New Look boosts customer data strategy with AI and cloud powered Amperity and Databricks partnership

New Look reports the implementation of Amperity, an AI powered customer data cloud, integrated with the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. Amperity was selected earlier this year following results from a pilot programme.

The solution enables New Look to connect data across all customer touchpoints - online and in-store - to better identify high value customers and activate insights in real-time. Results from the pilot indicated a projected return on investment within the first quarter, driven by more efficient marketing campaigns, improved audience targeting, and increased cross-channel conversions.

""With Amperity's AI powered identity resolution, we've uncovered that 3.4 million customer profiles had been fragmented across multiple records,"" saus Jack Freeman, Customer Analytics Manager at New Look. ""Most importantly, we discovered that 31% of our top customers were using multiple email addresses, making it nearly impossible to recognise and properly serve our most valuable shoppers.""

10. Asos focuses on exclusive benefits and experiences with launch of new loyalty programme for UK customers

Online fast fashion giant Asos has announced the launch of a new loyalty programme for UK customers after a trial earlier this year.

Called ASOS.WORLD, the scheme offers exclusive benefits and experiences such as early access to collections and edits, priority back-in-stock alerts, invites to events and early access to sales.

The loyalty programme will be offered to customers in four tiers:

Roblox

M3GAN 2.0 (pronounced Megan 2.0) opened in cinemas around the world this past weekend.

A sequel to viral horror/sci fi hit M3GAN (2022), the plot follows M3GAN, a life like AI powered doll programmed to be a child’s ally that goes rogue, being rebuilt to combat an out of control humanoid military robot put together using her technology.

To promote the movie, M3GAN has ventured on to the Roblox platform.

In a LinkedIn post, Stephanie Latham, Vice President Global Brand Partnerships & Advertising at Roblox, said: ""M3GAN is back - and not just on the big screen. Now on Roblox, users can join her to take down a new nemesis, Amelia, across fan favourite games like Clip It, Evade, and Piggy. Defeat Amelia and unlock your very own M3GAN companion to follow you across Roblox.”

She added: “Want less battle, more boogie? Head to M3GAN’s lair for a dance party and earn a free emote. She does adapt to you, after all. Big thanks to our partners at NBCUniversal and Blumhouse for bringing everyone’s favourite AI diva to Roblox - and to our amazing devs and entertainment teams for making it unforgettable.”

A dedicated payment system, integrated directly into the app – a single scan is all it takes to collect points, redeem coupons and pay directly. It couldn't be easier.”

“What impresses me about it: Consistently thought ahead, from the customer journey to the cost structure; Courageously implemented, despite complexity and existing solutions such as Apple Pay or Google Pay; Clearly positioned - independent, intuitive, data strong.”

He added: “I am pleased about such clear, strategic decisions - and the uncompromising implementation of them. It fills me with pride to be part of a company that not only plans innovations, but makes them a reality. Congratulations to all colleagues who have contributed to this. This is digital transformation in practice.”

Simbe's in-store robot Tally has joined the teams at SPAR Österreich and INTERSPAR.

In a LinkedIn post, SPAR ICS said: ""On 1st July, the first two Tally robots will begin operating at INTERSPAR Eisenstadt and EUROSPAR in Vienna. Developed by Simbe Robotics, Tally autonomously scans shelves, detects product gaps, and reports stock levels in real-time.""

The pilot is the result of an Innovation Trailblazers programme, where SPAR ICS was tasked with identifying technologies that create real value on the shopfloor. It says that Tally stood out because it does the following thing exceptionally well: it helps ensure that products are available exactly when customers need them.

SPAR ICS is supporting the project with key technical services - including infrastructure, integration, and deployment coordination - working with stores and relevant business departments.

Up to three times a day, Tally will check the store environment and identify gaps in shelves, and employees will then receive detailed reporting on where the goods need to be reshuffled. They will no longer have to interrupt their work and can concentrate fully on customer service.

Exotec by Dexter

Exotec by Dexter, a provider of intralogistics automation using robotics, has expanded its portfolio with new projects at six large companies in Spain.

As one of the fastest growing European markets in warehouse automation, Spain saw a 11.2% increase in logistics investments in 2024, with several companies turning to Exotec’s technology to overhaul their operations.

Exotec has signed new deals with sport and fashion retailer Sport Street; publisher Penguin Random House; used book retailer Hamelyn; pharmaceutical and healthcare company Alliance Healthcare; logistics operator ESBO Logistics; and veterinary product distributor Gepork Group.

RADAR

RADAR, a platform that combines RFID and computer vision technology to track and locate in-store inventory, has announced the launch of RADAR+, an AI analytics offering.

This builds on existing inventory tracking technology to provide real-time store intelligence. The platform is designed to help maximise sales, plan demand and allocations, prioritise workflows and support sales associates to provide a superior customer experience.

RADAR+ tracks which products are taken into fitting rooms and which picked up items convert into sales. It also detects inventory and identifies when items have been misplaced within the store or left in a fitting room.

Dexory, which provides warehouse visibility and automation solutions, has announced a new strategic partnership with Company Shop Group (CSG), which claims to be the UK’s biggest redistributor and retailer of surplus products.

Dexory’s autonomous robots and AI powered platform will be used to drive improvements at CSG’s Barnsley warehouse, which manages inventory including surplus food, homeware, personal care, and pet categories.

The technology will be used to ensure CSG stock is stored in the correct locations, allowing for rapid issue resolution and to support dispatch operations using by-date priority lists and real-time views of dispatch pallets.

Dexory’s robots can execute multiple autonomous scans each day, allowing CSG’s operational teams to act quickly to identify issues and implement training and improvement efforts.

Using Dexory’s solution, CSG says it is able to track stock with a level of accuracy and speed not previously possible. The technology has also freed up time for the stock control team, allowing them to focus on wider efficiency initiatives.

Walmart

Last month, Walmart Unlimited, a gamified mini-series, served up a third and final chapter.

This made its debut earlier in the year, brought to you by Walmart, Unity and Spatial in collaboration with animators and producers Martian Blueberry and game development studio PIGIAMA KASAMA.

The first episode introduced characters inspired by Walmart’s real-life suppliers, including A Dozen Cousins founder Ibraheem Basir.

It was the US retail giant’s latest attempt to tap immersive commerce - a form of online shopping that combines VR with 3D visualisations and gamification - to connect with the next generation of consumers.

In the third episode, players joined Jabari, an aspiring artist guided by the Young Kings founder, as he journeyed through a sci-fi dreamscape to find elixirs and unlock his crown. Along the way, they faced new challenges and also discovered shoppable beauty and self-care products woven into the adventure.

""With over 1.2 million players and an average in-game time of more than 35 minutes, our gamified series has exceeded expectations,"" says Matteo Fanchin, Co-founder at PIGIAMA KASAMA.

""For the first time, immersive storytelling, action gameplay, and real product discovery converge in a multi-platform branded experience - built entirely on Spatial and playable on any device.""

The turkey bacon was produced from April 24, 2025, through June 11, 2025. The following products are subject to recall [view labels]:

12-oz. vacuum-packed packages of “Oscar Mayer Turkey BACON ORIGINAL” and universal product code (UPC) “071871548601” printed on the packaging under the barcode,”use by” dates ranging “18 JUL 2025” to “02 AUG 2025,” and lot code “RS40.”

The products subject to recall bear the USDA mark of inspection on the front of the label. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide and some were exported to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

The problem was discovered after the establishment’s laboratory testing indicated the product may be contaminated with Lm.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

While near-term cash flow volatility is a concern, the structural cost savings and strategic bets on AI and premium products suggest HP is building a more resilient business model.","The global tech landscape has been buffeted by macroeconomic turbulence, geopolitical tensions, and shifting consumer preferences. Amid this volatility, HP Inc. (HPQ) has emerged as a case study in strategic resilience. By aggressively restructuring its cost base, diversifying its supply chain, and betting on high-margin segments like AI-powered PCs, the company is positioning itself to weather near-term challenges while setting the stage for a free cash flow turnaround.

A Mixed Start to 2025, But Signs of Strategic Focus

HP's Q1 2025 results revealed a company balancing growth and cost discipline. While net revenue rose 2.4% year-over-year to $13.5 billion, profitability was squeezed by rising commodity prices and tariffs. The Personal Systems division—HP's largest—saw a 5% revenue increase, driven by strong commercial demand and the early adoption of AI-enabled PCs (AIPC), which now account for 15% of shipments and are expected to reach 25% by year-end. This premium segment commands higher margins, offsetting declines in consumer PC sales, which fell 7% as HP intentionally prioritized profitability over market share.

The Printing division, however, faced headwinds. Revenue dropped 2% as aggressive pricing in China and weak commercial demand offset gains in consumer Big Tank printers and subscription services. Despite this, HP's focus on high-margin supplies—such as ink and toner—remains intact, with supplies revenue holding steady in constant currency.

The Cost-Cutting Engine: Saving $1.9 Billion by 2025

HP's “Future Ready” restructuring program has become its lifeline. By raising its savings target to $1.9 billion by fiscal 2025, HP is tackling both its workforce and supply chain:

- Workforce Reductions: Plans to cut 1,000–2,000 jobs will generate $300 million in annual savings, with restructuring charges of $150 million.

- Supply Chain Overhaul: HP aims to shift 90% of North American PC production out of China by year-end, reducing tariff exposure and geopolitical risks. These moves are critical as tariffs on Chinese imports have added ~$100 million in annual costs.

These measures are already bearing fruit. Non-GAAP operating margins in Personal Systems improved to 5.5% in Q1, despite macro headwinds. HP expects these savings to flow through to margins in the second half of 2025, as AI adoption accelerates and seasonal demand for PCs picks up.

Free Cash Flow: A Rocky Q2, But a Strong Finish Expected

HP's Q1 free cash flow of $70 million masks near-term turbulence. Management warned of a negative Q2 reading due to inventory buildups and receivables timing, but reaffirmed its full-year guidance of $3.2–$3.6 billion. This confidence stems from two factors:

1. Cost Discipline: The $1.9 billion savings target is designed to offset inflationary pressures and stabilize cash flow.

2. Working Capital Management: HP has tightened controls over payables and receivables, with CFO Karen Parkhill noting, “We're laser-focused on converting operational improvements into cash.”

The Investment Case: A Turnaround in the Making?

HP's stock has languished, down ~15% over the past year, as investors penalize its exposure to PC cyclicality and printing declines. However, the current valuation—trading at just 8.5x 2025E EPS—may reflect an overly pessimistic outlook. Key catalysts for a rebound include:

- AI-PC Penetration: As enterprise adoption of AIPCs accelerates, HP's leadership in this segment (via partnerships with NVIDIA and AMD) could boost margins beyond current expectations.

- Supply Chain De-risking: Reducing China's manufacturing footprint mitigates tariff and geopolitical risks, potentially unlocking a ~$100 million annual tailwind.

- Dividend Sustainability: With a payout ratio below 50%, HP's $0.34 quarterly dividend remains secure, even in a low-growth environment.

Risks and Challenges

Consumer PC Demand: Weakness in consumer spending could persist, pressuring margins unless HP's premium strategy gains traction.

Printing Headwinds: Competitor pricing in China and slowing enterprise spending could further weigh on the division.

Execution Risks: Supply chain shifts and layoffs require flawless execution to avoid operational disruptions.

Conclusion: A Buy-the-Dip Opportunity?

HP's stock trades at a discount to its historical average and peers like Dell Technologies (DELL), which commands a 12x P/E. While near-term cash flow volatility is a concern, the structural cost savings and strategic bets on AI and premium products suggest HP is building a more resilient business model. Investors with a 12–18-month horizon may find value in a stock that could rebound sharply if FCF exceeds guidance.

In the tech sector's current storm, HP's focus on cost discipline and innovation may position it to emerge stronger. For now, the stock offers a compelling risk-reward trade-off for patient investors.",,N,,2025-07-04 03:59:49.633247

Economic risks in focus as tariff deadline looms

Fed minutes, UK GDP and inflation data for mainland China are key releases in a week which is likely to be dominated by the looming US tariff deadline.

April's pause on higher US tariffs is due to expire on 9th July, in theory resulting in far higher levies on goods exported to the US for economies that have yet to secure trade deals. Few deals (notably the UK, Vietnam and a framework with China) have so far been announced at the time of writing, meaning countries will be eager to secure extensions.

Fed policymakers will be eager to learn what the tariff landscape is going to look like. The FOMC's wait-and-see approach to interest rates weighs up the risks of higher tariff-related inflation against the dampening effects on growth and hiring from recent US policy changes. A guide to policymaker views on potential rate cuts will come from the minutes of the last FOMC meeting, which saw interest rates on hold. While there have been recent signs of splits toward a more dovish stance, PMI and payroll data have indicated a resilience in the economy alongside rising price pressures, supporting the postponement of rate cuts until later in the year.

The health of the UK economy will also come under scrutiny with GDP data for May. April's 0.3% decline had indicated a marked deterioration after 0.7% growth in the first quarter. Another weak month would add to fears that the UK economy is spluttering amid headwinds of trade uncertainty, Budget measures which led to higher payroll costs starting in April, and low consumer confidence. However, the PMIs suggest that these headwinds have started to ease.

Meanwhile, industrial production data for Germany will be eyed for signs that rising domestic demand (linked to prospects for greater fiscal spending) will have helped offset some of the dampening impact of global trade tensions, while trade data will be assessed for tariff impact.

In APAC, rate cuts are on the table as central banks in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Malaysia weigh up prospects amid US trade uncertainties. The deflationary impact of US trade policies has been especially evident in mainland China, according to PMI data, drawing focus on the upcoming consumer price data to be released in the week.

Finally, the S&P Global Investment Manager Index for June will gauge appetite for risk and equity market preferences. amid the changing political and economic environment. Read May's IMI, which showed easing risk aversion, here.

The outlook for US interest rates will come under scrutiny via the publication of FOMC meeting minutes, which saw rates on hold in June, a decision in line with recent PMI data.

UK GDP growth is expected to have improved in May after a disappointing 0.3% decline in April.

What to watch in the coming week

Americas: Fed minutes; Mexico and Brazil inflation; Canada labour market data

Minutes from the June US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be published midweek for insights into the Fed's thoughts after they kept interest rates unchanged. Criteria for the Fed to resume lowering rates will continue to be sought via the minutes with market expectations pointing to a September move currently, though with Fed Chair Powell having notably not ruled out rate cuts at any meeting.

Inflation data out of Mexico and Brazil will also be closely watched amid ongoing tariff impact, while Canada updates its labour market data for June. This followed early indications of subdued labour conditions in the manufacturing sector, according to the Canada Manufacturing PMI, linked largely to trade disruptions.

EMEA: UK GDP and house prices; German trade figures

The UK publishes monthly GDP data for May with early PMI data having indicated that tax hikes and tariffs had weighed on the UK economy midway through the second quarter, but that growth has started to revive from April's low, with services growth notably rising to a ten-month high in June.

Germany's industrial production and trade figures will also be in focus with the PMI revealing improvements in goods trade over May and June, though this is set against a backdrop of subdued eurozone and global conditions.

Final June inflation data out of Germany, Italy and France are also anticipated, as well as industrial production numbers from various European economies and eurozone retail sales numbers.

APAC: RBA, RBNZ, BoK, BNM meetings; mainland China inflation and trade data; Singapore GDP

Central bank meetings in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Malaysia unfold in the new week with rate cuts on the table, according to market expectations amidst ongoing trade uncertainties.

On the data front, key releases from mainland China include inflation and trade numbers, with the latest Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI indicating improvements in manufacturing sector conditions as pressures from trade eased. Singapore also updates advance GDP data for the second quarter, serving as a bellwether for the APAC region.

Kroger made the commitment to appease regulators at a time when the merger is facing a federal court challenge, two state lawsuits and a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) administrative trial, according to the report.

The merger has also been criticized by elected officials and unions, who have said that the deal could lead to higher prices and lower wages, per the report.

Kroger and Albertsons have also said that they would increase worker wages by $1 billion and improve Albertsons stores with a $1.3 billion investment, according to the report.

In the past, Kroger has fulfilled similar commitments in connection with other transactions, the report said. It spent more than $100 million to cut prices on products after acquiring Roundy’s in 2015 and invested $125 million in lowering prices following its purchase of Harris Teeter a decade ago.

Kroger announced its planned $24.6 billion merger with Albertsons in October 2022, saying the deal would boost its capabilities.

“As a combined entity, we will be better positioned to advance Kroger’s successful go-to-market strategy by providing an incredible seamless shopping experience, expanding Our Brands portfolio, and … we’ll also be able to further enhance technology and innovation,” Kroger Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen said at the time in a statement.

“Customers look to us to provide high-quality, affordable groceries — particularly today,” they wrote. “At Kroger, our business strategy is to lower prices year over year, attracting more customers and earning their loyalty.”

In February, the FTC announced its intention to sue to prevent the merger, asserting that the proposed union would likely lead to increased prices for consumers and diminished wages for workers.",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kroger-Albertsons.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 05:02:10.427199

BECK and SUSAN HAIGH,,,,,https://www.960theref.com/news/health/rural-hospitals/OAW4O4J5MFHO3OEXFC2ZKNMRVU/,"More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.
President Donald Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers.
But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total.
Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.
“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,"" Cochran-McClain said.","OMAHA, Neb. — (AP) — Tyler Sherman, a nurse at a rural Nebraska hospital, is used to the area's aging farmers delaying care until they end up in his emergency room.

Now, with Congress planning around $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, he fears those farmers and the more than 3,000 residents of Webster County could lose not just the ER, but also the clinic and nursing home tied to the hospital.

“Our budget is pretty heavily reliant on the Medicaid reimbursement, so if we do see a cut of that, it’ll be difficult to keep the doors open,” said Sherman, who works at Webster County Community Hospital in the small Nebraska town of Red Cloud just north of the Kansas border.

If those facilities close, many locals would see their five-minute trip to Webster County hospital turn into a nearly hour-long ride to the nearest hospital offering the same services.

“That's a long way for an emergency,” Sherman said. “Some won't make it.”

States and rural health advocacy groups warn that cutting Medicaid — a program serving millions of low-income and disabled Americans — would hit already fragile rural hospitals hard and could force hundreds to close, stranding some people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.

More than 300 hospitals could be at risk for closure under the Republican bill, according to an analysis by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which tracks rural hospital closures. Even as Congress haggled over the controversial bill, a health clinic in the southwest Nebraska town of Curtis announced Wednesday it will close in the coming months, in part blaming the anticipated Medicaid cuts.

Bruce Shay, of Pomfret, Connecticut, fears he and his wife could be among those left in the lurch. At 70, they're both in good health, he said. But that likely means that if either needs to go to a hospital, “it's going to be an emergency.”

Day Kimball Hospital is nearby in Putnam, but it has faced recent financial challenges. Day Kimball's CEO R. Kyle Kramer acknowledged that a Senate bill passed Tuesday — estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years — would further hurt his rural hospital's bottom line. Roughly 30% of Day Kimball's current patients receive Medicaid benefits, a figure that's even higher for specific, critical services like obstetrics and behavioral health.

“An emergency means I’m 45 minutes to an hour away from the nearest hospital, and that’s a problem,"" Shay said. And he and his wife wouldn't be the only ones having to make that trip.

“You’ve got, I’m sure, thousands of people who rely on Day Kimball Hospital. If it closed, thousands of people would have to go to another hospital,” he said. “That’s a huge load to suddenly impose on a hospital system that’s probably already stretched thin.”

Rural hospitals have long operated on the financial edge, especially in recent years as Medicaid payments have continuously fallen below the actual cost to provide health care. More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.

President Donald Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers. To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs — cuts they insist only root out fraud and waste in the system.

But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total. Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.

Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals already struggle to break even, citing a recent American Hospital Association report that found that hospitals in 2023 got nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.

“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,"" Cochran-McClain said. ""Meaning that any amount of cut to a payer — especially a payer like Medicaid that makes up a significant portion of rural provider funding — is going to be consequential to the rural hospitals' ability to provide certain services or maybe even keep their doors open at the end of the day.”

A KFF report shows 36 states losing $1 billion or more over 10 years in Medicaid funding for rural areas under the Republican bill, even with the $50 billion rural fund. No state stands to lose more than Kentucky.

The report estimates the Bluegrass State would lose a whopping $12.3 billion — nearly $5 billion more than the next state on the list. That's because the bill ends Kentucky's unique Medicaid reimbursement system and reduces it to Medicare reimbursement levels.

Kentucky currently has one of the lowest Medicare reimbursement rates in the country. It also has one of the highest poverty rates, leading to a third of its population being covered by Medicaid.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat widely seen as a potential candidate for president in 2028, said the bill would close 35 hospitals in his state and pull health care coverage for 200,000 residents.

“Half of Kentucky’s kids are covered under Medicaid. They lose their coverage and you are scrambling over that next prescription,” Beshear said during an appearance on MSNBC. “This is going to impact the life of every single American negatively. It is going to hammer our economy.""

Recent data from the Phase 3 AMPLITUDE trial, presented at the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting, underscores Akeega's potential as a paradigm-shifting treatment for homologous recombination repair (HRR)-altered metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). This breakthrough positions JNJ to capitalize on the growing demand for precision oncology therapies, accelerated regulatory pathways, and the untapped commercial potential of gene-specific treatments in underserved populations.

Clinical Data: A New Standard of Care in Early-Stage Prostate Cancer

The AMPLITUDE trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) for patients with HRR-altered mHSPC. Among those with BRCA mutations (n=191), median rPFS was not reached in the Akeega arm versus 26 months for placebo (HR 0.52; p<0.0001). In the broader HRR-altered population (n=696), the median rPFS was not reached versus 29.5 months (HR 0.63; p=0.0001). The combination also reduced the risk of symptomatic progression by 50-56% across subgroups, with early trends toward improved overall survival (OS).

While side effects like anemia and hypertension were more frequent in the Akeega group (75% vs. 59% grade 3/4 AEs), treatment discontinuations remained low (14.7% vs. 10.3%), suggesting manageable toxicity. These results validate the synergistic efficacy of combining a PARP inhibitor (niraparib) with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (abiraterone), which targets both DNA repair defects and hormonal drivers of prostate cancer.

Market Opportunity: Early Intervention and Precision Medicine

Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in men, with mHSPC representing a critical early treatment window. Current therapies like androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and taxanes delay progression but lack targeted mechanisms for HRR-altered subgroups, which account for ~15-20% of mHSPC cases. Akeega's ability to delay symptomatic progression and extend rPFS in this high-risk population creates a compelling rationale for earlier, precision-guided treatment.

The global prostate cancer market is projected to exceed $25 billion by 2030, driven by aging populations and rising adoption of genetic testing. For Akeega, the addressable market includes not only newly diagnosed mHSPC patients with HRR alterations but also those with BRCA mutations, who already benefit from Akeega in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). With genetic testing becoming standard in prostate cancer care, J&J is well-positioned to capture this niche through its leadership in PARP/ARPI combinations.

Regulatory and Commercial Strategy: Acceleration and Pricing Power

J&J submitted Akeega for EMA approval in July 2025, building on its existing mCRPC indication. The agency's prioritized review of therapies for unmet medical needs—combined with the AMPLITUDE data's robustness—supports an accelerated timeline, with a potential decision by early 2026. In the U.S., a rolling FDA submission is expected by year-end.

Pricing will be a key factor in Akeega's success. Given its first-in-class status for HRR-altered mHSPC and life-extending benefits, Akeega could command a premium over standard therapies like Xtandi (pembrolisant) or Nubeqa (darolutamide). J&J's ability to secure favorable pricing in Europe and the U.S., supported by cost-effectiveness data from delayed progression and reduced symptom burden, could translate to high-margin revenue streams.

Investment Thesis: A First-Mover Advantage in a Growing Space

Akeega's data positions J&J to dominate a segment of the prostate cancer market where no competing PARP/ARPI combination exists. Key drivers of upside include:

- First-to-market advantage: Akeega's early-stage application in mHSPC offers a competitive edge over later-line treatments.

- High unmet need: HRR-altered patients have limited options and poor outcomes with current therapies.

- Scalable market: Expanding genetic testing will identify more eligible patients, while Akeega's safety profile supports long-term use.

While J&J's stock has lagged broader markets due to macroeconomic pressures, Akeega's regulatory progress and oncology pipeline momentum (e.g., Lynparza, Erleada) could reaccelerate growth. Analysts estimate Akeega's peak sales at $2.5–3.5 billion, driven by its dual approvals in mHSPC and mCRPC. With a current P/E ratio of ~18x (vs. 24x for peers like Roche), JNJ remains undervalued relative to its oncology growth potential.

Risks and Considerations

Safety concerns: Higher AE rates in the Akeega arm may limit uptake if real-world data shows increased toxicity.

Competitor responses: Pfizer and Astellas (Xtandi) may seek label expansions or combination therapies to counter Akeega.

Regulatory hurdles: While the EMA is likely to approve Akeega, final OS data could impact long-term adoption.

Conclusion: A Buy on JNJ with an Overweight Rating

Akeega's AMPLITUDE data marks a pivotal moment for precision oncology in prostate cancer. By targeting early-stage HRR-altered patients, J&J is redefining treatment paradigms and securing a high-margin niche in a multi-billion-dollar market. With accelerated regulatory paths and robust pricing power, Akeega is poised to drive oncology revenue growth for years. Investors should view dips in JNJ's stock as buying opportunities, as the company's leadership in PARP/ARPI combinations and expanding precision medicine pipeline positions it to outperform in 2025 and beyond.",,N,,2025-07-04 07:05:05.984296

Brands quickly discover that retail media participation isn't really optional if they want to maintain favorable relationships with these retailers.
Smaller brands get priced out, reducing competitive pressure on retail media networks to justify their costs or improve ad performance.
Understanding how retail media advertising influences these journeys requires cross-device tracking capabilities that simply don't exist when platforms operate in isolation.
The technical maze that prevents scaling Managing retail media campaigns isn't just operationally complex—it's technically nightmarish.","Last month, we spoke with a marketing director at a major consumer goods brand who was drowning in retail media complexity. ""I spend half my day just trying to figure out which platform to blame for our terrible return on ad spend,"" she confessed. ""Amazon DSP shows 4.2x ROAS, Walmart Connect claims 3.8x, but when I look at our actual sales numbers, nothing adds up. It's like every platform lives in its own universe.""

She's not alone. Despite retail media's explosive growth trajectory—projected to reach a staggering $166 billion in 2025, up from just $46 billion in 2023—marketers are discovering that success in this channel requires navigating a labyrinth of operational nightmares and strategic pitfalls that make traditional digital advertising look simple by comparison.

The promise is intoxicating. Platforms like Amazon DSP, Walmart Connect, Instacart Ads, Target, Kroger, and specialized retailers like Chewy's offer unprecedented targeting precision using first-party purchase data. The reality? Most brands find themselves trapped in a system where the house always wins, and achieving consistent ad performance feels like solving a puzzle where someone keeps changing the rules.

The fundamental power shift that changed everything

Here's what happened: retailers got tired of being middlemen. They looked at their first-party data goldmine—every search, every click, every purchase—and realized they were sitting on advertising's holy grail while watching Google and Facebook print money. So they decided to become media companies themselves.

""It's like letting the referee play for one of the teams,"" observes Scott Reinders, COO of Connect, and his analogy cuts to the heart of retail media's biggest problem. Retailers now simultaneously serve as marketplace gatekeepers, data custodians, advertising platforms, and increasingly, direct competitors to the brands paying for ads.

This isn't your typical conflict of interest. Amazon doesn't just sell ads—it uses advertiser-funded data to identify successful products for its private-label development. That supplement brand is spending thousands on Amazon DSP? Their performance data might inform Amazon's next AmazonBasics product launch. Walmart Connect doesn't just provide targeting capabilities—it can strategically promote Great Value products over national brands, even when those brands are paying premium prices for placement.

The power imbalance extends beyond data usage. Brands quickly discover that retail media participation isn't really optional if they want to maintain favorable relationships with these retailers. Reduce your ad spend on Target's platform, and you might find your products mysteriously getting less favorable shelf placement. Skip Kroger's media opportunities, and suddenly your promotional calendar negotiations become more difficult.

Consider what this means for ROAS calculations. Traditional advertising allows brands to optimize purely for performance—if Facebook ads aren't delivering, you shift budget to Google. In retail media, pulling budget from an underperforming platform risks damaging your entire supplier relationship with that retailer. You're not just optimizing for ad efficiency; you're managing a complex web of commercial dependencies.

The fragmentation nightmare that's driving marketers insane

If you think managing Google and Facebook campaigns is complex, try running campaigns across Amazon DSP, Walmart Connect, Instacart Ads, Target, Kroger, and Chewy's simultaneously. Each platform operates like an independent country with its own language, currency, and customs.

Amazon DSP requires a deep understanding of sponsored product campaigns, keyword bidding strategies, and their complex attribution models. Walmart Connect operates with entirely different auction dynamics, creative specifications, and optimization approaches. Target's advertising ecosystem emphasizes different metrics and requires separate expertise. Instacart Ads focuses heavily on basket-building and immediate purchase intent with its own unique measurement philosophy. Kroger's platform prioritizes different customer touchpoints, while Chewy's specialized audience demands pet-specific optimization strategies.

The knowledge transfer between platforms is essentially zero. Becoming an expert on Amazon DSP tells you nothing about succeeding on Walmart Connect. Master Instacart Ads, and you're still starting from scratch when you tackle Target's system. Each platform requires months of experimentation to achieve basic competency, and just when marketers think they've figured things out, algorithm updates reset their expertise.

The operational overhead is staggering. A marketing team managing five retail media networks needs separate campaign setups, different creative assets with varying specifications, distinct keyword research for each platform's search behavior, independent budget management systems, and completely different optimization strategies. It's like speaking five different languages fluently while simultaneously solving separate complex mathematical equations.

This fragmentation forces difficult strategic choices. Do you spread resources thin across multiple platforms and achieve mediocre ad performance everywhere? Or do you concentrate on a few networks and accept that you're missing opportunities? Most brands end up with a patchwork approach that satisfies no one and optimizes nothing.

The pricing opacity that makes budget planning impossible

Here's where retail media gets really frustrating: pricing that feels designed to prevent meaningful comparison or optimization. Unlike Google or Facebook, where auction dynamics create transparent, market-driven pricing, retail media operates more like an exclusive nightclub where the cover charge changes based on who's asking.

""Without competition or industry benchmarks, it's a 'take it or leave it' scenario for many brands,"" explains Reinders. Retailers bundle advertising opportunities with complex arrangements that might include premium homepage placements, sponsored product positions, display advertising, in-store promotional elements, and mysterious ""optimization fees"" that appear without explanation.

Try calculating accurate return on ad spend when one retailer charges $15 CPM for search placements while another charges $22 CPM for seemingly identical inventory. Add seasonal pricing fluctuations that can increase costs by 300-500% during peak periods, and budget planning becomes nearly impossible. The marketing director I mentioned earlier spent three months trying to understand why her Amazon DSP costs doubled between October and November, only to discover buried seasonal multipliers that no one had explained.

Smaller brands face even starker realities. ""Retailers can only really extract value from major brands. For challenger brands, covering normal rebates, listings, and promotions is all we can do,"" explains Paul Raphaely, director at food brand NOMU. When retailers suggest $50,000 media packages, he often has ""no choice but to say, 'Maybe later.' It's too expensive, and offers nothing unique to us.""

This pricing dynamic creates a vicious cycle. Only large brands with substantial budgets can afford meaningful retail media participation, which gives retailers less incentive to improve transparency or efficiency. Smaller brands get priced out, reducing competitive pressure on retail media networks to justify their costs or improve ad performance.

The data prison that makes optimization nearly impossible

Perhaps the most strategically damaging aspect of retail media complexity is what I call the ""data prison""—each platform jealously guards customer information and provides reporting only within its own ecosystem. This creates information silos that make calculating true return on ad spend nearly impossible and prevent the kind of holistic optimization that drives advertising efficiency.

""Retailers might provide basic metrics like impressions and clicks but withhold granular sales attribution data,"" explains Reinders. ""This makes it hard for brands to calculate true ROI."" The limitation extends far beyond simple performance metrics. Marketers cannot understand customer journey patterns across platforms, implement sophisticated attribution modeling, or even prevent over-exposing customers to the same advertisements across multiple networks.

Picture this common scenario: a customer searches for protein powder on Amazon, clicks a sponsored ad, researches the brand's products, then compares prices on Target's website, reads reviews on Walmart, and ultimately purchases through Instacart Ads while grocery shopping. Amazon DSP claims credit for the conversion using its attribution model. Target counts it as influenced traffic. Walmart might include it in brand awareness metrics. Instacart Ads gets the last-click attribution. The brand pays all four platforms while having no idea which actually drove the sale.

This attribution chaos makes meaningful ROAS optimization impossible. Marketers find themselves drowning in disconnected spreadsheets, manually attempting to aggregate ad performance data from dozens of sources. They're flying blind, making budget allocation decisions based on incomplete information while each platform insists its numbers tell the complete story.

The customer journey complexity intensifies when considering cross-device behavior. Customers research on mobile, compare on desktop, and purchase in-store or through apps. Understanding how retail media advertising influences these journeys requires cross-device tracking capabilities that simply don't exist when platforms operate in isolation.

The technical maze that prevents scaling

Managing retail media campaigns isn't just operationally complex—it's technically nightmarish. Each platform has unique API structures, data formatting requirements, and automation capabilities that make building unified management systems extraordinarily difficult.

While Amazon DSP offers relatively robust automation tools, many retail networks provide limited API access or require manual campaign management. This inconsistency means marketing teams cannot apply standardized workflows across their retail media portfolio, creating operational inefficiencies that prevent achieving optimal ad efficiency.

The definitional chaos around metrics compounds technical challenges. Amazon DSP might measure return on ad spend using a 14-day attribution window while including subscription sign-ups in conversion calculations. Walmart Connect could report ROAS with a 7-day window focusing purely on immediate purchases. Target might measure success through incremental lift studies. Instacart Ads emphasizes basket impact metrics. Comparing performance across these platforms becomes meaningless when everyone uses different math.

This is where technology solutions like RMIQ become essential. RMIQ is an AI-powered cross-retail media network ad performance and campaign management platform that addresses the fragmentation nightmare by providing unified campaign management across multiple retail networks. Instead of managing separate dashboards for Amazon DSP, Walmart Connect, Target, Kroger, Instacart Ads, and Chewy's, brands can use RMIQ's artificial intelligence to optimize campaigns automatically while providing standardized reporting that makes meaningful performance comparison possible.

The platform's AI-driven approach enables automated budget reallocation based on real-time performance data across all networks, identifies optimization opportunities that human managers might miss, and provides the kind of cross-platform insights that have been historically impossible to achieve. For brands managing campaigns across dozens of retail networks, RMIQ's technology can mean the difference between profitable growth and drowning in operational complexity.

The inventory scarcity that limits scaling

Unlike Google or Facebook, which can theoretically create unlimited advertising inventory, retail media networks have finite inventory tied to their specific customer traffic patterns. Premium placements—homepage carousels, search result sponsorships, category page takeovers—cannot be expanded regardless of advertiser demand or willingness to pay for improved ad performance.

This scarcity creates intense competition that varies dramatically across platforms and seasons. A pet supplement brand might find abundant, affordable inventory on Amazon DSP but face prohibitive costs on Target's general retail platform. However, that same brand could discover that Chewy's specialized pet audience offers superior ROAS at reasonable costs, but with extremely limited scale potential.

Seasonal inventory fluctuations compound planning challenges. During peak shopping periods like Black Friday or back-to-school seasons, inventory costs can increase 300-500% while availability simultaneously decreases. Marketers must constantly adjust strategies based on inventory availability rather than pure performance optimization, making consistent ad efficiency nearly impossible to maintain.

Successful campaigns cannot simply be scaled by increasing budgets like traditional digital advertising. A campaign generating excellent return on ad spend might hit inventory ceilings where additional investment doesn't translate to proportional reach increases because maximum available inventory has been purchased.

How smart brands are fighting back

Despite overwhelming complexity, sophisticated brands are developing strategies to navigate retail media more effectively while protecting their interests and maximizing return on ad spend.

The most successful approach involves building comprehensive commercial partnerships that extend beyond simple advertising relationships. Smart brands negotiate media packages as part of broader trade deals, bundling advertising spend with promotional support, inventory commitments, and category management partnerships. This approach provides leverage in pricing negotiations and reduces vulnerability to arbitrary treatment that might impact ad performance.

Data-driven brands are pushing back aggressively by demanding clearer performance metrics, ROAS guarantees, and greater transparency in pricing and inventory allocation. ""The more data-driven brands become, the better they can justify—or challenge—the spend,"" observes Reinders. This requires investing heavily in analytics capabilities that can provide independent verification of retail media effectiveness.

Technology solutions are becoming essential for managing operational complexity at scale. Beyond RMIQ, emerging platforms use artificial intelligence to normalize performance data across networks, identify optimization opportunities, and automate routine campaign management tasks. These solutions help level the playing field by providing smaller brands access to sophisticated optimization capabilities previously available only to companies with substantial technical resources.

Relationship building remains crucial for securing favorable treatment and inventory access. Brands investing in understanding retailer priorities, seasonal planning cycles, and strategic objectives often achieve better terms and premium inventory access despite limited budgets.

Looking ahead: evolution or revolution?

The projected growth to $166 billion suggests retail media's challenges won't slow platform expansion but will accelerate solution development. Competition among retail networks for advertiser investment will likely drive improvements in transparency, measurement capabilities, and advertiser-friendly terms.

Regulatory scrutiny is increasing around data usage, competitive practices, and transparency requirements. As retail media becomes a larger advertising component, regulators may implement clearer pricing disclosure requirements, data portability standards, and protection against anti-competitive practices that currently limit advertiser success.

Consumer privacy concerns and regulatory changes will continue shaping platform development, potentially limiting data collection capabilities while increasing consent requirements. These changes may actually benefit retail media networks that rely on first-party data compared to traditional platforms dependent on third-party data sources.

The technological sophistication of platforms will continue advancing rapidly. Amazon DSP, Walmart Connect, Target, Kroger, Instacart Ads, and others will likely invest heavily in improving programmatic capabilities and API functionalities to attract larger advertiser investments and compete more effectively for budget allocation.

The reality check every marketer needs

Retail media marketing represents more than operational challenges—it reflects a fundamental transformation in advertising power dynamics that requires new approaches to strategy, execution, and measurement. The technical difficulties of managing fragmented platforms are significant, but the strategic challenges around retailer control and competitive conflicts represent even more profound shifts that brands must navigate carefully.

Success requires developing competencies that extend beyond traditional advertising expertise to encompass relationship management, data analysis, technology integration, and strategic negotiation. Brands that thrive will balance retail media's targeting opportunities with risks created by retailer control and competitive dynamics.

The future lies not just in solving technical fragmentation through platforms like RMIQ, but in creating more balanced relationships between retailers and brands that recognize mutual value creation while protecting against exploitative practices. This requires industry cooperation, regulatory oversight, and continued advertiser pressure for fair, transparent practices.

As retail media networks continue rapid expansion and technological development, brands must remain vigilant about protecting their interests while capitalizing on genuine opportunities these platforms provide. The key is developing strategies that acknowledge inherent complexity while building capabilities that can adapt to continued evolution.

The retail media revolution is far from over. Brands that learn to navigate its complexities effectively—leveraging advanced technology solutions while maintaining focus on ad performance optimization—will capture significant competitive advantages in an increasingly digital marketplace. But success will require more than just technological solutions; it demands strategic thinking, operational excellence, and continuous adaptation to an advertising landscape that shows no signs of becoming simpler anytime soon.",https://images.financialcontent.com/investcenter/favicon.svg,N,,2025-07-04 02:58:51.508685

The 1,610-FEU shortfall led Dollar General to either seek service from other sources at higher freight rates, or skip shipments entirely.
One such 14-week stretch from August to October resulted in Yang Ming failing to meet the complainant’s forecasted volumes in 11 out of 14 weeks.","Dollar General is seeking $14.8 million in damages from Yang Ming on the grounds that the ocean carrier allegedly failed to provide the retailer with the sufficient cargo space agreed upon ahead of a yearlong contract.

In a complaint filed with the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) on Tuesday, the discount retailer said the Taiwanese container shipping firm did not meet its minimum quantity commitment of freight to be shipped from May 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022, which would be a violation of the Shipping Act of 1984.

During this time, the retailer said the logistics company instead allocated its intended space to higher-priced cargo from other shippers.

As a result, Dollar General was forced to obtain space on the spot market “at enormous expense” during a period of “unprecedented high spot market prices.” In October 2021, ocean spot freight rates soared above $10,000 per 40-foot equivalent unit (FEU), according to Drewry’s World Container Index (WCI). The same container on average would be worth $2,812 as of Thursday.

Under the service contract, Yang Ming was required to provide enough capacity to store 2,226 FEUs on its vessels for the year, corresponding to an average monthly allocation of 185.5 FEUs. Dollar General alleged that the deal required the carrier to offer weekly container space at a level “not less than 130 percent” of the weekly prorated portion of that minimum commitment.

The requirement was contingent on Dollar General providing forecasts four weeks ahead of the scheduled shipping time.

However, Yang Ming provided only approximately 616 FEUs of space to the dollar store throughout the year, amounting to 73 percent less space than originally committed.

The 1,610-FEU shortfall led Dollar General to either seek service from other sources at higher freight rates, or skip shipments entirely.

One such 14-week stretch from August to October resulted in Yang Ming failing to meet the complainant’s forecasted volumes in 11 out of 14 weeks.

Yang Ming has already been alleged to have failed to meet service commitments by both Bed Bath & Beyond ahead of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as well as former home decor wholesaler NBG Home.

The carrier isn’t the only one that has been the subject of a shipper complaint stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic era, with Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) embroiled in its own legal battle with Bed Bath & Beyond on allegations of similar service commitment breaches.

Most recently, QVC and subsidiary Cornerstone Brands filed a complaint with the FMC against Ocean Network Express (ONE) on similar accusations. The plaintiffs allege that ONE failed to meet service minimums agreed upon within their contract, and that they were passed over for higher-priced cargo space bought on the spot market.

The Dollar General complaint pointed to Yang Ming’s alleged transgressions impacting numerous other shippers in 2021, noting that the company only accommodated 48 percent of the BCO (beneficial cargo owner) volume that it had previously committed to for the 2021 shipping year.

“Yang Ming’s representatives offered shifting explanations, initially claiming unavailability of space due to congestion and blank sailings, but later admitting that the lack of cargo space allocation was coming from Yang Ming’s headquarters,” the complaint said, also noting that the company’s U.S.-based representatives “were also very frustrated with their leadership,” and that “their hands were tied.”

Uber Freight named as second-largest creditor in Del Monte bankruptcy

As the ocean carrier remains under scrutiny, another logistics giant is awaiting a payout of its own from a customer falling into bankruptcy.

Uber Freight is owed $9.1 million in unsecured claims from canned foods company Del Monte Foods, which filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. In the Chapter 11 filing, the transportation and logistics services provider was listed as the second-largest unsecured creditor after packaged fruits and vegetables provider Seneca Foods Corporation, which is owed $19.9 million.

Saddle Creek Logistics, the 14th-largest unsecured creditor, is owed $1.35 million for warehousing support, while CHEP USA still must claim $470,000 related to its pooled pallet services.

“Del Monte has been a valued customer of Uber Freight for many years. We are proud to serve a critical role to Del Monte’s business and remain committed to supporting them through this court-supervised restructuring process,” Uber Freight said in a statement. While the filing includes pre-petition balances, we’re confident those obligations will be addressed appropriately through the bankruptcy process. As a critical vendor of Del Monte, we are confident we will receive full payment for services rendered, and we remain focused on delivering uninterrupted support as a trusted, long-term logistics partner.”

There is no guarantee Uber Freight and the other creditors see a full recovery, with the final total depending on what the court approves during the reorganization process.

The news follows management’s disclosure in April of intentions to eliminate 20,000 front-line positions as part of a broader effort to cut excess capacity and improve profits. UPS’s (NYSE: UPS) network optimization plan, called Network of the Future, envisions closing 200 sortation centers over five years and increasing automation for handling packages. Dozens of facilities have already been consolidated in the past year.

Package drivers would “receive a generous financial package if they choose to leave UPS” on top of earned retirement benefits, including pension and healthcare, the parcel freight company said in a statement Thursday. “As we navigate an unprecedented business landscape, we are executing the largest network reconfiguration in UPS history” and need to similarly adjust headcount, the company explained.

Parcel volumes are under pressure from a variety of headwinds, including Trump administration tariffs that have slowed imports and a January decision to reduce Amazon business by 50% over 18 months because so much of it is unprofitable.

UPS’s voluntary severance plan angered the Teamsters union, which says the Atlanta-based company is obligated to create 30,000 jobs under a five-year contract ratified in August 2023, which forestalled a nationwide strike. It urged members to reject the buyout offer.

“UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts in front of Teamsters drivers. It is an illegal violation of our national contract,” said Teamsters President Sean O’Brien in a news release. “UPS is obligated to establish tens of thousands of new full-time jobs under the agreement. But CEO Carol Tomé and UPS’s corporate managers are hoping that if they offer paltry severance packages to enough workers, no one will notice the company is setting the union’s contract on fire. UPS Teamsters work too damn hard to be treated with such disrespect.”

Teamster contracts enable UPS drivers employed 30 years or more to receive employer-paid health care throughout retirement, a benefit that would not be guaranteed to all workers under UPS’s severance plan, according to the union. The current contract calls for UPS to elevate 22,500 part-time workers to full-time positions and create another 7,500 positions.

“We have approached the Teamsters on this topic and remain committed to the agreements we reached in 2023,” UPS said.

The Teamsters, which represents 340,000 UPS workers, last week accused UPS of failing to comply with the hiring requirement and a commitment to provide 28,000 air conditioned package cars and vans for heat relief in many parts of the country. It requested data from UPS on the status of open positions, as well as the delivery rate for vehicles equipped with air conditioning. The Teamsters gave the company until July 1 to provide answers, but the company has requested additional time to respond, the union said.

“Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. The Teamsters are prepared to fight UPS on every front with every available resource to shut down this illegal buyout program,” O’Brien said. “UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments, just as Teamsters do every day, reliably delivering packages to hundreds of millions of Americans. Profits are not more important than people, not at UPS or any other employer.”

UPS executives said during April’s earnings presentation that the company expects to save more than $1.2 billion this year by eliminating 25 million operating hours across the workforce. A similar amount in semi-variable cost reductions are estimated from the reduction of 20,000 employees.

The company is building a new production facility that will set new standards and, once completed, become one of the world’s largest production sites for DNA- and RNA-based active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). This positions BioSpring as a key economic driver in Hesse and in one of the fastest-growing segments of the biotech industry.

Minister President Boris Rhein praises BioSpring’s expansion: “BioSpring exemplifies the qualities that define Hesse as a hub for business and technology: world-class research, highly skilled jobs, and investments that drive long-term value creation. Expansions of this kind are essential to enhancing competitiveness and reinforcing Hesse’s leading position in the field of biotechnology. The fact that BioSpring, one of the global leaders in its industry, is headquartered in Hesse is a major asset for the region,” said Minister President Boris Rhein.

Felix Schwenke, Mayor of Offenbach: “BioSpring is not relocating from one city to another. BioSpring is creating entirely new jobs here. That’s not just good news for Offenbach but for the entire region. For the people of Offenbach, it's particularly positive that BioSpring and the city agreed to make this growth happen right here on the Innovation Campus. For the first time, Offenbach will become a serious hub for globally significant biotechnology. Given that biotech is relatively crisis-resilient, this is a major building block in strengthening Offenbach as an economic location and making it future-ready.”

Dr. Sylvia Wojczewski, CEO of BioSpring: “With our investment in Offenbach, we are setting new standards in nucleic acid drug substance manufacturing,” explained Wojczewski. “In the future, we’ll be able to produce nucleic acids for therapeutic applications on a ton scale. This allows us to support our clients’ growth by offering new high-volume capacity. The investment underscores our position as a global leading industrial manufacturer of synthetic nucleic acids.”

The new building complex will include three interconnected structures: a manufacturing and warehouse facility, an office area for quality control and production teams, and a glass atrium designed for events. An external solvent tank farm will also be built. Production will be conducted under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) conditions, a quality standard that ensures the highest levels of product quality, purity, and safety. In total, the complex will offer over 15,200 m² (approx. 164,000 ft²) of gross floor area and will employ around 200 people. In the long term, BioSpring aims to create additional jobs at the Innovation Campus in Offenbach. The investment amounts to several hundred million euros, with completion planned for the end of 2027.

“The city of Offenbach has supported our project from day one, from every level of staff up to the mayor himself. Even in challenging moments, everyone has been focused on finding solutions. We feel reassured in our decision to choose Offenbach,” said Wojczewski, also commending the regional government office in Darmstadt for their professional collaboration.

With nearly three decades of experience, BioSpring is a leading company and commercial provider specializing in the manufacturing and analysis of therapeutic nucleic acids, particularly oligonucleotides, from small preclinical quantities to full-scale commercial production. These short, synthetically produced RNA sequences hold the potential for groundbreaking new therapies, including treatments for cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. They also offer entirely new therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of rare genetic disorders—potentially enabling the complete cure of diseases that were previously considered incurable.

Union members were urging the grocery giant to address key demands such as better staffing levels, livable wages and the protection of workers’ health and pension benefits.

Safeway employees, who have been on strike for over two weeks because of stalled negotiations, are also seeking the same demands.

Members of Local 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers labor union had previously authorized a strike if a deal could not be reached. No specific details of the proposed agreement were released, although union officials said it includes higher wages, additional pension contributions and improvements in health, welfare and staffing.

“This victory wouldn’t have been possible without the power of our collective action,” according to a statement from the United Food and Commercial Workers’ union negotiating committee. “We stood strong against the companies’ disrespect and made it clear that we were ready to fight for the contract we deserve. Today proves that when workers stand together, we win.

“We look forward to sharing and discussing the details of this agreement with our co-workers before we make our voices heard during the voting process.”

There was no immediate response to a request for comment from Kroger — the parent company of Ralphs — or Albertsons, which also owns Pavilions and Vons.

It was unclear when union members would hold a ratification vote. Union officials said details of the tentative agreement would be shared with union members during upcoming meetings.

The union’s previous contract expired on March 2. The union announced June 11 that its members had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has published an active recall notice that affects multiple Kraft Heinz Oscar Mayer turkey bacon products.

It is feared that over 360,000 pounds of the products may be contaminated with the potentially life-threatening Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. Here’s what you need to know about the nationwide recall.

What is the reason for the turkey bacon recall?

According to the recall notice posted by the FSIS, the recall is being initiated after laboratory testing at the Kraft Heinz establishment that produces the turkey bacon products, indicating the products could be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

What turkey bacon products are being recalled?

This recall covers three products. The notice states that approximately 367,812 pounds of the three products are being recalled.

Where was the recalled product sold?

The FSIS notice confirms that the recalled products were sold at retail locations nationwide in America.

Additionally, some of the products were exported to Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands.

When was the recalled product sold?

The turkey bacon products that are being recalled were produced from April 24 through June 11 and so were sold after the originating April date.

As noted above, the use by dates for the affected products stretch from July to September, meaning customers may still have the products in their refrigerators or freezers.

What is Listeria?

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Listeria is a genus of bacteria that can cause severe illness in infected individuals. In the United States, about 1,600 people are known to be infected every year.

But what’s worrying about Listeria infections is that they have a high fatality rate. A Listeria infection is the third leading cause of death from a foodborne illness in the U.S., says the CDC. Listeria infections kill around 260 people in the U.S. every year.

Have the recalled turkey bacon products harmed anyone?

Thankfully, the FSIS notice says that so far, there have been no confirmed reports of people having adverse reactions due to consuming the recalled turkey bacon products.

What are the symptoms of a Listeria infection?

According to the FSIS, a Listeria infection, known as Listeriosis, can cause a number of symptoms, including:

fever

muscle aches

headache

stiff neck

confusion

loss of balance

convulsions

The above symptoms can sometimes be preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, according to the FSIS.

If a person is pregnant, they can be particularly vulnerable to Listeriosis, which can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, and other complications. Older adults and people with weakened immune systems are also at greater risk of more serious complications.

What do I do if I have the recalled turkey bacon products?

The FSIS says consumers who have the products in their possession should not consume them. Instead, the products should be taken back to their place of purchase for a refund or disposed of.

What to do

Denver7 found some shoppers at the Thornton Parkway location were willing to cross picket lines. 87-year-old Ron Davis, a former union member, had sympathy for the picketers.

“I feel for them. Today's cost of living is killing us all,” Davis said.

As hybrid work becomes the new normal, enterprises are prioritizing tools that blend seamless collaboration, security, and productivity. HP Inc., long synonymous with printers and PCs, is making a bold bet that its pivot toward AI-driven productivity solutions will position it as a leader in this evolving landscape. While its Q2 2025 earnings revealed near-term margin pressures, the company's strategic investments in hybrid work infrastructure and AI-integrated hardware/software stacks suggest a compelling long-term narrative for investors. Let's dissect the data and the strategy to determine whether HP is building a sustainable moat in this space—or if it's overestimating its ability to adapt.

The Hybrid Work Opportunity: HP's New Playbook

HP's recent moves underscore a clear thesis: hybrid work isn't just a temporary trend but a permanent structural shift. Its Q2 2025 earnings highlighted strong Commercial Personal Systems (PS) revenue growth (+9% YoY), driven by demand for devices like the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i and ZBook Ultra G1a, both of which integrate AI capabilities for real-time collaboration and productivity. These devices, announced at CES 2025, leverage 48 TOPS NPU performance (for the EliteBook) and AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO processors (for the ZBook) to accelerate tasks like video editing, data analysis, and virtual meetings.

The Workforce Experience Platform (WXP), launched in early 2025, further cements HP's push into software-driven solutions. This AI-powered ecosystem manages over 680,000 connected devices, processing 700GB of daily data to resolve IT issues and optimize workflows. For example, its Fleet Explorer tool allows IT teams to query device performance via natural language—“Which laptops had memory overutilization last week?”—thereby reducing downtime and improving employee satisfaction.

HP's financials tell a mixed story. While Personal Systems revenue rose 7% YoY (to $9.0B) on robust Commercial demand, Printing revenue fell 4% due to weaker supplies sales. The company's non-GAAP EPS dropped 13% to $0.71, missing estimates, as margin pressures (down to 7.3% from 8.8%) and elevated trade-related costs (e.g., U.S. tariffs) weighed on profitability.

However, the shift toward higher-margin AI-enabled devices and software services is evident. Consider:

- AI Companion software: Preloaded on new devices, it claims to boost productivity by 2x in tasks like email management and video editing.

- HP Wolf Security: AI-driven threat detection has become a key differentiator in an era where remote work expands attack surfaces.

Meanwhile, sister company Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) reported 6% YoY server revenue growth to $4.1B, fueled by AI data center demand. This suggests HP's broader ecosystem—spanning PCs, servers, and hybrid work software—is aligning to capitalize on enterprise spending on productivity tools.

Why This Matters for Investors

The hybrid work boom isn't just about laptops and printers—it's about solving the “digital friction” that plagues remote teams. HP's WXP platform addresses this directly, reducing IT bottlenecks and improving employee experience. With 68% of workers citing moderate-to-severe digital friction (per Mosaic Group), there's a clear demand for tools that streamline workflows.

HP's strategy hinges on three pillars:

1. AI-Enhanced Hardware: Devices like the EliteBook Ultra offer performance gains that justify premium pricing.

2. Software as a Service (SaaS) Integration: WXP's AI analytics and fleet management tools create recurring revenue streams.

3. Enterprise Partnerships: Collaborations with companies like Poly (for headsets) and Juniper (if the merger proceeds) could deepen its hybrid work ecosystem.

Risks and Reality Checks

Margin Pressures: HP's non-GAAP margins have dropped for five straight quarters. Cost inflation and supply chain bottlenecks remain risks.

Regulatory Headwinds: U.S.-China trade tensions and litigation (e.g., $103M SEP litigation charges in Q2) add uncertainty.

Competitor Threats: Dell's Workspace ONE and Microsoft's Viva suite offer competing hybrid work solutions.

Investment Thesis: A Buy for the Long Run?

HP's shift to AI-driven productivity tools is a calculated bet on a multi-year trend. While near-term earnings are clouded by margin contraction and macroeconomic uncertainty, the company's strategic moves—expanding its hybrid work ecosystem, reducing reliance on Printing, and leveraging AI—align with a sector poised for growth.

Buy Signal:

- If HP can stabilize margins above 7% (its Q2 non-GAAP margin) while growing Personal Systems revenue at >5% YoY, it could outperform in a hybrid work-driven IT spend cycle.

- The WXP platform's scalability (already managing 700GB/day of data) suggests untapped SaaS upside.

Hold/Wait:

- Short-term volatility persists. The Juniper merger's outcome and geopolitical risks could delay margin recovery.

Final Take

HP's pivot from a hardware company to a hybrid work solutions provider is a high-stakes gamble. The Q2 results show execution challenges, but the strategic direction is clear: invest in AI, software, and enterprise IT infrastructure. For investors willing to look past quarterly noise, HP's long-term positioning in a $2.5T hybrid work tech market could yield outsized returns. The question remains: Can HP convert its innovation into sustainable profits before the next recession hits?

The industry has been finding solutions to striking a balance between responsible AI use amid constant development with human creativity.

Tech labs and companies have developed sophisticated platforms that allow creators to make content they can only dream of in minutes, such as Midjourney and Google Veo 3. Meanwhile, developers and engineers have made solutions to ensure AI is used ethically and responsibly, including the Content Credentials and Meta’s efforts to label AI-generated content.

Australian marketers have been keen to adopt Generative AI tools, but only 8% have reached advanced maturity, leadership, planning, and deployment capability while 52% fall into the beginner category, with interest and few implementations or frameworks, according to The Australian Centre for AI in Marketing (ACAM) AI Readiness Benchmarking Report.

Mediaweek spoke to Houston Group’s Alex Creamer, Colleen Ryan from TRA, and Harry Preston of MBCS to examine the role of AI as a support tool in the creative process and its place in the future of the industry.

‘For some it’s terrifying, for others it’s tantalising’

Creative Director at Houston Group, Alex Creamer, said that AI has reshaped the industry in supporting craft, accelerating production, and replicating human creativity and interaction.

“For some it’s terrifying, for others it’s tantalising.”

He acknowledged that while AI has provided positives, such as democratising the creative industry, frictionless connections between customers and automating day-to-day work, it has the potential to damage the perceived value of creativity in both cost and skill.

Creamer noted that the future of brand and content creation is “likely somewhere in the middle.”

He said that when used ethically, Generative AI can offer new pathways of innovation and productivity often inaccessible to many and enable better work in the process.

“But the principles behind good brand building are the same – a unique POV and personality are essential, with a strong connection to people and place.

“AI may affirm, inform and support— but true originality that builds new relationships with new audiences, will still be a human endeavour,” he added.

For Colleen Ryan, Partner at insights agency TRA, human imagination born from personal and repeatedly reorganised mash-up of memory results in creativity.

“Sure, AI is ‘creative’, but it’s not idiosyncratic in the same way as human imagination. AI doesn’t dream or surprise itself. It might ‘hallucinate’ – but not in the same way as humans.

“Great brand work comes from embodied imaginative ideas, absurd and contrary juxtapositions that only an imaginative human mind could stitch together.

“Creativity is not just output generation, it’s imaginative synthesis, deeply tied to memory, subjective experience and embodied meaning – aka the human experience.”

Managing Director of MBCS, Harry Preston, said that while AI is powerful and influential, “it’s not visionary”.

“AI can help us with speed to market, better personalisation, and even provide a platform to ignite creativity – but it can’t replace gut feeling that tells you ‘This idea hits different’.

“The future of content isn’t man vs machine – it’s man with machine. AI should support creative ambition, not sterilise it.

“Brands who rely too heavily on AI risk producing homogenised content that gets lost. The bold ones will still come from people who know how to make culture, not just content.”

Using AI for good

Over-reliance on AI will have wide-ranging impacts on the industry, from creative to strategy, but Creamer highlighted “brain drain” as a lesser-discussed concerned.

“As a junior creative, I learnt so much from note-taking or sifting through competitor audits and books. If Otter or ChatGPT had been in my life then, I surely wouldn’t have had the same learning experience, or perhaps I’m just getting old.”

“Optimistically, this could lead to people developing new skills with more time to focus on innovation and creative thinking. Pessimistically, there’s a risk we cut junior roles in favour of efficiency at the top. Losing touch with new emerging demographics and ideas.”

Creamer pointed to Howatson & Co’s EXHIBIT A-I work for law firm Maurice Blackburn as a successful early work of text-to-image generation and helped tell the stories of those who can’t.

He also highlighted Publicis Groupe agency Marcel’s Les Bleues’ Highlights and how it used deepfake tech to shift the perception of women’s football.

“Brilliant human-centred ideas that used AI for good,” he added.

Transparency and owning the narrative

Can brands use AI ethically and transparently developed connection with customers? Ryan cited TRA research on Australian and New Zealand attitudes and values toward progress.

96% of people said honesty was the most important thing brands can do to help people make progress. But while people believe that AI helps companies make progress, they don’t think it helps customers as much. The report noted 13% disagreed that AI mainly benefits businesses, not consumers.

“This means the jury is still out on the promise of AI as a tool for helping customers, whether that is customer experience, better engagement, innovation or advantages in pricing,” Ryan said.

She noted that a third believe AI will help brands understand customers and help people engage with them better, while another third disagree, and the rest are undecided.

“Transparency and owning the narrative is key for brands to address this, by authentically demonstrating the value they’re passing on because of the advantages AI is giving companies.”

‘Great brand storytelling comes from truth, bravery, and a point of view’

Can brands strike a balance AI AI-generated content and authentic brand storytelling? Preston noted that automation is great at speeding up processes and streamlining mundane tasks, but can impact originality.

“People can quickly tell if a brand is being inauthentic. You can’t A/B test your way to a story that moves someone. Great brand storytelling comes from truth, bravery, and a point of view.

He noted that a brand voice needs to stand for something. Preston said: “Marketers who get this right will use automation for the everyday and save the real creativity for the moments that matter the most.”

With growing AI adoption, Preston urged brands not to chase efficiencies. He explained: “AI should serve the idea, not the other way round. The moment you let automation lead creative decisions, you risk slipping into a sea of sameness.”

He noted that brands should protect their tone of voice and creative DNA and use AI where it makes sense, such as automation and accelerating processes.

“Always ask yourself, ‘Is this making us bolder, or just quicker?’ Guardrails matter. So does taste. And while AI can do a lot, it can’t tell you when something’s iconic. That’s still a human job.”

Preston added that from an ethical perspective, transparency with colleagues, clients, and partners on how AI is used is necessary.

“Human care needs to remain in ensuring brand identity is protected, and we must avoid using AI models trained on copyrighted material to ensure original and legally compliant content.

“It’s also critical that any AI-generated content is monitored for bias. It must support fairness and inclusivity that reflects the diversity of a brand’s audience.”

Skilling up and shaping the future with AI

For all three, the future of marketing and AI is intertwined with creativity and productivity.

Ryan believes the future of AI will be in augmented imagination and using AI “as a tool to extend, not replace, our imagination and emotional nuances.”

“The human brain is only high performing in short periods, a couple of hours, for example. When we need to take a walk or whatever, our choice of defocussing is to replenish and enrich our inner life, our source of imagination.

“We might unconsciously or consciously see a beautiful and delicate butterfly juxtaposed against something harsh, triggering a memory or metaphor for an experience. In turn, this creates a unique emotional pulse.

Ryan explained that while creatives embody human experiences in short bursts of intense creativity, AI can be used to augment their work to build on their imagination.

“The challenge for creatives is in how this is executed – how can we avoid using AI for what we uniquely contribute as humans? Instead, how can we use it to feed, enhance and execute the outputs of our human imagination?”

Creamer’s outlook is “complex”. He said that AI aids the beginning stages of the creative process, such as research and planning, and automated end-of-project tasks.

But he noted that AI used from end-to-end can lack distinction and provenance in production and craft.

“Good brands make connections with their audience. The deeper meaning, craft and care in execution matters.

“The success of one-shot Netflix drama Adolescence isn’t just the acting, but in the way it was painstakingly planned and made. And Telstra’s ‘beautiful internet’ means very little if the dominoes didn’t actually fall.”

“If we use AI with integrity and to better innovation within the industry, we’ll find a balance that maximises and gives space to human-centred creativity.

“If we see it purely as a tool for efficiency and cost cutting, then our industry will look decisively different, more compact, and perhaps less original in the years to come.”

For Preston, marketers ned to watch out for falling down “the path of least resistance or become lazy.”

“With the huge pressure on marketing teams to do ‘more for less’, there’ll be a temptation to use AI and automate everything, but that’s an express path to getting lost in an already content-polluted world.”

He said the other risk is procurement finding AI-driven efficiencies and resulting in lesser investment, but believes brands who use AI wisely to free up time and money for bigger thinking will have stronger futures.

“Scale the basics and go harder on taking creative risks that earn attention in the lack of attention economy. That’s the work that people have cared about and always will care about the most. AI or no AI.”

These figures are taken from the BarthHaas Report Hops 2024/2025, the latest annual report on global developments in the beer and hop markets.

The first eleven places in the rankings remained unchanged year on year. Still leading the rankings are AB-InBev (495.5m hl), Heineken (240.7m hl) and China Res. Snow Breweries (108.8m hl). Together, these three companies accounted for more than half of the global beer output of the top 40 brewers. There was some movement, however: Baltika, the largest brewer in the Russian Federation, returns to the rankings in 12th place – after being nationalized by the Russian government, it now operates independently of its former parent company Carlsberg. Another newcomer to the Top 40 is the Russian group OPH United Breweries, once part of the Heineken Group, which is now in 24th place.

Change of course and structure

Parallel to geopolitical shifts, many groups are executing a strategic change of course: Instead of pursuing diversification and craft beer expansion, the major brewers are increasingly focusing on their international flagship brands. Molson Coors, for example, sold several US breweries including their brands to the Tilray group – a step that AB InBev had already taken in 2023.

In Africa, Diageo disposed of its majority stake in Guinness Nigeria, selling its shares to Singapore-based Tolaram. Denmark’s Carlsberg Group, on the other hand, is investing beyond beer and has taken over BritVic, the leading British manufacturer of alcohol-free soft drinks.

While the big international groups are refocusing, pressure is growing on small and medium-size brewers worldwide. In many places, rising raw material and energy costs can hardly be offset by higher consumer prices. Business closures, mergers, and market exits are the consequence worldwide.

Around 11,000 people in eastern Wisconsin will need to select new health insurance plans during the upcoming open enrollment period.

Chorus's exit follows a trend of insurers leaving the ACA marketplace, raising concerns about market stability.

Uncertainty remains about the future of federal subsidies and potential impacts on coverage affordability.

Chorus Community Health Plans, the health insurance provider owned by Children's Wisconsin, is dropping out of the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

About 11,000 people in eastern Wisconsin will have to switch to a new health insurance plan during the open-enrollment period for next year. That period begins Nov. 1.

That's according to a statement from Mark Rakowski, president of Chorus Community Health Plans and senior vice president at Children's Wisconsin.

Chorus is leaving the ACA marketplace because of a ""multi-year declining financial performance"" there, Rakowski said.

A 2024 report by Wisconsin's Office of the Commissioner of Insurance said Chorus was losing money selling insurance on the marketplace, but was profitable in its main business of offering Medicaid coverage.

Chorus last year reported an operating loss of $21.8 million, driven primarily by marketplace plans, according to its latest financial statement.

Chorus, which will continue to offer Medicaid, has more than 110,000 members covered by BadgerCare Plus, Rakowski said.

That state Medicaid program, funded by taxpayers, provides health coverage primarily to people in low-income households.

Chorus exiting as Obamacare faces changes

Chorus is exiting the Affordable Care Act market amid uncertainty.

Congressional Republicans are seeking changes to the ACA, also known as Obamacare, that could make it harder for people to keep coverage, USA Today has reported.

Its exit will mean one less insurer for people in eastern Wisconsin. Chorus sells plans on the marketplace in 15 eastern Wisconsin counties, including Milwaukee County.

Each of those counties have between six and eight health insurers participating on the marketplace. It will be announced later this year how many insurers will remain for 2026.

Other health insurers, such as CVS Health's Aetna, are pulling out of the marketplace next year. Aetna doesn't sell plans on the marketplace in Wisconsin.

It's possible more health insurers will drop out, said Thomas Buchmueller, professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.

But he doesn't think the situation spells doom for Obamacare.

Obamacare markets well established

The marketplaces, he said, are in a stronger place now than they were eight years ago − during President Donald Trump's first term when his administration tried to repeal Obamacare.

""Now, even if we lose a lot of coverage, the markets are pretty well established,"" Buchmueller said. ""I’m hopeful that enough insurers will think it’s still a good market to be in and they’ll survive.""

There's also uncertainty around federal subsidies set to expire at the end of 2025 if Congress doesn't extend them.

Millions of Americans could lose their health coverage without those subsidies, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected.

The subsidies, which were expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, helped more people afford health insurance through the marketplaces, and contributed to this year's record-high enrollment of 24 million people.

Their expiration would also be a blow to health plans, which would lose customers and potentially be left with a risk pool made up of sicker, more costly, patients, Buchmueller said.

The Trump administration already has taken steps to undermine parts of the Affordable Care Act.

The administration said it would slash funding for navigator programs. Those were created by the ACA to help people sign up for health coverage through the marketplace, or for Medicaid.

Proposals before Congress would make it harder for people to re-enroll in marketplace coverage and would impose new verification requirements, according to KFF, a health policy research institute.

""All those things are barriers that we can anticipate will reduce coverage, will increase costs for both consumers and plans,"" Buchmueller said.

Chorus entered ACA market in 2017

Formerly known as Children's Community Health Plan, Chorus entered the market and began selling health plans directly to individuals and families in 2017. Before that, it only contracted with the state to provide Medicaid coverage.

Chorus was not a major player in Obamacare, but it was locally based.

""They offer something a little bit different from the big, national carriers, so that is a loss that might be hard to quantify,"" Buchmueller said.

When switching plans, people will want to make sure their doctor is part of their new plan and their medications are covered.

""It's a real pain if you have to change your doctor, so that can be really disruptive,"" Buchmueller said.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/images/motleyfool/2025/06/08/USAT/84102204007-getty-health-insurance-medicare.jpeg?crop=2120,1193,x0,y141&width=2120&height=1193&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-04 05:02:18.017383

Medtronic’s recent clinical study, titled ‘Clinical Evaluation to Assess the Effect of the Combination of a Pre-Defined Management Pathway to Reduce Fluid Overload in Cardiac Decompensation With Carelink Remote Management, Connexus Remote Telemetry and the OptiVol Early Warning System on Health Care Utilization,’ aimed to evaluate the benefits of remote patient management compared to standard care for patients with CRT-D and ICD devices. The study’s key objective was to assess how timely access to ICD device information and a pre-defined treatment pattern could reduce fluid overload and improve health care utilization.

The intervention tested involved the use of Medtronic’s OptiVol, CareAlerts, and CareLink systems in Conexus-enabled devices. These tools were designed to provide remote monitoring and timely alerts to physicians, allowing for proactive management of fluid overload in heart failure patients.

The study was interventional, with a randomized allocation and a parallel intervention model. It was unmasked, meaning both patients and physicians were aware of the treatment being administered. The primary purpose of the study was treatment-focused, aiming to improve patient outcomes through innovative remote management techniques.

The study began in November 2007, with its primary completion and estimated completion dates not specified in the provided data. The last update was submitted on June 30, 2025, indicating ongoing interest and potential future developments in the study’s findings.

For investors, the completion of this study could signal a positive impact on Medtronic’s stock performance, as successful results may enhance the company’s competitive edge in the cardiac care market. The use of advanced remote management systems could position Medtronic favorably against competitors, potentially boosting investor sentiment.

The move comes as the company plans to shed 20,000 positions and close 73 facilities as part of the largest network reconfiguration in its history. The delivery and logistics giant is grappling with stagnant parcel volumes and high labor costs, which are weighing on its stock.

UPS employs about 330,000 full- and part-time delivery drivers, clerks, and package handlers represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Full-time drivers are eligible for the new buyout, the company said in a news release.

Difficult Times

Atlanta, Georgia-based UPS had signaled after its latest financial results in the spring that it was planning a network overhaul due to a slide in deliveries for its key customer Amazon (AMZN), and as U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs impact shipments and demand for its logistics services.

UPS said that the new buyout packages will be in addition to any retirement benefits such as pension and healthcare that unionized employees receive. However, it looks like the company might receive some pushback on its planned buyouts from the Teamsters union.

In a written statement, the Teamsters called the UPS buyouts an “illegal violation” of their national contract, under which UPS had committed to create 22,500 more jobs. “Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out,” said the union. UPS stock has declined 15% this year.

Is UPS Stock a Buy?

The stock of United Parcel Service has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 21 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 11 Buy, eight Hold, and two Sell recommendations issued in the last three months. The average UPS price target of $112.80 implies 8.33% upside from current levels.

The potential contamination was uncovered during routine laboratory testing.

No illnesses have been confirmed as of July 3; however, authorities are concerned the items may still be in refrigerators and freezers around the United States, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

Symptoms of listeria infection can include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, convulsions, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. It can also cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery and other infections in a newborn.

Treatment typically involves antibiotics. Officials urged anyone experiencing similar symptoms to contact a medical provider.

As it joins the ranks of world-leading companies for the second time, Flutterwave continues to redefine what’s possible for tech born on the continent.

In a world where innovation has become the currency of relevance, a Nigerian-born visionary has carved out a legacy that transcends borders, currencies, and convention.

Flutterwave, the fintech trailblazer that Nigerian-born Olugbenga Agboola founded, has once again secured a coveted place on TIME’s 2025 list of the 100 Most Influential Companies in the world.

This achievement marks the second time the company has earned such prestigious recognition, as it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with global titans such as OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, and Netflix.

But unlike most of its peers, Flutterwave’s story originates not from Silicon Valley’s deep-rooted ecosystem but from grit, tenacity, and a daring dream that emerged from the bustling streets of Lagos.

This moment represents more than just another corporate milestone.

Also Read:Global fintech market projected to grow by 18.1%

It embodies a continental victory. Flutterwave exemplifies a generation of African innovation that not only catches up with the world but also shapes its very future.

What began as a modest startup in 2016 with the mission to simplify and unify the fragmented payment systems across Africa, has transformed into a sprawling financial infrastructure.

It now powers over $23 billion in transactions and enables global commerce across 35 countries.

Its influence spans borders, linking small businesses, multinationals, and everyday individuals into the bloodstream of a digital economy that refuses to be left behind.

Agboola, the Founder and CEO, reflects with candor and pride, “Starting Flutterwave in 2016 has been one of the most challenging and rewarding things we have had to do, ever. We went through the highs and lows, but through it all, we kept building. Only the test of fire makes iron steel.”

His words capture more than just corporate struggle. They reveal the story of a resilient African spirit that refuses to yield to global skepticism, regulatory complexities, or infrastructural limitations.

They tell the story of building in the unknown, pushing boundaries in a landscape long overlooked, and believing that Africa could not only participate in global commerce but lead it.

Flutterwave does not simply operate as a payments company. It serves as the pulse of an emerging economic order, where African commerce no longer remains boxed into regional obscurity.

Through products like SendApp (formerly SendAnn), Flutterwave connects families across borders and empowers African diasporas to send money home with speed and trust.

From powering SMEs in Nairobi to enabling multinationals like Microsoft, Uber, Twitter, and Booking.com to operate in Africa seamlessly, Flutterwave has quietly become the unseen engine of African economic modernity.

The company has not followed a linear journey. It has navigated regulatory hurdles, market fragmentation, and global economic downturns that would have crushed most startups.

But Flutterwave, like the eagle it emulates, has soared above the storm. From its $35 million Series B funding in 2020 to a landmark $250 million Series D round in 2022 that catapulted its valuation to $3 billion.

With this, Flutterwave has defied every expectation and rewritten what African-founded tech ventures can achieve.

With over $509 million raised in funding and relentless year-on-year revenue growth, its business fundamentals continue to speak volumes even amidst a cautious investment climate.

Yet, at its core, Flutterwave remains deeply African. Agboola, a former Google engineer and banking executive, envisioned more than just a profitable company.

He envisioned a platform that could serve as a bridge between Africa and the global economy. From Lagos to Kigali, Cairo to Cape Town, Flutterwave’s infrastructure has become a lifeline for businesses, enabling them to transcend borders and dream bigger.

It has become the connective tissue that binds informal trade with digital rails, local merchants with global buyers, and startups with scalable opportunities.

In Agboola’s words, “We have evolved from infrastructure to innovation, from a small startup to a global player shaping the future of payments. It feels great to be recognised for this. The journey has not always been easy, but recognition like this from TIME reminds us that it is worth it.”

Indeed, he often reminds his team that it is still Day One. Flutterwave refuses to rest on its laurels. The company continues to push into new global markets, build long-term profitability, and embed sustainable growth into its DNA. Its ambition is as clear as it is noble: to support thousands, even millions, of businesses in reaching their full potential by making it seamless to move money into, within, and out of Africa.

In a time when the global narrative often skews towards adversity in Africa, Flutterwave offers an alternative story—one of excellence, global relevance, and the kind of leadership that inspires a generation. It represents a golden egg that emerged from the quiet storm of a fintech revolution, nurtured with wisdom, discipline, and boldness. It acts as the Northern Star for many African innovators who dare to dream beyond borders.

And in doing so, it has ensured that the African sun will never again set quietly in the shadows of global innovation.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-02-132240-1.png,N,,2025-07-03 19:02:43.083706

""This campaign embodies our innovation and determination to reshape an entire industry and strengthen America,"" said Stacey Kennedy, PMI Americas president and U.S. CEO. ""It also reflects our commitment to meaningful investments that create genuine value for our business, our workforce and our communities.""

The campaign launch comes as PMI prepares to break ground on its $600 million Zyn manufacturing facility in Aurora later this year. Plans for the facility were first announced in July 2024. The 500-job facility represents a significant expansion of PMI's smoke-free product manufacturing capacity in the United States.

Construction is expected to take approximately two years, with operations beginning by late 2025 and full production ramping up in 2026. According to PMI, the factory will generate an estimated $550 million in annual economic impact and create an additional 1,000 indirect jobs in the region.

The Colorado facility will supplement Zyn production from PMI's existing Kentucky operations, which the company acquired through its purchase of Swedish Match in 2022. The expansion aims to meet rapidly growing consumer demand for nicotine pouches in the U.S. market.

PMI currently employs approximately 2,500 people across the United States, with corporate headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.

The ""Invested in America"" campaign targets ""key opinion leaders"" across print, digital, social media and connected TV channels, with PMI stating its goal is to ""spark an intelligent dialogue around change"" while adhering to its marketing code that restricts advertising to adults of legal age to use nicotine.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-07/background/Zyn.jpg?VersionId=nfsqhWv5J4.Eac4JlwKw2LNA4xoeGrnd,N,,2025-07-03 20:04:23.427018

The symptoms of listeriosis—the infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes—are fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Prompt treatment is important, but some listeriosis symptoms are similar to morning sickness, so a person might not realize they’re sick with the infection until it has spread.","CR contacted Kraft Heinz for comment, and the company referred us to their press release.

Check your fridge or freezer, says James E. Rogers, PhD, director of food safety and testing at CR. “If you have one of the recalled packages, throw it out.” You can also return it to the store where it was purchased for a refund, according to the company’s release. Consumers with questions about the recall can contact Kraft Heinz at 800-280-7185 or consumerrelations@kraftheinz.com.

Listeria is a hardy bacterium that can survive in the freezer and on hard surfaces. If you have a recalled package of bacon, be sure to clean and sanitize the areas where it was stored using hot water and a mild liquid dishwashing detergent. After rinsing, disinfect with a solution of 1 tablespoon of bleach in 1 gallon of water and dry with a clean cloth or paper towel, says Rogers.

The symptoms of listeriosis—the infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes—are fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. For otherwise healthy adults, these symptoms typically resolve within a few days. However, listeriosis can cause severe illness, hospitalization, and even death, especially in high-risk people like very young children, older adults, and anyone with a weakened immune system.

Listeriosis is especially dangerous for pregnant people. It can cause a miscarriage, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection in the newborn, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prompt treatment is important, but some listeriosis symptoms are similar to morning sickness, so a person might not realize they’re sick with the infection until it has spread.

If you’re pregnant and have symptoms of listeriosis along with a temperature of 100.6° F or higher, ask your doctor for a blood test, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends.",https://article.images.consumerreports.org/image/upload/t_article_tout/v1751546697/prod/content/dam/CRO-Images-2025/Health/CR-Health-InlineHero-Oscar-Meyer-Turkey-Bacon-Recall-0725,N,,2025-07-03 23:58:42.346230

""Our goal is not to catch up; it's about figuring out how to build for the future,"" said Anuj Dhanda, EVP - chief information and transformation officer at Albertsons Companies. ""There's a certain late-mover advantage—we're now able to design solutions with AI and data science at the core, rather than as an afterthought. Many capabilities that once required heavy coding can now be built with little to no code, dramatically increasing speed and agility. That's why we're so excited about our presence in Bengaluru and the incredible talent here driving this transformation."" Albertsons has over 2,200 stores, and some of its banners include Safeway, Vons, Acme, Tom Thumb, Randalls, United Supermarkets, Haggen, Carrs, Kings Food Markets, and Balducci's Food Lover's Market. Dhanda said the US retail giant is aiming for a technology refresh. ""We need a technology 2.0, with significant shifts underway—that's where Bengaluru and the GCC come in. For success, we realised we need much greater velocity and agility, and to build far more of our own IP than we do today. Our goal is to change the way we work in technology. We've integrated product, data, and full-stack engineers into fully functional, global teams to enable seamless collaboration. We're applying AI and automation across the entire tech stack—not just in software development, but from requirements gathering to infrastructure and observability."" Many GCCs are increasingly relocating tech roles to India, signalling growing confidence in shifting solution ownership. ""My intent is to have several of my direct reports to be based here. If we consider the leadership group—around 17 to 18 vice-presidents and above—the goal is for at least a third of them to be in Bengaluru within the next 18 months,"" Dhanda said. He also said that the insourcing mix will shift dramatically, reducing reliance on external IT providers. ""We developed numerous digital systems, including pharmacy and health capabilities, and upgraded our financial systems. Going forward, our investment will move from foundational upgrades to development-driven initiatives. While we currently depend heavily on third parties like TCS, Cognizant, and Sapient for resources, we plan to bring much of that work inhouse, empowering our own associates. Our focus is to reduce third-party dependence and build stronger internal teams."" Lalit Ahuja, founder of full-stack GCC firm ANSR, said Albertsons is leveraging the late-mover advantage—not late to the party, but arriving at the perfect time to capitalise on a mature market. For retailers, the landscape is defined by thin margins, highly perishable inventory, and intense tech-driven competition—with e-commerce playing an increasingly vital role. ""Some companies struggle because tech centres are set up suboptimally. But there are firms which are set up with sharper tech differentiation. We're witnessing significant maturity in the types of roles being introduced, driving modernisation of its tech stack. This includes mainstream adoption of new technologies and a stronger emphasis on product and functional ownership. And AI has become the greatest accelerator of efficiency,"" Ahuja said. Last year, Accenture picked up a significant minority stake in the Bengaluru and US-based ANSR, which set up over 170 GCCs in India.

“This is a landmark win for low-paid fast food workers in Australia,” said SDA South Australia secretary Josh Peak.
This is the first time that a supported bargaining authorisation has been issued outside of a government-funded sector.
“This decision raises serious questions about the threshold for supported bargaining and whether the stream is being applied more broadly than Parliament intended,” said Rodwell.
This decision heightens the prospect of those struggling businesses being drawn into multi-employer negotiations without a majority of employee support, [which] is deeply concerning.”","The Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) has labelled the recent union win for collective bargaining over McDonald’s as “deeply disappointing”, believing it highlights the pitfalls of the government’s multi-employer bargaining measures.

Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox has hit out at the FWC’s recent decision to allow the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) to bargain on behalf of thousands of workers across multiple South Australian McDonald’s franchises to improve their pay and conditions.

The decision – which was heavily disputed by the global fast-food giant – gives the SDA the go-ahead to bargain on behalf of more than 5,100 workers operating across 18 South Australian McDonald’s franchises.

“This is a landmark win for low-paid fast food workers in Australia,” said SDA South Australia secretary Josh Peak.

“The fast-food industry has the highest proportion of award-reliant workers in the country, these workers deserve to be covered by enterprise agreements.”

What unions have viewed as a “David and Goliath” victory has been characterised by Willox as a “deeply disappointing” decision.

“The decision highlights the risk for thousands of employers in the fast food, retail, hospitality and many other sectors of being dragged into multi-employer bargaining by unions against their will and without the support of the majority of their employees,” said Willox.

“This includes many small businesses that are struggling to survive in the current difficult trading environment.

“The union-friendly supported bargaining stream was intended to operate in sectors where the employers and employees need a lot of support to bargain, typically because of the government-funded nature of those sectors. This is the first time that a supported bargaining authorisation has been issued outside of a government-funded sector.

“Many hundreds of enterprise agreements have been made in the fast-food industry, and there is no reason why the main enterprise bargaining laws should not apply, including the requirement for a union to establish that the majority of employees support the negotiation of an enterprise agreement.”

Willox and Ai Group urged the federal government to introduce urgent amendments to the Fair Work Act, which they hope will tighten the scope of the supported bargaining scheme.

Australian Retailers Association chief executive Chris Rodwell agreed with Willox’s assessment.

“This decision raises serious questions about the threshold for supported bargaining and whether the stream is being applied more broadly than Parliament intended,” said Rodwell.

“Small-business operators in fast food and retail are already facing significant cost pressures and economic uncertainty. This decision heightens the prospect of those struggling businesses being drawn into multi-employer negotiations without a majority of employee support, [which] is deeply concerning.”",https://res.cloudinary.com/momentum-media-group-pty-ltd/image/upload/v1751524036/HR%20Leader/innes-willox_mcdonalds_hr_orl9go.jpg,N,,2025-07-03 20:04:08.221244

According to the Israeli economic newspaper Calcalist, Landa was already racking up abysmal losses in 2022 and 2023: 264 million euros for cumulative sales of 70 million euros over these two years.
The result: a dormant stock valued at 170 million shekels (43 million euros).
As a result, Landa Digital Printing's accumulated debt would amount to 1.74 billion shekels (around 450 million euros), nearly 82% of which is owed to its own shareholders in the form of equity or convertible loans.
An internal analysis projected a return to breakeven only in 2030, at the cost of a further $300 million (255 million euros).","The soap opera surrounding Landa Digital Printing enters a decisive phase. Two weeks after laying off more than 100 employees, the Israeli company the developer of nanographic printing, has applied for a stay of legal proceedings to give itself a 14-day reprieve in order to ""complete ongoing negotiations with strategic partnersâeuros¯"" according to a press release from the company founded by Benny Landa. This decision comes after a ""cash flow crisis"".

Landa reports a 30âeuro¯% increase in machine installations over the last twelve months, particularly for customers already equipped with nanographic presses.

""Despite the company's significant achievements, the time needed to fully realize its commercial potential is longer than expected. The geopolitical situation, resulting from the prolonged war in Israel and regional instability, as well as commercial reasons have complicated the company's life.""

According to the Israeli economic newspaper Calcalist, Landa was already racking up abysmal losses in 2022 and 2023: 264 million euros for cumulative sales of 70 million euros over these two years.

The situation deteriorated rapidly after the last edition of Drupa, where 50 purchase intentions were collected. The company reportedly placed orders for spare parts, but only 11 presses were actually sold. The result: a dormant stock valued at 170 million shekels (43 million euros).

As a result, Landa Digital Printing's accumulated debt would amount to 1.74 billion shekels (around 450 million euros), nearly 82% of which is owed to its own shareholders in the form of equity or convertible loans. The remainder is owed to suppliers, employees and the bank Mizrahi Tefahot.

Shareholders reportedly released a final envelope of 13.2 million dollars (11 million ueors) in June, before halting all financial support. An internal analysis projected a return to breakeven only in 2030, at the cost of a further $300 million (255 million euros).

While Landa's press release remains vague on the ongoing negotiations with strategic partners"", Calcalist reports that the Board of Directors, in conjunction with Deloitte and the investment bank Nomura, has opened a data room to accelerate a sale, probably in the region of $100 to $200 million (?85 to ?170 million) - a far cry from paying off creditors in full.

And Landa is said to have attracted many manufacturers: HP, which in 2002 had already acquired Indigo, a company also founded by Benny Landa, for $850 million, is said to be the main candidate for the takeover, alongside other international groups such as Canon, Xerox, Agfa, Fujifilm, Epson, Brother and Koenig & Bauer.

In parallel with this application for a judicial freeze, Landa is continuing its reorganization and ""continues to pay particular attention to the success of its customers, whom it will continue to serve fully and uninterruptedly"".",https://media.printindustry.news/src/images/news/articles/ima-image-49589.jpg,N,,2025-07-03 22:02:50.901173

The complaint also highlights what NRF described as “arbitrary exemptions” in the law and argues that it lacks evidence to support the claim that algorithmic pricing harms consumers.
“Although the state is free to express its opinion that algorithmic pricing is dangerous, it cannot force businesses that disagree to do so,” the lawsuit stated.
“Algorithmic pricing mechanisms lower overall consumers prices in the aggregate,” the suit said.
“Studies have consistently shown that algorithmic pricing incorporating data on market conditions plays a powerful role in driving prices down because algorithms allow companies to be more responsive to supply and demand and so better optimize pricing to reflect market conditions.”","WASHINGTON — The National Retail Federation (NRF) has filed a federal lawsuit aiming to halt enforcement of a controversial New York state law that would require retailers to disclose when prices are set using algorithms and customer data.

Set to take effect July 8, the New York Algorithmic Pricing Disclosure Act mandates that retailers place a notice next to any price determined using customer information, stating: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” The law was passed in May as part of the state’s annual budget legislation and signed by Governor Kathy Hochul with little public debate.

In a lawsuit filed today in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the NRF argued that the measure is both unconstitutional and harmful to consumers, claiming it would stigmatize technology that enables discounts, personalization, and increased value. The lawsuit seeks both preliminary and permanent injunctions against the enforcement of the law.

“This law interferes with retailers’ ability to provide their customers with the highest value and best shopping experience they can,” NRF Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel Stephanie Martz said. “Algorithms are created by humans, not computers, and they are an extension of what retailers have done for decades, if not centuries, to use what they know about their customers to serve them better. It’s just done at the scale of the modern economy. Stigmatizing tools that drive prices down turns offering deals into a liability, and consumers will end up paying more.”

According to the NRF, algorithmic pricing relies on information such as purchase history, location, or online behavior—not sensitive personal data—to tailor promotions or discounts. The group said requiring retailers to issue what it called a “misleading and ominous” disclosure amounts to compelled speech and violates the First and 14th Amendments.

“This act compels NRF’s members to impugn their pro-consumer practices against their will,” NRF said in a lawsuit filed today in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The suit argues that the law, which is “replete with arbitrary exemptions,” violates both the First and 14th Amendments and asked for both preliminary and permanent injunctions blocking its enforcement.

The complaint also highlights what NRF described as “arbitrary exemptions” in the law and argues that it lacks evidence to support the claim that algorithmic pricing harms consumers. “Although the state is free to express its opinion that algorithmic pricing is dangerous, it cannot force businesses that disagree to do so,” the lawsuit stated.

“Retailers use algorithmic pricing to help customers save money” by using their purchase history, items in their online shopping cart, zip code and other information customers voluntarily share rather than any personal sensitive data, the complaint said. “Despite this, the State of New York will soon require many retailers to affix a misleading and ominous warning to any price set by an algorithm using any information that could be linked to a customer. … Although the state is free to express its opinion that algorithmic pricing is dangerous, it cannot force businesses that disagree to do so.”

The lawsuit said the law “is unsupported by any facts” that algorithmic pricing is inherently harmful and based instead on “speculative fear.” Any discrimination or price gouging that might inadvertently occur is already prohibited by other state laws, the suit said.

“Algorithmic pricing mechanisms lower overall consumers prices in the aggregate,” the suit said. “Studies have consistently shown that algorithmic pricing incorporating data on market conditions plays a powerful role in driving prices down because algorithms allow companies to be more responsive to supply and demand and so better optimize pricing to reflect market conditions.”",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589391886645-d51941baf7fb?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGdhdmVsfGVufDB8fHx8MTc1MTU1NDEwM3ww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=2000,N,,2025-07-03 19:02:24.128006

What To Know The recall affects about 367,812 pounds of fully cooked turkey bacon products produced between April 24 and June 11.
There are many factors that determine if someone gets listeriosis—a listeria infection.","More than 360,000 pounds of turkey bacon products have been recalled over a possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

Kraft Heinz Foods Company, based in South Carolina, issued its recall on July 2 for various products sent to retail locations nationwide. Some products were also shipped to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

Newsweek contacted Kraft Heinz Food Company for comment by email outside regular working hours.

Why It Matters

FSIS has issued a Class I risk classification for the recall, the most serious category. The classification means a ""health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.""

Listeria infection, or listeriosis, may lead to a range of symptoms in infected individuals. For those experiencing less severe infections, symptoms include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which often last between one and three days, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

For more severe and potentially life-threatening infections, symptoms may include headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. Severe infections are particularly dangerous for newborns, adults over age 65 and those with weakened immune systems.

What To Know

The recall affects about 367,812 pounds of fully cooked turkey bacon products produced between April 24 and June 11.

The affected products include these:

Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original in 12-ounce vacuum-packed packages with use-by dates ranging from July 18 to August 2, 2025; the UPC 071871548601; and the lot code RS40.

Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original in 36-ounce packages containing three 12-ounce vacuum-packed packages with use-by dates ranging from July 23 to September 4, 2025; the UPC code 071871548748; and lot codes RS19, RS40 and RS42.

Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original in 48-ounce packages containing four 12-ounce vacuum-packed packages with use-by dates ranging from July 18 to September 4, 2025; the UPC code 071871548793; and lot codes RS19, RS40 and RS42.

The issue was discovered after the company's laboratory testing indicated possible contamination with the bacteria.

As of July 2, there were no confirmed reports of adverse reactions connected to the consumption of the affected products.

What People Are Saying

Haley F. Oliver, a professor of food science at Purdue University, previously told Newsweek: ""Listeria monocytogenes is a common microorganism that can be found in the natural environment, for example in soil. There are many factors that determine if someone gets listeriosis—a listeria infection. In most instances, an immunocompromised person, so young, old, pregnant or otherwise immunocompromised, must eat contaminated food. The number of bacteria resulting in infection and the amount of time before illness varies considerably. Symptoms vary among people but can include fever, flu-like symptoms, headache, stiff neck, confusion and loss of balance.""

Mary O'Riordan, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, previously told Newsweek: ""Listeria has an unusual capacity to grow at refrigerated temperatures. Although the bacterium can contaminate many types of food, cheeses or deli meats that are kept in cold storage for long periods in stores or at home, are a place where listeria can keep growing.""

She added: ""Early symptoms of listeria infection look similar to other common foodborne infections, including fever, diarrhea and vomiting, so it's often not diagnosed right away. Unfortunately, sometimes listeria can spread into the brain and cause more serious illness, like meningitis. In those cases, if people experience headache, stiff neck or confusion, they should seek urgent medical attention.""

The FDA said on its website: ""Pregnant women and their unborn or newborn baby, adults over the age of 65, and those with weakened immune systems, are all considered to be high-risk groups that are susceptible to the serious and adverse effects of listeriosis.""

What Happens Next

The recall is listed as active, according to FSIS. The agency advises people in higher risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months of eating contaminated food to seek medical care.

National bank charters offer more than just prestige.
National trust banks don’t take deposits or offer lending, however, so they sidestep some of the Fed’s strictest rules and capital requirements.
A national trust charter would allow Circle to oversee those reserves directly and streamline custody for its institutional clients.
“And clearly, that’s how Circle and Ripple are seeing things right now.”","It may be hard to believe, but two of crypto’s biggest stablecoin issuers want to become banks.

Ripple, the company that issues RLUSD, and Circle, responsible for stablecoin USDC, have both applied for US National Trust Bank charters, a rare move that if approved would bring them under federal oversight, and closer to the heart of the US financial system.

The charters would place both companies under the purview of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, subjecting them to the same capital, liquidity, and risk standards as traditional banks.

That matters for crypto, said Chris Colson, payments guru at the Atlanta Federal Reserve, mainly because it suggests that stablecoins would truly enter the financial mainstream.

“A trust charter could enhance trust in USDC and RLUSD safety and oversight,” he said on LinkedIn on July 3.

“It potentially paves the way for broader institutional and cross-border adoption.”

Direct access

Getting approved for a bank charter is a huge deal in crypto, where regulatory clarity has been murky and quite hard to come by.

National bank charters offer more than just prestige. They provide direct access to the US financial system.

National trust banks don’t take deposits or offer lending, however, so they sidestep some of the Fed’s strictest rules and capital requirements.

Still, acquiring a charters would allow these companies could serve as federally regulated custodians, hold stablecoin reserves on their own books, and potentially tap into the Fed’s real-time payment systems.

Incumbents tremble

Approval also means big competition for incumbent banks, Colson said.

“Circle and Ripple’s move blurs the line between fintech and traditional banking,” he said. “It introduces a new kind of competitor — one offering programmable, blockchain-native money but operating under similar rules.”

The OCC has historically been hesitant on crypto, denying Kraken’s application for a bank license in 2023. But now sentiment has changed.

As the Genius Act wiggles its way through Washington D.C., and new leadership at the OCC under Trump-appointed regulator Rodney Hood, crypto companies are racing to get ahead of the curve.

In the first days of his tenure, Hood took action to reaffirm that a range of cryptocurrency activities are permissible in the federal banking system.

‘Absolutely fascinating’

For Chris Perkins, president of crypto VC firm CoinFund, the bank license will form the backbone of compliant issuance under the Genius Act.

And he didn’t shy away from how bullish this is for Ripple.

​​“It’s been absolutely fascinating how Ripple has been acquiring licenses. I think they’re a force to be reckoned with,” Perkins told DL News.

“They’re putting together all the elements to build a very successful and scalable stablecoin in RLUSD.”

Unlike Circle, whose stablecoin USDC forms the backbone of DeFi and led the company to a blockbuster IPO, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, has grown at a sluggish pace.

It now ranks 20th among all stablecoins by market value with $469 million.

Evolve or die

The stakes are as high as they’ve ever been.

Circle, which recently went public, holds over $60 billion in reserves to back USDC — and currently relies on traditional custodians like BNY Mellon to manage its assets.

A national trust charter would allow Circle to oversee those reserves directly and streamline custody for its institutional clients.

Ripple, meanwhile, has already applied for access to the Federal Reserve’s master account, a move that would let it settle payments directly on Fed rails — a rare privilege even among fintechs.

“It’s evolve or get left behind,” Jeff Cantwell of Seaport Research Partners reportedly said. “And clearly, that’s how Circle and Ripple are seeing things right now.”",https://www.dlnews.com/resizer/v2/AQ6FV7L52JHP3I2FGVJORDKHXY.jpg?smart=true&auth=2a6b61052e8acbcef2ecf7ac14f826b2fe32c1ffa94213cd245cb27a2e906bd9&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-07-03 17:05:11.592133

Why this matters: Instacart currently counts retailers like Aldi, Kroger, Schnucks, Gelson’s, and Hornbacher’s among its stores using its Caper Cart.

Expanding to another major retailer like Wegmans is a huge opportunity for Instacart to push its tech mainstream, backed by sizable consumer interest: Only 9% of customers currently use smart carts in their grocery shopping, but 64% of shoppers would be eager to try it, according to the Progressive Grocer.

For Wegmans, introducing Caper Carts could help boost volume. Integrations into its loyalty program, gamified quests, location-based coupons, and aisle-aware advertising formats, match consumers’ requests for retailers.

55% of customers find gamification opportunities extremely/very important in their grocery loyalty programs, per a May 2024 survey from Lobyco.

The Teamsters, which covers many UPS drivers, was less than impressed. Teamsters President Sean O’Brien called the plan “illegal” and said it violated the union’s 2023 contract. He pointed out that the contract requires UPS to create 22,500 more jobs.

“UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts in front of Teamsters drivers. It is an illegal violation of our national contract,” O’Brien said. “UPS Teamsters work too damn hard to be treated with such disrespect.”

According to the union, the buyout offer wouldn’t include employer-paid healthcare in retirement for workers who held the position for 30 years or more. It would also be “far less” than what UPS drivers currently make.

“Our members cannot be bought off, and we will not allow them to be sold out. The Teamsters are prepared to fight UPS on every front with every available resource to shut down this illegal buyout program,” O’Brien said. “UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments, just as Teamsters do every day, reliably delivering packages to hundreds of millions of Americans. Profits are not more important than people, not at UPS or any other employer.”

The Teamsters also accused UPS of failing to fulfill other parts of their contract, such as ensuring air-conditioned vehicles for drivers in hot areas.

Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman strongly urged drivers not to accept the offer, saying they’re still protected under the current agreement.

Favourites such as Happy Meals, fries, and wraps have seen price increases of up to 15% in just a few months.

For example, the Wrap of the Day, which was priced at £1.99 in January, now costs £2.29.

Happy Meals have also gone up, with some locations charging as much as £4.49, compared to £3.99 in May.

Similarly, the average price of large fries has risen from £2.39 in June to £2.49 in July.

Lots of angry customers have spotted the increases with some threatening to boycott the chain.

One person wrote on Reddit: ""I'm done with Maccies,"" while another said: ""Won't be going back.""

Defending the price hikes, a McDonald's spokesperson said: ""We refuse to compromise on the quality of our ingredients – and that means when these ingredients cost more, we have to review our prices.

""Raising some prices means we are able to stand by our quality commitments, like our beef patties being made from 100% British and Irish beef or our Chicken McNuggets being made from 100% chicken breast.

""We know how much these mean to our customers. Providing value remains an absolute priority. We continue to work tirelessly to ensure that every customer has a value offering that works for them.""

Prices at McDonald's do vary based on the location, partly due to some being franchises, which means they set their own prices.

McDonald's has not confirmed whether other items have also gone up.

The Sun previously reported on several other price increases back in May.

The Steakhouse Stack burger, which returned earlier this year, cost £5.99, up from £5.49.

Its meal option also rose to £7.99, compared to £7.19 before.

The Biscoff McFlurry has also seen a 15% price hike, going from £1.99 to £2.29.

Meanwhile, the Mayo Chicken burger from the Saver Menu has increased from £1.39 last year to £1.49.

What else is happening at McDonald's?

Earlier this week, McDonald's introduced a new twist on a classic with the launch of the Double Filet-o-Fish.

This new burger includes two crispy Pollock fish patties, along with melted cheese and creamy tartar sauce, all served in a steamed bun – just like the original.

The Double Filet-o-Fish costs £5.29 on its own or £7.39 as part of an Everyday Value Meal.

It joins other menu items like the Big Arch, a massive new burger.

Last month, McDonald's also added four new items to the menu, including the Cheesy McCrispy burger and Halloumi fries.

Plans for Redfern McDonald’s scrapped It comes after plans for a 24-hour Macca’s in the inner Sydney suburb of Redfern were scrapped following uproar from local residents and police earlier this year.
The local planning panel conceded that the development proposal “has not adequately addressed crime prevention”.","One of Sydney’s affluent Northern Beaches suburbs has said no to the golden arches, with a contentious proposal to build a McDonald’s in Balgowlah shut down amid concerns of anti-social behaviour and congestion on an-already bustling road.

The plan to build the restaurant – which would operate from 5am to midnight – at 37 Roseberry Street, was unanimously rejected by the Northern Beaches Local Planning Panel (NBLPP) on Wednesday.

In its decision, the panel highlighted existing congestion in the area – which is home to businesses, dwellings and the Manly Vale B-Line bus stop, stating: “The application has not demonstrated the proposed development will not have unreasonable impacts on the already congested surrounding road network”.

It also pointed out “incidents of anti-social behaviour in the vicinity recorded by police” – who have raised concerns the restaurant could make matters worse.

In its submission to Northern Beaches Council, police said they had “some reservations” about the restaurant – which was originally proposed to be open 24 hours a day – stating it “may contribute to an increase in crime and anti-social behaviour, particularly at night unless adequate security measures are implemented”.

“Given the 24-hour operating model, this development has the potential to attract increased levels of crime, anti-social behaviour, and public safety concerns, particularly during late-night and early-morning trading periods,” police said in the report.

Police also noted a comparable existing 24-hour McDonald’s located nearby recorded 58 incidents over the last 24 months, including assaults, burglaries and malicious damage.

Within the vicinity of the proposed Roseberry Street site, police recorded a total of 112 incidents over the past 24 months.

“The introduction of a 24-hour fast-food venue at this location has the potential to exacerbate these incident categories, particularly in relation to assaults, anti-social behaviour, and property damage at night, if reasonable mitigation strategies are not implemented.”

McDonald’s had originally proposed redeveloping the site – which is currently occupied by the Seven Miles Coffee Roasters plant, head office and cafe – and opening the restaurant for 24 hours a day, seven days a week in an almost $4 million Development Application lodged to the council in February.

However, the hours were later scaled back to 5am to midnight, seven days a week amid community backlash.

A community petition calling on officials to “Say NO” to McDonald’s was launched in February.

At the time of publication, it had attracted over 3,000 signatures, with supporters raising concerns about traffic congestion and potential crime, as well as noise and rubbish pollution.

“We are calling for a rejection of the application … and to consider the cumulative impact of fast-food outlets on our neighbourhood’s environment and character,” Petition creator Sarah Garland said, as per The Courier Mail.

Prior to the proposal’s rejection, McDonald’s told the publication last month, the restaurant would “create more than 100 new local jobs and represents an investment of more than $3.9m into the community”.

News.com.au contacted McDonald’s for comment however a statement was not provided prior to publishing.

Plans for Redfern McDonald’s scrapped

It comes after plans for a 24-hour Macca’s in the inner Sydney suburb of Redfern were scrapped following uproar from local residents and police earlier this year.

The $3 million development plan for a two-storey restaurant on the area’s main dining and shopping strip, Redfern Street, was blocked in a unanimous vote by the local planning panel at a City of Sydney council meeting in May.

Police and local residents fought to stop the proposal, warning it would lead to a spike in theft and violent crime at night, and be a step backwards for the suburb.

A request by a McDonald’s representative for a six-week extension to try and resolve locals’ concerns was also denied during the meeting, with one panel member suggesting those attempts would be like putting “lipstick on what the community submissions largely believe to be a pig”.

The local planning panel conceded that the development proposal “has not adequately addressed crime prevention”.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d4ac5eb0b7a5dcd04d50e7e1c59e8f18,N,,2025-07-03 18:06:15.287282

The company describes it as an attempt to create a community-focused environment.

The first “Back to Starbucks” redesign has been unveiled in Bridgehampton. It has a lounge-like vibe with brand new lighting, seating, and acoustics. The aim is to invite customers to stay in the store for longer — to socialize, work, or relax, rather than a grab-and-go concept.

Over the next year close to 1,000 US locations will undergo similar changes.

Nike Inc. will face pressure to raise prices higher than expected after the U.S. and Vietnam reportedly reached a new trade agreement that boosts tariffs, according to an analyst.

“Nike already plans surgical price increases, and we expect this plan to move forward, with potentially higher increases than prior plan,” Raymond James analyst Rick Patel wrote in a research note to clients July 2.

U.S. President Donald Trump said the accord will place 20% tariffs on goods coming from Vietnam. That’s double the 10% the U.S. enacted in April. Before Trump’s second term, the U.S. had levies of about 8% on nonagricultural products from Vietnam.

Patel said the increased tariffs will also reduce gross margin more than expected at Nike and other companies that source from Vietnam, including Under Armour, Skechers USA, On Holding AG, Lululemon Athletica and Deckers Outdoor Corp.

Shares of Nike were little changed July 3 after gaining about 4% on July 2 when Trump talked about the deal on social media. Investors might have been pleased that the levies on Vietnam will only be 20%.

The fast food chain has added the Daily Double to its national menu, expanding its value meal offerings.

This new burger is made with two beef patties, American cheese, shredded lettuce, slivered onions, mayo and two slices of tomato.

The Daily Double has been a hit in certain local markets such as Miami, Chicago and Seattle — and now fans can get it all over the country.

According to the Golden Arches, this hearty burger has a whopping 490 calories, 31 grams of total fat, 30 grams of carbs and 22 grams of protein.

This new burger might sound similar to classics like the McDouble or Double Cheeseburger, because they are, but these two OG sandwiches instead have cheese, pickles, diced onions, ketchup and mustard.

Customers also have the option to add bacon to the McDouble. A small but mighty difference.

The Daily Double will be available at participating McDonald’s restaurants across the U.S. starting July 22 through the end of 2025.

Later this month, the Daily Double will be included as an option in the McValue Meal Deal bundle — which includes a choice of select entrees plus four-piece Chicken McNuggets, small fries and a small soft drink.

This yummy deal is priced at $6 or $7, depending on location.

Customers who frequent the Chicago International McDonald’s restaurant will also be able to order curly fries — a rare menu item only rarely seen in the U.S.

Since 2018, this Midwest location has been known for featuring different menu items offered at McD’s locations around the world.

On June 27, food Instagram account @snackolator reported the arrival of “Twister Fries at the Chicago location — but likely only for a few weeks.

“You can now get Twister Fries currently sold in other countries at McDonald’s international restaurant in Chicago (1035 W. Randolph),” the post read.

“At this location they rotate a menu every 6 weeks or so and feature items that they’re currently selling outside of the USA.”

People across Europe and Asia have been lovin’ these curly fries for years, and patrons weren’t shy about bragging in the comments.

“I had them in Ireland a few years ago, along with cheese curds!” someone shared.

Recently, fans were flocking to the Midwest McDonald’s for the McAloo Tikki burger — a crispy, spicy potato-and-pea patty topped with tomato and a sweet-tangy tomato mayo.

Meanwhile, McDonald’s is spicing things up this summer with the introduction of new spicy menu items.

Starting July 8, a new spicy variation of the Egg McMuffin will be available at participating restaurants for a limited time.

The Spicy McMuffin includes everything fans love about the Egg McMuffin with a shot of McDonald’s signature Spicy Pepper Sauce. Fans can also get the Spicy Sausage McMuffin and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

They also quietly added the Blueberry & Crème Pie nationwide, a twist on the classic McDonald’s sleeved pie, featuring blueberries and vanilla crème.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107553648.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-07-03 17:05:58.730887
