The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator.
Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using Nvidia’s Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.
During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company’s Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits.

The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using Nvidia’s Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.

Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator’s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services.

One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out.

“Our customers don’t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they’re doing the work is very important to them.”

Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia’s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar’s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations.

The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the mining sector, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.

“The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some real momentum on and we felt like we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that it provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.”

Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn’t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia’s physical AI strategy.

Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier for the company and its powerful GPUs.

During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company’s Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits.

While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.

“Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that’s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ces-caterpillar.jpg?resize=1200,900",N,,2026-01-07 19:03:23.380905

Why it matters: An emblem of Austin's growth — and growing pains — the city-owned airport has long been ripe for expansion.
Driving the news: City officials said they inked new lease contracts with Southwest, Delta, United, American and Alaska airlines, along with FedEx, and UPS.
The intrigue: The expansion keeps ABIA well ahead of rival San Antonio International Airport, which is also undergoing an expansion to give it up to 40 gates total.
The airport expansion is ""a tremendous economic opportunity for Austin — not only through the trades and construction jobs created during the buildout, but also through long-term jobs in concessions, airport operations, and airline services after the program is complete,"" Vanessa Fuentes, the Austin City Council member who represents the area, said in a statement.","Austin officials have firmed up the money for a massive expansion at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport — with plans to nearly double the number of gates.

Why it matters: An emblem of Austin's growth — and growing pains — the city-owned airport has long been ripe for expansion.

Catch up quick: The airport, which opened in 1999, is in the midst of an expansion that could cost upward of $6.5 billion.

The federal government has committed at least $200 million to the project so far.

The airport currently has 34 gates. Officials announced Wednesday that they'll add 32 more gates.

Driving the news: City officials said they inked new lease contracts with Southwest, Delta, United, American and Alaska airlines, along with FedEx, and UPS. The 10-year contracts will provide major revenue certainty for the airport as it embarks on the ambitious expansion project.

The contracts spell out airline fees for runways, ticket counters, gates, baggage systems and aircraft parking positions, among other things.

Airlines that are not signatories will pay per-use charges for those services.

Follow the money: City officials expect to pull in roughly $250 million in revenue from the airlines this fiscal year — more than half of its total revenue — and $275 million next fiscal year, according to a city budget document from August.

Zoom in: The money will help pay for the redevelopment of the existing Barbara Jordan Terminal, as well as:

A new pedestrian bridge connecting parking garages and the rental car facility.

A new and expanded baggage claim hall.

A new centralized TSA security checkpoint.

New expanded airline ticket counters.

And the new gates, split between two new concourses.

The intrigue: The expansion keeps ABIA well ahead of rival San Antonio International Airport, which is also undergoing an expansion to give it up to 40 gates total.

The two airports have competed for international flights and other routes in recent years.

What they're saying: The commitment from the airlines ""provides the financial foundation we need to modernize our facilities, transform customer experience, and build the infrastructure needed to support Central Texas' continued growth for generations to come,"" airport CEO Ghizlane Badawi said in a statement.

The airport expansion is ""a tremendous economic opportunity for Austin — not only through the trades and construction jobs created during the buildout, but also through long-term jobs in concessions, airport operations, and airline services after the program is complete,"" Vanessa Fuentes, the Austin City Council member who represents the area, said in a statement.

The PMI remained below the 50.0 neutral mark separating growth from contraction for the 12th consecutive month, with its second-lowest reading since May 2020.

Tim Moore, S&P Global Market Intelligence's economics director, commented: ""UK construction companies once again reported challenging business conditions and falling workloads in December, but the speed of the downturn moderated from the five-and-a-half-year record seen in November. Many firms cited subdued demand and fragile client confidence.

""Despite a lifting of Budget-related uncertainty, delayed spending decisions were still cited as contributing to weak sales pipelines at the close of the year.""

Moore noted: ""Total new orders nonetheless decreased to a much lesser degree than in November, while business activity expectations for the year ahead rebounded to a five-month high.""

S&P Global said approximately 37% of the survey panel predicted that output will increase in the year ahead, while 20% predicted a decline.

""Some survey respondents attributed greater optimism to projections of rising infrastructure spending, especially in the utilities sector,"" Moore said. ""There were also hopes that lower borrowing costs and easing inflationary pressures could boost demand across the construction sector.""

The UK construction PMI is compiled by S&P Global from questionnaire responses by a panel of about 150 construction companies.

The data was collected between December 4 and 22.

But as Scientific American and many other outlets have previously reported, some health experts have urged caution when using ChatGPT for health care reasons—and especially for mental health. The company has faced legal scrutiny in recent years after several people, including at least two teenagers, died by suicide after interacting with ChatGPT. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other experts are more positive. Peter D. Chang, an associate professor of radiological sciences and computer science at the University of California, Irvine, says the tool represents a “step in the right direction” toward more personalized medical care. But he also cautions that users should approach any AI-generated medical advice with a grain of salt. “Maybe don’t do exactly what it says but use it as a starting point to learn more.”

“Absolutely there’s nothing preventing the model from going off the rails to give you a nonsensical result,” Chang says.

Growth outlook strengthens as acquisition talks and partnerships advance

Eli Lilly is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire Ventyx Biosciences in a deal valued at over $1 billion, which is expected to expand its drug portfolio, especially in inflammatory disease treatments. The potential acquisition could further bolster growth prospects within the company’s pipeline. Recent news also highlights Lilly’s projected revenue gains and strategic partnerships focused on new oral therapies.

Overbought signals emerge as buyers press against resistance

Momentum remains clearly positive, with both MACD and ADX signaling bullish strength on the daily chart. RSI at 55.78 suggests bullish but not overbought conditions, though both Stochastic RSI and Bull/Bear Power flag emerging overbought zones and strong buyer dominance intraday. The Awesome Oscillator is neutral. Today’s session opened with a modest upward gap, and the price is currently near the session’s high. Intraday volatility is moderate, with a clear upward tone as buyers continue to exert pressure after the open. Some divergence is noted with oscillators reflecting mounting overbought signals even as momentum remains robust, so caution is warranted as price approaches potential exhaustion levels. Nearest support is seen at the Ichimoku Kijun ($1,036.88), with next dynamic resistance aligning near the 50-day Moving Average and the round $1,100–$1,110 zone.

Breakout risks climb as upward bias meets volatility zone

Over the next five trading days, LLY is likely to trade within a $1,075 to $1,125 volatility band relative to current levels. The probability of further upward movement is high (over 80%), while the chances of a meaningful pullback remain low. The baseline scenario sees price consolidating around $1,100, but a sustained bullish push could trigger a breakout above $1,125, whereas heightened selling might test support near $1,075. Multi-timeframe momentum continues to favor buyers, though short-term volatility risks persist as overbought readings intensify.

Previously it was reported that Eli Lilly and Company is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, consistently trading above key moving averages across all timeframes, with technical indicators such as MACD and ADX in buy territory and RSI remaining bullish without reaching overbought levels. The stock is supported near $1,035–$1,040 and faces resistance around $1,095–$1,100, while momentum and institutional activity suggest further upside is likely despite some mixed oscillator signals.",https://files.tradersunion.com/images/analytics-news/eli-lilly/eli-lilly_01.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 17:02:42.464565

ChatGPT Health is not intended for diagnosis and treatment, and it's not supposed to replace medical care, OpenAI said. Rather, the experience is supposed to help users navigate everyday questions, and it aims make ChatGPT's responses more relevant by grounding them in a user's own health information.

""ChatGPT Health is another step toward turning ChatGPT into a personal super-assistant that can support you with information and tools to achieve your goals across any part of your life,"" Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI, wrote in a post on Substack.

OpenAI said ChatGPT Health has its own dedicated space within the chatbot, so all of those files, conversations and connected apps are stored separately from other chats. Information and memories from ChatGPT Health will not flow outside of that space, and those conversations will not be used to train OpenAI's foundation models, the company said.

The startup has partnered with b.well, which provides the health data connectivity infrastructure that will allow users to share their medical records with ChatGPT Health.

Users will also be able to connect to Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, the lab testing startup Function and other data. Services can be connected from tools or apps in settings.

ChatGPT Health was developed in ""close collaboration"" with physicians, OpenAI said.

OpenAI has deepened its push into health care in recent months.

After the company launched its GPT-5 model in August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC that health care was ""maybe the area where there's the strongest improvement of any category.""

In May, it released a benchmark called Health Bench that is designed to measure how well AI models perform in realistic health scenarios.

The startup said Wednesday that ""hundreds of millions"" of people ask health and wellness questions each week.

ChatGPT Health will initially be made available to a small group of early users that will offer feedback and refine the experience. OpenAI said it will expand access in the coming weeks.

BALTIMORE and SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- OpenAI has selected b.well as the underlying health data connectivity infrastructure enabling users to securely connect their medical records for more personalized health AI interactions in ChatGPT Health.

Through this collaboration, users can explicitly authorize access within ChatGPT to securely connect their health data and medical records from U.S. healthcare providers. This enables health-related conversations in ChatGPT Health to be grounded in a user's own longitudinal health information, delivering more relevant, context-aware insights. The integration is designed to put consumers in charge of where and how they can safely and securely access their health information.

""One of the most common and meaningful ways people use ChatGPT today is for health and wellness information,"" said Ashley Alexander, VP of Health Products, OpenAI. ""By working with trusted brands like b.well, we're able to make the user experience even more useful and personalized.""

b.well operates a highly connected health data network designed to support consumer-mediated access to live clinical data across more than 2.2 million providers and 320 health plans, labs, and other sources. Built on FHIR-based APIs and trusted healthcare exchange frameworks, the network maintains strict controls around identity verification, consent management, data security, and auditability.

""We know patients are already using ChatGPT for health information and advice. Allowing patients to securely and privately integrate their own health data will make those interactions much more contextually relevant and accurate,"" said Kristen Valdes, CEO and Founder of b.well. ""b.well was built to make healthcare simpler for consumers and their families. We're excited that this collaboration meets consumers where they are — talking to ChatGPT — and brings more personalized interactions so they can better engage in their health and well-being.""

OpenAI is leveraging b.well's SDK for Health AI to activate this connectivity and accelerate the delivery of AI-driven health experiences.

The b.well SDK for Health AI transforms connected health data into clean, aggregated, AI-optimized inputs for large language model (LLM) applications, enabling organizations to deploy and scale AI-driven health experiences in weeks rather than months or years. The SDK supports secure use of both structured and unstructured clinical data — including patient summaries, lab and vital trends, clinical notes such as progress notes and discharge summaries, diagnostic interpretations, care plans, and coverage information — while optimizing data delivery for performance, cost efficiency, and fast response times. This approach allows AI systems to generate answers in seconds, even when working with years of longitudinal patient records.

""Today, AI is only able to work across a small part of the patient record. The b.well Health SDK for AI finally enables AI to work across the full patient record — spanning multiple EMRs and with complete access to both structured data and unstructured data,"" said Imran Qureshi, Chief AI and Technology Officer at b.well. ""We are excited about the power of combining OpenAI's industry-leading AI with b.well's industry-first AI SDK to help consumers make informed decisions about their health.""

The work with OpenAI reflects a broader industry shift toward B2B health infrastructure models — where AI and consumer platforms rely on proven interoperability networks rather than building healthcare connectivity from scratch. By leveraging b.well's existing network, OpenAI can accelerate development while aligning with U.S. healthcare data standards and privacy regulations.

This announcement builds on b.well's growing role as foundational infrastructure for technology companies integrating health data into consumer experiences, following similar work with major global technology leaders.

The more I think about it, the more sad I am that the arc of the computing industry trended towards standardized desktops and laptops. There was a brief spark of interest with the UMPC (ultra mobile PC) trend in the 2000's, which Engadget covered extensively as a young blog, as well as ASUS's Eee keyboard. But they couldn't survive the rise of the smartphone and tablet. It turns out putting an entire computer behind a screen was more compelling than stuffing them into a keyboard.

I was able to test out an early EliteBoard prototype, and while the experience wasn't perfect, it's still an intriguing computing option. I had trouble setting it up initially because it only had two USB-C ports on its rear, which meant I had to find a way to power it through one port and pass a video signal through the other. Thankfully, my Anker USB-C charging hub was able to juice it up, and I also had a USB-C hub with an HDMI port, which allowed me to connect to my monitor.

Sadly, the overall setup was a jumble of wires, and not the clean layout I expected from a keyboard PC. Once I was able to start up Windows though, I was less annoyed and more amazed that the keyboard contained an entire computer. I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised, as Intel's Compute Stick placed a functional PC in a much smaller case, but unlike the failed product, the EliteBoard actually felt usable. I was able to load up several browser windows with tabs, edit a few photos and even play a few light games, like Vampire Survivors. And yes, typing on it felt pretty great too.

Since I was testing out prototype hardware, I agreed not to benchmark the EliteBoard. But from the performance I saw, it felt about the same an entry-level laptop. Basically, it's perfectly suited to its main task: Being a boring office computer. Back in my IT days, I certainly would have preferred deploying a few light keyboards instead of the tank-like Dell desktops we typically ordered.

While the EliteBoard is targeted at commercial users, HP is considering it an experiment to see how people respond to a keyboard PC. There's a chance we could see one that's eventually meant for mainstream consumers. I'm not sure if that's exactly, necessary, though. The whole concept of a desktop PC mainly appeals to tinkerers and IT folks. And for anyone who wants to get their hands on an EliteBoard soon, there's really nothing stopping you.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9FzrEqYh99.2zeZe5jHYIg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MTk-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:02:14.631138

Press release from the issuing company:

This week at CES 2026, HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) debuted new technologies that position personal fulfilment as the next frontier for driving business growth. Knowledge workers worldwide are feeling under pressure; just 20% have a healthy relationship with work. But given the right tools and technology, the likelihood of workers having a healthy work relationship more than doubles – and increases five-fold when the workforce sees their company investing in them. In an era marked by disruption and change, HP recognizes a growing fulfilment deficit in the workforce and is committed to empowering organizations to transform this challenge into an opportunity for innovation and resilience.

HP Innovations Designed for the Future of Work

As businesses navigate unprecedented challenges, HP remains steadfast in its commitment to pioneering solutions that foster professional fulfilment and accelerate business growth, ensuring that the future of work is both human-centered and technology-driven.

New products and solutions include:

Keep hybrid work running smoothly and strengthen IT’s ability to maintain business continuity across distributed environments with enhancements to the company’s Workforce Experience Platform (WXP) employee device management features.

Cole will be CEO-Designate as of January 19, 2026, and will officially assume the CEO role on February 16, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) said in a statement on Tuesday (January 6).

Cole will succeed Andy Mooney, who led Fender as CEO since 2015 and will be retiring.

Mooney leaves Fender after more than a decade in the CEO role, leading the company through a period of technological innovation that included the launch of subscription-based digital software.

Fender launched the Fender Play app – an online learning platform for guitars and other string instruments – in 2017. In 2025, the company launched Fender Studio, an app for recording music and jamming.

Cole has been with Fender since 2015, most recently serving as President of the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, a role in which he led a number of initiatives including the launch of Fender’s APAC headquarters in Tokyo and launching the first-ever Fender flagship store in Harajuku, Tokyo, in 2023.

Fender credits Cole with expanding the company’s presence in 14 APAC markets.

“Bud has been one of the most impactful leaders within our organization. He has a deep understanding of the Fender brand, our global players, and the commercial and operational foundation required to propel us into the future,” said Mark Fukunaga, Executive Chairman of the FMIC Board.

“His track record of building teams, expanding markets, and elevating Fender’s presence around the world makes him uniquely qualified to lead the next chapter of growth. On behalf of the Board, I also want to thank Andy Mooney for his leadership over the past decade and for the significant contributions he has made to the company.”

“[Cole’s] track record of building teams, expanding markets, and elevating Fender’s presence around the world makes him uniquely qualified to lead the next chapter of growth.”

Mark Fukunaga, Fender

“Leading Fender has been a highlight of my career. I’m deeply grateful for the creativity and commitment of the Fender teams around the world and proud of what we’ve accomplished,” Mooney said in a statement.

“I’m excited to pass the baton on to Bud and confident that under his leadership, Fender will continue to inspire players for generations to come.”

Prior to joining Fender, Cole held senior leadership roles at Pernod Ricard Group, LVMH, QVC, and Ralph Lauren, building a globally focused career that has seen him work in some 60 countries.

Fender stresses that Cole is a lifelong musician whose first guitar was an acoustic Fender La Brea, followed by a Fender Made-in-Japan 1969 Thinline Telecaster reissue purchased in 1989, which Cole still plays today.

A graduate of Arizona State University, Cole’s first job interview out of college was for a PR position at Fender – a role he didn’t land. That makes his eventual appointment as CEO “especially meaningful,” Fender said.

Founded in 1946, FMIC will celebrate its 80th anniversary this year. Along with the Fender brand, the company owns and operates Squier, Gretsch guitars, Jackson, EVH, Charvel, Bigsby, and PreSonus.",https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2026/01/Edward-Bud-Cole-Fender-Musical-Instruments-Corporation-CEO-Designate-Photo-Credit_-Naoki-Tsuruta-.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:02:34.880022

Impact of Marketing Investments on 2025 Holiday Season

Sales generated through consumers visiting a retail site from social media increased 40.3% year over year, with social media generating 4.6% of holiday revenue, up from 3.3% of revenue in 2024. This is separate from social media influencers, which generated one in five online holiday purchases (20.4% of sales from affiliates and partners) up from 17.6% share of revenue from the 2024 holiday season. Paid search and email also drove a significant share of revenue, according to Adobe without providing specific figures.

Generative artificial intelligence chat services, like ChatGPT, also increased its share of referring sales, according to Adobe data. Consumers especially used these tools to find deals and research products. Traffic to U.S. retail sites from generative AI increased 670% year over year. Adobe did not reveal the percent of traffic that comes from generative AI.

“While the base of users remains modest, the uptick shows the value AI can deliver as a shopping assistant,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, in a press release. “These services were used most in categories including video games, toys, appliances, electronics and personal care products.”

Discounts

Retailers’ strong discounts drove the considerable increase in online sales this holiday season, according to Adobe. In many categories, the average peak discount rate was higher than in 2024:

Electronics — 30.9% off listed price compared with 30.1% in 2024

Toys — 29.6% peak discount (vs. 28%)

Apparel — 25.1% peak discount (vs. 23.2%)

Televisions — 24.3% peak discount (vs. 24.2%)

Computers — 23.4% peak discount (vs. 22.8%)

Sporting goods — 20.3% peak discount (vs. 19.5%)

Appliances — 20.2% peak discount (vs. 19.2%)

Furniture — 18.8% peak discount (vs. 19%)

Deep discounts also enticed shoppers to purchase higher-ticket items and many shoppers “traded up,” according to Adobe.

Barclays cited the growing interest in cryptocurrencies as part of the reason for its strategic investment. The U.S. banking giant also highlighted progress in regulatory processes in several jurisdictions, adoption, and emerging use cases, adding that both companies will remain committed to the responsible development of tokenized money within the regulatory perimeter.

Stablecoins in particular are increasingly becoming a popular segment of the industry after President Trump signed into law the much-awaited GENIUS Act last July. The bill provides clarity for regulating cryptocurrencies tied to real-world assets.

Commenting on the announcement, Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets and Strategic Investments at Barclays, said: “Interoperability is essential to unlock the full potential of digital assets. As the landscape of tokens, blockchains, and wallets evolves, specialist technology will play a pivotal role in delivering connectivity and infrastructure to enable regulated financial institutions to interact seamlessly.”

Tony McLaughlin, CEO of Ubyx, commented: “Our mission is to build a common globalised acceptance network for regulated digital money, including tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins. Bank participation is vital to provide par value redemption through regulated channels. We are entering a world in which every regulated firm offers digital wallets in addition to traditional bank accounts.”

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.

This company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10.01%.

For the last reported quarter, The Bank of New York Mellon came out with earnings of $1.91 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 per share, representing a surprise of 8.52%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.94 per share, delivering a surprise of 11.49%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For The Bank of New York Mellon, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

The Bank of New York Mellon has an Earnings ESP of +3.13% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 13, 2026.

When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

The Vera Rubin platform is not a single chip. Instead, it is a full system made of six chips that work together as one AI computer. Nvidia stated that the platform is already in full production, with shipments planned for the second half of 2026.

For now, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts that Nvidia’s prior estimate of $500 billion in data center chip revenue through year-end has increased. She said customer demand has come in higher than expected across both current and future products.

Meanwhile, NVDA shares closed Tuesday at $187.24, showing little change on the day despite the announcements.

Performance Gains and Revenue Outlook

At the center of the platform is the Rubin graphics chip, which includes 288 gigabytes of HBM4 memory. This allows data to move much faster than in Nvidia’s current Blackwell system. Nvidia said the new setup offers close to three times the memory speed per chip.

In addition, the full rack system uses 72 Rubin chips along with Vera CPUs and other Nvidia hardware. As a result, Nvidia says the system can deliver up to five times more performance for AI tasks that run after models are trained.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said demand for both training and everyday AI use continues to rise. As a result, Wall Street now expects Nvidia to generate about $321.2 billion in revenue in calendar 2026, which would be about 57% growth from the prior year.

China Demand and Global Expansion

Separately, Huang said demand from China for Nvidia’s H200 chips remains very strong. He confirmed that production is active after the U.S. government signaled support for exports under a revenue-sharing plan. He added that final approval would be clear once orders are placed.

At the same time, Nvidia plans to expand its workforce in Israel. The company aims to double its staff there to ten thousand workers and build a new campus in Kiryat Tivon. This move reflects Nvidia’s long-term investment plans as AI demand continues to grow.

Is Nvidia Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

On the Street, Nvidia holds a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target is $263.39, implying a 40.67% upside from the current price.

Albertsons saw net sales and other revenue increase by just under 2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, to about $19.1 billion, driven primarily by strong growth in pharmacy sales, the supermarket operator announced Wednesday.

Identical sales were up by 2.4%, an amount that was depressed by between 10 and 20 basis points by the delay in the distribution of SNAP benefits caused by the federal government shutdown last autumn.

Shoppers showed growing signs of price sensitivity during the quarter, with even higher-income shoppers paying more attention to costs, CEO Susan Morris said during a Wednesday morning earnings call.

Dive Insight:

The shaky economic conditions that defined Albertsons’ latest quarter affected shopping behavior across the income spectrum, with customers who earn less buying fewer items per trip, prioritizing essentials and making more frequent visits to stores, Morris said. Middle-income households, which Morris said had been “relatively resilient,” traded down in some categories as their spending capacity took a hit, while spending patterns among more affluent customers remained stable even as these shoppers became more conscious of price and value, she said.

In response, Albertsons stepped up personalized promotions and loyalty program enhancements during Q3 while also turning to “surgical management of cost inflation,” Morris said. The retailer continued to invest in its private label portfolio and is on course to increase its own brands penetration from 25% to 30%, she said.

“We also very carefully manage the pass through inflation to deliver value for customers across the entire company, ensuring affordability while protecting margins,” Morris said. The grocer leaned into artificial intelligence systems as it sought to deliver relief to shoppers while also charting its future course, she added.

Albertsons is also looking to digital relationships with shoppers to drive sales, Morris said, noting that the “Ask AI” search tool the company introduced in 2025 drove a 10% increase in basket size among people who use the capability.

“By leveraging AI, we’re creating differentiated experiences that go beyond convenience. They increase basket size, drive repeat trips and deepen loyalty,” Morris said.

Albertsons’ online sales rose 21% during Q3, while digital penetration reached about 9.5%, she said. Albertsons believes that its e-commerce business could become profitable as soon as the end of this year, President and CFO Sharon McCollam said during the call, adding that the company does not include retail media sales when calculating its digital profitability.

McCollam said Albertsons expects to face significant headwinds during the coming months stemming from Medicare drug price reductions related to the federal Inflation Reduction Act, the first round of which went into effect at the start of 2026. The company forecasts that the changes will depress identical sales during Q4 by about two-thirds of a percentage point and shave as many as 18 basis points off that metric for the full fiscal year, she said.

Albertsons has narrowed its guidance for fiscal 2025 as a result of the challenges posed by the government’s moves to reduce drug prices for consumers. The company now expects identical sales growth for the year to come in between 2.2% to 2.5%, down from its previously forecast range of 2.2% to 2.75%.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_px6lW8f4e2oL9yyMmfrUEQp2sMQRynwArVtTpnZimA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TYWZld2F5X0NoZWhhbGlzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-07 13:02:46.699954

Here’s My Take Jensen Huang’s CES keynote wasn’t just about showing off new hardware.
Huang’s CES keynote made it clear that Nvidia isn’t waiting for this future to arrive.","Greetings from “the most powerful tech event in the world!”

I’m writing to you from Las Vegas, where I’m attending CES, formerly the Consumer Electronics Show. This is the massive annual trade show that showcases the next generation of technology.

And I’ve already seen some wild things. Including this guy here…

Who I’ll save for a future issue.

But today, I want to cover Jensen Huang’s keynote, just like I did last year.

I wasn’t able to watch it live because I was attending the Boston Scientific and Hyundai keynote, although I’ll have a chance to see Huang speak at the Sphere later this week.

Still, I watched every minute of his CES keynote as soon as I got back to my hotel room.

And I don’t think it’s something we can afford to gloss over.

Because what he delivered was more than just a product showcase. It was Jensen Huang telling us where artificial intelligence is headed next…

And which companies are positioning themselves to control it.

From Cloud AI to Physical AI

For most of the last two years, artificial intelligence has been based almost entirely in the cloud.

We’ve measured progress by model size, training runs and how many tokens a system can generate per second.

That phase created enormous value. It also made Nvidia one of the most important companies in the world.

But Jensen Huang made something clear at CES this week.

That phase is ending.

The next phase of AI is not about generating words or images. It is about systems that can perceive the physical world, reason about it and take action on it. And Nvidia intends to supply the computing platform that makes this possible.

That’s why Huang spent so much time talking about physical AI in his keynote.

And it’s not just talk. During the keynote, he introduced Nvidia’s next major computing platform, Vera Rubin, which will enter production later this year.

Vera Rubin is a full-system architecture that combines Nvidia’s custom CPU, next-generation GPUs, high-bandwidth memory, networking and data processing units into a single rack-scale machine.

In layman’s terms, it represents a shift from AI as software to AI as an operating system for physical machines.

According to Nvidia, a full Vera Rubin NVL72 system can deliver more than 3 exaFLOPS of inference performance. That’s more than double what the previous generation delivered.

More important than that raw number is what it enables. These systems are designed to run massive AI workloads continuously, with lower training costs and far higher throughput than before.

And that’s a huge deal because physical AI is compute-hungry in a way that cloud-only AI isn’t.

Training a language model is expensive. But training a system to drive a car, operate a robot or control industrial equipment is far more demanding.

These systems must process sensor data in real-time and simulate thousands of possible outcomes before acting. And they must do it reliably, not once, but every second of every day.

Nvidia is aligning its entire platform around making that possible.

Huang also unveiled Alpamayo, a new reasoning-focused AI stack designed for autonomous vehicles.

The key problem for driverless vehicles is that seeing the world isn’t enough. Autonomous systems tend to fail in unusual situations outside their training data.

Nvidia is trying to solve that by pairing perception with reasoning, so vehicles can think through a situation before acting.

Mercedes-Benz plans to ship vehicles using this system in early 2026.

Nvidia paired that announcement with demonstrations of its simulation software, which allows companies to generate vast amounts of synthetic training data. With it, robots, vehicles and industrial systems can be trained in virtual environments before they ever touch the real world.

Nvidia says these tools are already being used by robotics companies and manufacturers to accelerate development and reduce costs.

Taken together, Huang’s message from CES shows that — once again — he’s seemingly pivoting at exactly the right moment.

Nvidia is aiming to become the operating system for intelligent machines.

And the company can afford to make that bet because its current business is throwing off an extraordinary amount of cash.

In its most recent reported quarter, Nvidia generated roughly $57 billion in revenue, with data center sales dominating growth. Those numbers were driven by cloud providers racing to build AI infrastructure.

But cloud demand alone doesn’t justify the scale of investment Nvidia is making now.

Physical AI does.

Autonomous vehicles, industrial robots, logistics systems and intelligent factories represent a much larger and longer-lasting market than chatbots. These systems will require continuous upgrades, ongoing training and massive compute budgets.

And that changes the economics. It also helps explain Nvidia’s competitive position.

Because building a fast chip is difficult. Building an integrated platform that spans hardware, networking, software, simulation and developer tools is even harder.

But once companies commit to that full stack, switching becomes costly.

That’s the payoff Nvidia is banking on.

Here’s My Take

Jensen Huang’s CES keynote wasn’t just about showing off new hardware.

It was about drawing a line between the AI era we’re living through now and the one that comes next.

This current one is all about models and cloud computing. But we’re quickly moving into a new phase that’s all about machines acting in the real world.

Nvidia is building the control system for that future, and the scale of that opportunity is larger than anything the company has pursued before.

Huang’s CES keynote made it clear that Nvidia isn’t waiting for this future to arrive.

In September 2025, it launched the People-First AI Fund to support nonprofits “working at the intersection of innovation and public good.” Two months later, the foundation announced its first recipients.
If the People-First AI Fund can help recipients operate more efficiently, the initiative will emerge as a compelling case study of how a grantmaker can leverage AI to drive meaningful, short-term impact.
The fact that the foundation selected 208 People-First AI Fund recipients after reviewing close to 3,000 applications within two months suggests its officers were up to the task.
To this point, many People-First AI Fund grantees provide direct services in fields like veterans support, health, STEM education and food security.","In November of 2025, OpenAI restructured as a public benefit corporation — a for-profit company with a commitment to making a positive impact on society and the environment while generating financial return. The nonprofit that controlled OpenAI, rebranded as the OpenAI Foundation, received a 26% equity stake valued at $130 billion in OpenAI Group PBC.

The restructuring generated a litany of questions, not the least of which was what the OpenAI Foundation’s grantmaking would look like. Fortunately, the company had offered some clues in the run-up to the announcement.

In September 2025, it launched the People-First AI Fund to support nonprofits “working at the intersection of innovation and public good.” Two months later, the foundation announced its first recipients. It would disburse $40.5 million in unrestricted grants to 208 U.S.-based nonprofits by the end of the year, and a second wave of $9.5 million in board-directed grants would be announced in the following months.

At a time when some funders are grappling with ways to anticipate AI’s more profound impacts on society, People-First AI Fund grantees, some of which have never used AI or are in the early adoption phase, hope to leverage the technology to optimize service delivery in areas like mental health, education and food security.

Many organizations in the direct services field have struggled to generate sustainable philanthropic support in recent years, as small donor support declines, and some funders pivot to advocacy and organizing to address the root causes of problems. Federal funding cuts and lapsed foundation funding over the past 12 months have exacerbated this challenge. If the People-First AI Fund can help recipients operate more efficiently, the initiative will emerge as a compelling case study of how a grantmaker can leverage AI to drive meaningful, short-term impact.

“One thing the grantees have in common is that they’re community-driven,” said Daniel Zingale, who convened OpenAI’s nonprofit commission, which supported an engagement process to inform how OpenAI’s philanthropy can address long-term systemic issues. “And what we heard, wherever we went, was that AI should benefit all of humanity, and humanity needs a seat at the table.”

How the People-First AI Fund came together

The seeds of the fund were planted in April of last year, when OpenAI assembled a nonprofit commission tasked with informing OpenAI’s philanthropic efforts.

The company “communicated a genuine interest in getting community input,” said Zingale, who previously served as senior vice president of the The California Endowment and strategist to California Govs. Gavin Newsom and Arnold Schwarzenegger. “If you believe that AI carries with it extreme promise and extreme peril, then who are the people that you would want to tip that balance toward benefiting humanity?”

The commission’s advisors held listening sessions with over 100 organizations and over 500 individuals throughout California. “The commission called the shots in terms of whether we would do a listening tour and who we would invite,” he said. “I think we did a good job at getting cross-representation across the communities — faith-based groups, academia, community organizing, farm workers.”

The commission published its report in July. Its authors encouraged the company’s philanthropy to zero in on three priorities: invest in the people sector and close economic gaps, democratize the understanding and influence of AI, and unlock AI to transform and scale philanthropy.

In an October 28 post announcing the company’s restructuring, OpenAI Board of Directors Chair Bret Taylor said the OpenAI Foundation “will initially focus on a $25 billion commitment” across two areas: health and curing diseases, and supporting “practical technical solutions for AI resilience, which is about maximizing AI’s benefits and minimizing its risks.”

While Taylor’s post didn’t provide a timeline for disbursing those funds, I noted the potential challenge of scaling up the foundation’s grantmaking machinery. The fact that the foundation selected 208 People-First AI Fund recipients after reviewing close to 3,000 applications within two months suggests its officers were up to the task. The $40.5 million the foundation will disburse through the fund by the end of 2025 was a 440% increase over the previous year’s grantmaking outlay of $7.5 million.

“We tried to make the process user friendly and not burdensome or bureaucratic,” Zingale said. “Obviously, it needed to be thorough and done with integrity, but I think it demonstrated that it doesn’t have to put already strained community organizations through an arduous process.”

Contextualizing the People-First AI Fund within the larger funding ecosystem

Every funder wants to see AI developed in a way that benefits humanity. However — and at the risk of oversimplifying a large, interconnected and growing segment of the philanthrosphere — grantmakers’ AI-related work often falls into one of two buckets.

The first is more forward looking and conceptual in nature. Grantmakers seek to preserve the dignity of workers and the diminishment of human connection while staving off an AI-induced apocalypse. Funders tackling these issues include the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, Eric and Wendy Schmidt, Omidyar Network and the foundations behind the five-year, $500 million Humanity AI initiative.

The second bucket focuses on more tangible, short-term applications of AI to advance specific priority areas like global development (Gates Foundation), medical research (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), education (Salesforce), economic mobility (NextLadder Ventures and Robin Hood’s AI Poverty Challenge) and children’s mental health (Google).

Obviously, funders can simultaneously work on both priorities by, for example, planning for a world of mass automation in 2075 while providing workers with the skills to land a job today. Regardless of the issue or timeline in question, funders aim to ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed equitably so that the technology benefits the many and not the few.

Generally speaking, the work conducted by the community-focused grantees of OpenAI Foundation’s People-First AI Fund falls into this second category by addressing what it calls “immediate needs.”

These include AI literacy and public understanding so people “can engage with AI in ways that matter for their lives”; community innovations to improve access to essential services and strengthen civic life; and economic opportunity in the form of “meaningful, fairly distributed work as AI changes the labor landscape.” The second wave of People-First AI Fund grants will support organizations “already advancing transformative AI work across areas like health.”

Using AI to more effectively deliver direct services

People-First AI Fund recipients have annual budgets between $500,000 and $10 million. Their familiarity with AI ranges from “figuring it out, or they’re very anxious to figure it out,” Zingale said. “That was a discovery for us, to find out that a small organization in a rural corner of Montana is already incorporating AI.”

Zingale’s commentary suggests that organizational leaders realize that the AI genie is out of the bottle. Rather than push back against it, they can embrace it — or, at the very least, thoughtfully explore ways in which the technology can advance their missions.

To this point, many People-First AI Fund grantees provide direct services in fields like veterans support, health, STEM education and food security. It goes without saying that it’s been rough sledding for direct service providers over the past year. Many organizations lost federal funding, and those that didn’t receive federal support to begin with had to contend with increased demand due to the cuts inflicted on organizations in their geographic region. Looking ahead, analysts fear that proposed cuts in President Donald Trump’s 2026 fiscal budget will add additional strain on direct services providers.

“There’s a hearty representation of direct service organizations” in People-First AI Fund’s cohort, Zingale said. “We didn’t position [the fund] as a kind of emergency relief response, but again, when you listen to community at this moment in time, what you hear is that direct service providers are in desperate need of relief, and so that found its way into this cohort of grantees.”

Given the profound challenges facing direct services organizations, it will be interesting to see how grantees harness AI to deliver services and the extent to which the OpenAI Foundation shares its insights with the broader field.

“I think there’s a general understanding that there’s no going back,” Zingale said. “So how to you go forward in a way that meets people’s needs — maybe with less resources, but done more efficiently? And I think that there’s a great deal of hope that AI is part of the solution.”",https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2677731345-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 13:03:01.043893

Alaska has a fleet of 413 planes, which it expects to grow to 475 by 2030, and to more than 550 by 2035.
The airline is the fifth largest in the United States, though its 8 percent market share is still only about half that of United Airlines, which ranks fourth.
United, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines dominate the U.S. market.","Alaska Airlines said on Wednesday that it would buy 110 Boeing planes, part of an ambitious plan for growth fueled by its recent acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines. The order is the largest in the airline’s history and will support Alaska’s expansion, including to destinations abroad.

“This fleet investment builds on the strong foundation Alaska has created to support steady, scalable and sustained growth,” Ben Minicucci, Alaska’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We are incredibly proud to be partnering with Boeing, a Pacific Northwest neighbor and a company that stands as a symbol of American innovation and manufacturing.”

For Boeing, the deal contributes momentum to its turnaround since a harrowing incident two years ago when a panel blew off one of its 737 Max planes operated by Alaska Airlines. No one was seriously injured, but that flight raised concerns about the quality of Boeing’s planes and prompted major changes at the company.

Alaska did not disclose the value of the deal with Boeing, but typically an order of this size would cost billions of dollars. The airline will receive five 787 Dreamliners, two-aisle planes that it plans to use for long-distance international flights; and 105 Max 10s, the model’s largest version. The Max 8 and Max 9, single-aisle planes used for short and medium-haul routes, have been flying for years, with the Max 10 widely expected to be certified by federal authorities later this year.

Alaska has a long history with Boeing, which makes the Max miles from the airline’s Seattle headquarters. The airline has historically operated an all-Boeing fleet, though it acquired a few dozen Airbus planes in its merger with Hawaiian Airlines, which will continue to fly under Hawaiian’s own brand.

Alaska has a fleet of 413 planes, which it expects to grow to 475 by 2030, and to more than 550 by 2035. The airline is the fifth largest in the United States, though its 8 percent market share is still only about half that of United Airlines, which ranks fourth. United, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines dominate the U.S. market.

Alaska is in the middle of a major expansion, both on the West Coast and abroad. Last year, the airline began flying from Seattle to Tokyo and Seoul. This summer, it plans to add flights to Rome, London and Reykjavik, Iceland. Alaska recently revamped its loyalty program and is adding more premium seats to its planes while also building new airport lounges, all in an effort to attract and retain high-spending travelers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/09/multimedia/07biz-boeing-alaska/09storm-pnw-hqfw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 14:04:10.402195

They're hardworking, they're smart, they're dedicated, they care about the company, they care about their people, they care about the country,” Huang said when asked about Nvidia’s presence in Israel.
“Nvidia’s BlueField-4 DPU and three networking components, the ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, NVLink 6 Switch, and Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch all came out of Israel.
We have people in our Israel office who have been with the company for 20-25 years.","LAS VEGAS - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered rare insight into the company’s operations in Israel at a press conference during CES 2026 on Tuesday, emphasizing the central role the country plays in the world’s most valuable technology company. Nvidia, with a market capitalization of approximately $4.55 trillion, has been operating in Israel since its $6.9 billion acquisition of networking firm Mellanox in 2019. The acquisition transformed Mellanox’s Yokneam headquarters into Nvidia’s primary Israeli hub, which now employs roughly 3,000 of the company’s 5,000 Israeli staff.

“Our team in Israel is incredible. They're hardworking, they're smart, they're dedicated, they care about the company, they care about their people, they care about the country,” Huang said when asked about Nvidia’s presence in Israel. “The sacrifices they make for each other, for their country, is incredible, and we’ve been very, very successful there.”

Huang highlighted Israel’s role in the development of key Nvidia chips. “Nvidia’s BlueField-4 DPU and three networking components, the ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, NVLink 6 Switch, and Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch all came out of Israel. So, four out of six chips came out of Israel. Pretty amazing. And maybe next time, six out of six chips.”

The CEO also emphasized the company’s culture and approach to talent management. “Our turnover is incredibly low. You know, it’s probably one or two percent in Israel. People stay for a very long time. We have people in our Israel office who have been with the company for 20-25 years. This is quite an extraordinary thing. Our ability to attract great people is second to none, and our ability to retain them is absolutely world class.”

Huang connected these achievements to Nvidia’s broader corporate philosophy: “We dedicate ourselves to choosing good work for the company to do, that’s one of the responsibilities of the CEO, to choose what kind of work we should be doing and what kind of work we shouldn’t be doing. The quality of the work, the purpose of the company, all of it comes together, and it’s pretty magical in Israel.”

The praise comes amid Nvidia’s ongoing expansion in the country. Last month, the company formally confirmed plans to establish a 160,000-square-meter campus in Kiryat Tivon, expected to employ roughly 10,000 workers. The facility will be built on 90 dunams of state-owned land granted with an exemption from public tender, representing one of the largest private technology investments in Israel in recent years.

Nvidia’s Israeli operations now represent a central node for the company’s global hardware development. Huang’s remarks underline not only the technological importance of Israel’s workforce but also the strategic commitment Nvidia has made to the country, a hub for advanced networking, AI, and high-performance computing technologies.",https://pic1.calcalist.co.il/picserver3/crop_images/2026/01/06/HkxXFbZjEWg/HkxXFbZjEWg_0_108_3000_1689_0_large.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 13:14:24.839376

Since launching its in-store digital display network, Albertsons Media Collective has delivered strong results and attracted more than 50 unique advertising partners eager to tap into the power of retail media, while staying focused on rapid growth and expansion.

Unlike traditional attribution models that assign credit to purchases that may have occurred anyway, Albertsons Media Collective’s matched market framework measures the true incremental impact of in-store media, isolating the effect of advertising as the sole driver of lift. The incrementality solution operates at the store level, comparing sales performance in test stores exposed to ads against a rigorously selected set of control stores with no media exposure. By estimating the counterfactual, what would have happened without advertising, the model delivers a statistically validated measure of true lift.

Albertsons Media Collective, NBCUniversal debut CTV closed-loop measurement

Albertsons Media Collective’s in-store incrementality measurement addresses one of the industry’s most persistent challenges: accurately measuring in-store media, which operates outside the signal-rich, identity-connected environment of other digital channels. Designed specifically to alleviate this complexity, the matched market framework delivers true incrementality by attributing sales, orders and unit lift solely to media exposure rather than correlation. The solution leverages nearly 60 variables for advanced store-level matching to reduce bias and noise, scales nationally across diverse store formats and works across both existing and new in-store screens, including deli and pharmacy placements.

“For too long, in-store media has been measured with tools that confuse correlation for impact,” said Liz Roche, vice president of media and measurement at Albertsons Media Collective. “Our matched market incrementality approach cuts through that noise. By isolating causal lift at the store level, we’re showing brands the actual impact of in-store media activation—and giving them confidence that their investment is driving net-new sales. We look forward to advancing the measurement capabilities we offer in the future with closed-loop measurement, while remaining compliant with and closely aligning our measurement roadmap with IAB current and future standards for in-store media.”

Albertsons Media Collective cited a recent campaign for Mondelēz International that it said highlights the effectiveness of in-store media when measured through Albertsons Media Collective’s matched market incrementality framework.

Designed to promote Sargento Cheese Bakes, a snack cracker from Mondelēz, the campaign aimed to drive household penetration, category growth and incremental sales. Mondelēz integrated in-store digital screens with high-engagement onsite and offsite media to build awareness and drive conversion among Albertsons shoppers. The addition of in-store screens contributed to a significant sales lift, demonstrating the incremental value of in-store activation within an omnichannel strategy.

“In-store is one of the most influential moments in the path to purchase, but historically it’s been difficult to measure with precision,” said Melissa Pitmon, customer director, OmniChannel, Mondelēz. “Albertsons Media Collective’s matched market measurement gave us clear, causal insight into how in-store media drove incremental sales, helping us optimize with confidence and validate the true impact of our investment.”

Albertsons Media Collective is a full-funnel media platform that reaches known shoppers across channels, now complete with in-store media which unlocks the full power of the omnichannel experience at the moments closest to the point of purchase. After bringing incrementality onsite and offsite, bringing incremental results to in-store media helps advertising partners truly understand collective growth.

Given the strong in-store results achieved since the launch of the in-store digital display network, Albertsons Media Collective is focused on expansion. In 2026, the in-store fleet will include about 800 additional stores, offering scaled coverage and strategic continuity, with presence across 10 divisions.",https://drugstorenews.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/2026-01/albertsons_instore_news_image_2.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:02:10.606823
ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-07 15:42:28+00:00,Quartz,Nvidia is putting its AI muscle behind autonomous vehicles - Quartz,"Shannon Carroll, qz.com",,,,,https://qz.com/nvidia-mercedes-benz-cla-parternship-drive-av,"So why wouldn’t it want to take the wheel in the global autonomous vehicle push, too?
CEO Jensen Huang tells Xu that his job is “to make everything that moves autonomous.” This is a crucial start.
“Everything that moves will ultimately be fully autonomous,” he said, also framing the era shift toward “physical AI,” with autonomous vehicles as one of the three categories of “robots” that matter.
Autonomy has spent years as a promise; Nvidia wants it to behave like infrastructure.
L2++ gets Nvidia into real cars without demanding a leap of faith, and Alpamayo pushes the hardest problems upstream into models and simulation — where Nvidia’s advantage is already industrial.","Nvidia is everywhere. Its logo has become the watermark of modern computing. It sits under AI-era compute, cloud infrastructure, PC graphics, and the industrial automation that’s quietly remaking factories. So why wouldn’t it want to take the wheel in the global autonomous vehicle push, too?

But Nvidia isn’t really chasing “self-driving cars.” Nvidia is doing something closer to chasing autonomy as an industrial stack — a set of chips, models, simulation tools, and safety systems that other companies can plug into, iterate on, and ship, without betting their entire company on a robotaxi moonshot. That framing sounds semantic until you sit inside one of Nvidia’s demo vehicles and listen to the company’s automotive leadership talk like they’re building a supply chain, not a sci-fi future.

Now, Nvidia’s first big “in cars” proof point has a pilot: The company’s Drive AV software is launching in the all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan, with an enhanced Level 2 (Nvidia calls it L2++) point-to-point driver-assistance system that Nvidia expects will hit U.S. roads this year. Mercedes is selling the tech, which it calls MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO for $3,950 for three years in the U.S., with monthly and yearly pricing still to come; Tesla, meanwhile, sells its Full Self-Driving for $8,000 a year or $99 a month. That’s great business for Mercedes, but it says something bigger about the changing AV landscape. What Nvidia is launching is the kind of autonomy that could actually ship at scale: driver assistance that still assumes a human behind the wheel — but with tech that Nvidia says can improve over time through software; the MB.OS design is built to enable over-the-air updates for future upgrades and features.

At a recent San Francisco ride-along tied to the Mercedes-Benz demo, Nvidia executives framed the company’s automotive push as a full-stack effort: the in-car computer, the models, the validation loop, and the industrial-scale training infrastructure behind it.

Xinzhou Wu, who leads Nvidia’s automotive group, said at the demo that the partnership has been over four years in the running, a full-stack and multiyear proof point for that mass-market approach. Under the hood — literally — Wu described what Nvidia is running in the demo vehicles: a “hybrid stack” that pairs an end-to-end model with a more traditional, “classical” stack that’s already deployed in Mercedes vehicles in Europe. The coupling is the point: The end-to-end model drives a more humanlike feel; the classical stack provides an interpretable backstop, with a “safety monitor” choosing the safer trajectory.

Physical AI, Wu said, is “a deep problem to solve for the next decade."" That frame positions Nvidia as the one vendor already built to supply all three layers — vehicle compute, data-center compute, simulation — and it reframes the autonomy arms race as a compute and tooling problem more than a map-and-sensors problem. In that worldview, the winners are the companies that can compress the loop: train faster, simulate more edge cases, deploy more safely, and keep the system improving without breaking the trust contract with drivers.

CEO Jensen Huang tells Xu that his job is “to make everything that moves autonomous.” This is a crucial start.

Underneath the architecture

Nvidia’s AV push is built to scale through partnerships like the one with Mercedes — the company supplying the compute-heavy backbone and tooling, and the automaker owning the vehicle, the brand, and the customer relationship. During the CLA test drive, Ali Kani, Nvidia’s VP of automotive, described the system in the most Nvidia way possible: as something engineered end-to-end, trained on Nvidia infrastructure, tested in the cloud, and gated by the process.

In a separate briefing, Kani zoomed out to full Nvidia-prophetic. “Everything that moves will ultimately be fully autonomous,” he said, also framing the era shift toward “physical AI,” with autonomous vehicles as one of the three categories of “robots” that matter. The rhetoric is big — maybe too big in an era where people still don’t entirely trust this technology — but it fits the underlying strategy: autonomy becomes another domain where Nvidia can supply... everything.

The near-term version, though, stays grounded in passenger-car reality: driver assistance, careful safety layering, and a partnership model designed to scale. The company isn’t trying to wrestle control of the wheel, rather building the system that makes more of the drive feel automatic — and then building the compute loop that enables that capability to improve. The global AV push has plenty of contenders chasing the spotlight. Nvidia’s move is quieter, more infrastructural, and therefore perhaps more dangerous in the way that platform plays tend to be.

Alpamayo, the long-tail bet

If the Mercedes CLA launch is Nvidia’s “in cars” proof point, Alpamayo is the part where Nvidia tries to turn autonomy into an ecosystem — and keep its hands on the tooling that determines who’s getting behind the wheel next.

Alpamayo is billed as a family of open-source models, simulation tools, and datasets aimed at “safe, reasoning-based” autonomous driving — specifically the ugly, rare “long tail” cases that still break systems in ways that never show up in a glossy demo loop. Nvidia’s attempt to make “reasoning” a product layer in autonomy and to standardize the upstream toolchain that improves systems over time. The pitch is that traditional autonomy architectures split perception and planning in ways that can limit scalability when something weird happens; end-to-end learning has moved the ball, but edge cases still demand models that can reason about cause and effect when the situation falls outside training experience.

Alpamayo introduces “chain-of-thought, reasoning-based” vision-language-action (VLA) models designed to think through novel scenarios step by step, with improved explainability that is “critical to scaling trust and safety,” according to the company, and the whole effort is “underpinned by the NVIDIA Halos safety system.” CEO Jensen Huang is leaning all the way into the moment-language, calling it “the ChatGPT moment for physical AI,” and arguing that Alpamayo can help vehicles “think through rare scenarios” and “explain their driving decisions,” as “the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”

Nvidia says Alpamayo models are teacher models, “rather than running directly in-vehicle,” meant to be fine-tuned and distilled into the runtime backbones of complete AV stacks. That makes Alpamayo feel less like “new feature coming to your Mercedes” and more like Nvidia trying to standardize the way autonomy gets built — the same platform instinct, aimed at the training/simulation layer where Nvidia already knows how to win.

Autonomy has spent years as a promise; Nvidia wants it to behave like infrastructure. L2++ gets Nvidia into real cars without demanding a leap of faith, and Alpamayo pushes the hardest problems upstream into models and simulation — where Nvidia’s advantage is already industrial. If this play works, the most important autonomy company won’t be the one with the biggest fleet. It’ll be the one that makes everyone else’s autonomy ship.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/Mercedes-Benz%20CLA%20L2%20Image.jpg",N,,2026-01-07 13:02:56.526729

The chips promise to eliminate water chiller requirements in data centers, potentially disrupting an established supply chain built around traditional cooling infrastructure.

Key Takeaways:

Johnson Controls and Trane Technologies dropped 7.5% and 5.3% respectively, hitting multi-month lows after Huang’s CES remarks

Nvidia’s Vera Rubin platform, featuring six integrated chips now in full production, claims to eliminate water chiller needs in data center operations

Data centers contribute 10% of Trane Technologies’ revenue and low-double-digit percentages for Johnson Controls, putting substantial business at risk

Huang delivered his comments Monday evening at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where he revealed the Vera Rubin platform has entered full production ahead of its expected 2025 debut. His declaration that “no water chillers are necessary for data centres” sent immediate shockwaves through markets Tuesday morning.

Johnson Controls International plummeted to $112.40, while Trane Technologies sank to $370.40. Both companies ranked among the S&P 500’s worst performers for the session, reflecting investor concerns about their exposure to data center cooling contracts.

Barclays analysts, in research led by Julian Mitchell, acknowledged the gravity of Huang’s statements despite their initially dramatic tone. “Given the primacy of Nvidia to the whole AI ecosystem, one should not take their comments lightly,” they wrote, identifying the most vulnerable players in the cooling sector.

The investment bank’s analysis reveals varied exposure levels across manufacturers. Johnson Controls faces low-double-digit percentage dependence on data center sales, while Trane Technologies derives approximately 10% of revenue from this segment. Carrier Global, which saw shares decline 1.1%, has roughly 5% exposure.

Not every company in the infrastructure space faces headwinds from Nvidia’s announcement. Barclays pointed to potential beneficiaries, including nVent Electric, which avoids space cooling and chiller products but maintains solid positioning in data center liquid cooling systems. The firm’s shares edged 0.5% higher.

Vertiv Holdings, despite a 2.1% share decline, may also capitalize on the transition. The company brings established expertise in precision air cooling alongside competitive liquid cooling capabilities, positioning it to adapt as infrastructure requirements evolve.

The Vera Rubin platform combines six distinct Nvidia chips into an integrated system designed for AI workloads. The architecture apparently generates less heat than current solutions, enabling data centers to operate without traditional water-based cooling infrastructure that has dominated the industry for decades.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DH1L4415-HDR-20220527-r5-resize.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 12:01:07.474492

In Walmart U.S., grocery delivered a low single-digit comparable sales increase during the period, with growth in both transactions and unit volumes.

Grocery strength was led by fresh food sales, followed by pantry items. Consumables also posted growth, supported by categories such as personal care and beauty. Management noted that grocery performance remained broad-based, even as the company lapped prior-year impacts related to port disruptions.

Value execution remained a consistent theme in grocery during the quarter. Walmart had approximately 7,400 active rollbacks in Walmart U.S., with more than half of those rollbacks concentrated in grocery. The company reiterated that many of these Rollbacks are structured as 90-day price reductions, and management said that more than 2,000 rollbacks since the beginning of the year have transitioned into new everyday low prices.

Inflation levels in Walmart U.S. moderated during the quarter. Like-for-like inflation was 1.3% in Walmart U.S., with food and general merchandise inflation running at low single-digit levels. Grocery performance also benefited from Walmart’s omnichannel execution. Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales increased 28% in the quarter, with management highlighting strong growth in store-fulfilled pickup and delivery. Nearly 50% growth was reported in store-fulfilled delivery, and management stated that approximately 35% of store-fulfilled digital orders were delivered in under three hours during the quarter.

Walmart U.S. saw share gains across income brackets in the third quarter, including higher-income households. Grocery was cited alongside health and wellness and general merchandise as categories contributing to those gains. Overall, grocery appears to be a consistent traffic driver within Walmart U.S., supported by price rollbacks, everyday low pricing and improving fulfillment speed.

The Notes will not be listed on any U.S. securities exchange or quotation system. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these Notes or determined that this pricing supplement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The Notes constitute our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.

SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS OF THE NOTES

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying prospectus supplement, the following provisions will apply for purposes of the Notes.

Market Disruption Events

If the Calculation Agent determines that, on the Initial Valuation Date or any Observation Date (each, a “Valuation Date”), a Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing with respect to the Underlier, that Valuation Date will be postponed to the immediately succeeding Index Business Day (as defined under “Information Regarding the Underlier” in this pricing supplement) on which no Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing. In no event, however, will a Valuation Date be postponed by more than five scheduled Index Business Days. If the Calculation Agent determines that a Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing with respect to the Underlier on that fifth day, the Calculation Agent will determine the Closing Value of the Underlier for that fifth day in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.

If any Observation Date is postponed, the relevant Contingent Coupon Payment Date will be postponed such that the number of business days from the Observation Date to the Contingent Coupon Payment Date remains the same.

With respect to the Notes, a “Market Disruption Event” means:

●the occurrence of a Trading Disruption Event, an Index Market Disruption Event or an Index Disruption Event (each as defined and described under “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement); or

●the failure of the Index Sponsor to calculate and publish the official closing level of the Underlier on an Index Business Day

in each case as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion.

Discontinuation of the Underlier; Alteration of Methodology or Calculation of the Underlier

If the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Underlier and the Index Sponsor or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the discontinued Index (such index being referred to herein as a “Successor Index”), then the Closing Value of the Underlier on any relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined will be determined by reference to the level of that Successor Index at the time of daily final publication, or close of trading on the relevant exchange or market for that Successor Index, as applicable, on that date. If a Successor Index is selected by the Calculation Agent, the Successor Index will be used as a substitute for the Underlier for all purposes under the Notes, and the Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion adjust any variable described in this pricing supplement, including but not limited to any level (including but not limited to the Initial Underlier Value, the Coupon Barrier Value, the Barrier Value, the Final Underlier Value and the Closing Value on any relevant date), or any combination thereof. The Calculation Agent will make any such adjustment with a view to offsetting, to the extent practicable, any difference in the relative levels of the Index and the Successor Index at the time the Index is replaced by the Successor Index.

If an Index Cancellation occurs on or prior to any Observation Date or any other relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined and is continuing on that date, then the Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion determine to compute the Closing Value of the Underlier in accordance with the formula for and method of calculating the Underlier or Successor Index, as applicable, last in effect prior to that Index Cancellation.

An “Index Cancellation” will occur if (a) the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Closing Value of the Underlier on or prior to any Observation Date (or any other relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined) and that discontinuation is continuing on that day and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Index is available at that time or (b) the Calculation Agent has previously selected a Successor Index and publication of that Successor Index is discontinued prior to, and that discontinuation is continuing on, any Observation Date (or any other relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined).

If at any time the method of calculating the Underlier or a Successor Index, or the level thereof, is changed in a material respect, or if the Underlier or a Successor Index is in any other way modified such that the Underlier or that Successor Index does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the level of the Underlier or that Successor Index had those changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion determine to make such calculations and adjustments as the Calculation Agent determines may be necessary in order to arrive at a level for the Underlier or Successor Index comparable to the Underlier or Successor Index, as the case may be, as if those changes or modifications had not been made, and determine whether the Notes are automatically redeemed and calculate the payment at maturity or any other payment to be made on the Notes with reference to the Underlier (or Successor Index), as adjusted.

Material Index Amendment Events

If a Material Index Amendment Event occurs prior to the Final Valuation Date, the Calculation Agent may elect in its sole discretion to cause the Maturity Date to be accelerated to a date no later than the tenth business day following the occurrence of that Material Index Amendment Event. In the event of such an acceleration, the amount payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date as so

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-18 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENTS DURING THE TERM OF THE NOTES

The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value: 100.00*

■Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

■You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are not automatically redeemed.

* The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of 100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial Underlier Value or Coupon Barrier Value. The actual Initial Underlier Value will be equal to the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value will be equal to 70.00% of the Initial Underlier Value.

For information regarding recent values of the Underlier, please see “Historical and Hypothetical Historical Performance of the Underlier” in this pricing supplement.

Example 1: The Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the first and second Observation Dates, but the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each other Observation Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on each of the first and second Observation Dates, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $11.958 per $1,000 principal amount Note (1.1958% of the principal amount) on each related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on the remaining Observation Dates, the Contingent Coupons applicable to those Observation Dates will not be payable at any time.

Example 2: The Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on the second through fifty-ninth Observation Dates, but the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than the Coupon Barrier Value on the first and final Observation Dates.

Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the first Observation Date, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $11.958 per $1,000 principal amount Note (1.1958% of the principal amount) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on the second through fifty-ninth Observation Dates, the Contingent Coupons applicable to those Observation Dates will not be payable on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Dates; however, because the Closing Value of the Underlier on the final Observation Date is greater than the Coupon Barrier Value, the Contingent Coupons that would have been paid on the second through fifty-ninth Contingent Coupon Payment Dates had the Closing Value of the Underlier been greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the second through fifty-ninth Observation Dates will be paid on the final Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY

The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value: 100.00*

■Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

■Hypothetical Barrier Value: 50.00 (50.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

■You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT automatically redeemed.

* The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of 50.00 have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial Underlier Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value. The actual Initial Underlier Value will be equal to the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value will be equal to 70.00% and 50.00%, respectively, of the Initial Underlier Value.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated:

Example 1: The value of the Underlier increases from an Initial Underlier Value of 100.00 to a Final Underlier Value of 150.00.

Because the Final Underlier Value is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon and any Unpaid Contingent Coupons otherwise due).

Example 1 demonstrates that you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Underlier. Even though the Underlier appreciated significantly, the payment at maturity is limited to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon and any Unpaid Contingent Coupons otherwise due).

Example 2: The value of the Underlier decreases from an Initial Underlier Value of 100.00 to a Final Underlier Value of 80.00.

Because the Final Underlier Value is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon and any Unpaid Contingent Coupons otherwise due).

INFORMATION REGARDING THE UNDERLIER

The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index (the “Index”) is a rules-based proprietary index created and owned by Barclays Bank PLC. The Index is operated by Barclays Index Administration, a distinct function within Barclays Bank PLC (in such capacity, the “Index Sponsor”). The Index Sponsor has appointed a third party, MerQube, Inc. (together with any successor thereto, the “Index Calculation Agent”), to calculate and maintain the Index. The Index is reported by Bloomberg under the ticker symbol “BXIIUT4E.”

The Index attempts to provide variable exposure of up to 400% to the Barclays US Tech Tracker ER Index (the “Futures Index”), with greater exposure when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively lower (subject to the maximum exposure of 400%) and lesser exposure when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively higher (subject to a minimum exposure of 100%). The Futures Index tracks the excess return of a notional rolling position in the first nearby futures contract on the Nasdaq-100 Index® (the “Reference Index”). For more information about the Futures Index, see “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Background on the Barclays US Tech Tracker ER Index” in the accompanying underlying supplement. The Reference Index is designed to measure the performance of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. For more information about the Reference Index, see “Indices—The Nasdaq-100 Index®” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

The Index is subject to a 6% per annum decrement, deducted daily. The decrement will offset appreciation of the Futures Index, heighten depreciation of the Futures Index and generally act as a drag on the performance of the Index. The Index will trail the performance of an identical index without a decrement.

The Index applies an exposure (the “Index Exposure”) of between 100% and 400% to the Futures Index, with the aim of increasing exposure (subject to the maximum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively lower and decreasing exposure (subject to the minimum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively higher. The Index Exposure is not adjusted according to a predetermined schedule. Instead, on each Index Business Day (as defined below), the Index determines a new target exposure to the Futures Index, but the Index Exposure will be adjusted only if the new target exposure differs sufficiently from the current Index Exposure. Otherwise, the Index will maintain its current Index Exposure.

On each Index Business Day, the target exposure of the Index to the performance of the Futures Index on the following Index Business Day is set equal to (a) a volatility level of 40% (the “volatility threshold”) divided by (b) the realized volatility of the Futures Index, subject to a maximum exposure of 400% and a minimum exposure of 100%. The Index’s target exposure to the Futures Index will equal the maximum exposure of 400% when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is less than or equal to 10% and will equal the minimum exposure of 100% when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is greater than or equal to 40%. The Index’s target exposure to the Futures Index will be between 400% and 100% when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is between 10% and 40%. For example, if the realized volatility of the Futures Index is equal to 20%, the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index will equal 200% (or 40% / 20%). No assurance can be provided that the realized volatility of the Index will approximate the volatility threshold. The realized volatility of the Index may be greater or less than the volatility threshold, perhaps significantly.

The Index Exposure remains unchanged on each Index Business Day, unless a newly calculated target exposure based on the realized volatility of the Futures Index on a subsequent Index Business Day would be, on an absolute basis, 40% or more above or below the current Index Exposure. For example, if the Index Exposure is 200%, the Index Exposure will remain unchanged unless the target exposure is greater than 240% or less than 160%. If an Index Exposure adjustment is triggered, the Index will adjust the Index Exposure on the immediately following Index Business Day (a “Rebalancing Day”), subject to the occurrence of a Trading Disruption Event (as defined and described under “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index” in the accompanying underlying supplement).

The Index Calculation Agent began calculating the Index on a live basis on April 22, 2025.

“Index Business Day” means any day on which the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (or any successor thereto) is scheduled to be open for business for equity futures contracts.

The Index is an “excess return” index, and not a “total return” index, because the Futures Index provides notional exposure to futures contract returns that reflect changes in the price of those futures contracts and does not reflect interest that could be earned on funds notionally committed to the trading of futures contracts, resulting in an implicit financing cost.

Certain features of the Index, including the decrement described above, are designed to make it possible for certain economic terms of the Notes to be more favorable to you than would otherwise be the case, all else being equal. However, there can be no assurance that these more favorable terms will offset the negative effects of these features on the performance of the Index, and your return on the Notes may ultimately be less favorable than it would have been without these more favorable terms but with an index that does not contain these features.

The Index is subject to risks associated with the use of significant leverage. When leverage is employed, any movements in the values of the Futures Index will result in greater changes in the value of the Index than if leverage were not used. In particular, the use of leverage will magnify any negative performance of the Futures Index, which, in turn, would negatively affect the performance of the Index. The use of leverage will cause the volatility of the Index to be greater, perhaps

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Underlier, the Futures Index, the Reference Index or their components. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss—The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not automatically redeemed, and if the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Underlier from the Initial Underlier Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes—The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date a Contingent Coupon plus all previously Unpaid Contingent Coupons, if any, only if the Closing Value of the Underlier on an Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Underlier on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date will not be payable on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If a Contingent Coupon is not paid on any Contingent Coupon Payment Date, that Contingent Coupon will be paid as an Unpaid Contingent Coupon on a later Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of the Underlier on a subsequent Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

●Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of the Underlier—The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Underlier, which may be significant, even though you will be fully exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Underlier from the Initial Underlier Value if the Notes are not automatically redeemed and the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value.

●Your Potential Return on the Notes Will Be Different Depending on the Sequence of Closing Value of the Underlier on Different Observation Dates—Depending on the sequence in which the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on specific Observation Dates (if at all), you could receive a lesser or greater return regardless of the number of Observation Dates on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. For example, if the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each of the first fifty-nine Observation Dates but is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the final Observation Date, you will receive sixty Contingent Coupons (fifty-nine in the form of Unpaid Contingent Coupons). However, if the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on each of the first two Observation Dates but on no subsequent Observation Dates, you will receive only two Contingent Coupons, even though the Closing Value of the Underlier was greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on twice as many Observation Dates as in the previous example.

●Automatic Redemption and Reinvestment Risk—If the Notes are automatically redeemed, the holding period over which you may receive Contingent Coupons could be as short as approximately one year. The payment upon an automatic redemption, together with any Contingent Coupons that you may have received on prior Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been automatically redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are automatically redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after an automatic redemption. The automatic redemption feature of the Notes may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Underlier on the Dates Specified—Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the Underlier determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of the Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Automatic Redemption—You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any automatic redemption. If you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of the Underlier has increased from the Initial Underlier Value. See “—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk—Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The Contingent Coupon is determined based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Underlier. The Contingent Coupon will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would be if the level of expected volatility of the Underlier taken into account in determining the terms of the Notes were lower. As volatility of the Underlier increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of the Underlier on one or more Observation Dates will be less than the Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Underlier Value will be less than the Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher Contingent Coupon reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive Contingent Coupons with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the Contingent Coupon been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive Contingent Coupons and/or that you will lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

●Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Futures Contracts Composing the Futures Index or the Securities Composing the Reference Index—The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or the securities composing the Reference Index. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have any rights with respect to the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the securities composing the Reference Index would have.

●Tax Treatment—Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer—The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier Generally

●The Index May Not Be Successful or Outperform Any Alternative Investment Strategy That Might Be Employed with Respect to the Futures Index—There can be no assurance that the investment strategy on which the Index is based will be successful or that the Index will outperform any alternative strategy that might be employed with respect to the Futures Index.

●The Value of the Index Will Reflect a 6% per Annum Decrement, Deducted Daily—The performance of the Index will be reduced by the decrement of 6% per annum, deducted daily. As a result of the decrement, the Index performance will trail that of a hypothetical, identically constituted index from which no such decrement is deducted.

The decrement will place a significant drag on the performance of the Index, potentially offsetting positive returns on the Index’s investment strategy, exacerbating negative returns of its investment strategy and causing the value of the Index to decline steadily if the return of its investment strategy is relatively flat. The Index will not appreciate unless the return of its investment strategy is sufficient to offset the negative effect of the decrement, and then only to the extent that the return of its investment strategy is greater than the decrement. As a result of the decrement, the value of the Index may decline even if the return of its investment strategy is positive.

●The Index Is Subject to Risks Associated with the Use of Significant Leverage—The Index applies an exposure of between 100% and 400% to the Futures Index, with the aim of increasing exposure (subject to the maximum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively lower and decreasing exposure (subject to the minimum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively higher. Under normal market conditions in the past, the Futures Index has tended to exhibit a realized volatility below 40%. Accordingly, based on hypothetical back-tested and historical performance, the Index has

generally employed leverage in the past, except during periods of elevated volatility. When leverage is employed, any movements in the value of the Futures Index will result in greater changes in the value of the Index than if leverage were not used. In particular, the use of leverage will magnify any negative performance of the Futures Index, as well as the negative effect of the implicit financing cost embedded in the Futures Index, which, in turn, would negatively affect the performance of the Index. The use of leverage will cause the volatility of the Index to be greater, perhaps significantly greater, than the volatility of the Futures Index, and no assurance can be given that the annualized realized volatility of the Index will approximate the volatility threshold of 40%. The exposure of the Index to the Futures Index may be relatively high during periods of negative performance of the Futures Index and/or relatively low during periods of positive performance of the Futures Index, which would adversely affect the performance of the Index, perhaps significantly. In situations where a significant increase in volatility of the Futures Index is accompanied by a significant decline in the value of the Futures Index, the value of the Index may decline significantly before the next Rebalancing Day when the Index’s exposure to the Futures Index would be reduced. If, on any Index Business Day, the value of the Index as calculated is negative or zero, the value of the Index on that Index Business Day will be zero, and the value of the Index will stay at zero. In this scenario, you will not receive any further Contingent Coupons and you will lose the entire principal amount of your Notes at maturity.

●The Index Is Subject to Risks Associated with Its Methodology for Setting the Index Exposure—No assurance can be given that the Index’s methodology for setting the Index Exposure will be successful or outperform any alternative strategy that might be employed with respect to setting the Index Exposure.

On each Index Business Day, the target exposure of the Index to the performance of the Futures Index on the following Index Business Day is set equal to (a) the volatility threshold of 40% divided by (b) the realized volatility of the Futures Index, subject to a maximum exposure of 400% and a minimum exposure of 100%. On any Index Business Day, the realized volatility of the Futures Index used to determine the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index on the following Index Business Day is equal to the lower of the short-term realized volatility of the Futures Index and the long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index. The short-term realized volatility and long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index on an Index Business Day are calculated based on the daily returns of the Futures Index from the base date of the Index to that Index Business Day, with half-lives of 5 and 21 Index Business Days, respectively.

There is no guarantee that the methodology used by the Index to determine the realized volatility of the Futures Index will be representative of the realized volatility that the Futures Index will experience. Realized volatility is backward looking, and there is no guarantee that trends exhibited by historical realized volatility will continue in the future. In addition, the volatility of the Futures Index on any day may change quickly and unexpectedly, but it may take time for the realized volatility referenced by the Index to fully reflect those changes and for the target exposure of the Index to be adjusted accordingly. In particular, since the Index references the lower of the short-term and the long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index, if the short-term realized volatility of the Futures Index increases suddenly, the Index’s target exposure to the Futures Index may not be reduced unless and until the long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index also increases. In addition, the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index will not be further reduced when the realized volatility of the Futures Index exceeds 40% due to the minimum exposure, and the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index will not be further increased when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is below 10% due to the maximum exposure. Furthermore, the Index Exposure will be adjusted only if the newly calculated target exposure is, on an absolute basis, 40% or more above or below the current Index Exposure.

●The Index May Be Adversely Affected by a “Volatility Drag” Effect—The Index may be subject to a “volatility drag” effect due to the resetting leveraged exposure to the Futures Index. The drag effect is likely to occur when the value of the Futures Index moves in one direction prior to an Index Exposure adjustment and the other direction following that Index Exposure adjustment. Resetting the exposure of the Index after an increase but in advance of a decline in the Futures Index would cause the Index to have increased exposure to that decline, and resetting the exposure following a decline but in advance of an increase in the Futures Index would cause the Index to have decreased exposure to that increase. The more this fact pattern repeats, the lower the performance of the Index will be relative to the performance of the Futures Index. The Index may rebalance as frequently as daily, and the Index may be subject to a greater drag effect compared with an identical index that rebalances less frequently.

●The Index Sponsor Will Have the Authority to Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Closing Value of the Index and the Amount Payable on the Notes and Their Market Value and Create Conflicts of Interest—The Index Sponsor, a distinct function within Barclays Bank PLC, is responsible for the operation of the Index, and the policies of the Index Sponsor concerning the calculation of the Closing Value of the Index could affect the Closing Value of the Index and, therefore, the amount payable on the Notes at maturity and the market value of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity.

The Index Sponsor may modify the methodology for calculating the Closing Value of the Index. In addition, as described in “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement, the Index Sponsor may make certain changes to the way in which the Index is calculated. For example, the Index Sponsor may discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of the Index upon the occurrence of certain market disruptions or other events, in which case it may become difficult to determine the Closing Value of the Index and the value of the Notes. In addition, the Index Sponsor may replace the Futures Index as the underlying index if a material change is made to the calculation methodology of the Futures Index or the Reference Index. The replacement underlying index may perform significantly worse than the Futures Index. Any such changes could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The circumstances in which the Index Sponsor might make any such a determination are described more fully under “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The

Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

In addition, if a modification to the Index or the Futures Index constitutes a Material Index Amendment Event, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly. See “Supplemental Terms of the Notes—Material Index Amendment Events” above.

The role played by the Index Sponsor, and the exercise of the kinds of discretion described above and in the section entitled “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement, could present it with significant conflicts of interest in light of the fact that Barclays Bank PLC is the issuer of the Notes. The Index Sponsor has no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into consideration at any time.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs—Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or the Underlier or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●The Index Has a Limited Performance History—The Index Calculation Agent began calculating the Index on a live basis on April 22, 2025, and the Index Sponsor has published limited information about how the Index might have performed had it been calculated in the past. Because the Index is new and limited historical performance data exists, your investment in the Notes may involve a greater risk than investing in alternate securities linked to one or more indices with an established record of performance. A longer history of actual performance would be helpful in providing more reliable information on which to assess the validity of the methodology that the Index uses as the basis for an investment decision.

●Hypothetical Back-Tested Data Relating to the Index Does Not Represent Actual Historical Data and Is Subject to Inherent Limitations—All data relating to the period prior to the launch date of the Index, including the table and graphs set forth under “Historical and Hypothetical Historical Performance of the Underlier” below, is purely theoretical and does not represent the actual historical performance of the Index and has not been verified by an independent third party. The information is based on a hypothetical estimate by the Index Sponsor using available historical data as to how the Index may have performed in the pre-launch date period. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions may produce different hypothetical historical information that might prove to be more appropriate and that might differ significantly from the hypothetical historical information set forth under “Historical and Hypothetical Historical Performance of the Underlier” below. In addition, back-tested, hypothetical historical results have inherent limitations. These back-tested results are achieved by means of a retroactive application of a back-tested model designed with the benefit of hindsight. Hypothetical back-tested data should not be taken as an indication of future performance.

●Historical or Hypothetical Historical Levels of the Index Should Not Be Taken as an Indication of the Future Performance of the Index During the Term of the Notes—The actual performance of the Index over the term of the Notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, may bear little relation to the historical or hypothetical historical levels of the Index. Past fluctuations and trends in the Index are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations or trends that may occur in the future.

●The Index Is Not Actively Managed—The Index operates by pre-determined rules, as described under “Information Regarding the Underlier” in this pricing supplement. There will be no active management of the Index to enhance returns or limit losses. An actively managed investment may potentially respond more directly and appropriately to immediate market, political, economic, financial or other factors than the non-actively managed Index, which may adversely affect the Closing Value of the Index and the value of the Notes.

●The Index Is Comprised of Synthetic Assets and Liabilities—The exposure to the Futures Index at any given time is purely synthetic and will exist solely in the records maintained by or on behalf of the Index Sponsor. There is no actual portfolio of assets to which any person or entity is entitled or in which any person or entity has any ownership interest. Consequently, no person or entity will have any claim against any of the components of the Futures Index or the Reference Index at any time.

Risks Relating to the Futures Index

●The Futures Index Reflects the Price Return of the Futures Contracts Composing the Futures Index, Not the Total Return—The performance of the Index, and therefore the return on the Notes, is based on the performance of the Futures Index, which reflects changes in the market prices of the futures contracts composing the Futures Index and positive or negative yields associated with rolling those futures contracts. The Futures Index (and, in turn, the Index) is not a “total return” index that, in addition to reflecting those price and roll returns, would also reflect interest on a hypothetical cash position collateralizing the futures contracts composing the Futures Index. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature.

●Adjustments to the Futures Index Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes—The sponsor of the Futures Index may add, delete, substitute or adjust the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or make other methodological changes to the

Futures Index that could affect its performance, and the sponsor of the Reference Index may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing the Reference Index or make other methodological changes to the Reference Index that could affect the performance of the Futures Index. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the Futures Index and, consequently, the value of the Notes.

●The Performance of the Futures Index Will Differ from the Performance of the Reference Index—A variety of factors can lead to a disparity between the performance of an equity index futures contract and its reference index, including the expected dividend yields of the equity securities included in the reference index, an implicit financing cost associated with the futures contract and policies of the exchange on which the futures contracts are traded, such as margin requirements. A decline in expected dividends yields or an increase in margin requirements may adversely affect the performance of the Futures Index. In addition, the implicit financing cost will negatively affect the performance of the Futures Index, with a greater negative effect when market interest rates are higher. During periods of high market interest rates, the Futures Index is likely to underperform the Reference Index, perhaps significantly. The negative effect of the implicit financing cost will be magnified when the Index is exposed on a leveraged basis to the Futures Index.

●Negative Roll Returns Associated with the Futures Contracts Composing the Futures Index May Adversely Affect the Value of the Futures Index and the Value of the Notes—Unlike equity securities, the futures contracts composing the Futures Index, by their terms, have stated expirations. As the futures contracts composing the Futures Index approach expiration, they are replaced by contracts of the same series that have a later expiration. For example, a futures contract notionally purchased and held in June may specify a September expiration date. As time passes, the contract expiring in September is replaced by a contract for delivery in December. This is accomplished by notionally selling the September contract and notionally purchasing the December contract. This process is referred to as “rolling.” Excluding other considerations, if prices are higher in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months, the notional purchase of the December contract would take place at a price that is higher than the price of the September contract, thereby creating a negative “roll return.” Negative roll returns adversely affect the returns on the futures contracts composing the Futures Index and, therefore, the value of the Futures Index and any payments on, and the value of, the Notes. Because of the potential effects of negative roll returns, it is possible for the value of the Futures Index to decrease significantly over time, even when the levels of the Reference Index are stable or increasing.

●The Futures Index Is Subject to Significant Risks Associated with Futures Markets—Futures markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, the participation of speculators and government regulation and intervention. In addition, futures exchanges generally have regulations that limit the amount of the futures contract price fluctuations that may occur in a single day. These limits are generally referred to as “daily price fluctuation limits” and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of those limits is referred to as a “limit price.” Once the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond the limit, or trading may be limited for a set period of time. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of contracts at potentially disadvantageous times or prices. These circumstances could delay the calculation of the value of the Futures Index. These factors and others can cause the prices of the futures contracts composing the Futures Index to be volatile and could adversely affect the value of the Futures Index and any payments on, and the value of, your Notes.

●There Are Risks Associated with Investments in Securities Linked to the Value of Non-U.S. Equity Securities—Some of the equity securities composing the Reference Index are issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Furthermore, the role played by Barclays Index Administration in its role as Index Sponsor creates additional conflicts of interest. See “—Risks Relating to the Underlier Generally—The Index Sponsor Will Have the Authority to Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Closing Value of the Index and the Amount Payable on the Notes and their Market Value and Create Conflicts of Interest” above.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe value and expected volatility of the Underlier;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

odividend rates on the securities included in the Reference Index;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes—The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing topurchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.”

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss if you hold the Notes for more than one year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-07 11:03:02.761420

Enjoy the ride with Eli Lilly while it lasts While there is no way to predict the future, Eli Lilly faces very clear risks.","Eli Lilly's (LLY +3.52%) stock price has increased by approximately 35% over the past year. It has risen nearly 200% over the past three years. And it has rallied more than 500% over the past five years. If you bought this stock five years ago, you have benefited from its skyrocketing rise. What's behind this performance, and can it last?

Eli Lilly takes the lead from Novo Nordisk

The big story surrounding Eli Lilly is its leading position in the GLP-1 weight loss drug market. Its two GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, have been massive hits. In fact, in the third quarter of 2025, Mounjaro's sales rose a huge 109% year over year. That astounding growth was eclipsed by Zepbound, which saw sales increase a shocking 185% in the quarter.

Sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound have been such a powerful driver of Eli Lilly's performance that they made up 57% of the company's sales in the third quarter of 2025. What's interesting here is that Eli Lilly was actually the second pharmaceutical company to market with a GLP-1 drug. The first to market was Novo Nordisk (NVO +1.92%).

The facts just laid out set the stage for the story behind the hidden risk that investors face with Eli Lilly's soaring stock. The unfortunate part is that the risk is, really, just business as usual in the highly competitive, technical, and regulated healthcare sector.

What happens if Eli Lilly isn't the GLP-1 king?

It is clear that Wall Street is rewarding Eli Lilly for its dominance in the GLP-1 space. While the stock's 53 times price-to-earnings ratio isn't out of line with its five-year average for this metric, it is far above the average pharma stock's P/E of around 30 times. If that dominance were to be challenged or lost, investors would likely react by repricing the shares, ultimately affording them a lower valuation.

The first sign of such a threat is already here, as Novo Nordisk received FDA approval to sell a pill version of its GLP-1 drug. GLP-1 shots have been a bit hit, but people prefer pills over shots. It wouldn't be surprising to see Novo Nordisk's pill regain some market share from Eli Lilly. This type of innovation is relatively common in the pharmaceutical industry. Eli Lilly's GLP-1 offering was, basically, just a better product, and it quickly gained a leading market position.

There's a very real possibility that Eli Lilly's GLP-1 drugs could lose ground to a more effective weight loss drug or a more convenient delivery method. To be fair, Eli Lilly isn't sitting around doing nothing. It is also working on a pill, but so are other companies.

For example, Pfizer (PFE +0.71%) just acquired a company with a promising weight-loss drug pipeline, and it agreed to distribute a Chinese company's GLP-1 pill if that pill is approved.

This risk is exacerbated by the fact that Eli Lilly is so heavily reliant on GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound to support its top line. However, there's a risk to consider even if Eli Lilly remains the dominant GLP-1 company. Pharmaceutical companies are granted a time-limited period of exclusivity to sell drugs they discover. That's meant to help the companies recoup the costs of developing important drugs. When patent protection expires, however, companies often face what is known as a patent cliff.

A patent cliff occurs when generic versions of a blockbuster drug begin to pull sales away from the original blockbuster. While Eli Lilly has a while to go before it faces a patent cliff with Mounjaro and Zepbound, it is inevitable that it will eventually face one. Given the importance of these two drugs to the company's income statement, the loss of patent protection will pose a significant problem.

Enjoy the ride with Eli Lilly while it lasts

While there is no way to predict the future, Eli Lilly faces very clear risks. None of the risks, however, is unusual for a drug company. The major issue is that the risks are exacerbated by the significance of Mounjaro and Zepbound to Eli Lilly's business. If you own or buy Eli Lilly because of its leading position in the GLP-1 drug space, you should carefully consider a future in which the company's GLP-1 drugs aren't as important to the world and the company as they are today.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849520%2F25_02_28-people-in-business-attire-leaving-the-starting-line-on-a-track-_mf-dload-gettyimages-89285817-1200x800-5b2df79.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-07 11:03:30.094422

Historical exploration efforts culminated in a historical mineral resource estimate published by the Slovak Geological institute in 1992 (see ""Historical Resource Estimates"" in the press release issued today).
For additional information relating to the historical estimate see below under the heading ""Historical Resource Estimates"".
The current drill program supports this work by seeking to confirm historical results and validate preliminary resource models.
""Hatch brings the depth, discipline, and proven execution capability required to responsibly deliver the Stibnite Gold Project,"" said Jon Cherry, President and CEO of Perpetua Resources.","The Western world is entering a strategic race to secure domestic supplies of critical minerals, creating a compelling opportunity set for investors focused on resource security and long-term value for active miners that include Military Metals Corp. (OTCQB: MILIF) (CSE: MILI), Perpetua Resources Corp. (NASDAQ: PPTA) (TSX: PPTA), United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE American: UAMY), MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML). Antimony and gold are moving to the forefront as strategically vital materials: antimony for defense systems, semiconductors, and advanced energy applications, and gold for financial stability, electronics, and secure communications. With global supply highly concentrated outside the U.S. and its allies, these markets are increasingly shaped by geopolitical risk, positioning domestic producers as scarce, strategic assets with growing pricing power. Chinese export restrictions of metals such as antimony have further exposed the vulnerability of Western supply chains, reinforcing the urgency for domestically anchored alternatives. From a market value perspective, critical minerals represent a rapidly expanding investment theme measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars globally, with demand expected to accelerate through the next decade. Gold remains one of the largest and most liquid commodity markets in the world, valued in the trillions with consistent institutional demand, while antimony—though smaller in absolute size—commands premium pricing due to its limited supply base and lack of substitutes in many defense and industrial applications. As supply constraints tighten and governments prioritize secure sourcing, both metals are poised to benefit from structurally higher prices and long-term demand visibility, enhancing project economics for domestic producers. Securing domestic supply from allied jurisdictions has become a cornerstone of this strategy, reinforcing resilience by prioritizing production in politically stable, transparent, and defense-aligned countries.

For investors, the U.S. government's evolving approach significantly improves the risk-reward profile of domestic critical minerals projects. Direct federal support—through grants, low-cost financing, offtake agreements, and potential equity participation—is reducing capital risk and accelerating development timelines. Complementary policies such as tax incentives, permitting reform, Defense Production Act funding, and strategic stockpiling are creating clearer demand signals and more predictable revenue frameworks. As capital increasingly flows toward assets aligned with national security and supply chain resilience, domestic antimony and gold projects offer investors exposure to policy-backed growth, downside protection, and the potential for premium valuations as strategic scarcity intensifies.

Military Metals Drills 23.2 Meters of 2.22% Antimony including 7.9 Meters of 4.9% Antimony and 23.2 Meters of 1.27 g/t Gold Including 6.2 Meters of 3.17 g/t Gold at Flagship Trojarová Project - Military Metals Corp. (CSE: MILI) (OTCQB: MILIF) (FSE: QN90) (the ""Company"" or ""MILI""), is pleased to report the first analytical results of the Company's definition drilling campaign at the 100% owned flagship Trojarová Antimony Gold Project (the ""Project"") in Slovakia as announced on November 4, 2025. The holes were designed to confirm historical drilling results and to support SLR Consulting's work towards establishing a current mineral resource estimate on the Project. These priority assay results represent the main mineralized zone from the first hole of the program, 25-TVA-001.

Highlights of the Results from hole 25-TVA-001 Include:

23.2 drilled meters (m) of 2.22 % Antimony (Sb) over a true width of 20.1m from 144.3m to 167.5m

Including: 7.9m of 4.9% Sb over a true width of 6.8m from 152.7m to 160.6m

23.2m of 1.27 g/t Gold (Au) over a true width of 20.1m from 144.3m to 167.5m

Including: 6.2m of 3.17 g/t Au over true width of 5.4m from 160.6m to 166.8m

Scott Eldridge, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, ""We are thrilled by these first results from the Trojarová Antimony Gold Project confirmation drilling campaign. This validation of the quality and continuity of historical results provides crucial confidence as we proceed with the completion of the project's first modern Mineral Resource Estimate which is expected to be completed by SLR Consulting this quarter. We are confirming that Trojarová hosts antimony mineralization consistent with earlier work but now supported by contemporary assays. In the context of Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act, these results underscore Trojarová's potential to become a strategically important antimony project for the European Union at a time when secure, domestic supply of critical minerals has never been more important. Trojarová stands out as the only known antimony project in Europe with extensive historical drilling that can now be supported by modern drilling and assays. This combination significantly enhances the project's strategic relevance as the EU works to secure reliable, home-grown supply of critical minerals.""

The Company is working to complete the logging and sampling of the remaining drill core and to expedite the release of complete assay results as quickly as possible. Further details of the complete drill program will be included in future releases as the campaign's data is verified and finalized including professional location surveys of final drillhole collar locations.

The complete results, (outlined in Table 1 to be viewed in actual press release), show a distinct metal zonation within the main zone. Antimony and gold mineralization are consistently present throughout the main zone with a distinct 7.9m interval of Antimony enrichment from 152.7m to 160.6m immediately overlying a 6.2m interval of gold enrichment between 160.6m and 166.8m. Antimony values in the enriched interval range from 0.76% to 12.8%. Gold values in the enriched interval range from 1.26 g/t to 10.45 g/t.

History of the Project and Historical Resource - Discovered nearly fifty years ago, Trojarová was the focus of extensive surface and underground exploration over 2km of strike length between 1983 and 1995, including 63 diamond drillholes totaling 14,330 meters, and 1.7 kilometers of underground workings. Historical exploration efforts culminated in a historical mineral resource estimate published by the Slovak Geological institute in 1992 (see ""Historical Resource Estimates"" in the press release issued today). Per this historical estimate, at a cut-off grade of 1.0% antimony, Trojarová hosts 2.46 million tonnes averaging 2.47% antimony and 0.635 grams per tonne gold in a mineralized zone averaging 3.32 meters wide, containing approximately 60,000 tonnes of antimony in situ.

The historical estimate at Trojarová was classified using the Slovak version of the newly post-Soviet Russian classification system, which uses categories not directly comparable to modern standards as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy & Petroluem (""CIM"") Definition Standards for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves. The Slovak Geological Institute, the State agency that carried out all exploration and underground development work at Trojarová, classified the resource as ""P1"" in the Slovak version of the Russian classification system. P1 is most comparable in CIM's classification system to ""Inferred Mineral Resources,"" which is defined by the CIM as that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence gathered through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current, and the Company is not treating the historical estimate as current. For additional information relating to the historical estimate see below under the heading ""Historical Resource Estimates"".

The Company announced January 8th, 2025, that SLR Consulting had been engaged to complete a modern mineral resource estimate of the Trojarová Project. The current drill program supports this work by seeking to confirm historical results and validate preliminary resource models.

Preliminary modelling of historical data indicates the Trojarová deposit may display a trend of thickening and increasing antimony grades to the NW. The Company has targeted projected extensions of the deposit along this vector with 3 of the 7 planned drillholes with the aim to expand the current extents of the known deposit.

The analysts project 2031 sales of the duo at $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.
The once-daily oral treatment is set for a potential launch in 2027 and has the potential to become a “paradigm-changing treatment for B-cell malignancies,” the report notes.
The oral second-generation cereblon E3 ligase modulator could be a new option for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who've previously been treated with immunomodulatory drugs, Clarivate said.
Clarivate also selected Otsuka’s voyxact, which is expected to launch in 2026 and generate $955 million in 2031 sales.","Eli Lilly has dominated headlines in recent months, recently taking the crown as the most valuable company in the biopharma industry by market cap. And the song remains much the same in analytics firm Clarivate's Drugs to Watch 2026 report.

The annual outlook, which identifies (PDF) 11 potential blockbusters and transformative medicines, highlights two cardiometabolic treatments from the Indianapolis company, which have yet to be approved but could ultimately take the place of its current cash cows Mounjaro and Zepbound.

Lilly’s investigational treatments are daily GLP-1 pill orforglipron, which is slated for an FDA decision by March of this year, and triple-action, weekly injection retatrutide, which Clarivate expects will be ready for launch in 2028.

Both assets are under development in obesity, diabetes and a host of other related indications.

The Clarivate analysts project sales of orforglipron will reach a whopping $16 billion in 2031 and that retatrutide will generate revenue of $30 billion in the same year, an astounding figure which includes $10 billion in sales as an obesity treatment and $20 billion as a medicine for diabetes.

Clarivate’s report highlights the continued ascent of the obesity and metabolic disease market, as well as how Lilly has positioned itself to take full advantage. Morgan Stanley projects the overall cardiometabolic medicine market will reach $150 billion by 2035.

“The GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) revolution is entering a new phase of maturation and diversification,” Clarivate wrote. “Orforglipron and retatrutide exemplify the next generation of metabolic therapies: oral formulations that promise improved adherence, triple-hormone mechanisms that deliver superior weight loss and expanded therapeutic applications spanning from brain health to renal disease.”

As for the 2031 sales projections of the drugs on Clarivate’s 2026 list, orforglipron and retatrutide eclipse all others. The remaining medicines Clarivate highlighted have much lower sales projections than Lilly's, with no others expected to surpass the $2-billion threshold in 2031, according to Clarivate’s reckoning.

Johnson & Johnson is the only other company with two drugs named—bladder cancer treatment Inlexzo, which gained FDA approval in September of last year, and immunotherapy icotrokinra, which Clarivate expects will be launched this year. The analysts project 2031 sales of the duo at $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.

Inlexzo made the grade with Clarivate for its bladder-sparing, “paradigm-shifting” drug-releasing system, which allows for extended release of the chemotherapy gemcitabine directly to patients' bladders through an intravesical system that can be placed in minutes in an outpatient setting.

Icotrokinra, meanwhile, is poised to become the first-to-market targeted oral peptide designed to block the interleukin (IL)-23 receptor, which plays a key role in the inflammatory process in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis as well as ulcerative colitis, Clarivate said.

Clarivate also singled out two protein degrader cancer drugs, including BeOne Medicine’s BGB-16673. The once-daily oral treatment is set for a potential launch in 2027 and has the potential to become a “paradigm-changing treatment for B-cell malignancies,” the report notes. The asset could be effective at treating multiple hematological cancers as well, according to the analysts. Clarivate projects the drug's sales at $1.2 billion in 2031.

The other protein degrader on Clarivate's radar is Bristol Myers Squibb’s mezigdomide, which is expected to launch in 2026 and could generate $1.5 billion in 2031. The oral second-generation cereblon E3 ligase modulator could be a new option for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who've previously been treated with immunomodulatory drugs, Clarivate said.

Yet another oncology drug on the list comes in the form of Celcuity’s gedatolisib, which is set up for launch this year and is expected to deliver $1.1 billion in sales in 2031.

Clarivate also selected Otsuka’s voyxact, which is expected to launch in 2026 and generate $955 million in 2031 sales. The first-in-class selective A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) inhibitor could serve as a “high-impact, disease-modifying entrant"" in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), also known as Berger’s disease, the Clarivate team predicts.

The analytics team made another rare disease pick in GSK’s Exdensur, which was approved in December and is expected to generate sales of $510 million in 2031. The monoclonal antibody, which targets IL-5, is the first approved ultra-long-acting biologic with a six-month dosing schedule for severe asthma, providing greater convenience over currently available IL-5 inhibitors that require monthly or bimonthly dosing.

Also on Clarivate’s list are two drugs that recently suffered untimely rejections from the FDA. Sanofi’s multiple sclerosis treatment tolebrutinib is a potential first-in-class, brain-penetrant Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. But its prospects have been dampened by both efficacy and safety concerns raised in an FDA complete response letter (CRL).",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-486691192.jpg?VersionId=D1l6TNpezWwcJX_KqmWnaiIJECgJArJS,N,,2026-01-07 12:01:20.786882

Traders may take a step back from the markets following the advance seen to start the first full trading week of the new year.

However, it is worth noting that the futures were pointing to a roughly flat open on Tuesday before the Dow and the S&P 500 both climbed to new record closing highs over the course of the session.

The futures remained little changed after payroll processor ADP released a report showing private sector employment in the U.S. increased by slightly less than expected in the month of December.

ADP said private sector employment rose by 41,000 jobs in December after falling by a revised 29,000 jobs in November.

Economists had expected private sector employment to climb by 47,000 jobs compared to the loss of 32,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

""Small establishments recovered from November job losses with positive end-of-year hiring, even as large employers pulled back,"" said ADP chief economist Dr. Nela Richardson.

After turning in a strong performance to kick off the first full trading week of the new year, stocks saw further upside during trading on Tuesday. With the continued upward move, the Dow and the S&P 500 reached new record closing highs.

The major averages ended the day just off their highs of the session. The Dow jumped 484.90 points or 1.0 percent to 49,462.08, the Nasdaq climbed 151.35 points or 0.7 percent to 23,547.17 and the S&P 500 rose 42.77 points or 0.6 percent to 6,944.82.

The Dow benefitted from a sharp increase by shares of Amazon (AMZN), with the online retail giant surging by 3.4 percent.

Amazon jumped to a new record closing high after announcing it is rolling out Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers in what is seen as an effort to more directly compete with ChatGPT and Gemini.

Strong gains by Amgen (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM) and IBM Corp. (IBM) also contributed to the jump by the blue chip index.

The continued advance by the broader markets came despite a lack of major catalysts, as traders look ahead to the release of several key U.S. economic reports in the coming days.

The highlight of the week is likely to be the release of the Labor Department's closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday.

The data could impact the outlook for interest rates ahead of the Federal Reserve's next monetary policy meeting later this month.

While the Fed is likely to leave rates unchanged at its January 27-28 meeting, the central bank is widely expected to cut rates by at least another quarter point in the coming months.

Computer hardware stocks turned in some of the market's best performances on the day, with the NYSE Arca Computer Hardware Index soaring by 4.3 percent.

A sharp increase by the price of gold also contributed to substantial strength among gold stocks, as reflected by the 4.1 percent surge by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index.

Biotechnology stocks also saw considerable strength on the day, resulting in a 3.0 percent jump by the NSYE Arca Biotechnology Index.

Semiconductor, retail and healthcare stocks also showed notable moves to the upside, while significant weakness was visible among energy stocks amid a pullback by the price of crude oil.

The AI Marketing Cloud provider revealed that the collaboration would utilize OpenAI’s models to power conversational intelligence and agentic functions into the product.

This partnership will further enable Zeta to increase the speed at which it understands the customer market and how its strategies are driving meaningful engagement.

David A. Steinberg, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Zeta Global, explained how this collaboration would allow Zeta to expand its vision for Athena and its role in the enterprise marketing sector.

“AI is moving from the edges of marketing to the center of how enterprises operate, and Athena embodies that shift,” he said.

“It transforms the Zeta Marketing Platform into an intelligent operating system for growth – one that can listen, reason, and act on behalf of marketers.

“Together with OpenAI, we’re making this new way of working easy to adopt and scale, so brands can move faster, spend smarter, and win the moments that matter most.”

By utilizing OpenAI’s models for Athena, this will allow Zeta Global to input more natural conversational responses and decision-ready answers directly into marketing workflows.

Athena is embedded within the Zeta Marketing Platform, meaning that when in use, marketers are not required to switch between analytics tools, dashboards, or reporting systems, allowing analysis and execution to remain connected.

Athena will interpret the data and present possible conclusions that turn raw metrics into summarized insights with clear implications. This allows marketing teams to ask Athena questions on audience responses, email performance, or conversion rates declines, and in return receive actionable insights without needing multiple tools.

Furthermore, Zeta will also be expanding early beta access for its two Athena applications, Insights and Advisor, responding to customer uptake in adoption interest.

So, let’s take a closer look at what customers can expect from these solutions:

Insights with Athena

This application can be used by marketers as a conversational analytics assistant. Marketing teams can ask audience and product performance-related questions, as well as research possible trends and opportunities in plain language to receive instant, insight-heavy results.

Athena utilizes OpenAI’s models to pull relevant data, trends, and insights to generate answers, visualizations, and dashboards.

It can also identify shifts in customer behavior and engagement patterns across multiple channels, eliminating the need for manual database creation or navigating multiple tools for faster, more intuitive insight gathering.

Advisor with Athena

This app functions as an AI marketing strategist, utilizing goal-driven optimization capabilities to review ongoing marketing campaigns, performance metrics, and historical data. From here, it can recommend next steps to adjust targeting, modify creative content, or budget reallocating to improve outcomes.

In limited circumstances, Athena can automatically execute actions in configured accurately, including sending revised campaigns to selected audiences or launching follow-up sequences.

By automating analysis and decision-making, the app can advise marketing teams to act on insights quickly without waiting for manual reports to come in.

Giancarlo ‘GC’ Lionetti, Chief Commercial Officer at OpenAI, emphasizes how this partnership will allow Zeta Global to expand its data analysis capabilities with AI.

“Zeta shows how advanced AI moves beyond insight and into action,” he said.

“By working together, we are bringing agentic intelligence directly into everyday marketing workflows, helping enterprises move faster and act with confidence.”

What This Means For The Customer Journey

By implementing the Insights app, marketing teams can now deliver faster insights into customer trends, behavior, and campaign performance.

Decisions regarding targeting, messages, and offers can now also be made in near real-time, allowing campaigns to be optimized quickly during the conversion stage and increasing the likelihood of purchase.

This ensures that delays between observation and action are minimized, enabling marketing to respond faster to changing customer behavior throughout the journey.

Advisor ensures that customers are receiving more personalized engagement during the customer journey. By recommending actions targeted toward the consumer, the app can tailor campaigns automatically to an individual customer or segment, enhancing customer relationships throughout the journey and increasing loyalty post-purchase.

This can also be accomplished with Open AI’s capability to reduce manual work for faster execution.

By reducing report and planning creation, marketing teams can focus on strategy and optimizing customer journey success, improving efficiency and customer retention levels.

This partnership moves marketing toward an AI-assisted, insight-driven process, improving decision-making, speed, and ability to closely align with customer needs at each journey stage.",https://www.cxtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Zeta-Global-Partners-With-Open-AI-To-Expand-Marketing-Capabilities.png,N,,2026-01-07 13:03:10.339623

This is a fundamental prerequisite for the widespread use of AI, one of the company's key strategic goals.","According to the report ‘The Age of Software-Driven Mobility: Beyond Vehicles’ by the Capgemini Research Institute, 92% of organisations in the automotive sector anticipate a transformation into software companies. This trend, to support software-defined vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM) services, is directly linked to AI and computer vision.

More than eight out of ten organisations believe that software-defined products and services, and not just the physical vehicle, will become their main value proposition. Although the goals are ambitious, less than half of these companies have ramped up their SDM initiatives by 2025: 34% have partially ramped up at least one SDM use case, and only 14% have achieved large-scale implementation.

According to the research, organisations in the automotive sector increasingly recognise the value of broader collaboration, with nearly two in five partnering with large technology companies and hyperscalers to gain critical software, cloud and data capabilities.

AI as a source of innovation

The report highlights that 85% agree that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software, directly integrated into software features and functions, from enhancing the in-vehicle experience to enabling advanced safety and cybersecurity features.

77% believe that the integration of AI into software development, in-vehicle features and mobility services is a key competitive advantage that will transform the automotive value chain. By reducing costs, increasing productivity and efficiency, and improving product quality, AI is propelling the industry into a new era of innovation.

Implications of these advances for the near future

Both AI and computer vision implemented in the automotive industry have major safety considerations and a growing demand for autonomous driving.

These advances mean greater safety in both assisted (ADAS) and automated driving, thanks to perception systems that are more accurate, reliable under difficult conditions and capable of reacting in real time. In addition, they are democratising advanced assisted driving; thanks to cheaper and more modular AI vision solutions, technologies that previously only existed in high-end ranges could reach more popular cars.

On the other hand, with software-defined vehicles (SDVs), vehicles will no longer be a ‘sum of independent parts’ but will become unified software platforms, facilitating updates, new features, customisation and remote maintenance. We also find that, with advances in 3D perception, sensor fusion, robustness in adverse conditions, and AI control systems, computer vision is laying the foundation for higher-level autonomous cars, especially in controlled environments.

Not only that, but new implications are also emerging in the industry with greater automation in production and quality control, which can translate into safer, more consistent vehicles and more efficient and sustainable manufacturing.

Recent major advances

Stradvision, which specialises in advanced 3D vision for ADAS and autonomous driving,

has been recognised in 2025 as a ‘Top SME Innovator’ by CLEPA, thanks to its AI-based perception technology, SVNet 3D Perception Network. This system allows for high-fidelity 3D understanding of the vehicle's environment, even under difficult conditions (low light, adverse weather).

With SVNet, manufacturers can offer driver assistance and partial/more advanced automation features at a lower cost, bringing 3D ADAS to more vehicle ranges. SVNet is designed to deliver higher fidelity spatial understanding, robust real-time object classification, and improved performance in low light and adverse weather conditions, enabling next-generation autonomous driving platforms. The technology is optimised to offer deployment flexibility across multiple SoCs and vehicle segments.

In addition, CES 2025 showcased its integration with the Texas Instruments TDA4VPE-Q1 automotive chip, optimised for Level 2/2+ ADAS (advanced assistance, automatic parking, 3D perimeter vision, etc.). This means that technologies previously reserved for expensive vehicles can now be implemented in a scalable manner.

AI-powered driver and occupant monitoring

Seeing Machines' DMS and OMS technology can be found integrated into a number of demonstrations from leading customers and partners, who will also be present at CES. This includes the company's Guardian Generation 3 software, which will be showcased at Ambarella's invitation-only exhibition. Seeing Machines' next-generation driver safety solution leverages Ambarella's CV25 AI SoC to deliver industry-leading AI performance per watt, enabling the company to improve Guardian's overall performance for commercial vehicles while enhancing global road safety and helping its customers comply with new regulations, including those currently in force in Europe.

In collaboration with QNX, Seeing Machines is integrating its QNX Cabin interior sensing technology, where the company's advanced algorithms will be leveraged to enable OEMs to monitor driver drowsiness and distraction, mitigating the risks associated with unsafe driving and enabling compliance with international safety regulations.

New SDV architectures and centralisation of intelligence

Visteon has launched its cognitoAI tool which, unlike other cloud-based AI systems for cars, resides directly in the vehicle. This system processes everything locally to deliver ultra-fast responses; continuously analyses vehicle data to provide useful information about the vehicle's condition and performance; learns and adapts to your driving habits over time; integrates data from multiple vehicle systems to make smarter decisions; and enables state-of-the-art voice interactions without the need for an internet connection.

This new platform manages multiple critical functions simultaneously. Think of it as the car's brain, managing advanced driver assistance with enhanced visualisation, high-fidelity 3D controls for vehicle functions, augmented reality navigation, AI-powered driver monitoring and Android-based entertainment systems. And it does all this while maintaining maximum performance and reliability.

Visteon is making vehicle interaction more enjoyable thanks to three key innovations: curved OLED displays: crisp information that adapts to the natural contours of the car; active privacy features: keeping confidential information visible only to those who need to see it, to avoid distractions; Deco Trim: controls hidden within decorative surfaces; no cluttered dashboards.

Toolchain

Continental's Road to Cloud Ecosystem approach to SDVs provides a comprehensive toolchain to simplify and accelerate vehicle software development. With the electrical backbone of SDVs, users will see the interaction and connection of hardware enablers, while the Continental Automotive Edge Framework and virtualisation highlight the developer workbench, cloud solutions and seamless integration into high-performance computers (HPC) and zone control units.

Other software solutions for future mobility, such as Cabin Sensing, Holistic Motion Control, Radar Vision Parking and Smart Device-based Vehicle Access, further expand the capabilities of SDV. The range of possibilities for SDV is unveiled with Continental's Intelligent Vehicle Experience, a smart vehicle that senses its surroundings, anticipates user intentions and interacts with the user. Sensors in existing vehicles, combined with artificial intelligence algorithms, offer a system solution for the new SDV architecture and provide a highly personalised user experience.

Serving production and business

At the Bosch Tech Day at the end of October, the company showcased artificial intelligence (AI) as a lever for industrial and social transformation. The firm has been implementing AI in its factories for decades to speed up production, optimise processes and reduce errors. A clear example was the automation of state-of-the-art sensor lines, where algorithms replaced repetitive tasks previously performed by operators, allowing them to focus on higher value-added functions.

They explained the difference between weak and strong AI and the role of generative AI in creating synthetic data, which is essential for training algorithms in environments with few real failures. They also highlighted how Bosch applies AI in predictive maintenance, automatic processing robots and alert classification, improving efficiency and safety in factories and vehicles.

In terms of human talent, it was noted that digitalisation generates new job opportunities: data scientists and engineers, profiles with training in physics and mathematics, and experts in technological ethics who previously had no clear prospects in the job market now find a place in the digitalised industry. Collaboration with universities, start-ups and technology consortia was also highlighted as a key element in accelerating innovation.

Volkswagen and productive AI

In preparation for vehicle production for a future driven by artificial intelligence, Volkswagen and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have extended their collaboration on the Digital Production Platform (DPP), Volkswagen's “factory cloud” designed to support car manufacturing, for another five years.

Volkswagen uses the DPP to implement cutting-edge AI and IT systems across all its global production plants. This makes production more flexible and faster, reduces IT costs, and helps bring new models to market more quickly.

Originally launched as a network of industrial partners, Volkswagen and AWS have turned the DPP into a key digital link that helps connect order intake, logistics, and manufacturing, helping to ensure a seamless flow of data throughout the entire process chain. This is a fundamental prerequisite for the widespread use of AI, one of the company's key strategic goals. In addition, the DPP helps Volkswagen implement new IT systems as standardised solutions across all its factories.

Across the Volkswagen Group, 43 plants in Europe, North America and South America are already connected to the DPP. In total, the Volkswagen Group operates 114 production plants worldwide.

The high availability and scalability of AWS help Volkswagen host these production-critical systems in the cloud and contribute to reducing the risk of production line downtime. Thanks to greater standardisation of systems across all plants, the Volkswagen Group is already achieving medium-term savings in the tens of millions. At the same time, these standards help to create a unified, multifunctional database – enabling even more consistent use of technologies such as AI. For example, with ‘KI4UPS’, Volkswagen leverages AI to assist assembly line teams in implementing vehicle software, identifying potential electronic problems more quickly. This contributes to a substantial reduction in Volkswagen's manual workload.

The Volkswagen Group currently uses more than 1,200 AI applications – far beyond the realm of production. Through innovative AWS services such as Amazon SageMaker, Volkswagen trains AI models and creates industrial computer vision use cases that improve quality control systems and reduce costs. These AI applications include sustainability initiatives: at the Poznań plant in Poland, for example, AI is used to help optimise electricity consumption. As a result, energy costs have been reduced by 12%, along with a decrease in CO₂ emissions.

Key AI trends in the automotive industry

Several AI-driven trends have been transforming development and operations throughout 2025.

Predictive thermal control in electric vehicle propulsion systems

When discussing optimising the propulsion system of an electric vehicle, it is useful to first analyse what that system actually consists of. Essentially, it involves electric motors, batteries and a set of power electronics components — including on-board chargers, DC-DC or AC-DC converters and controllers — that work together to deliver power efficiently and reliably.

AI is already accelerating innovation in batteries, but it is also driving advances in these other components. For example, in electric motor design, AI is increasingly being used in material selection, simulation, and multivariable modelling to increase power, reduce weight, and improve overall efficiency. These optimisations directly translate into better performance and lower energy consumption.

Another significant development is the transition from 400-volt to 800-volt architectures. Early generations of BEVs typically used 400-volt motors and supporting electronics. Now, with the rapid advancement of technology, many original equipment manufacturers, especially in China, are migrating to 800 V systems, which enable significantly faster charging thanks to their ability to handle high-voltage current flows with capable power electronics, improved thermal performance, and greater overall efficiency.

Achieving these improvements requires compatible power electronics and motor designs, areas where AI-based design and validation tools are proving indispensable.

With accelerated battery design using AI-enabled platforms, AI algorithms and artificial intelligence applied to automotive are transforming battery development from start to finish. Engineers are using AI to improve thermal management and prevent risks such as overheating, which can lead to fires.

Machine learning models also guide the selection and optimisation of cell chemistry, striking a balance between fast charging capability and long-term durability. This allows batteries to accept high-voltage currents without accelerating chemical degradation.

In addition, AI is helping to increase energy density, enabling greater range without adding weight, and refining recharge cycles so that batteries last longer. These advances not only affect performance, but also shorten R&D cycles and reduce development costs.

In markets such as China, where new-generation electric vehicle manufacturers are leveraging AI to launch new products at a rapid pace, established vehicle manufacturers are being forced to accelerate their own innovation cycles. In markets such as China, where new-generation electric vehicle manufacturers are leveraging AI to launch new products at a rapid pace, established vehicle manufacturers are being forced to accelerate their own innovation cycles.

While battery design and development remain critical, the impact of AI goes beyond that. It is shaping the entire battery ecosystem. AI optimises supply chains for critical materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel.

It also increases manufacturing efficiency by reducing production waste. In addition, AI improves recycling to recover valuable materials when electric vehicle batteries reach the end of their useful life. These applications highlight the broad potential of AI to make batteries more sustainable, cost-effective and resilient.

In factories and vehicle systems, AI enables rapid scenario testing. Incorporating digital twins into R&D processes enables early-stage validation, with layered data feedback loops that reduce downtime and development costs. Analysts can triangulate efficiency differences between original equipment manufacturers using these methods. By aligning design and manufacturing with these new paradigms, companies can systematically reduce time to market and support data-intensive product lines.

Según el informe “La era de la movilidad impulsada por el software: más allá de los vehículos”, del Instituto de Investigación de Capgemini, el 92% de las organizaciones del sector de la automoción prevén una transformación en empresas de software. Esta tendencia, para dar soporte a los vehículos definidos por software (SDV) y a los servicios de movilidad impulsados por software (SDM), está directamente entroncada con la IA y la visión artificial.

Como nos explica Johan Huss, Vice President Digital Products and Services en Sandvik Coromant, el futuro está en los modelos de negocio que eliminan la complejidad de la planta de producción y vinculan los costes directamente al rendimiento.

En virtud de la norma FMVSS 127, la Administración Nacional de Seguridad Vial en Carreteras de Estados Unidos (NHTSA) exige que, a partir del 1 de septiembre de 2029, todos los turismos y camiones ligeros nuevos vendidos en los Estados Unidos estén equipados con sistemas de alerta de colisión frontal (FCW) y de frenado automático de emergencia (AEB).

Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna have been embroiled in lawsuits with several other companies claiming infringement of mRNA technology.
Five months ago, GSK collected $320 million in a settlement with Pfizer and BioNTech that also involved German vaccine specialist CureVac.","Bayer has filed separate lawsuits against the creators of three COVID-19 vaccines, claiming they violated intellectual property developed by Monsanto, the crop science company the German company acquired a decade ago.

In federal district court in Delaware, Bayer filed one complaint against Moderna and another against partners Pfizer and BioNTech. In U.S. district court in New Jersey, Bayer also is suing Johnson & Johnson.

The lawsuits allege that the defendants used Bayer’s technology in creating their vaccines “to eliminate ‘problem’ coding sequences in the building blocks of cells to improve mRNA stability and the amount or quality of protein produced.”

Pfizer and J&J did not respond to a request for comment. Moderna and BioNTech responded but only to say they were aware of the litigation.

Monsanto filed to protect its intellectual property in 1989, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office eventually granted it in 2010, according to the lawsuits. Bayer bought out Monsanto for $66 billion in 2016.

Monsanto initially used the technology to increase the expression of an insect-resistant protein in crops, which reduced the need for pesticide sprays and improved agricultural output, the lawsuits explained.

Instability leading to poor protein expression was a central issue the COVID-19 vaccine makers faced in developing their shots. Solving this helped enhance the vaccines' “ability to confer immunity to the virus,” Bayer wrote in its complaint against Pfizer/BioNTech, adding that the German biotech has “acknowledged that it utilizes codon optimization in its mRNA products.”

While J&J’s COVID shot—which is no longer available—was a traditional viral vector vaccine, it still needed increased mRNA stability for protein expression, according to Bayer.

Bayer is requesting a jury trial and is seeking a cut of the proceeds generated by the vaccines and royalties on future sales. In the case of Pfizer and BioNTech, Bayer said the companies reported more than $93 billion in sales of their vaccine Comirnaty.

Third Quarter of Fiscal 2025 Results

Net sales and other revenue increased 1.9% to $19,123.7 million for the 12 weeks ended November 29, 2025 (""third quarter of fiscal 2025"") from $18,774.5 million during the 12 weeks ended November 30, 2024 (""third quarter of fiscal 2024""). This increase was driven by a 2.4% increase in identical sales, with strong growth in pharmacy sales being the primary driver of the identical sales increase. We also continued to grow our digital sales with a 21% increase during the third quarter of fiscal 2025. These increases in Net sales and other revenue were partially offset by a net reduction in sales driven by store closures since the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and lower fuel sales. In addition, we estimate the temporary government shutdown and related delayed SNAP funding during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 negatively impacted identical sales by approximately 10 to 20 basis points.

Gross margin rate decreased to 27.4% during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 27.9% during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact of fuel and LIFO expense, gross margin rate decreased 55 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease in gross margin rate was driven by increases in delivery and handling costs related to the continued growth in our digital sales, and strong growth in pharmacy sales, which carries an overall lower gross margin rate. We also continue to make incremental investments in our customer value proposition which were funded by the benefits from our productivity initiatives.

Selling and administrative expenses decreased to 24.9% of Net sales and other revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 25.1% during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact of fuel, Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue decreased 33 basis points. This decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue was primarily attributable to the sales leveraging of employee costs and lower merger-related costs, partially offset by an increase in business transformation costs. The benefits from our productivity initiatives continue to partially offset increasing wage rates and other inflationary pressures on our operating expenses.

Net gain on property dispositions and impairment losses was $1.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to net loss of $10.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Interest expense, net was $116.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $109.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Other income, net was $4.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $5.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Income tax expense was $84.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, representing a 22.3% effective tax rate, compared to $14.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, representing a 3.5% effective tax rate. The increase in the effective rate was primarily driven by the recognition of $81.0 million of discrete state income tax benefits related to the settlement of audits during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Net income was $293.3 million, or $0.55 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $400.6 million, or $0.69 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The third quarter of fiscal 2024 included the $81.0 million or $0.14 per share benefit related to certain discrete state income tax benefits related to the settlement of audits.

Adjusted net income was $390.3 million, or $0.72 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $420.3 million, or $0.71 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,038.7 million, or 5.4% of Net sales and other revenue, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $1,065.1 million, or 5.7% of Net sales and other revenue, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Capital Allocation and Common Stock Repurchase Program

During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, capital expenditures were $1,412.8 million, which primarily included the completion of 74 remodels, the opening of five new stores and continued investment in our digital and technology platforms. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company paid its quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on November 7, 2025 to stockholders of record as of October 24, 2025. On January 7, 2026, the Company announced the next quarterly dividend payment of $0.15 per share to be paid on February 6, 2026 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 23, 2026.

On October 14, 2025, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""ASR Agreement"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (""JPMorgan"") to repurchase $750 million of shares of the Company's common stock. Also on October 14, 2025, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program from $2.0 billion to $2.75 billion, inclusive of the ASR Agreement. On October 15, 2025, the Company paid JPMorgan $750.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 35.4 million shares of common stock with a value equal to $600.0 million as of the date the ASR Agreement was executed, representing an estimated 80% of the total shares initially underlying the ASR Agreement. The delivery of any remaining shares will occur at the final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreement, which is expected to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2026. The number of shares to be delivered upon final settlement will be based on the average of the volume-weighted average share price of the Company's common stock on specified dates during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount. During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, inclusive of the $750.0 million ASR Agreement, the Company invested $1,361.6 million for the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the existing multi-year $2.75 billion repurchase authorization.

On November 10, 2025, the Company completed the issuance of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior unsecured notes due March 31, 2031 (the ""2031 Notes"") and $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior unsecured notes due March 31, 2034 (the ""2034 Notes"" and together with the 2031 Notes, the ""Notes""). Proceeds from the Notes were used to redeem in full the $750.0 million outstanding of the Company's 3.250% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2026 (the ""Redemption""), to repay a portion of the borrowings under the ABL Facility, and to pay fees and expenses related to the Redemption and the issuance of the Notes.

Non-GAAP Measures and Identical Sales

Non-GAAP Measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per Class A common share and Net debt ratio (collectively, the ""Non-GAAP Measures"") are performance measures that provide supplemental information the Company believes is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate its ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, gross margin, and net income per Class A common share. These Non-GAAP Measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing the Company's ongoing core operating performance, and thereby provide useful measures to analysts and investors of its operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by such differences. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Net debt ratio for board of director and bank compliance reporting. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Investing.com -- Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE: ACI) reported third-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, while revenue came in slightly below estimates as the grocery chain continues to invest in digital growth and technology.

The supermarket operator posted adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share for the quarter ended November 29, beating the analyst consensus of $0.68. Revenue reached $19.12 billion, up 1.9% from the same period last year but falling short of the $19.18 billion analysts had expected. Identical store sales increased 2.4% YoY, driven primarily by strong pharmacy sales growth.

Shares of Albertsons dipped 0.5% following the earnings announcement.

""In the third quarter, we delivered solid results and continued to advance our strategic priorities,"" said Susan Morris, Chief Executive Officer. ""Our investments in technology and AI are fundamentally reshaping how we operate and serve our customers; driving smarter decisions, greater efficiency, and more personalized experiences.""

Digital sales surged 21% during the quarter, while loyalty membership grew 12% to 49.8 million members. The company noted that the temporary government shutdown and related delayed SNAP funding negatively impacted identical sales by approximately 10 to 20 basis points during the quarter.

Gross margin rate decreased to 27.4% from 27.9% in the prior year period, primarily due to increased delivery and handling costs related to digital sales growth and the expansion of lower-margin pharmacy sales.

For fiscal 2025, Albertsons narrowed its identical sales growth forecast to between 2.2% and 2.5%, down from its previous guidance of 2.2% to 2.75%, partly due to the impact of Medicare’s Drug Price Negotiation Program. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $2.08 to $2.16, compared to the analyst consensus of $2.14.

Financial Highlights

Net sales and other revenue increased by 1.9% to $19.1 billion, driven by a 2.4% increase in identical sales and a 21% growth in digital sales.

The company also reported a 12% increase in loyalty members, reaching 49.8 million. However, the gross margin rate decreased to 27.4% from 27.9% in the previous year, primarily due to higher delivery and handling costs associated with digital sales and lower-margin pharmacy sales.

“This 2025 holiday season, consumers embraced generative AI more than ever as a shopping assistant in their purchasing decisions,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights.","Record holiday season online, propelled by a strong Cyber Week

Consumers spent $257.8 billion online from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, up 6.8% year-over-year (YoY) and setting a new record for e-commerce. 25 days saw consumers spend more than $4 billion in a single day (a significant jump from 18 days in 2024). Mobile shopping hit a new milestone, with the majority of online transactions (56.4%) taking place through a smartphone this season (up from 54.5% in 2024); Mobile shopping was highest on Christmas Day (Dec. 25), driving 66.5% of online sales (vs. 65% in 2024), followed by Thanksgiving Day (Nov. 27) at 61.6% mobile share (vs. 59.3% in 2024).

Record online spending this season was bolstered by a strong Cyber Week (the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday), which brought in $44.2 billion online overall, up 7.7% YoY. Cyber Monday remained the biggest e-commerce day of the season (and year), driving $14.25 billion in online spend, up 7.1% YoY. Cyber Monday growth was outpaced by Black Friday ($11.8 billion, up 9.1% YoY), as consumers embraced earlier deals. On Thanksgiving Day, consumers spent $6.4 billion online, up 5.3% YoY.

Competitive discounts pushed consumers to ‘trade up’

Strong discounts this season drove resilient consumer demand online. Shoppers found great deals in electronics, where discounts peaked at 30.9% off listed price (vs. 30.1% in 2024), as well as toys at 29.6% (vs. 28%), apparel at 25.1% (vs. 23.2%), televisions at 24.3% (vs. 24.2%), computers at 23.4% (vs. 22.8%), sporting goods at 20.3% (vs. 19.5%), appliances at 20.2% (vs. 19.2%) and furniture at 18.8% (vs. 19%).

Deals this season also drove consumers to purchase higher-ticket items in categories such as electronics, sporting goods and appliances—propelling e-commerce growth as a result. This season, the share-of-units-sold for the most expensive goods increased by 20% compared to the rest of the year. Within categories, this figure was up 56% in electronics, 55% in sporting goods, 38% in appliances, 34% in personal care products and 29% in tools.

Generative AI reshaped the online shopping journey

Generative AI-powered chat services and browsers have become an integral tool for consumers to find deals and research products. This season, traffic to retail sites from generative AI tools (shoppers clicking on a link to a retail site) increased by 693.4% compared to the year prior. On Cyber Monday, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 670%. While the base of users remains modest, the uptick shows the value AI can deliver as a shopping assistant. These services were used most in categories including video games, toys, appliances, electronics and personal care products.

“This 2025 holiday season, consumers embraced generative AI more than ever as a shopping assistant in their purchasing decisions,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “Competitive discounts and flexible payment options like Buy Now Pay Later also contributed to driving record spend of $257.8 billion throughout this holiday season.”

GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ: GTLB) was downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at Cantor Fitzgerald, which slashed the target price on the shares to $40 from $60.","Pre-Market Stock Futures:

The futures are trading flat on Wednesday after a second strong day for Wall Street, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another record high, closing over $49,000 for the first time at $49,484, up a solid 1.04%. The S&P 500 also posted a record high, closing at 6,947, up 0.66%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also scored a win on Tuesday, closing the day at 23,546, up 0.64%. Continued momentum from Monday carried stocks higher, plus solid economic news on multiple fronts also added to the bullish sentiment. Semiconductor stocks are still leading the technology charge, and many feel the top companies could post outstanding fourth-quarter earnings, which will start next week with the big money-center banks reporting. Plus, after hitting a wall at the end of 2025, AI and data center stocks have shown renewed momentum as investors chase more big gains in 2026.

Treasury Bonds:

Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve after a solid start to the week on Monday. While buying was seen in the shorter T-bill maturities, there was some modest selling across the middle and longer maturities. Investors are clearly focused on upcoming economic data and geopolitical events, such as developments in Venezuela. However, recent market shifts saw yields dip amid broader Fed uncertainty and tech bubble fears, creating a volatile environment for safe-haven assets. The 30-year long bond was last seen Tuesday at 4.85% while the benchmark ten-year note finished the day at 4.17%

Oil and Gas:

After a solid Monday, stocks were down across the energy complex, and some of the same worries from 2025 resurfaced on Tuesday as expectations of a global supply surplus in 2026 and the lack of immediate supply disruption from geopolitical tensions in Venezuela, as Chevron reported that it will keep Venezuelan oil flowing despite the political upheaval there. Traders are focused on market fundamentals, which point to ample supply and subdued demand concerns. Brent Crude closed at $60.49, down 2.06%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen at $56.91, down 2.42%. Natural gas also saw sellers reappear, as unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country was a factor. Nat gas closed at $3.40, down 3.43%.

Gold:

Gold and Silver continued their respective marches higher, albeit not as dramatically for Gold as some of the trading days we have seen recently, when both precious metals would bolt higher by 5-10% and more. The song remains the same as central bank buying, massive retail inflows, and geopolitical concerns continue to drive investors to chase both Gold and Silver. Gold closed the session up almost 1% at $4,492. However, Silver continued a hot streak, closing up 6.06% at $81.18.

Crypto:

Crypto markets traded mixed on Tuesday as investors remained cautious ahead of key macroeconomic data releases. Bitcoin pulled back slightly but generally held above the $91,000 to $92,000 range, while some altcoins like XRP and Solana posted notable gains. Many crypto analysts on Wall Street are starting to signal they feel the bottom after a sizable sell-off that began last year may be in the process of being put in. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $91,940, while Ethereum was trading at $3,212.

24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Here are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Wednesday, January 7, 2026.

Upgrades:

Amcor plc (NYSE: AMCR) was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Baird with a $10 target price.

Block Inc. (NYSE: XYZ) was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at BNP Paribas with an $82 price target.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler, which bumped the target price for the stock to $88 from $82.

Market consolidation limits risk-taking, creating space for independent brands to lead meaningful change.

Specialty coffee roasters can drive real innovation by partnering with producers, collaborating beyond coffee, and developing value-led products.

Successful innovation strengthens financial resilience and supports the wider supply chain.

When specialty coffee first emerged, it redefined how coffee was grown, traded, and consumed. Quality and traceability became the differentiators, demonstrating how value commanded higher prices.

For a long time, these factors alone were enough for specialty coffee roasters. But today’s challenging market requires them to continue innovating.

At the same time, consolidation is reshaping the industry. In August 2025, Keurig Dr Pepper agreed to buy JDE Peet’s in a US$18bn deal. This will create the world’s second-largest coffee company, behind Nestlé, and shape the global coffee sector for years to come.

However, innovation thrives on risk, and consolidation at this level makes key players risk-averse. For specialty coffee roasters, this is an opportunity to push for genuine change that strengthens business resilience, exceeds consumer expectations, and supports the overall supply chain.

There are many ways for specialty coffee roasters to drive real innovation: mutually beneficial partnerships with producers, collaborations with brands outside the coffee industry, or the pioneering of new brewing techniques. Regardless of which direction they take, it needs to feel authentic, fresh, and relevant.

Specialty coffee roasters need to maintain momentum

Specialty coffee thrives on innovation, and we have seen plenty over the last two decades.

Flat whites, which became a status symbol in the 2000s for those “in the know” about specialty coffee culture, redefined traditional milk-based drinks. Brewing methods and experimental processing have also proliferated, creating unique flavour experiences. Specialty-grade capsules and instant coffee gained traction in the 2010s, offering both convenience and quality. The cold RTD coffee revolution is arguably still underway, introducing Gen Z consumers to higher-quality options.

Even with higher coffee prices, rising operational costs, and intensifying competition, roasters still need to maintain this momentum.

“Innovation matters because taste alone is too fragile a differentiator,” says Michael Cleland, the co-founder of Assembly Coffee in London, UK. “Quality has become baseline, and the whole industry is selling ‘specialty-grade ethical coffee’ in a market that’s struggling to sustain value.”

One way Assembly drives innovation is by collaborating with producers and research organisations to overcome challenges at origin and deepen understanding of coffee processing. In early 2025, the roaster partnered with Brazilian farm Mió and the Coffee Sensorium to utilise controlled fermentation to increase the quality of overripe cherries.

The result was a limited-edition drop of three coffees processed using three methods: carbonic maceration, yeast fermentation, and “volcanic” fermentation. Overripe coffee is typically discarded due to flavour and quality degradation, so the project allowed consumers to experience flavours that might otherwise be unattainable. Mió, meanwhile, addressed a climate-change-driven problem: rising temperatures are placing coffee plants under severe stress.

“Real innovation meets or exceeds expectations while increasing margin, and this gives businesses the resilience they need while everything else becomes harder,” Michael says. “Without this, they risk competing only on price, and a race to the bottom is a quick way to lose.”

But innovation has many definitions

Innovation conjures up images of unconventional processing techniques, hyper-minimalist packaging, and creative signature drinks. But not all roasters define it in the same way.

“I don’t see innovation as a primary ambition for us,” says Ian Bailey, the founder of Vivid Coffee in Burlington, Vermont, US. “We want to be known as an authentic expression of our values rather than as a brand that is always on the cutting edge.”

For Vivid, real change lies in translating values into tangible products. This begins with building direct sourcing relationships with producers that pay higher prices for exceptional quality.

“In many ways, it requires innovation to communicate these values authentically,” Ian says. “For us, it’s less about chasing trends and more about pursuing authenticity in our values and sourcing practices.”

This highlights a key tension within specialty coffee: how roasters can adapt to changing consumer behaviour while staying true to the ethical and quality-driven principles that define the sector.

Could coffee innovation return to its roots?

Consumer preferences are shifting, particularly among younger generations. Matcha drinks and customised beverages are growing in popularity, often at the expense of traditional black coffee. Research indicates that around 75% of younger consumers regularly add flavours to their drinks.

In response, some specialty coffee roasters are developing blends optimised for milk, sweeteners, and cold coffee, while others are creating in-house syrups and seasonal drinks. Cafés are experimenting with flavours such as corn cold foam and black sesame vanilla, inspired mainly by East Asian cuisine, to appeal to younger demographics without abandoning quality principles.

But instead, there could be potential to refocus on the drink that kickstarted the third wave coffee revolution: black filter coffee.

“Black filter coffee represents essence. It’s a longer drink that helps us perceive the full spectrum of flavours,” says Cosimo Libardo, the head of sales at equipment manufacturer Ceado. “In fact, it’s the beverage that best allows us to understand coffee’s complexity, much like a glass of red wine.

“It is the most critical opportunity to build education and culture. Yet it has been taken for granted,” he adds. “We need to bring it back to the centre stage, as the key to understanding and appreciating coffee.”

Ceado designed its radial infusion Hoop brewer to make filter coffee more accessible. Users add ground coffee to the Flow Tower and pour water into the Outer Loop to assist with more even extraction. For younger, more convenience-focused consumers, low-effort, high-yield brewing is more appealing than intricate multi-step pours.

Roasters can use this opportunity to simultaneously drive innovation and build black coffee’s appeal among Gen Z. Brands like Counter Culture, Onyx Coffee Lab, Klatch, and Black & White are partnering with companies such as Cometeer and xBloom to offer flash-frozen capsules and whole bean pods that simplify high-quality brewing.

Encouraging a shift to “tradition”

Price sensitivity may encourage more people to resume drinking black coffee, but roasters can find other ways to innovate and drive consumption.

“The truth is, it’s hard to make black coffee ‘Instagram special’. You can’t post the taste, so the real work has to go deeper,” says Vytautas Kratulis, the founder of Huracán Coffee, Lithuania’s first specialty coffee roastery.

Huracán collaborates with brands outside the coffee industry, including bean-to-bar chocolate companies, a distillery, and an ice cream manufacturer, demonstrating how diversification can strengthen business resilience, diversify revenue, and drive innovation.

The company recently received Gold and Bronze medals for its filter coffee at the European edition of the Global Coffee Awards.

“You educate, but sometimes it’s an invitation. You create an environment where drinking black coffee feels grown-up, confident, even exalted,” he adds. “A student might order it because they want to embody a more mature image, and batch brew is cheaper than customised drinks.”

A focus on black coffee’s health benefits could prove promising for stressed-out Gen Z, who increasingly prioritise their mental wellbeing.

Innovation in specialty coffee has no single definition. For some roasters, it means new products or formats. For others, it means refining sourcing models, improving sustainability, or strengthening storytelling.

What remains clear is that the future of specialty coffee depends on balance. Roasters must continue to honour the values that shaped the sector while finding new ways to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive and consolidated market. Those who succeed will be the ones who innovate with intention.

​Regulation and risks for “digital cash” Regulation is starting to catch up with this shift.","Stablecoins are shifting from a crypto native tool to a core piece of institutional market plumbing, according to a new cross-sector outlook report from Moody’s.

In the report, published Monday, the ratings agency said stablecoins processed about 87% more settlement volume in 2025 than the year before, reaching $9 trillion in activity based on industry estimates of onchain transactions, rather than purely bank‑to‑bank flows.

Moody’s said fiat‑backed stablecoins and tokenized deposits are evolving into “digital cash” for liquidity management, collateral movements and settlements across an increasingly tokenized financial system.

Stablecoins plug into institutional rails

Moody’s placed stablecoins alongside tokenized bonds, funds and credit products as part of a broader convergence between traditional and digital finance.

Banks, asset managers and market infrastructure providers spent 2025 running pilots on blockchain settlement networks, tokenization platforms and digital custody, seeking to streamline issuance, post‑trade processes and intraday liquidity management.

The report estimated that, across these initiatives, more than $300 billion could be invested in digital finance and infrastructure by 2030 as firms build out the rails for large‑scale tokenization and programmable settlement.

​Within that picture, stablecoins and tokenized deposits increasingly act as the settlement asset for cross‑border payments, repo (short-term secured loans where one party sells securities and agrees to buy them back later at a higher price) and collateral transfers.

Moody’s noted that regulated institutions used cash and US Treasury‑backed stablecoins in 2025 to facilitate intraday movements between funds, credit pools and trading venues, with trials in banks such as Citigroup and Société Générale, among others.

JPM Coin is cited as an example of a deposit token model that integrates programmable payments and liquidity management into existing banking infrastructure, illustrating how “digital cash” layers can sit on top of traditional core systems.

​Regulation and risks for “digital cash”

Regulation is starting to catch up with this shift. The report highlighted the European Union’s Markets in Crypto‑Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, US stablecoin and market structure proposals and licensing frameworks in Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates as evidence of a converging global approach to tokenization, custody and redemption rules.

In Europe, Société Générale‑Forge’s EURCV and related initiatives are cited as examples of bank-issued products developed under the EU’s emerging stablecoin framework, while in the Gulf, banks and regulators are exploring UAE dirham‑referenced payment tokens and broader digital money architectures.

​Still, Moody’s stressed that the transformation is far from risk‑free. As more value moves onto “digital rails,” the report warned that smart contract bugs, oracle failures, cyberattacks on custody systems and fragmentation across multiple blockchains could create new forms of operational and counterparty risk.

The agency argued that security, interoperability and governance will be just as important as regulatory clarity if stablecoins are to function as reliable institutional settlement assets rather than new sources of systemic vulnerability.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 11:14:10.182838

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Delta Air Lines Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simple stories you build around a company that connect your view of its future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast and then to a fair value that you can compare with the current share price to help decide whether it looks more like a buy, hold or sell for you.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, each Narrative turns your assumptions into a living model that automatically refreshes as new information such as earnings, news or guidance comes through. This means your fair value view is not frozen at the moment you first ran the numbers.

For Delta Air Lines, for example, one published Narrative currently points to a fair value of about US$49 per share, while another points to about US$74.61. This shows how two investors can look at exactly the same company and, based on different expectations for revenue growth, profit margins, discount rates and future P/E, arrive at quite different fair values that the platform then sets against the market price so you can see how your story lines up with what the market is paying today.

For Delta Air Lines, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Delta Air Lines Narratives:

These sit side by side, use different assumptions, and show you how reasonable investors can look at the same stock and land in different places on value and risk.

🐂 Delta Air Lines Bull Case

Fair value in this narrative: US$74.61 per share

Gap to that fair value at the current US$72.22 price: about 3.2% below the narrative fair value

Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 3.92% a year

Focuses on premium cabins, loyalty revenue and international routes as the key earnings drivers, with a long term maintenance deal adding another revenue stream.

Assumes modest revenue growth and slightly lower profit margins over time, with earnings reaching about US$4.6b and a future P/E of 12.9x by 2028.

Ties the analyst consensus price target of US$67.81 to these earnings and valuation assumptions, while highlighting risks from tariffs, softer domestic travel and pressure from low cost competitors.

🐻 Delta Air Lines Bear Case

Fair value in this narrative: US$59.84 per share

Gap to that fair value at the current US$72.22 price: about 20.6% above the narrative fair value

Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 3.5% a year

Frames Delta as a quality operator with strong yield and cost control, but questions how much investors should pay given thin margins and sector shocks that can hit demand and balance sheets.

Flags tariffs, trade tensions and softer travel appetite as key threats for both transatlantic and domestic routes, even for a carrier that currently leads US peers.

Uses a lower future P/E multiple of 10x to reflect these risks, which pulls fair value below the current share price despite recognising solid recent profitability and debt reduction.

Taken together, these Narratives give you a compact range of fair values and the assumptions behind them so you can decide which story, if either, lines up best with your own view on Delta Air Lines.

Excluding the impact of fuel, Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue decreased 33 basis points. This decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue was primarily attributable to the sales leveraging of employee costs and lower merger-related costs, partially offset by an increase in business transformation costs. The benefits from our productivity initiatives continue to partially offset increasing wage rates and other inflationary pressures on our operating expenses.

Capital Allocation and Common Stock Repurchase Program

During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, capital expenditures were $1,412.8 million, which primarily included the completion of 74 remodels, the opening of five new stores and continued investment in our digital and technology platforms. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company paid its quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on November 7, 2025 to stockholders of record as of October 24, 2025. On January 7, 2026, the Company announced the next quarterly dividend payment of $0.15 per share to be paid on February 6, 2026 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 23, 2026.

On October 14, 2025, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""ASR Agreement"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (""JPMorgan"") to repurchase $750 million of shares of the Company's common stock. Also on October 14, 2025, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program from $2.0 billion to $2.75 billion, inclusive of the ASR Agreement. On October 15, 2025, the Company paid JPMorgan $750.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 35.4 million shares of common stock with a value equal to $600.0 million as of the date the ASR Agreement was executed, representing an estimated 80% of the total shares initially underlying the ASR Agreement. The delivery of any remaining shares will occur at the final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreement, which is expected to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2026. The number of shares to be delivered upon final settlement will be based on the average of the volume-weighted average share price of the Company's common stock on specified dates during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount. During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, inclusive of the $750.0 million ASR Agreement, the Company invested $1,361.6 million for the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the existing multi-year $2.75 billion repurchase authorization.

Proceeds from the Notes were used to redeem in full the $750.0 million outstanding of the Company's 3.250% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2026 (the ""Redemption""), to repay a portion of the borrowings under the ABL Facility, and to pay fees and expenses related to the Redemption and the issuance of the Notes.

Fiscal 2025 Outlook

Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.825 billion to $3.875 billion, including approximately $65 million related to the Company's 53rd week (previously $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion)

Adjusted net income per Class A common share in the range of $2.08 to $2.16 per share (previously $2.06 to $2.19 per share)

Effective income tax rate in the range of 23% to 24% (previously 23.5% to 24.5%)

Capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion (unchanged)

The Company is unable to provide a full reconciliation of the GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures (as defined below) used in the updated fiscal 2025 outlook without unreasonable effort because it is not possible to predict certain of the adjustment items with a reasonable degree of certainty.

Non-GAAP Measures and Identical Sales

Non-GAAP Measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per Class A common share and Net debt ratio (collectively, the ""Non-GAAP Measures"") are performance measures that provide supplemental information the Company believes is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate its ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, gross margin, and net income per Class A common share. These Non-GAAP Measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing the Company's ongoing core operating performance, and thereby provide useful measures to analysts and investors of its operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by such differences. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Net debt ratio for board of director and bank compliance reporting. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Identical Sales. As used in this earnings release, the term ""identical sales"" includes stores operating during the same period in both the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year, comparing sales on a daily basis. Direct to consumer digital sales are included in identical sales, and fuel sales are excluded from identical sales.

The strategy reflects growing confidence that voice could become a primary interface for AI systems embedded in homes, vehicles, workplaces and autonomous machines.

From Novelty Interfaces to Production Systems

Voice interaction is not new, but the reported direction marks a shift away from command-based assistants toward full-duplex conversational AI: systems capable of interrupting, responding in real time and managing dialogue more fluidly.

The Information reported that OpenAI had consolidated several internal research and product teams into a dedicated audio initiative, aimed at improving latency, turn-taking and conversational flow. These are areas where audio interfaces have historically lagged behind text-based models. These improvements were described as prerequisites for deploying voice AI in continuous, production-grade environments, rather than as experimental features.

This evolution is particularly relevant for robotics and embodied AI, where speech must function reliably alongside sensors, motion control, and decision-making systems. In these settings, audio becomes an operational interface rather than a convenience layer.

Enterprise and Commercial Implications

Beyond consumer devices, OpenAI’s reported audio strategy has implications for enterprise software, customer operations, and industrial automation.

The reporting suggested that OpenAI’s planned audio model was intended to support persistent, always-on interaction, allowing AI systems to remain context-aware without requiring explicit prompts. For businesses, this capability could enable new classes of AI agents to operate within workflows such as customer service, logistics, healthcare support and field operations. This is contingent on latency, compliance and reliability thresholds being met.

This positions audio AI as a potential bridge between cloud-hosted intelligence and edge-deployed systems, particularly in environments where screens are impractical, unsafe or distracting.

Latency, Trust and Infrastructure Pressure

The move toward conversational, always-listening systems raises fundamental questions for infrastructure providers and enterprises alike.

Low-latency audio interaction remains technically challenging at scale, especially when inference is handled in the cloud. As a result, analysts expect increased pressure on edge compute, distributed inference architectures, and on-device processing, particularly for robotics, wearables and in-vehicle systems.

Privacy and trust are equally critical. Persistent audio capture heightens concerns around consent, data retention and regulatory exposure, particularly in Europe, where voice data may be classified as sensitive personal information. Successful deployment is likely to depend less on model capability and more on transparent controls over what is recorded, stored, and processed.

Hardware Ambitions, Cautiously Staged

While OpenAI has explored hardware partnerships previously, The Information reported that any audio-first devices were positioned as a longer-term initiative, with internal timelines pointing to 2027 rather than an immediate commercial launch.

The cautious staging reflects lessons from earlier attempts to move beyond screens, where voice-centric products struggled with reliability, context awareness, and user trust. The reported focus suggests OpenAI is prioritising platform readiness and enterprise viability before committing to hardware at scale.

Why It Matters

OpenAI’s audio push is not just a product update; it is a signal of how AI interfaces are evolving as systems move closer to everyday deployment.

For consumer electronics, it points toward more ambient, screen-light interaction. For robotics, it reinforces speech as a control and coordination layer. Finally, for enterprises, it raises new questions about infrastructure design, latency, governance and how AI integrates into daily operations at scale.

Whether audio becomes the dominant interface will depend less on novelty and more on execution. In 2026, conversational AI will be judged not by how natural it sounds, but by how reliably it performs when systems are always on.",https://www.techerati.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Techerati-images-2026-01-07T112135.492.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 10:02:26.918495

Siegler,,,,,https://spyglass.org/microsoft-almost-acquistion-openai/,"I've long thought that the Inflection deal structure, and thus, the ""hackquisition"", was born out of a deal Microsoft nearly had to execute under duress.
Either OpenAI would reinstate Altman, or Microsoft would just hire the entire company.4 Sound familiar?
So yeah, Microsoft would have paid at least $25B, and perhaps $29B to do that would-have-been ""hackquisition"".
The key bit to remember here is that no one actually owned equity in OpenAI at the time.
And it highlights just how killer of a deal Microsoft would have gotten here.","When looking back at the origins of the ""hackquisition"" model for acquiring startups, Microsoft was clearly the godfather of such deals. Their March 2024 deal to not buy Inflection, but instead to bring on much of their team was groundbreaking in this regard, and it has led basically all of their rivals to copy (or expand upon) the same general structure.1 But actually, there was almost a ""hackquisition"" that Microsoft did before the Inflection deal... OpenAI.

I've long thought that the Inflection deal structure, and thus, the ""hackquisition"", was born out of a deal Microsoft nearly had to execute under duress. In November 2023, OpenAI's board ousted CEO Sam Altman and the ensuing weekend saw Microsoft, led by Satya Nadella on down, scramble to save the situation. The company had invested around $13B into OpenAI at the time – a lot of money in those days2 – and they were worried it was going to go to zero overnight.3 So they implemented a plan. Either OpenAI would reinstate Altman, or Microsoft would just hire the entire company.4

Sound familiar?

But wait, don't ""hackquisitions"" also involve some level of IP rights? You know, ""non-exclusive licensing agreements""? For show, if nothing else? Yeah, Microsoft didn't need those here because they already had far more rights to OpenAI's IP, thanks to their deal terms following their massive investments. So yes, this would have been the first ""hackquisition"". And now we know how much it would have cost.

Thanks to text messages from OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap, uncovered as part of Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company, to Nadella and Altman, we have the number. $25B. Or $29B if they wanted to include Ilya Sutskever. Which of course Microsoft would have, but given his role in said coup d'état of Altman, it's not clear that would have happened...

As relayed by Rocket Drew of The Information:

Lightcap disclosed Sutskever’s financial stake after the OpenAI board fired CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella prepared to hire Altman and OpenAI colleagues. Lightcap wrote to Altman and Nadella that paying OpenAI employees for their equity would require $25 billion excluding Sutskever’s equity, or $29 billion including Sutskever’s vested units. (It’s not clear how much Sutskever had in unvested equity.)

The day following the exchange, Microsoft chief technology officer Kevin Scott said publicly that Microsoft would hire and match the compensation of every OpenAI employee who chose to resign from the startup, in the event that Altman was not reinstated at OpenAI. Those hires never happened because the OpenAI board rehired Altman later that night.

So yeah, Microsoft would have paid at least $25B, and perhaps $29B to do that would-have-been ""hackquisition"". That's not too surprising since OpenAI was valued at... $29B during secondary sales that were taking place at the time. But the math wouldn't have been quite that straightforward.

The key bit to remember here is that no one actually owned equity in OpenAI at the time. This was long before the conversion to the public benefit corporation, and everyone from Microsoft on down simply had percentages of the rights to future profits. Microsoft was clearly willing to ""true up"" those employees and match the on-paper value, and seemingly assume that those employee shares equated to 100% ownership of the company. Of course, there were other investors in OpenAI, even beyond Microsoft. So the bigger question remains if they would have given those other investors anything.5

That is, of course, another key component to the ""hackquisition"", paying out investors to ensure they go along with the deal. Given how freaked out those investors were during ""The Blip"", it seems reasonable to think they believed they'd be getting nothing for their investments. But it's also probably reasonable to think that Microsoft would have given them something to avoid future litigation, if nothing else. Again, this is what Microsoft did with Inflection investors several months later.

And if that's the case, that probably would have pushed the deal well past $30B – especially if you consider compensation for Altman, who famously had no direct equity – or even ""Profit Participation Units"" – in OpenAI at the time (and apparently still doesn't). But if Sutskever was going to get $4B... Microsoft probably would have wanted to keep Altman happy, in order to keep him.

Anyway, there was one massive shareholder Microsoft didn't need to pay out: Microsoft. Everyone now knows they own 27% of OpenAI, but again, at the time no one had any equity. Microsoft had the right to 49% of those profits (though actually a much higher percentage until their initial investment was paid back) and undoubtedly could have and would have argued that meant they ""owned"" 49% of the company. Unless it was regulators who were asking.

Had anyone else tried to ""hackquire"" – or even actually acquire – OpenAI, they probably would have wanted at least $15B for their troubles, if not more. And it highlights just how killer of a deal Microsoft would have gotten here.

Call it $30B - $35B to effectively buy OpenAI in late 2023. Given that the company is currently raising around an $850B valuation just over two years later...

Alas, by the end of the weekend, Altman was back in place atop OpenAI and ""The Blip"" was just that, a blip. This is clearly the outcome Nadella and Microsoft wanted, undoubtedly due to regulatory concerns if nothing else. But the mad scramble also pretty clearly planted the seed that would grow into the ""hackquisition"" model.",https://spyglass.org/content/images/size/w1200/2026/01/ChatGPT-Image-Jan-7--2026--11_36_36-AM-1.png,N,,2026-01-07 08:01:14.838056

She highlights the mixed performance of current AI technologies, which succeed brilliantly in some tasks while faltering in others, challenging the notion of a one-size-fits-all human benchmark.

Anthropic President Daniela Amodei has challenged the AI industry's holy grail, suggesting that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—the theoretical point where machines match human-level intelligence—may already be an irrelevant concept. In a recent CNBC interview, Amodei argued that AGI no longer captures how AI systems simultaneously outperform humans in some areas while falling dramatically short in others. ""AGI is such a funny term,"" she said. ""Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?' I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong—or maybe not wrong, but just outdated."" Her comments arrive as tech giants pour tens of billions of dollars into AGI development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims we're ""confident we know how to build AGI"" and predicts powerful AI agents will join the workforce in 2025. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis estimates AGI is five to ten years away, while Anthropic's own CEO Dario Amodei previously suggested it could arrive as early as 2026. Elon Musk predicted his xAI company would achieve AGI by 2026—notably, after predicting it would arrive by 2025 last year.

Claude already codes better than professional engineers at Anthropic

Amodei pointed to concrete examples where AI has already surpassed human capabilities. Anthropic's Claude model now writes code comparable to many professional engineers inside the company itself. ""That's crazy,"" she said, noting the speed of advancement. In November 2025, Claude Opus 4.5 became the first model to exceed 80% accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark using real GitHub issues that professional developers tackle daily. Yet these same systems still falter at tasks that humans handle with ease. “Claude still can’t do a lot of things that humans can do,” Amodei acknowledged. This tension—superhuman performance in narrow areas alongside conspicuous weaknesses—undermines the idea of a single, universal general intelligence threshold.

The real question isn't when AGI arrives, but how businesses actually use AI

Rather than the milestones of AGI, the urgent question, according to Amodei, is how companies use these tools and the speed at which people can adapt. Even as the models improve, he says, adoption slows due to managing change, buying processes, and the difficulty of spotting where AI really adds value instead of just hype. For Amodei, the future of AI won't depend on whether it fits some textbook definition of AGI. It's going to depend on what these systems can do, where they miss the mark, and how society chooses to use them.

A further 67% want brands to label AI‑generated adverts and content, underlining the desire for human control at every step.","Greater uptake of AI is forcing a number of sectors into a rapid transition, and shopping is no exception.

A quarter of consumers used generative AI shopping tools in 2025 and a further 31% plan to adopt them in future.

That’s according to a new report from IT firm Capgemini, based on global consumer responses and interviews with retail executives.

“Brands must move beyond being optimised for search to being optimised for selection,” said Dreen Yang, EVP, global consumer products and retail lead at Capgemini. “Success increasingly depends on being chosen by algorithms, not just found by consumers.”

In practice, shoppers can apply AI in different ways, whether they make purchases directly through a chatbot, use algorithms for advice, or allow a virtual assistant to spend money on their behalf.

Last year, for instance, OpenAI announced that it would be allowing US users to purchase Etsy, Shopify, and Walmart goods through ChatGPT.

Other companies, such as Amazon, have proven more hesitant, blocking OpenAI crawlers and thereby restricting access to its product listings. By focusing on its own AI ambitions, Amazon hopes to retain control over the e-commerce advertising market.

According to Capgemini, 63% of surveyed consumers want generative AI to provide hyper-personalised shopping content, although concerns around the technology remain. For instance, 71% of respondents said they were worried about how generative AI uses their information.

The desire for human assistance also remains strong, with 66% of those surveyed valuing human support at the point of purchase. This means brands should offer “a balanced mix of digital convenience and human support,” said Capgemini.

In particular, helpline chatbots on company sites, intended to give instant, 24/7 support, were comparatively unpopular, only satisfying 57% of respondents.

Appealing to the bots

According to the report, retailers must adapt to the new age of shopping or risk being left behind.

To improve traction with AI bots, firms should provide machine-readable, continuously refreshed data, enriched with product attributes. This means that the technology can interpret, surface, and recommend products in real-time.

AI tools are more likely to recommend companies that give detailed context about their goods, as it is easier for the bot to understand who the item is for and why it is relevant.

Third-party sources like reviews and ratings also matter, said Capgemini, as they influence how large language models describe the goods or the brand.

Looking ahead, the continued popularity of chatbot shopping is, however, reliant on a number of factors. One key question revolves around the appetite of AI firms for advertisement. If shopping assistants become densely populated with adverts, it’s possible that consumer trust in their recommendations will decline.

Tapping into the transition

When it comes to a firm’s own AI offerings, it's important to adapt the tech to the consumer’s preferences, said Capgemini.

In other words, brands that stand out are offering diverse shopping experiences through one interface. Some users like to explore on their own, while others prefer step-by-step recommendations, both of which can be accommodated using AI tools. Novel offerings include “try-on” features for clothes or accessories, as well as ‘AI style advisers”.

Transparency and control around this technology is also crucial, said the report. A majority of shoppers want to set strict boundaries on digital assistants such as spending caps, and 63% want to approve or reject purchases initiated by AI.

The bank described Ubyx as a clearing system for digital money, including tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins.
“Interoperability is essential to unlock the full potential of digital assets,” said Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets and Strategic Investments at Barclays.
He said: “Our mission is to build a common globalised acceptance network for regulated digital money including tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins.","Barclays has bought a stake in US-based stablecoin settlement company Ubyx, marking the bank’s first investment in a stablecoin-related business as it looks to explore what it describes as “new forms of digital money”.

The investment forms – according to the bank – part of a broader strategy to engage with digital assets and tokenised forms of money. While they haven’t disclosed the size of the stake or the valuation of Ubyx, Barclay’s has stated that this was its first investment in a company focused on stablecoins.

Founded in 2025, Ubyx operates a clearing system designed to support stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are typically pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies. The platform aims to reconcile tokens issued by different stablecoin providers, addressing interoperability challenges as the number of issuers and blockchain networks continues to grow.

Interest in stablecoins and blockchain-based financial infrastructure has seen something of a renewal over the past year, with banks and financial institutions announcing a range of initiatives tied to digital assets.

This renewed momentum has been driven in part by rising cryptocurrency prices and renewed political attention in the United States, including support for the sector from President Donald Trump, which has contributed to increased market volatility and speculation.

Despite this renewed interest across the sector, many blockchain-related projects across the banking industry remain at an early stage of development.

Alongside Barclays, Ubyx has previously attracted investment from the venture capital arms of US crypto firms Coinbase and Galaxy Digital, according to PitchBook.

The stablecoin market itself has expanded rapidly, with the number of tokens in circulation rising sharply in recent years. El Salvador-based Tether currently leads the market, with $187 billion worth of tokens outstanding. Stablecoins are primarily used to move funds within cryptocurrency markets, though proponents argue their role could expand into mainstream financial services.

Barclays said the investment aligns with growing interest in tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins, particularly as regulatory frameworks begin to take shape in several jurisdictions. The bank described Ubyx as a clearing system for digital money, including tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins.

“Interoperability is essential to unlock the full potential of digital assets,” said Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets and Strategic Investments at Barclays.

The analysis piece - by Jim Burkhard, Vice President and Global Head of Crude Oil Research, and the S&P Global Energy Crude Oil Markets team - outlined that S&P Global Energy is still projecting a 1.4 million barrel per day global crude oil stock build in the first quarter of this year.
“However, there could be a more discernible impact on the heavy sour crude oil market,” the analysis piece stated.

The analysis piece - by Jim Burkhard, Vice President and Global Head of Crude Oil Research, and the S&P Global Energy Crude Oil Markets team - outlined that S&P Global Energy is still projecting a 1.4 million barrel per day global crude oil stock build in the first quarter of this year. The analysis also outlined that S&P Global Energy is still calling for Dated Brent to average $60 per barrel.

“However, there could be a more discernible impact on the heavy sour crude oil market,” the analysis piece stated.

“Venezuela accounts for one percent of global crude oil production but roughly nine percent of the world’s nine million barrels per day of heavy crude oil production. The United States and China are the world’s largest markets for heavy crude oil,” it added.

“Global heavy crude/heavy residual feedstock markets are currently narrowly balanced. Higher supply would be bearish for heavy sour crude differentials and high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) cracks. Lower supply would be modestly bullish,” it continued.

The analysis piece stated that, in 2025, Venezuela produced an average of 826,000 barrels per day of crude oil, excluding imported diluent that is blended into domestic production. Crude oil exports, including blended diluent, averaged 750,000 barrels per day, according to the analysis.

“Before Jan. 3, S&P Global Energy had already assumed a reduction in supply from Venezuela due to U.S. efforts to curtail exports on sanctioned oil tankers, and the view remains the same,” the analysis noted.

“While S&P Global Energy sees risk to the upside and downside in terms of production and exports, it is not enough either way to significantly alter the global oil balance in the first quarter,” it added.

“If sanctions were removed, Venezuelan oil production could grow but it would require at least several billion dollars or more of fresh investment to boost marketed production to 1.5 million barrels per day in the next 12-24 months - an increase of roughly 500,000 barrels per day from recent levels (including blended diluent),” it continued.

In the analysis piece, Burkhard stated that recent developments in Venezuela do little to alter the fact that the global oil market is facing a surplus at the start of 2026.

In a statement sent to Rigzone by the Morningstar team late Monday, which focused on the Venezuela situation, Morningstar’s director of equity research, Joshua Aguilar, said, “we don’t plan to alter our fair value estimates or our midcycle oil price estimates of Brent $65 per barrel and WTI $60 per barrel”.

“While significant Venezuelan supply increases to global markets could be bearish for our 10-year forecast, we think it will take years for supply to meaningfully increase,” he added.

“Venezuela will require years of large capital investments to modernize its infrastructure,” he continued.

In a comment sent to Rigzone early Tuesday, Aaron Hill, Chief Market Analyst at FP Markets, noted that the “Venezuela crisis trigger[ed]… [a] rally in commodities”.

“Crude markets … found support, with WTI rallying nearly 2.0 percent as the intervention cast fresh uncertainty over access to oil reserves,” Hill said.

In a statement sent to Rigzone on Monday morning, Naeem Assam, Chief Analyst at Zaye Capital Markets, noted that “oil remains range bound, with Brent near $60.9 per barrel and WTI around $57.4 per barrel, underscoring that macroeconomic weakness is outweighing geopolitical risk”.

“Despite U.S. actions tied to Venezuela and rhetoric from Donald Trump regarding control of Venezuelan oil assets under Nicolas Maduro, price reaction has been muted - clear evidence of headline exhaustion,” he added.

In a news conference held on January 3 in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, which was streamed by Sky News, U.S. President Donald Trump stated, “late last night and early today, at my direction, the United States Armed Forces conducted an extraordinary military operation in the capital of Venezuela”.",https://images.rigzone.com/images/rz-facebook.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 07:01:28.113876

That has implications for energy efficiency and the broader cooling market

When you think of liquid cooling for data centers, you probably don't think of hot water. But that’s exactly what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it can use to cool its new Vera Rubin supercomputers.

Contrary to what you might think (again), this could be good news for liquid cooling companies, despite the stock market's reaction to the news today. But first, here is the break-down of the news and what it means.

“The power of Vera Rubin is twice as high as Grace Blackwell. And yet – and this is the miracle – the air that goes into it, the air flow is about the same. And very importantly, the water that goes into it is the same temperature, 45 degrees C,” Huang said on the CES keynote stage on Monday. “With 45 degrees C, no water chillers are necessary for data centers. We are basically cooling this supercomputer with hot water.”

In case it’s not immediately apparent, this is a big change: 45-degrees Celsius is around 113-degrees Fahrenheit.

There are two big takeaways from this shift: one, it could be very good news for liquid cooling, and two, it could be good news for energy efficiency.

Good news for energy efficiency

Taking the latter point first, the ability to use high-temperature water eliminates the need for chillers and their power-hungry compressors. This, in turn, enables a shift to dry cooler systems.

Without nerding out too much, dry cooler systems can use ambient air – which in many places is under 45-degrees Celsius for many parts of the year – to cool the liquid running through the cooling system rather than a chiller.

Huang said in his CES address that the shift “enables us to save about 6% of the world's data center power.” That’s a huge deal in a market where access to power is a key constraint and consumption is a point of public criticism.

Good news for liquid cooling, too

But circling back to the first takeaway, the shift could also be good news for liquid cooling systems in general.

Dell’Oro Group noted in December that direct liquid cooling – the leading option for cooling high-performance computing – grew 85% in Q3 2025 and was on track to surpass $2 billion in yearly revenue.

“Liquid cooling has always had the opportunity to work at higher temperatures, like at 45-degrees Celsius, to cool these AI workloads,” Lucas Beran, Director of Product Marketing at Accelsius, told Fierce. “This cements the value that liquid cooling is bringing to the data center. You could not use 45-Celsius air to cool these processors.”

Beran added the change could especially be a boon for two-phase direct liquid cooling, which he said functions more efficiently at higher temperatures.

The dominant liquid cooling systems today are single phase, meaning the cooling liquid stays a liquid. Two-phase systems include a change from liquid to gas and back again. In October, Accelsius CEO Josh Claman told Fierce he believed two-phase cooling had reached a “tipping point” but noted some supply chain issues were slowing uptake of the technology.

“This starts to open the door for two-phase cooling’s better performance at higher facility water temperatures to resonate,” Beran said.

The looming question, of course, is what this means for the rest of the multi-billion-dollar data center cooling market. It doesn’t seem to bode well for vendors of traditional chiller and HVAC systems.

“If being able to support Vera Rubin chips with 45-degree Celsius water means you don’t need a chiller, then instead of buying a chiller you’re going to buy a dry cooler, which probably isn’t going to come from your traditional [heat] rejection supplier,” Beran said.

And the stock market reaction

Despite Beran's positive angle on the news, investors took it as a bad sign. Stocks for traditional cooling players Vertiv, Schneider Electric, Johnson Controls and Eaton all took a sharp dive when the markets opened after Huang’s address. All but Johnson Controls had recovered a few hours later. Vertiv, Schneider and Johnson all make chillers for data center applications.

Fierce reached out to Schneider and Vertiv for comment and will update this story when we hear back.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud4/media/image/liquid%20cooling%20silicon%20gpu_MJ%20for%20FN.png?VersionId=mwYyzRTGCJwBTaO6fzQPfcIs4pXxnWtF,N,,2026-01-07 11:03:57.906123

And its commanding EBIT of 16.0 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. It is well worth noting that Boston Scientific's EBIT shot up like bamboo after rain, gaining 31% in the last twelve months. That'll make it easier to manage its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Boston Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.

Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Boston Scientific recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 87% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.

Our View

Boston Scientific's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! We would also note that Medical Equipment industry companies like Boston Scientific commonly do use debt without problems. Considering this range of factors, it seems to us that Boston Scientific is quite prudent with its debt, and the risks seem well managed. So we're not worried about the use of a little leverage on the balance sheet. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Boston Scientific .

By Alexander Jones, International Banker

The consensus among analysts is that broad stability will characterise the global banking sector in 2026. That said, the key industry risks that periodically cropped up during 2025 have the potential to return during the coming year. While credit-rating firms are largely “neutral” on the sector for the time being, with most core financial metrics unlikely to be spectacularly impacted, they remain watchful for specific trends that could trigger a more pronounced downside scenario.

According to S&P Global Ratings, four key risks will influence bank ratings in 2026:

An escalation of geopolitical risks, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East;

A stronger spillover from tariff shocks to the real economy and financial markets than initially anticipated;

A weakening of banks’ regulatory environments; and

Evolving risks, including climate change and new technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).

As the global economy demonstrated throughout 2025, heightened geopolitical risks remain inescapable. Some regions are now gearing up to ensure their banking sectors can withstand potential adverse shocks from escalating conflicts, with Europe likely to do the most in 2026 to counter any destabilising effects.

A report published in October by the European Parliament—“The Impact of Geopolitical Risks on the Resilience of Banks in the Banking Union”—spelled out only too clearly how seriously elevated geopolitical risks could rock the banking sector’s stability. According to the report, empirical research indicated that associated spikes in geopolitical-risk indices coincided with potentially sizeable drops in bank profitability (especially for smaller and weakly capitalised banks) and asset quality (particularly for smaller banks), as well as with increases in banks’ perceived risks, as measured by the credit-derivatives market.

From a supervisory perspective, the report also found that geopolitical risks were reinforced by certain weaknesses in the management of cybersecurity risks, a finding that was generated by an ad hoc stress test of the cyber-resilience of major banks. “Although recovery plans were present in all surveyed banks, many institutions did not have in place specific tools for managing complex scenarios and preserving customer data and assets,” the research added.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has urged Europe’s banking sector to accept a new reality with more frequent shocks, including tariffs and cyberattacks, and to remain prepared for a range of possibilities, even when the exact nature of the next crisis is unknown. “Geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies, climate and nature-related crises, demographic change and technological disruptions are exacerbating structural vulnerabilities, making the likelihood of extreme, low-probability events unprecedentedly high,” Europe’s top monetary institution explained in a November statement. It also confirmed that strengthening banks’ resilience to political risks and uncertainties will remain the ECB’s top supervisory priority, with a focus on prudent risk-taking and adequate capitalisation.

On the tariff front, meanwhile, banks worldwide will likely remain wary of extending credit to certain industries and businesses, particularly those reliant on global supply chains. With margins being squeezed and the risks of corporate-loan defaults and higher capital requirements elevated, banks in 2026 will want to ensure they lend only to companies with sufficiently contained credit-risk profiles.

Some analysts have pointed to Europe as the region with the highest banking-sector vulnerability to trade wars. Citing various studies on the subject, BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria) found in August that European banking systems are both the “most” and “least” exposed to the trade war. “Italy is considered the most exposed via the Bank of Italy due to its exports to the United States and the composition of its credit portfolio, more concentrated in sectors affected by tariffs,” according to the Spanish bank. “Germany, Ireland and Slovenia have also been identified as vulnerable. Moody’s agrees in identifying Ireland, Germany and Italy as the most exposed, also suggesting that the banking systems of Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom could see their net interest margins (NIM) reduced due to the high proportion of variable-rate mortgages.”

Regarding the regulatory environment in 2026, analysts have stated that they expect a possible easing of certain rules for banks. Fitch Ratings, for example, projected an overall “looser” outlook for bank regulation as deregulation rises, with the United States and the United Kingdom leading the way—and to a lesser extent, the European Union (EU). Emerging markets, meanwhile, will see “tighter standards” to reduce banking-sector vulnerabilities and attract foreign investment.

“Key areas to watch for 2026 are the implementation of Basel III endgame rules in the US, amendments to resolution regimes, including depositor preference and capital stack, and digital asset innovation and the increasing scrutiny of private credit markets,” Fitch noted in its “Global Banking Regulation Outlook 2026” report. “We expect macroprudential policies to vary across regions, with a looser stance in low-growth developed markets and a tighter approach in high-growth, high-inflation emerging markets.”

While the major credit-rating firms have been clear about the key risks to global banking that may emerge in 2026, their overall outlooks have nonetheless suggested a largely moderate, stable environment for global lenders. For example, despite persistent challenges such as geopolitical tensions and high trade barriers, Moody’s 2026 outlook highlighted broad stability across the sector, with strong bank creditworthiness supported by resilient asset quality, solid funding profiles and sustained profitability.

This is largely owing to a resilient, albeit slowing, US economy, while several of the largest European countries may even see their real GDP (gross domestic product) gradually increase from modest levels. In emerging markets, Moody’s has highlighted rapid GDP growth across several key regions, particularly India, the fastest-growing economy in the G20 (Group of Twenty).

“Broadly stable employment levels and lower interest rates will support credit quality, although central bank monetary policies are diverging,” according to the rating firm’s global co-head of banking, Donald Robertson. “Net interest margins will likely be squeezed by lower rates in some regions, but banks will mitigate this by growing other sources of income. And healthy capital and reserve levels will continue to support both credit growth and shareholder distributions. However, the prospect of a looser regulatory environment adds some incremental risk for bank creditors.”

Similarly, S&P Global Ratings has forecast broad rating stability for global banks in 2026, with 85 percent of its ratings currently assigned a “stable” outlook. “Banks’ balance sheets are solid, characterized by good capitalization, sound asset quality, and adequate funding and liquidity,” an S&P report published on December 9 acknowledged. “That said, banks are operating at a volatile time, when significant policy decisions and regional conflicts could disrupt financial markets and rapidly change the economic environment.”

Moody’s also observed that banks will continue to invest in their businesses in response to the rapid development of private credit markets, artificial intelligence and digital assets, all of which will reshape the sector for many years to come. “Beyond macro and regulatory drivers, structural change is accelerating. AI is being deployed across risk management, compliance, customer service and product design, improving efficiency but also introducing new operational and cyber risks,” Moody’s “Outlooks 2026: Global Banks” explained.

“Private credit is expanding its role as an alternative source of finance for corporates, increasing competitive pressure on banks in some segments,” the outlook also noted. “At the same time, digital assets and tokenized financial instruments are prompting banks to adapt their technology stacks and risk frameworks.”

Could private credit pose a major risk to the banking sector this year? Not according to S&P Global Ratings’ managing director of financial institutions ratings, Brendan Browne. “Such lending requires strong surveillance, a thorough understanding of collateral, and safeguards to ensure that such collateral is not being double-counted, that is, pledged elsewhere,” Browne recently explained. “That said, we don’t see this as a material systemic risk that could cause major widespread problems for banks. However, NBFI [non-bank financial institution] lending is likely to continue growing at a robust pace. Furthermore, for some banks, NBFI lending as a proportion of total lending has grown well into the low double digits and sometimes into the mid-teens or higher.”

Fitch Ratings, however, has specifically cited the rising exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), which now account for nearly 10 percent of bank loans, as a key risk to the banking sector, with US lenders particularly exposed. “While private credit offers opportunities, its complexity and opacity raise concerns about performance under stress,” according to Fitch’s November 21 outlook for US banks. “Consumer credit risk is increasing, particularly among lower-income borrowers facing high interest rates, eroding savings, and rising unemployment (forecast at 4.7 percent).”",https://internationalbanker.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Global-Banking.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 07:01:33.670077

ID27,L’Oréal,2026-01-07 11:05:10+00:00,Glossy,"Wellness Briefing: L'Oréal bets on LED, Amorepacific launches a smart mirror, and more from CES",Lexy Lebsack,,,,,https://www.glossy.co/beauty/wellness-briefing-loreal-bets-on-led-amorepacific-launches-a-smart-mirror-and-more-from-ces/,"The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas kicked off on Tuesday, and videos of viral new tech are already flooding social media.
The new mirror analyzes real-time skin-aging signals to predict aging and delivers personalized solutions tailored to individual needs, including product recommendations, according to the company.
“Amorepacific aims to lead the global beauty and wellness industry with holistic longevity solutions,” Hyojung Joo, head of Amorepacific’s digital strategy division, said in a statement.
L’Oréal Groupe is also betting big on new tech with its foray into LED light therapy.
“It’s the thinnest LED mask in the world, at one millimeter thick,” Guive Balooch, global vp of tech and open innovation at L’Oreal Groupe, told Glossy.","The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas kicked off on Tuesday, and videos of viral new tech are already flooding social media. This includes an AI-powered robot that folds laundry, smart Legos that change color and an electric spoon that makes food taste salty without using actual sodium.

On the wellness front, bionic footwear gained momentum — it’s a technology that Nike is developing, as well, and is often described as “an e-bike for walking.” As expected, health tracking is also trending, seen in a body-scanning smart scale from Withings, a new tracker watch competitor to Whoop from the brand Luna, and a $899 Longevity Mirror from Nuralogix that tracks blood flow to the face to rate the user’s longevity.

But it was Amorepacific, parent company of brands like Laneige, Etude and Sulwhasoo, that received a CES Innovation Honoree Award — for Skinsight, a new smart mirror developed with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Samsung Electronics. The new mirror analyzes real-time skin-aging signals to predict aging and delivers personalized solutions tailored to individual needs, including product recommendations, according to the company.

“Amorepacific aims to lead the global beauty and wellness industry with holistic longevity solutions,” Hyojung Joo, head of Amorepacific’s digital strategy division, said in a statement. The company did not share when the product will be available for sale.

L’Oréal Groupe is also betting big on new tech with its foray into LED light therapy. The company revealed an ultra-thin, flexible silicone mask on Tuesday, as well as eye patches. “It’s the thinnest LED mask in the world, at one millimeter thick,” Guive Balooch, global vp of tech and open innovation at L’Oreal Groupe, told Glossy. “It’s super, super easy to apply, it’s flexible, and we have [eye patch and] full-face versions, which is really cool.”

Both of the prototypes were made with U.K.-based I-Smart Developments, a global leader in LED device innovation and maker of LED masks from Omnilux, Beauty Pie and The Light Salon. Balooch believes that the large, plastic, helmet-like masks available from top brands will slowly lose their luster among consumers as thin, lightweight alternatives emerge. “[I-Smart Developments] found a way to make flexible electronics at the power [that is proven to be effective when] put into a mask,” he said. “It almost feels like a sheet mask.”

I-Smart Developments has completed more than 10 clinical tests on its LED lights, including four on L’Oréal’s new prototypes, which are shown to combat fine lines, sagging and uneven tone when used 10 minutes per day, Balooch said. L’Oréal Group is currently seeking FDA approval for both versions. If successful, Balooch will focus on developing chest, neck, forehead and chin versions. The exact price of the mask has not been determined, but it will launch at “a few hundred dollars,” to start, Balooch said. He hopes to rapidly scale manufacturing to lower the price for the mass market.

According to Mintel market research company, just 10% of U.S. consumers reported using an LED light therapy mask in 2025, up from 5% in 2023. However, Mintel found that these numbers soar when looking at interest among teenagers: 33% of U.S. consumers ages 12-17 reported using facial skin-care devices, like red-light masks or cleansing devices, within the past year.

Balooch told Glossy that L’Oréal Group will determine the right brand for the mask soon. He mentioned Lancôme, Armani, Prada and YSL as potential fits for the tech, which will launch in 2027.

“Longevity is a broad word, but for us, it’s about trying to, as much as possible, get our biology to be as young as possible — not just our chronological age, but also our biological age,” he said. “It’s a very exciting moment, because the tech is also evolving and allowing us to do it.”

Executive moves:

Esi Eggleston Bracey is stepping down from her role as chief growth and marketing officer at Unilever after an eight-year tenure at the conglomerate. Leandro Barreto, former CMO for Unilever’s beauty and wellbeing arm, will replace Bracey.

News to know:

TrueMed, an HSA- and FSA-focused online retailer, has taken on $34 million in Series A funding led by capital market firm Andreessen Horowitz. As previously reported by Glossy, pre-tax flexible-spending and health-spending accounts have grown in popularity as the “health is wealth” movement continues. As of January 2024, there was more than $1 billion in HSA and FSA accounts ready to be spent.

A new Gallup poll shows that more than half of Americans surveyed are interested in losing weight. The group found that 41% of Americans surveyed describe themselves as being overweight, and 26% are actively trying to lose weight. Broken out by gender, women are more likely to want to lose weight and more likely to attempt to lose weight. By age, around 30% of 18- to 34-year-old adults say they are overweight, compared with 44% of 35- to 54-year-olds, and 45% of adults aged 55 and older.

Healf, the U.K.-based wellness retailer, has hired A-list faces to front its resolution-focused marketing campaign starring supermodel Claudia Schiffer, DJ Calvin Harris and Olympian Miles Chamley-Watson. Schiffer is also an investor in the company, which took on an undisclosed investment from Iris Ventures in 2025.

The FDA approved the first oral GLP-1 on December 22. Currently called the “Wegovy pill,” it was developed by Danish pharma company Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and could be available early this year, according to Reuters.

Stat of the week:

​​Americans plan to spend an estimated $60 billion in 2026 to support their health, fitness and exercise goals, according to a U.S. survey by the global trade association Health & Fitness Association. The group found that 89% of survey respondents believe regular physical activity is one of the most effective forms of preventive healthcare, with top goals including mobility, strength, posture, flexibility and mental health.

After a turbulent start to the year driven by critical analyst commentary, Adobe's stock has shown signs of stabilization mid-week. The core of investor skepticism revolves around artificial intelligence, with growing doubts about whether the software giant's AI models can translate into measurable revenue quickly enough. Market observers view the current price action as a tentative attempt to form a base in a jittery trading environment.

The recent weakness was triggered by a downgrade from the research firm Jefferies on Monday. Analysts removed their ""Buy"" recommendation, shifting the rating to ""Hold,"" and slashed their price target dramatically from $500 to $400. Their rationale carries significant weight: the anticipated revenue boost from generative AI, spearheaded by Adobe's Firefly models, has been slower to materialize than expected. According to Jefferies, the aggressive AI strategy for fiscal 2026 has not yet been monetized to the degree the market had priced in.

This assessment prompted further adjustments. BMO Capital Markets also reduced its price target to $400, although it maintained its ""Outperform"" rating. This follows earlier caution from KeyBanc in mid-December, which warned of stagnating growth projections for recurring revenue.

The Demand for Tangible Results

The landscape for software equities has shifted. Whereas 2025 was heavily influenced by hype surrounding technological potential, investors in 2026 are demanding concrete results on the balance sheet. Jefferies analysts noted that adoption of Adobe's tools by casual users is progressing more slowly than hoped, partly due to a flood of cheaper AI alternatives.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

Even Adobe's current presence at CES 2026 and the release of its ""Creative Trends Report"" have so far failed to sustainably improve market sentiment. Wall Street is now strictly focused on financial metrics rather than thematic trends, a pattern evident across the broader sector where competitors like Salesforce have also seen a weak start to the year.

Technical Perspective and Future Catalysts

Closing at $335.46 on Tuesday, the stock is now testing a crucial support level around $330. A sustained break below this zone could open the door to further downside, potentially toward the psychologically important $300 mark. On the upside, bulls would need to reclaim the $350 level to improve the technical picture.

For a fundamental reversal in trend, Adobe must deliver operationally in the coming months. Meeting its first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) forecast of $5.85 to $5.90, alongside demonstrating an acceleration in recurring revenue from AI products, will be critical to restoring investor confidence.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2425134_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 12:15:33.817895

Catch up quick: The term vibe coding — describing projects in natural language instead of code — was coined early last year, but most vibe coding tools still required some coding.
Claude Code changed this by letting users talk directly to an agent and giving Claude full read/write access to files.
Another feature working in its favor: Claude Code runs in the terminal, where programmers actually work.
You can build astonishingly complex apps without looking at a single line of code,"" Shipper writes on the Every blog.","The big picture: A mass market, easy-to-use coding tool is a game changer for the 99% of people who, until now, had to rely on other people's software to do anything from building custom data tools to automating repetitive work to building apps or websites.

And Claude Code — Anthropic's AI coding agent powered by models like Claude Opus 4.5 — is having a moment.

Zoom in: Professionals and dabblers alike say Claude's latest tool is best for coding and outperforms others like Cursor, GitHub Copilot and even Gemini 3 Pro.

The tool can read an entire codebase, plan complex changes, write and debug code autonomously, run commands and loop for hours on tasks.

Catch up quick: The term vibe coding — describing projects in natural language instead of code — was coined early last year, but most vibe coding tools still required some coding.

Even as recently as early summer 2025, users still had to understand what a tool was doing in order to use it, Dan Shipper, co-founder and CEO of AI subscription service Every, tells Axios.

""You still really had to understand the underlying architecture, and maybe you still needed to go look at the code,"" Shipper says. ""It would get lost or go off the rails.""

Claude Code changed this by letting users talk directly to an agent and giving Claude full read/write access to files. ""You just tell it to do something, and it works,"" Shipper says, calling it an ""infinite vibe coding machine.""

State of play: The explosion of online excitement about the tool isn't about one dramatic breakthrough, but a result of different factors coalescing.

""The underlying models keep getting better,"" former OpenAI board member Helen Toner tells Axios. ""It's not that it's a huge change, but it's a noticeable improvement.""

Another feature working in its favor: Claude Code runs in the terminal, where programmers actually work.

But Toner thinks the real catalyst was the winter holiday that gave people the extra hours to set up Claude and experiment with it.

Claude Code might be the latest darling, but some say OpenAI's models have also recently reached a kind of escape velocity.

""It genuinely feels to me like GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5 in November represent an inflection point — one of those moments where the models get incrementally better in a way that tips across an invisible capability line,"" developer Simon Willison wrote in his blog late last year.

""We are in a new era of autonomous coding. You can build astonishingly complex apps without looking at a single line of code,"" Shipper writes on the Every blog.

Zoom out: Improved vibe coding has the ability to change who gets to make things and whether or not you even need to program.

""It's also a tremendous change in developer productivity, because once you're at that level, you're not just typing in a command and telling the agent to do something, and then just waiting. You're active.""

Shipper says this can give one engineer the productivity of four or five.

Yes, but: There's a big difference between being able to generate a working prototype via vibe coding and being able to create and iterate secure, enterprise-ready applications.

It often still takes someone with true programming skills to turn the former into the latter.",https://images.axios.com/Nn2V5-HoYAw4XcgZHIgl9z6aum4=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2026/01/06/1767735255166.jpeg,N,,2026-01-07 08:01:19.104346

Recognising that many fitness pledges drop by the end of January, the brand is turning a standard retail policy into a powerful tool to encourage active habit building, fun, and long-term commitment to movement throughout the year.

While 48% of Canadians prioritise fitness as their top New Year’s resolution, recent data from Drive Research (2024) reveals a stark tension: roughly 92% fail to see their resolutions through, with the second Friday of January infamously coined the 'Quitters Day.'

In response, Decathlon and creative agency Rethink are intervening at a pivotal moment, turning a simple purchase into a powerful act of self-commitment: Between January 1st and 31st, 2026, customers purchasing the KIPRUN 500 WR models are symbolically waiving their right to return the product, effectively 'locking in' their resolution. Members who stick to their resolution will be rewarded with 1,000 bonus loyalty points in recognition of their commitment to movement.

""We often talk about removing friction from the customer journey, yet here, we’re using friction as a strategic tool for motivation,"" said Xavier Blais, partner and executive creative director at Rethink. ""By challenging the standard return policy, we’re leaning into a fundamental brand truth: Decathlon deeply cares about its customers staying active. It’s a bold move for a retailer to suggest a product is unreturnable, but we’re flipping the script to show how this supports people’s goals: It transforms the brand from a vendor into an accountability partner.""

How does it work?

Everyone interested in starting their year in movement is encouraged to secure their own pair of the unreturnable shoe by following these easy steps:

● Purchase the Shoe: Go to decathlon.ca or visit any Decathlon store across Canada and purchase one of the best-selling running shoe models; KIPRUN men’s and women’s versatile and water-repellent running shoes, 500 WR.

● Take the Pledge: On the product page, customers will be shown a warning, stating that, by purchasing the shoes, they are agreeing to not return them as they’ll be sticking to their New Year’s resolution to keep moving.

● Receive the Reward: Customers will receive 1,000 bonus loyalty points upon purchase, and will keep them by completing their commitment (not returning the shoes for 30 days).",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2026-01/2321x2.gJpo2I0e.png,N,,2026-01-07 09:15:21.558397

With Delta trading at US$72.22, carrying an intrinsic value estimate that implies around a 49% discount and sitting only slightly below the average analyst target, you have to ask: is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.

Let’s dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.

Nvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our Senior AI Editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open-source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD’s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships

AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners including OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Lei, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, Senior Reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Boston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of Atlas that was shown on stage. Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via its browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer Editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, Consumer Reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

Razer joins the AI deluge with Project AVA and Motoko

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions and a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

With the feature called Spatial Aware, you use your smartphone camera to take pictures of a room decorated with Hue lights. The software identifies the light points and considers their location when distributing the color nuances of a color combination selected in the Hue app to the light points. Previously, the algorithms ignored whether the light points were adjacent or far apart – as is common with apps from lighting providers.

Continue after ad

Because the Hue software will consider spatial proximity in the future, lighting moods that imitate natural scenarios should appear more realistic. In a sunset scene, the lights on one side of the room would emit warm yellow tones to imitate the setting sun, while the ceiling lights on the opposite side would display darker color tones.

The function is scheduled to be available as a free update “from spring 2026” and will then be compatible with about half of the light scenes pre-installed in the app. Spatial Aware can then be activated via the light scene library.

HomeKit for cameras, AI for Automations

In addition to the new lighting concept feature, Philips Hue announces the long-awaited interface to Apple Home for the brand's security cameras in Las Vegas. The wired Hue Secure Camera, the Hue Secure Video Doorbell, and the Hue Secure Contact Sensors are to receive access to the Apple world by March 2026. From then on, live videos can be streamed via the picture-in-picture mode of the Apple TV set-top box, and push notifications from the Hue Secure system can be received in Apple's Home app. Philips Hue left open whether the cameras will then also support HomeKit Secure Video. The integration enables video storage in Apple's iCloud and location-based automations for camera recording. Previously, Hue lamps with Matter could be integrated directly into Apple Home, but not all of them.

The AI assistant, which has been announced repeatedly for a long time, is now finally to be launched in German. Philips mentioned the first quarter of 2026 as the timeframe. As soon as the AI assistance is available, it will enable rule-based creation of automations via voice input, contrary to what was previously known. Saying “Wake me up every day at 6:45 AM, except Wednesdays” should then be sufficient for the corresponding result, eliminating the need to click together the conditions with the graphical editor.

SpatialAware scenes take into account the position of all of the Hue lights in a room, using an algorithm to distribute light in a more natural way.

The savannah sunset scene with SpatialAware

The SpatialAware feature analyzes the layout of each room in the home with Hue lights, and then lighting scenes are tailored to your personal space. Lighting is meant to feel more immersive and dynamic than before.

The savannah sunset scene without SpatialAware

Right now, when a Scene Gallery scene is activated, the different colors are randomly sent to different lights without the system knowing where those lights are positioned. SpatialAware allows color to be distributed more intentionally for a more natural look. A scene that's designed to mimic a sunset, for example, will set lamps on one side of the room to warm yellow tones to mimic the setting sun, while lamps on the other side are set to darker shades.

SpatialAware requires the Hue Bridge Pro that came out last year, and it uses an iPhone or iPad camera to scan the room to figure out where each light is located. Scans can be updated with each new light that's added. SpatialAware will be accessible through the Scene Gallery, and it is an optional setting.

At launch, SpatialAware will be compatible with around half of the light scenes available in the Scene Gallery, and it has been designed primarily for nature-based scenes like lake mist, mountain breeze, and savanna sunset.

Along with SpatialAware, Signify is adding support for migrating multiple Hue bridges to a single Bridge Pro during the Bridge Pro setup process, and it is bringing Apple Home support to the Hue Secure camera line.

The Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell, and Hue contact sensors will work with Apple Home in the future, and users will be able to stream live video in picture-in-picture mode on the Apple TV and get real-time alerts using the Apple Home app.

The Hue AI assistant has been updated with the ability to create automations based on natural language user requests, such as ""wake me up at 6:45 a.m. every day except on Saturdays,"" and AI support is expanding to additional languages like Dutch, German, and Spanish.

Automations for lights and accessories are also now listed in the Rooms and Zones they control for easier adjustment, with options to rearrange content to put the most used automations front and center.

The new Hue SpatialAware feature is launching in spring 2026, while Apple Home support is coming in the first quarter of 2026. Multi-bridge migration and AI assistant automations are available now.",https://images.macrumors.com/t/0ytF2yHrAHCtRUNvDmDy-hHOty0=/1920x/article-new/2026/01/hue-spatialaware-savannah-sunset.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 05:59:48.966406

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

In today’s report, the committee says: For a decade, this committee and its predecessors have urged the Ministry of Justice to get a better understanding of the wider costs of its legal aid reforms.
The Ministry of Justice and the Legal Aid Agency acknowledged that a cyberattack on the agency’s online digital services had begun in December 2024, four months before it was detected on 23 April 2025.
It called on the Ministry of Justice to publish a timetable for implementing all the means test changes.
The Ministry of Justice will respond in due course.","The Ministry of Justice should consider changing its name to the “Ministry of Justice (for Certain People)” if it refuses to “wake up” on the subject of legal aid, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee suggests in comments published this morning.

Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative MP since 1992, said the so-called LASPO reforms to legal aid introduced in 2013 “are now at serious risk of going down in history as an extinction event for the entitlement to access to legal advice in large parts of the country”.

Dartmoor

In a report published this morning, the public accounts committee finds that the prison service, a Ministry of Justice executive agency, is spending around £4 million a year of taxpayers’ money on keeping Dartmoor prison in Devon empty because of its failure to negotiate a good deal for the lease. The prison, in use for more than 200 years, has high levels of radon gas.

Clifton-Brown said:

The issue of HMP Dartmoor is an absolute disgrace, from top to bottom.

We heard claims that the leasing of this unusable building, known for years by HM Prison and Probation Service to be choked with radon gas with all the health risks that entailed, was sensible, driven by the need for prison places. Our committee rejects this excuse outright.

Dartmoor appears to the committee a perfect example of a department reaching for a solution, any solution, in a blind panic and under pressure. This is obviously not how policy should be delivered.

Government must now respond to us on what it has learned from this catastrophic failure, and how nothing like it will ever be allowed to happen again.

Today’s report says that levels of radon in 2020 were nearly 10 times the acceptable limit in the prison kitchen. Despite that, the prison service signed a new lease in 2022.

The report says:

HMPPS acknowledged that it would have been helpful to have more information on the density of radon at the Dartmoor site prior to the lease negotiations.

However, it bizarrely maintained that signing the lease without undertaking a recent survey was sensible, given the prison capacity crisis at the time.

It argued that in the context of needing to spend over £600 per cell per night to temporarily hold prisoners in police cells under Operation Safeguard, £1.5 million a year for 640 prison places felt like good value for money…

Under the terms agreed, HMPPS cannot terminate the new lease until after December 2033.

Legal aid

A previous report by the public accounts committee in May 2024 had raised concerns about access to publicly-funded legal advice in areas of the country lacking face-to-face provision of legal aid.

The committee stressed that so-called legal aid deserts, large geographic areas without legal aid providers, risked disproportionately penalising groups who could access remote advice, such as people with disabilities or those with limited access to technology.

In today’s report, the committee says:

For a decade, this committee and its predecessors have urged the Ministry of Justice to get a better understanding of the wider costs of its legal aid reforms. A 2015 report noted the lack of analysis the Ministry of Justice had undertaken of the wider impacts of the reforms on itself and other government departments and stressed that it needed to do more.

In its 2024 report, the previous committee noted that while the Ministry of Justice acknowledged that the removal of most early legal advice via its reforms was likely to have led to additional costs to the public sector, its progress in measuring the scale of these costs was disappointing.

The Ministry of Justice and the Legal Aid Agency acknowledged that a cyberattack on the agency’s online digital services had begun in December 2024, four months before it was detected on 23 April 2025. It took action in April to boost security, informing legal aid providers that their bank details might have been compromised. However, the agency did not discover the full extent of the attack until 16 May 2025, at which point it took its systems offline

The risk of a cyberattack on the Legal Aid Agency’s systems had been rated as “extremely high” since 2021, it added.

Responses

Welcoming today’s report, solicitors’ representatives said that nearly 70% of the population were denied access to a community care legal aid provider in their area.

The Law Society said it had “long warned about the Legal Aid Agency’s antiquated computer systems”.

Their fragility had prevented vital reforms, including updates to the means test that could help millions more access legal aid. It called on the Ministry of Justice to publish a timetable for implementing all the means test changes.

The Ministry of Justice will respond in due course.

Cairo-based Bank NXT has partnered with IBM and Inspire for Solutions Development to modernise its technology stack as part of a broader push toward scalable, cloud-native digital banking.

Under the collaboration, Bank NXT has implemented IBM Instana, IBM Turbonomic, and IBM Cloud Pak solutions to strengthen real-time observability, automate resource optimisation, and improve system integration across its digital banking environment. The initiative aims to enhance platform resilience, minimise downtime, and expedite the delivery of digital services as Egypt’s banking sector advances toward more agile, technology-driven models.

Egyptian banks are increasingly under pressure to modernise legacy systems to support always-on digital channels, open banking connectivity, and collaboration with FinTech partners. Bank NXT’s technology upgrade reflects a wider industry trend toward cloud-native architectures and DevOps-driven operating models that can support rapid innovation while maintaining operational stability.

As part of the transformation, Bank NXT deployed IBM Instana to gain real-time visibility across its digital banking applications, enabling proactive monitoring and quicker issue resolution. IBM Turbonomic has been introduced to automate intelligent resource allocation across hybrid cloud environments, helping optimise IT utilisation and control infrastructure costs as transaction volumes scale.

The bank has also adopted IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation, running on Red Hat OpenShift, to consolidate systems and simplify application development and deployment. According to the bank, this has reduced platform complexity and supported a continuous delivery model for new digital services.

“Our collaboration with IBM and Inspire for Solutions Development is a crucial part of the bank’s transformation strategy,” said Tamer Seif, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Bank NXT. “By adopting the DevOps model and improving our business automation capabilities, we have enhanced the flexibility of our technology infrastructure. This prepares us to integrate with FinTech companies through an API-driven ecosystem and deliver faster, more responsive services.”

Alongside technology deployment, Bank NXT is investing in workforce upskilling through training programmes focused on observability, automation, integration, and DevOps practices. The bank said this is intended to ensure long-term sustainability of its digital platform and support the continued rollout of new digital banking services across retail and corporate segments.",https://ibsintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/banknxteg_logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 02:14:00.263858

Morgan Stanley Warns AI Could ... - International Business Times UK,Jim Manzon,,,,,https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/your-banking-job-safe-morgan-stanley-warns-ai-could-wipe-out-200000-european-roles-2030-1768978,"'Many banks have quoted efficiency gains coming from AI and further digitalisation to the tune of 30%,' Morgan Stanley noted in its report.
Several European lenders have already begun restructuring with artificial intelligence at the core of their cost-cutting strategies.
In November, Dutch lender ABN Amro announced plans to reduce around one-fifth of its full-time workforce by 2028, according to the Economic Times.
'Otherwise, we're storing up a big problem for the future,' Hillery cautioned, according to the Economic Times.
Jason Napier, head of European banks research at UBS, acknowledged that efficiency gains from AI are already evident in sectors such as audit, law, and consulting.","If you work in banking, your job security may have recently been called into question.

Morgan Stanley has projected that more than 200,000 European banking jobs could disappear by 2030, warning that artificial intelligence and rapid digitalisation are set to transform the sector in ways not seen for decades, according to a report by the Economic Times.

The analysis, which covers 35 major European lenders employing approximately 2.12 million staff, suggests that banks could reduce their workforce by around 10% within the next five years. This would equate to approximately 212,000 jobs lost across the continent.

For employees in certain areas, the outlook appears particularly bleak.

Which Roles Are Most at Risk?

Morgan Stanley's analysis indicates that job losses are expected to hit 'central services' divisions hardest. These include back-office and middle-office functions, as well as risk management and compliance positions.

The rationale is clear: these roles involve tasks that AI systems can perform more quickly and at lower cost. Monitoring transactions, preparing regulatory reports, and processing large datasets are prime candidates for automation through machine learning tools.

'Many banks have quoted efficiency gains coming from AI and further digitalisation to the tune of 30%,' Morgan Stanley noted in its report.

For workers whose daily responsibilities involve spreadsheets, regulatory checks, and data reconciliation, the implications are stark.

Banks Already Acting on AI Strategies

This forecast is not merely hypothetical. Several European lenders have already begun restructuring with artificial intelligence at the core of their cost-cutting strategies.

In November, Dutch lender ABN Amro announced plans to reduce around one-fifth of its full-time workforce by 2028, according to the Economic Times. The bank has identified AI as increasingly capable of handling tasks currently performed by staff, particularly in operations and compliance functions.

Similarly, in France, Société Générale's chief executive Slawomir Krupa has taken an assertive stance. 'Nothing is sacred', he declared in March, signalling that no division would be exempt from his drive to lower the bank's persistently high costs.

Why the Urgency? Investor Pressure Intensifies

This push towards automation is driven by mounting pressure from shareholders frustrated with European banks' persistently weak returns on equity, especially in comparison with their American counterparts.

Morgan Stanley analysts highlighted that AI offers lenders a new opportunity to improve their cost-to-income ratios—an important efficiency metric closely scrutinised by investors—particularly as traditional cost-cutting measures have 'largely run out of momentum.'

The forecast underscores how increased digitalisation could significantly reshape Europe's banking landscape in the coming years, especially among consumer-focused lenders and in countries like France and Germany, where cost-to-income ratios remain relatively high.

Senior Bankers Urge Caution

Despite the sector-wide push for AI-driven efficiencies, some senior figures within banking are urging restraint.

Conor Hillery, JPMorgan Chase's co-chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, warned against abandoning fundamental skills in the rush to automate. He emphasised that JPMorgan aims to balance AI utilisation—speeding up routine tasks—while ensuring junior staff continue to develop vital skills such as building cash-flow models and analysing price-to-earnings ratios.

'Otherwise, we're storing up a big problem for the future,' Hillery cautioned, according to the Economic Times.

Jason Napier, head of European banks research at UBS, acknowledged that efficiency gains from AI are already evident in sectors such as audit, law, and consulting. However, he noted that banks have yet to fully realise similar benefits. 'Cost bases remain large, and these powerful new tools are still not fully implemented,' he said.

UBS has already begun experimenting with AI-generated content, producing analyst avatars that deliver video updates to clients. The Swiss bank recently sent 250 of its senior leaders to Oxford University for an AI-focused leadership summit.

What Does This Mean for Banking Employees?

For the 2.12 million people currently employed by Europe's major banks, the next four to five years will likely require adaptation—whether through retraining for higher-value roles, transitioning to emerging functions, or exiting the industry altogether.

Morgan Stanley's message is clear: the era of AI-driven banking has arrived, and not everyone will be able to keep pace.",https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1780797/ai-adoption.png,N,,2026-01-07 04:13:44.574915

Instead, he decided to build the Exige Lotus never sold here—and then he turned it into something far more extreme than the factory ever dared.
The foundation is a 2005 Lotus Elise, but that’s where anything resembling stock ends.
Up front, Schmauderer imported an Exige V6 nose from overseas, then fabricated custom panels to make it work with the Elise chassis.
Lotus never sold the Exige America wanted, but now the Land of the Free arguably has the most desirable one.","Lotus has skipped the U.S. market plenty of times when it comes to its cars, and the Exige is a great example of that. While the Elise made it Stateside, latter versions of the harder-edged, track-focused Exige were formally kept out of reach; buyers in America could look, but they couldn't touch.

Saxon Schumauderer didn't accept that reality. Instead, he decided to build the Exige Lotus never sold here—and then he turned it into something far more extreme than the factory ever dared.

The foundation is a 2005 Lotus Elise, but that’s where anything resembling stock ends. Up front, Schmauderer imported an Exige V6 nose from overseas, then fabricated custom panels to make it work with the Elise chassis. Around back, things get even more involved: he sourced a wrecked Exige, salvaged the rear clamshell, repaired it, and grafted it onto his car. The result is a car that plenty of folks would likely take as the real deal.

The bodywork is only the appetizer, though. “The hardest part of the build was taking a 200 horsepower engine and building from scratch a complete system that could handle an excess of 1000 horsepower,” Schmauderer told Road & Track.

This was his first turbo build from the ground up, meaning everything, including fabrication, welding, wiring, ECU calibration, and drivetrain, had to be learned the hard way. “There was a lot of trial and error,"" he said. ""The build took many years of tinkering and has had four or five different configurations to make it how it currently sits.”

Originally, Schmauderer tried to make the Elise’s stock Toyota-sourced 2ZZ work. “I initially turboed the stock motor and was mildly boosted, which was still fun, but it maxed out the platform,” he said. Eventually, practicality won out. “I decided on [a new] powertrain after realizing the stock 2ZZ motor wasn’t going to cut the cheese.”

The solution came unexpectedly: a fully built K24/K20 “Frankenstein” Honda engine he scored for just $1500. Now force-fed by a turbocharger, the setup makes around 750 horsepower. That's an almost absurd number for a car that weighs well under 2000 pounds. It sends that power through a manual transmission, with a center-exit exhaust for maximum drama.

And here is maybe the best part: he's not done. Schmauderer already has a larger turbo rated for over 1000 horsepower sitting in the garage. “The goal would be to make the fastest stick-shift Lotus on the quarter mile,” he said. Everything else, he claims, is already ready for four digits. Lotus never sold the Exige America wanted, but now the Land of the Free arguably has the most desirable one. Eat your heart out, everybody else.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/untitledhjk-695c3153b681c.jpg?crop=0.832xw:0.738xh;0,0.142xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2026-01-06 23:59:17.991964

""We've essentially used AI to protect AI from other AIs,"" Prince told Business Insider.
She also leads Hugging Face's Frugal AI Challenge, encouraging academics and industry leaders to deploy AI models with efficiency in mind.
Anthropic bakes what it calls ""constitutional AI"" into its AI models, meaning they are trained on foundational guidelines of ethics and human values.
""Curious people get more done, and we've built a set of AI tools and assistants that help users do more with AI,"" Srinivas told Business Insider.","Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, the AI sector has undergone a significant transformation.

Model capabilities have advanced, agents are proliferating, and enterprises are spending big to roll out AI across their workforces.

At the same time, generative AI-human interactions have started to fuel mental health concerns. Investors continue to wait for their billion-dollar bets to yield returns. Companies contend with whether AI is actually boosting productivity. It's not just models creating friction: the data center boom that underpins AI deployment is straining electric grids and increasing utility bills, raising concerns about the tech's long-term sustainability.

Building the most powerful AI systems at the fastest rate possible is no longer enough to compete in today's AI arms race. Leaders must also consider public safety, trust, and environmental impacts.

So, who's stepping up to these challenges?

Since 2023, Business Insider's AI Power List has recognized the most influential people in AI across sectors. Looking back to the past 12 months, we've identified 25 key players who we believe are shaping this next wave of AI innovation — from the C-suite and behind the scenes.

They include executives designing AI infrastructure, investors betting on long-term value over hype cycles, researchers and activists confronting the social costs of AI, and founders building tools designed to help rather than harm. Together, they represent where AI will go next.

These are the most powerful people in AI.

Why they made our list:

Lin invests in AI startups at one of the world's most prestigious venture capital firms. As an early-stage investor in Nvidia, OpenAI, Google, and xAI, Sequoia is committed to backing the next generation of AI darlings. In late October, Sequoia announced two new early-stage funds totaling $950 million, inviting founders to create the ""next Amazon of the AI era"" as Series A bets on firms like Clay, Harvey, and n8n reach 10-figure valuations.

""Almost every single industry will be disrupted by AI,"" Lin wrote in Sequoia's October fund announcement.

Despite AI's colossal potential, Lin approaches investing with care. In October, Lin publicly cautioned founders and investors against relying on what he described as ""experimental revenue"" when evaluating AI companies, urging them to prioritize durable products and sustainable revenue over pilots and short-term deals.

Why they made our list:

Srinivas challenges Google's search dominance with Perplexity. In September, Perplexity, which the CEO calls an ""answer engine,"" raised $200 million at a $20 billion valuation, bringing its total funding to $1.5 billion in just three years.

Perplexity reported having an estimated 45 million active users in the second half of 2025. In July, the company rolled out Comet, an AI-powered web browser with agentic capabilities. Srinivas said Comet answered up to 18 times as many questions as Perplexity could alone.

The company also expanded Perplexity Enterprise Pro, its business tier with administrative controls and data protections, and it forged a partnership with US government agencies that use its tools. Together, these releases signal Perplexity's push beyond consumer search and into business and productivity.

""Curious people get more done, and we've built a set of AI tools and assistants that help users do more with AI,"" Srinivas told Business Insider.

Nvidia's growth prospects remain attractive

There are risks for the company that are holding Nvidia's stock valuation down. Wall Street is pricing in the potential for a slowdown in spending on AI infrastructure, while also accounting for the increasing competition in the AI chip market.

Still, leading cloud service providers continue to see demand for compute capacity outpace supply, which is good news for Nvidia. Nvidia's cloud customers are buying every graphics processing unit (GPU) the company can supply.

However, the EliteBoard G1a can be configured to house a 32 Wh battery.

CPUs and GPUs have never been tinier underneath the heatsink, but PCs themselves are still big and boxy. Not so HP's newly launched EliteBoard G1a range, because at under 780 grams in weight and 36 cm in length, it's possibly one of the smallest PCs around.

Admittedly, the EliteBoard G1a is essentially a business laptop that's had the screen ripped off and the sides all chopped away. But even so, the remaining keyboard still sports a numpad (though the whole thing is too compact to be classed as full-sized) and the internal gubbins are respectable enough, if just not very potent.

Not that HP is aiming the EliteBoard at gamers, of course. This is an AI PC for business users (the dedicated Copilot button really stands out), but if you got one with the best processor on offer, then you could do a spot of handheld-like gaming while pretending to juggle spreadsheets at work.

The chip in question is an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 Pro, which is a Kracken Point APU, with eight Zen 5 cores (4x Zen 5, 4x Zen 5c) and a Radeon 860M integrated GPU. That sports eight RDNA 3.5 compute units, which equate to 512 shaders. That's roughly the same as the Steam Deck's GPU, so it should give you an idea as to what kind of gaming you can do on it.

HP also offers the EliteBoard G1a with a Ryzen AI 5 340 Pro (six CPU cores, four GPU compute units) or the miserable Ryzen 3 330 (four CPU cores, two GPU compute units), so if you were offered a G1a at work, I know which chip I'd be demanding.

Naturally, for such a market, RAM options are limited to a maximum of 64 GB, in the form of two DDR5-5600 SODIMMS, and up to 2 TB of Gen 4 NVMe storage. For some reason that I can't fathom just yet, the Ryzen 7 350 variant comes with 32 GB of eMMC flash storage, whereas the others don't. Answers on a postcard as to what one can genuinely use that for.

The whole caboodle requires a 65 W power supply to run, and you can provide that either via the provided adapter, or if you have a suitable monitor, you can use the same USB Type-C cable for sending the display signal. However, the EliteBoard G1a can be configured to house a 32 Wh battery.

For connectivity options, it's barebones, I'm afraid: just two USB Type-C ports (USB4 and USB 3.2 10 Gbps), and either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7. Oh, and Bluetooth 5.3 or 6, depending on what Wi-Fi module you choose. There's no LAN port, SD card reader, or anything else.

And yet, despite all its limitations, the EliteBoard G1a reminds me somewhat of the first home computers I used in the early 1980s. Those were very much the same thing: just a keyboard with a couple of sockets, plus a cable for the TV and one more for power.

Even though they were incredibly basic, I enjoyed years of programming and gaming on them, and I dare say the same thing could happen with this svelte HP.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9ozn9B2ifHCo4dQTVC9RH-2560-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 00:58:25.278952

An update from Plug Power ( (PLUG) ) is now available.

On December 30, 2025, Plug Power entered into a 15-year Release Event License Agreement with Walmart that establishes a contingency framework for Walmart to access escrowed GenKey System-related software, documentation and materials solely for internal maintenance of its facilities if certain defined release events occur, while Plug Power retains all intellectual property rights. The agreement also sets out Plug Power’s efforts to qualify alternative fuel cell stack suppliers, gives Walmart limited conditional rights around stack sourcing, provides for compensation to Walmart under certain circumstances for costs to sustain industrial truck operations, and structures a tiered fee arrangement under which Walmart pays one-time and annual license fees that increase if a release event is triggered. As part of the deal, Walmart irrevocably terminated a 2017 transaction agreement and forfeited all vested portions of a warrant to purchase Plug Power common stock, with all unvested portions cancelled, thereby eliminating potential future dilution of up to 42,192,479 shares and removing 34,554,185 vested warrant shares and 7,638,294 unvested shares from Plug Power’s future share issuance overhang.

Spark’s Take on PLUG Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, PLUG is a Neutral.

Plug Power’s overall stock score reflects significant financial challenges, with persistent losses impacting profitability and cash flow. However, positive strategic initiatives and corporate events provide some optimism. Technical analysis and valuation remain moderate, with mixed signals and a challenging valuation due to ongoing losses. The earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth and strategic positioning, contributing positively to the score.

AI Tools in Shopping AI tools are becoming a staple of online shopping services, no longer in experimentation but readily accessible to customers throughout their shopping journey.","Capgemini has released its 2026 Consumer Report, detailing how consumer value has now shifted toward fairness, transparency, and emotional connection.

The technology service provider has revealed that consumers now prioritize fairness and transparency, with 71% of respondents agreeing they would switch brands if pack sizes or quality of products were decreased without prior communication.

Furthermore, the report highlights how AI tools have become significantly more influential in online shopping; however, consumers still expect transparency when AI comes into play.

The report, which surveyed 12,000 consumers, uncovers that even as technology grows in the retail space, human interaction remains essential to its success.

Fairness and Transparency

Despite low pricing still driving significant revenue, fairness and transparency are also key to defining value for a brand.

This comes with clear communication; if one brand can clearly advertise its products with promotional and valuable deals, customers are keen to switch their loyalty to brands that can provide this.

In fact, 74% of consumers revealed they would switch brands if they had found lower prices elsewhere, as well as 61% agreeing that promotional bundles that combine products with higher value services are worth purchasing. These can include guaranteed faster deliveries, or product benefits that assure cleanliness, health, or environmental advantages.

Priyanka Bhargav, Head of Insights and Brand Strategy at Flipkart, argues that consumers are more likely to spend more for free delivery promotions, discounts, and bundles if brands can advertise these extras as valuable:

“These customers are willing to pay a little extra for faster delivery, signaling that convenience and immediacy are becoming universal expectations.”

Low pricing cannot get the results on its own, brands that can provide meaningful experiences with clear transparency to their consumers will set the expectations in the industry.

However, consumers are still willing to purchase products that are more expensive, as the report notes an increase in customer assessments, not just product, quality, and price, but also the brand itself.

If a brand can prove it holds itself to reliable, transparent, and ethical standards, they are more likely to see an increase in consumer loyalty.

Transparency is more than clear communication, it influences trust and loyalty by demonstrating how it puts customers first.

Brand Connection

Consumers are also willing to stay with a brand if their loyalty is already established, usually if there’s a previous level of trust and admiration, especially if it’s for both parties.

For example, a consumer who works or has previously worked with a brand may stay loyal when making purchasing decisions as a personal connection has previously been established.

If a brand is already well-established, with high-end luxury shops such as Chanel or Gucci, this can foster brand loyalty without the need for promotional bundles, but having already positioned itself as a stereotypical desired brand.

Customers are unlikely to move to a non-luxury brand during price increases or product changes as this comes with the brand expectations, consumers of high-retail brands are likely to remain loyal as customers remain trusting in their company decisions.

This is also true of child-centered brands, where parents are more likely to remain loyal to a brand during price increases or product changes if their child is showing positive signs with a brand compared to another.

In regard to pricing, customers may also choose to stay with a brand long-term if it offers customized benefits and rewards for remaining loyal.

In the report, 70% of consumers agreed that personalized coupons based on their purchase history was a good practice, as well as 68% of consumers believed that member-only pricing for loyalty program subscribers was a good idea.

These practices provide emotional brand connection, if consumers believe they are being offered reduced prices to help with their everyday purchases, they are more likely to stay.

AI Tools in Shopping

AI tools are becoming a staple of online shopping services, no longer in experimentation but readily accessible to customers throughout their shopping journey.

The report reveals that 2025 saw a quarter of respondents having used Gen AI shopping tools to enhance their decision-making, as well as over 73% of consumers having used a chatbot for query resolution at least once.

These tools provide customers with out-of-hours support, product availability, and promotions for discounted purchases.

These AI bots can also be used to continue customer engagement even after a purchase is made, with 61% of consumers having received personalized follow-ups and 54% satisfied with the results, featuring product instructions, tips, and recommendations.

By offering post-purchase support, brands can boost their customer engagement and increase future purchases.

However, almost half of the respondents who use chatbots are not satisfied with the experience, as many retail bots still lack the ability to deliver human-level capabilities, or even transfer consumers to a human support agent.

Friction AI bot experiences can taint a consumer’s impression of a brand, increasing disengagement and disappointment.

This has led to only 8% of respondents agreeing they would pay a monthly fee for a chatbots or AI assistant to make automatic purchases on their behalf, highlighting how AI bots still have a long way to go before building absolute customer trust.

Currently, 76% of consumers want to set boundaries for these digital assistants; by ensuring customer control around preferences, privacy, data management, and shopping experiences, AI can enhance its relevance in the industry if the customer is confident in the bot’s actions.

By first introducing clear transparency around data governance, compliance and security measures, brands can then introduce customers to AI assistant perks, personalizations, and rewards.",https://www.cxtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Capgemini-Reveals-How-Transparency-and-Connection-Now-Drives-Consumer-Loyalty.png,N,,2026-01-07 08:00:40.927501

If this has you thinking beyond packaged foods, it could be a good moment to widen your search with and spot companies where growth and insider conviction line up.

With Kraft Heinz shares lagging over 1 and 3 years, yet trading at a discount to analyst targets and some models of intrinsic value, you have to ask: is this a reset level that offers upside, or is the market already pricing in all the growth ahead?

Most Popular Narrative: 13.3% Undervalued

With Kraft Heinz last closing at US$23.51 against a narrative fair value of US$27.13, the current gap is all about what future earnings power looks like.

Ongoing portfolio optimization divesting non-core brands and reinvesting into high-margin segments and key power brands should lead to structurally higher operating margins and improved profitability in future periods. Continued disciplined investment in marketing and the Brand Growth System, especially in North America retail, is already showing performance improvement and is expected to stabilize and eventually reaccelerate top line revenue while maintaining pricing power in an environment of rising consumer price sensitivity.

CES is a huge opportunity annually for companies both large and small to parade products they plan to put on shelves this year. As predicted, artificial intelligence was anchored in nearly everything as tech firms continue to look for AI products that will attract customers.

Here are the highlights from Day 1:

Nvidia gets physical

The biggest buzzword in the air at CES is ""physical AI,"" Nvidia's term for AI models that are trained in a virtual environment using computer generated, ""synthetic"" data, then deployed as physical machines once they've mastered their purpose.

CEO Jensen Huang showed off Cosmos, an AI foundation model trained on massive datasets, capable of simulating environments governed by actual physics. He also announced Alpamayo, an AI model specifically designed for autonomous driving. Huang revealed that Nvidia's next generation AI superchip platform, dubbed Vera Rubin, is in full production, and that Nvidia has a new partnership with Siemens. All of this shows Nvidia is going to fight increased competition to retain its reputation as the backbone of the AI industry.

But once Huang called for two little, waddling, chirping robots to join him on stage, that's all the audience wanted to see more of.

The chips are back in town

AMD CEO Lisa Su announced a new line of its famed Ryzen AI processors as the company continues to expand its footprint in the world of AI-powered personal computers.

For gamers, AMD also showed off the latest version of its gaming-focused processor, the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D.

Meanwhile, Intel announced its new AI chip for laptops, Panther Lake (also known as the Intel Core Ultra Series 3), and said the company has plans to launch a new platform to address a growing market for handheld video gaming machines.

WATCH: What's next for AI and has its explosive growth in 2025 created a bubble?

Intel, a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone. It fell further behind after the AI boom propelled Nvidia into the spotlight.

President Donald Trump's administration stepped in recently to secure a 10% stake in the company, making the government one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel to support U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing.

Uber dives back into the robotaxi game

Uber is giving the public a first look at their robotaxi at CES this week. Uber, along with luxury electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Motors and vehicle tech company Nuro, introduced an autonomous vehicle with an Uber-designed in-cabin experience.

Uber calls it the most luxurious robotaxi yet. It features cameras, sensors and radars that provide 360-degree perception and a low-profile roof ""halo"" with integrated LEDs that will display riders' initials to help them spot their car and track their ride status. Inside, riders can personalize everything from climate and seat heating to music, while real-time visuals show exactly what the vehicle is seeing on the road and the route it plans to take.

Autonomous on-road testing began last month in San Francisco, led by Nuro, marking a major step toward what the companies said is a planned launch before the end of the year.

Star Wars and Lego announce a new partnership

When Lucasfilm chief creative officer David Filoni brought out an array of X-Wing pilots, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C-3PO, he won the Star Wars fandom for Lego.

Lego announced its Lego Smart Play platform on Monday, which introduces new smart bricks, tags and special minifigs for your collection. The new bricks contain sensors that enable them to sense light and distance, and to provide an array of responses, essentially lights and sounds, when they are used in unison.

Combine this with a newly announced partnership with the Star Wars franchise and now you can create your own interactive space battles and light-saber duels.

LG reveals a new robot to help around the home

File this one under intrigued, for now.

The Korean tech giant gave the media a glimpse Monday of its humanoid robot that is designed to handle household chores such as folding laundry and fetching food. Although many companies have robots on display at CES, LG certainly is one of the biggest tech companies to promise to put a service robot in homes.

It will be on display beginning Tuesday, so we'll have more to report soon.

What's new with lollipops?

Music you can taste was on display Monday at CES: Lollipop Star unveiled a candy that plays music while you eat it. The company says it uses something called ""bone induction technology,"" which lets you hear songs — like tracks from Ice Spice and Akon — through the lollipop as you lick it or bite it in the back of your mouth, according to spokesperson Cassie Lawrence.

The musical lollipops will go on sale after CES on Lollipop Star's website for $8.99 each. And if that wasn't enough star power, Akon was expected to visit the company's booth Tuesday when CES opens to the public.

Atlas holds up Hyundai's (manufacturing) world

Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics publicly demonstrated its humanoid robot Atlas for the first time at the CES tech showcase, ratcheting up a competition with Tesla and other rivals to build robots that look like people and do things that people do.

The company said a version of the robot that will help assemble cars is already in production and will be deployed by 2028 at Hyundai's electric vehicle manufacturing facility near Savannah, Georgia.

Delta gets spherical

Delta Air Lines is taking entertainment to new heights as the ""official airline"" of the Sphere in Las Vegas. The airline announced a new multiyear partnership with Sphere Entertainment Co. that it says will deliver premium experiences to the venue, including a Delta SKY360° Club lounge.

The carrier said SkyMiles members can unlock exclusive access to other experiences at the Sphere, starting during the final weekend of the Backstreet Boys' residency in February with features including private suite seating, food and beverages. The partnership brings Delta branding to the Sphere's massive exterior LED screen.

Former Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle told Skift in September that the ultra-low-cost carrier was also considering an in-flight Wi-Fi option.
Delta Air Lines also has free Wi-Fi on most of its domestic and international flights.","American Airlines launched free in-flight Wi-Fi Tuesday, joining a growing industry trend that has carriers racing to offer travelers high-speed connections.

The airline said it would roll out the free Wi-Fi in phases across all of its narrowbodies and dual-class regional fleets, and expects the installation to be complete by early spring. American’s new Boeing 787-9 and 787-8 will also feature free Wi-Fi.

The Wi-Fi is free only for members of American’s loyalty program. AT&T is sponsoring the service and Viasat and Intelsat are providing the connectivity.

American was reportedly in talks with Amazon for Leo in-flight Wi-Fi, according to Bloomberg News. American did not confirm whether it was considering Amazon.

“American Airlines is committed to delivering an enhanced customer experience that meets the expectations of today’s travelers and to ensure as such, we are constantly in conversation with various companies and groups to discuss future opportunities,” American said in a statement to Skift.

Free Wi-Fi has become an increasingly popular option for airlines as the industry looks to cater to more premium and business travelers. JetBlue was the first U.S. carrier to offer free Wi-Fi in 2013 and is now the launch customer for Amazon’s Project Kuiper, a competitor to Starlink. Former Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle told Skift in September that the ultra-low-cost carrier was also considering an in-flight Wi-Fi option.

United Airlines started offering free in-flight connectivity through Starlink in 2025. Delta Air Lines also has free Wi-Fi on most of its domestic and international flights.

American’s Premium Push

American has also made a host of changes to its customer experience to capitalize on the premium boom that has led its competitors — Delta and United — to report record profits. Some of the other changes include bringing back champagne to business class, partnering with Italian coffee company Lavazza, and expanding business class to more routes.

American was the first U.S. carrier to debut the Airbus A321XLR, an “extra-long-range” single-aisle jet that can travel transatlantic and transcontinental routes. The new aircraft features 20 new Flagship suites — American’s business class product.

During the 2025 Skift Aviation Forum, American chief customer officer Heather Garboden said premium demand has been the most resilient. She added that American aims to increase the number of premium seats by 30% by the end of the decade and 50% across long-haul flights.

“We’ll have more free satellite-based Wi-Fi on our aircraft than any other airline in the entire world,” she said. “So while I think premium demand is kind of the focus right now, I have no doubt that whether that changes over the next decade or so or it doesn’t, we also are focused on all customers, not necessarily just premium.”","https://skift.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2K4A3209-scaled-e1715613640958.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2026-01-07 07:00:31.217116

Quantum is the next frontier, with quantum-ready organizations worldwide three times more likely to belong to multiple ecosystems than their least ready counterparts.

DUBAI, UAE – The IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) has unveiled Five Trends for 2026, a new report identifying the forces that will redefine competitive advantage for organizations in the UAE and around the world in the year ahead. As 2026 begins, the research shows that uncertainty isn’t slowing business down it’s accelerating transformation.

To thrive, companies are doubling down on technologies that provide speed, resilience, and insight. AI has shifted from experimental to essential, redefining decisions, roles, and customer expectations at an unprecedented pace. Enterprises are moving towards operating with AI at the core, and soon, quantum will help tackle their most complex problems.

“The findings point to a fundamental shift in how organizations are approaching growth and competitiveness in 2026,” said Shukri Eid, General Manager, IBM Gulf Levant and Pakistan. “In the UAE, leaders are accelerating decision-making, embedding AI at the core of their operations, and strengthening resilience and sovereignty across their technology environments. At the same time, there is a clear focus on building trust - with employees, customers, and partners - as AI becomes more deeply integrated into everyday business. Together, these priorities are shaping organizations that are better prepared to adapt, collaborate across ecosystems, and take advantage of emerging technologies such as quantum.”

Fast decisions turn disruption into opportunity

Of the executives surveyed in the UAE, 95% say they increasingly need to make fast decisions, and all believe the highest-stakes decisions they made in 2025 were the right ones – that’s 4% above the global average. Uncertainty can become the greatest business asset for those who embrace it, with 63% of the respondents saying economic and geopolitical volatility will create new business opportunities for their organizations in 2026. The report notes that 93% of UAE executives fear they’ll lose their edge if they can’t operate in real time.

Employees are ready to embrace AI-driven role changes

The research shows that employees no longer fear AI they want to embrace it, even if that means their roles will change significantly. Globally, 81% are confident they can keep up with new technologies, and 61% think AI makes their job less mundane and more strategic. Across all generational groups from digital natives to seasoned veterans at least twice as many employees would welcome rather than resist greater use of AI by their employers in 2026. In addition, 63% would work with an AI agent.

Consumers are excited about AI, but transparency is mandatory

While consumers don’t need AI to be flawless, they do need to be in the loop. Easy-to-understand explanations of how AI is using their data are what make consumers most comfortable engaging with it. Among the consumers surveyed worldwide, 89% want to know when they’re interacting with AI, and four in five say they would trust a brand less if it intentionally concealed AI use. Two-thirds would switch brands – and half would even pay more – to avoid hidden AI. Meanwhile, 95% of global executives believe consumer trust in their AI will define the success of new products and services.

AI resilience and sovereignty become essential

In the face of growing uncertainty, AI resilience and sovereignty – an organization’s ability to control and govern its AI systems, data, and infrastructure at all times – have become mission-critical. In the UAE, 98% of executives say AI resilience and sovereignty must be part of their 2026 strategy, and 63% worry about overdependence on compute resources.

Quantum will require deep ecosystem collaboration

Quantum demands resources no single entity can realistically maintain alone in short, it takes an ecosystem, or several. Quantum-ready organizations (QROs) worldwide are three times more likely to participate in multiple ecosystems than their least ready counterparts. In the UAE, four in five executives (80%) say ecosystem partners help accelerate technology adoption, while 88% believe these partners enable their company to limit the impact of disruption, and an equal number agree that partner data improves business outcomes. The findings indicate that enterprises forging the best ecosystem alliances today are positioning themselves to lead in the quantum era.

With Delta’s exit from the direct New York service, Brussels Airlines will once again become the sole operator of nonstop flights between Brussels and JFK, while United will continue to serve the market from Newark.
Perspective and future outlook The end of Delta’s Brussels–New York nonstop service marks a symbolic shift in transatlantic aviation.","Delta Air Lines is discontinuing its non-stop flights between Brussels Airport (BRU) and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), bringing to a close more than three decades of continuous service on one of its longest-standing transatlantic routes. The final departure from New York took place on January 5, 2026, with the last return flight from Brussels on January 6.

The last flight DL141 from Brussels to New York JFK was operated by Boeing 767-332(ER) registered N196DN. It took off at 12:34 (UTC+1) instead of its scheduled time of departure at 11:00, due to weather conditions in Brussels. The estimated arrival time at JFK is 14:20 (UTC-5), only half an hour late.

Short History of the Route

The Brussels–New York service was inaugurated in December 1991, with Delta operating Airbus A310 equipment on a daily basis, marking the beginning of its direct link between the Belgian capital and the United States. Over the years, the carrier updated the route with larger wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 767-300ER, cementing its role as a key transatlantic connection. This service played a crucial role not only in leisure travel but also significantly for diplomatic and business traffic, given Brussels’ role as the seat of the European Union and NATO.

Like many international routes, the service was temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022) but was restored as travel demand recovered, operating four weekly flights in recent seasons.

Strategic shift: From New York to Atlanta

Delta’s decision to end the JFK–Brussels service is part of a broader network realignment intended to strengthen its transatlantic operations and optimise profitability. Instead of serving Belgium from New York year-round, the airline is shifting focus to its major hub at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). Beginning March 8, 2026, Delta will expand its Atlanta–Brussels schedule, initially with four weekly flights before moving to daily service during the peak travel season.

Delta’s executives have indicated that the shift reflects changes in market demand, especially in fare-sensitive economy cabins, and greater strategic value in feeding Brussels traffic through Atlanta’s extensive domestic and international connecting network.

For passengers based in the New York area, this move means the loss of a direct flight option to Brussels on Delta; travellers will instead have to connect via Atlanta or opt for other carriers.

Competitive landscape on the Brussels–New York Corridor

The competitive environment on the Brussels–New York corridor has been a persistent strategic challenge for Delta:

Brussels Airlines: As Belgium’s flag carrier and a member of the Star Alliance (via the Lufthansa Group), Brussels Airlines operates daily direct service between Brussels and New York-JFK, typically using Airbus A330-300 aircraft. Its strong local brand and alliance connectivity have made it a dominant player on this route.

United Airlines: A major U.S. competitor, United operates daily non-stop flights from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to Brussels, diversifying connections to the U.S. East Coast and beyond.

Delta’s Position: Unlike in other European markets such as Amsterdam or Paris, Delta does not have a joint-venture partner in Brussels, limiting its access to broader connecting traffic flows that alliance partners can provide. This has historically constrained Delta’s ability to capture a larger share of connecting travellers beyond point-to-point passengers.

With Delta’s exit from the direct New York service, Brussels Airlines will once again become the sole operator of nonstop flights between Brussels and JFK, while United will continue to serve the market from Newark.

Wider market and strategic implications

This route termination should be understood in the context of broader shifts in transatlantic aviation:

Open Skies Framework: Under the EU–US Open Skies Agreement, carriers from EU and U.S. countries can freely operate transatlantic services. While this has fostered competition, it also subjects airlines to intense fare pressure and the need for scale and alliances to sustain profitability.

Delta’s Network Optimisation: By focusing on Atlanta—where Delta controls a large share of connecting flows and has strong joint-venture partnerships with Air France–KLM and Virgin Atlantic—the airline aims to leverage its hub strength to better serve European markets, including Belgium.

Alliance Dynamics: The absence of a SkyTeam partner based in Brussels contrasts with Star Alliance’s integrated position via Brussels Airlines and United, illustrating how alliance networks shape competitive advantage on transatlantic routes.

Perspective and future outlook

The end of Delta’s Brussels–New York nonstop service marks a symbolic shift in transatlantic aviation. For Brussels, travellers and businesses lose a legacy direct link that has operated for 34 years. However, the market will remain well-served by alliance and incumbent carriers, and connectivity to the United States continues through diversified gateways.

For Delta, the strategic choice to channel Brussels traffic through Atlanta reflects a prioritisation of hub connectivity and network efficiency in a competitive global air travel market. How this strategy will perform in the medium term will depend on consumer demand for seamless connections, competitive responses from other carriers, and evolving alliance structures.",https://www.aviation24.be/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Delta_Air_Lines_B767-332_N1611B_Brussels_Airport_25L.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 02:59:18.962581

With Lenovo AI Cloud Gigafactory with NVIDIA, AI cloud providers can be among the first to tap the power of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra high-performance architecture to address the soaring demand to deploy sovereign, secure and specialized AI use cases with customized cluster designs across accelerated computing, storage and networking options. Built on decades of development collaboration, the program also ensures time to market access to the most advanced NVIDIA accelerated computing infrastructure. This includes the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 system from Lenovo with a fully liquid-cooled, rack-scale architecture that integrates 72 NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs and 36 NVIDIA Grace™ CPUs into a single platform.

The program will also support the newly announced NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 flagship system for AI training and inference – which unifies 72 Rubin GPUs, 36 Vera CPUs, ConnectX-9 SuperNICs, BlueField-4 DPUs, and Spectrum-X Ethernet in a rack-scale AI supercomputer to power next-generation gigawatt AI factories. This features new, advanced networking options with NVIDIA Spectrum-6 Ethernet switches and NVIDIA Photonics Ethernet switches.

Beyond optimized design, co-engineering, and deployment expertise, Lenovo Hybrid AI Factory Services deliver full-lifecycle capabilities that reduce factory stand-up time and support long-term differentiation with greater speed, efficiency and confidence. AI-native platforms and repeatable Lenovo AI Library use cases integrated with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, including the open Nemotron models, further simplify delivery of specialized horizontal and vertical AI workloads at scale.

Lenovo powers eight of the world’s top ten public cloud providers and is the only company offering fully in-house design, manufacturing, integration, and global services for custom AI cloud solutions. By unifying NVIDIA accelerated computing with Lenovo’s liquid-cooling expertise, global manufacturing and local reach, AI cloud providers can deploy AI factories faster, reliably at scale with trusted performance.

The result is a shorter path from AI investment to outcomes, helping organizations realize value faster and move AI into the core of their business operations.",https://news.lenovo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/HighEnergyWave_G1473215496-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 23:59:28.341502

Nvidia’s new Vera Rubin architecture was launched earlier than expected at CES, joined by announcements for its own Tesla-rivaling self-driving car technology, and the latest updates coming to DLSS, G-Sync display tech, and the GeForce Now cloud gaming platform.

While none of these hold quite the same appeal as a new generation of consumer graphics cards — something we might see at CES 2027, following the RTX 50-series launch last year — it can still be a lot to parse, especially through the vast slurry of everything else being promoted at the giant Consumer Electronics Show. We’ve rounded up the most significant announcements that Nvidia has made so far to help you stay on top of the news.

Vera Rubin ‘AI supercomputer’

Nvidia launched the Vera Rubin platform during its CES keynote, its next-generation successor to the Blackwell architecture that’s currently used in its most powerful AI chips. Nvidia says this new architecture, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, can train large “mixture of experts” (MoE) AI models as quickly as Blackwell, but with far greater efficiency. Dion Harris, Nvidia’s senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as “six chips that make one AI supercomputer,” which include the Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, NVLink 6th-gen switch, Connect-X9 NIC, BlueField4 DPU, and Spectrum-X 102.4T CPO.

Autonomous driving solutions

Nvidia is racing against Tesla and Waymo to build technology that will allow cars to fully drive themselves without human assistance, and it may now have the edge. Alpamayo, a newly announced portfolio of AI models, simulation blueprints, and datasets, can give vehicles level 4 autonomy — allowing them to fully drive themselves under specific conditions. “Not only does it take sensor input and activates steering wheel, brakes, and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it is about to take,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the presentation.

The first passenger car that will be available with this tech is the new Mercedes-Benz CLA, with AI-assisted driving features coming to the US this year. Nvidia’s answer to Full Self-Driving is impressive, according to my colleague Andrew J. Hawkins, who took it for a test-drive, and says that Tesla should be concerned.

DLSS 4.5 is here

The next major update to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) feature is now available for all RTX GPUs, providing improvements to image quality and fewer artifacts compared to DLSS 4. This DLSS 4.5 update includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model and is supported across more than 400 games and apps via Nvidia’s app.

This is the technology that allows supported games to be played at higher resolutions without compromising frame rates, a valuable feature for PC gamers with older Nvidia RTX graphics cards in their systems. Those with newer GPUs will see greater benefits from DLSS 4.5, however: it will run faster on RTX 40- and 50-series cards and provides a 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series GPUs that generates up to five additional frames for every frame rendered.

GeForce Now is coming to Linux and Fire TV

Nvidia is planning to launch native GeForce Now apps for Linux and Amazon’s Fire TV devices in the coming months, giving more people who may not have adequate gaming hardware access to the cloud streaming service. The first beta will be available for the Ubuntu 24.04 Linux distro, before expanding to additional distributions in the coming weeks. A GeForce Now app for Fire TV Stick 4K Plus and 4K Max is expected to launch early this year. Nvidia is also introducing full flight control support for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 in GeForce Now, allowing joysticks and yokes from Thrustmaster and Logitech to work on the cloud gaming service.

New G-Sync monitors

A new set of G-Sync Pulsar monitors is launching on January 7th that use a built-in light sensor to automatically adjust brightness and color based on your room lighting. Each model is a 27-inch IPS display running at 1440p and up to 360Hz refresh rate, with prices starting at $599.

“In bright daylight conditions, it increases brightness and shifts to a color that’s cooler in temperature,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge. “At night, or in darker rooms, it reduces brightness and uses warmer tones to minimize glare and eyestrain.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-153250.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.8395719693116%2C100%2C92.320856061377&w=1200,N,,2026-01-06 20:00:53.733164

The exclusive data and analysis provides shippers and carriers a composite view of truck freight costs, including average-per-mile contract, spot and fuel rates.

The first publication of the U.S. Bank Freight Payment Index – Rates Edition revealed that spot rates jumped 3.0% in October before falling 1.1% to $1.65 per mile in November. Contract rates have held steady in recent months and were at $2.02 in November. Both spot and contract rates are up less than 1% when compared with a year earlier.

Fuel surcharges, meanwhile, jumped 7.5% in November due to refinery outages. The report noted that “national diesel prices dropped that month … a reminder that fuel surcharges don’t always track pump prices in real time.”

“Our collaboration with DAT Freight & Analytics is about building on the insights we can deliver to shippers and carriers so they can make better business decisions,” said Jeff Pape, General Manager of U.S. Bank Freight Payment. “In addition to the volume and spend data and analysis included in our Freight Payments Index, we know our clients will value the spot, contract and fuel rates in this additional report.”

“The freight market is rarely one-dimensional, and looking at financial or rate data in isolation only tells half the story,” said Ken Adamo, GM, Shipper and Chief of Analytics at DAT. “By layering DAT’s benchmark analytics on top of transaction volume from U.S. Bank, we’re helping shippers bridge the gap between settlement data and real-time market dynamics. This composite view moves the industry beyond simple observation to actionable intelligence, ensuring stakeholders can anticipate volatility rather than just reacting to it.”

The new research complements the U.S. Bank Freight Payment Index, which the bank has published quarterly since 2017. The Index measures quantitative changes in freight shipments and spend activity based on data from transactions processed through U.S. Bank Freight Payment, which processes more than $43 billion in freight payments annually.

6100 Waterford District Drive

The Canadian fast-food holding company will take the entire second floor at 6100 Waterford District Drive, spanning 43K SF, from L'Oréal, Bisnow has learned.

The lease was first made public in Savills' fourth-quarter office report, and an RBI spokesperson confirmed the deal in a statement Tuesday.

RBI's new office space is within the 250-acre Waterford Business District. It represents an expansion in the sprawling office park — the company's corporate headquarters and Burger King's corporate office are located at 5707 Waterford Drive. RBI also has corporate offices in Toronto, Singapore and Zug, Switzerland.

“As we continue to grow our business in the US and globally, we are expanding our restaurant support centers in Miami to allow each of Burger King and Popeyes to have dedicated space — just down the street from each other,” an RBI representative said in a statement.

The spokesperson added that RBI plans to renovate the space.

The space used to serve as the headquarters of Parbel, a perfume and cosmetics subsidiary of L’Oréal. The company renewed its lease at the four-story, 163K SF office in 2019, Commercial Search reported at the time.

The lease term ends in August 2027, according to a JLL marketing brochure provided to Bisnow. The space has 233 workstations, 31 collaboration rooms and 10 open collaboration areas, according to the brochure.

L’Oréal did not respond to a request for comment.

JLL brokers Ryan Levy and Iker Belauste, who represented L’Oréal in the deal, declined to comment. Colliers' Jonathan Kingsley, who represented RBI in the deal, also declined to comment.

While it was unclear when the cosmetics company began marketing the space, the deal was one of the largest signed in the last quarter of 2025, according to Savills.

Roib Waterford LLC acquired the office building in 2021, along with two neighboring office buildings at 6303 Blue Waterford District Drive and 6505 Waterford District Drive, from MetLife for $110M, according to records provided by Vizzda.

The LLC is registered to Reggie Bell and Rajib Das. Bell, who is CEO of real estate investment company RealOp, and Das, CEO of merchant bank Lexington Park Group, didn't respond to requests for comment.

While Brickell, Wynwood and Miami Beach have captured much of the attention in Miami's office market, the area surrounding Miami International Airport has emerged as a budget option for companies.

Summary and Investor Outlook Eli Lilly’s 2026 strategy represents a bold bet on the industrialization of weight loss.
The combination of a $1 trillion valuation, a massive manufacturing ""moat,"" and a looming oral drug launch positions Lilly as the definitive leader of the obesity market.","As of January 6, 2026, the landscape of the pharmaceutical industry has been fundamentally reshaped by Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY), which recently became the first healthcare entity to surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization. This historic milestone is not merely a reflection of past successes but a validation of the company’s aggressive 2026 strategic pivot: a decisive shift from ""scarcity economics"" to ""access economics."" By prioritizing massive volume growth over high per-unit pricing, Lilly is attempting to saturate the global obesity market and squeeze out competitors before they can achieve meaningful scale.

The immediate implications of this strategy are already being felt across the healthcare continuum. With the launch of a new ""vial-first"" distribution model and the imminent regulatory decision for its oral GLP-1, orforglipron, Lilly is moving to capture the millions of patients previously sidelined by high costs or needle phobia. This ""volume-led"" approach signals the end of the early-adoption phase of the obesity gold rush, transitioning instead into a mature, high-output industrial race where manufacturing capacity and distribution reach are the primary determinants of victory.

The Strategy of Scale: Vials, Vouchers, and Volume

The core of Eli Lilly’s 2026 playbook is a transition that analysts have dubbed ""The Great Scaling."" For the past two years, the narrative surrounding Zepbound (tirzepatide) was dominated by shortages and supply-chain bottlenecks. However, following a staggering $50 billion multi-year investment in manufacturing, Lilly entered 2026 with a ""supply chain moat"" that its rivals are struggling to bridge. New high-capacity facilities in Indiana, North Carolina, and a massive $6.5 billion API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) plant in Texas have finally reached operational maturity, allowing the company to move away from the complex autoinjector pens that previously limited supply.

A critical component of this volume surge is the aggressive expansion of the LillyDirect platform. In a move that sent shockwaves through the industry in late 2025, Lilly slashed the self-pay price for Zepbound vials to between $299 and $350 per month. This pricing strategy is specifically designed to dismantle the gray market of compounded weight-loss drugs and to make the therapy accessible to the middle-class ""cash-pay"" segment. Furthermore, Lilly is preparing for the April 1, 2026, launch of a landmark Medicare Part D pilot program, which will provide a structured pathway for millions of seniors to access obesity medications through negotiated government rates—a move that was unthinkable just 24 months ago.

The strategic focus has also shifted toward the ""oral wave."" Eli Lilly’s once-daily pill, orforglipron, is currently under priority review with an FDA decision expected by March 2026. Unlike injectable biologics, orforglipron is a small-molecule drug, making it significantly cheaper and faster to produce at scale. By positioning this pill as a ""maintenance therapy"" for patients who have reached their goal weight on injectables, Lilly is creating a lifelong treatment loop that prioritizes long-term patient retention over one-time high-margin sales.

Winners and Losers in the New Obesity Economy

The primary beneficiary of this strategy, thus far, has been Eli Lilly itself, as it currently commands a 71% share of new U.S. obesity prescriptions. However, the shift to volume-led growth is creating a polarized environment for other players. Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) remains the most formidable challenger, having launched its own oral Wegovy pill in early January 2026 with a disruptive $149 ""starter price."" While Novo remains a ""winner"" in terms of clinical reputation, it is currently locked in a brutal price war with Lilly that is compressing margins across the sector, forcing both giants to rely on sheer scale to maintain profit growth.

On the other side of the ledger, the ""losers"" in 2026 appear to be the mid-tier biotech firms and compounding pharmacies. Compounding pharmacies, which thrived during the 2024–2025 shortage era, are seeing their business models evaporate as Lilly’s official vial prices drop to near-parity with compounded versions. Meanwhile, companies like Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) find themselves in a high-stakes waiting game. Amgen’s MariTide, a monthly injectable currently in Phase 3, is being marketed as a convenience play, but it faces a market that may already be saturated by Lilly’s daily pills and low-cost vials by the time it reaches commercialization in 2027.

Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) remains a ""wildcard"" winner. Despite the massive scale of the ""Big Two,"" Viking’s VK2735 has demonstrated clinical efficacy that may exceed Zepbound. In the 2026 market, Viking has become the ultimate acquisition target for a large-cap pharmaceutical company—such as Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) or Roche (OTC:RHHBY)—desperate to enter the space with a ""best-in-class"" asset to challenge the Lilly-Novo duopoly.

Broad Industry Trends and the ""Oral Revolution""

The shift toward volume reflects a broader trend in the pharmaceutical industry: the ""commoditization of miracles."" As obesity drugs move from niche luxury treatments to standard-of-care primary care medications, the industry is witnessing a shift in regulatory and policy focus. The 2026 Medicare pilot program is a watershed moment, suggesting that the U.S. government now views obesity treatment as a long-term cost-saving measure for the healthcare system rather than a discretionary expense. This sets a historical precedent similar to the rollout of statins in the 1990s, where high-volume, lower-margin distribution eventually led to massive cumulative profits and improved public health outcomes.

Furthermore, the ""oral revolution"" led by orforglipron and oral Wegovy is removing the final barrier to mass adoption: the ""needle phobia"" factor. By mid-2026, it is expected that nearly 40% of new obesity starts will be for oral medications. This transition is forcing a massive reconfiguration of the pharmaceutical supply chain, moving away from specialized cold-chain logistics required for biologics and toward the traditional pill-and-bottle distribution that has dominated the industry for a century. This shift also has significant ripple effects on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who are being pressured by both Lilly and the government to pass through more of the volume-based discounts directly to consumers.

The Road Ahead: From 2026 to the ""Triple G"" Era

Looking toward the second half of 2026 and into 2027, the market is bracing for the next technological leap. While orforglipron and Zepbound drive volume today, Lilly is already preparing the ground for Retatrutide, its ""Triple G"" agonist (GLP-1, GIP, and Glucagon). Phase 3 results for Retatrutide are expected to trickle out throughout 2026, potentially setting a new ceiling for weight loss at 25% or higher. The challenge for Lilly will be managing its own internal competition: ensuring that Retatrutide can be positioned as a premium ""high-efficacy"" tier while orforglipron handles the mass-market ""maintenance"" tier.

In the short term, the market will be hyper-focused on the Q1 and Q2 2026 earnings reports to see if the ""volume-led"" strategy is actually translating into bottom-line growth. There is a risk that the aggressive price cuts through LillyDirect and the low-cost Medicare deals could temporarily suppress margins before the full effect of the manufacturing scale-up kicks in. Investors will also be watching for any potential ""rebound effect"" data—long-term studies on what happens when patients transition from injectables to orforglipron pills—as this will determine the sustainability of Lilly’s ""lifelong patient"" model.

Summary and Investor Outlook

Eli Lilly’s 2026 strategy represents a bold bet on the industrialization of weight loss. By pivoting from a model of high-priced scarcity to one of high-volume accessibility, the company is attempting to build an insurmountable lead in the most lucrative therapeutic area in medical history. The combination of a $1 trillion valuation, a massive manufacturing ""moat,"" and a looming oral drug launch positions Lilly as the definitive leader of the obesity market.

For investors, the coming months are critical. The key metrics to watch are not just ""total revenue,"" but ""total prescriptions (TRx)"" and ""manufacturing yield."" If Lilly can successfully transition millions of patients to its oral platform while maintaining its 70%+ share of the injectable market, the $1 trillion market cap may only be the beginning. However, the ongoing price war with Novo Nordisk and the clinical progress of high-efficacy challengers like Viking Therapeutics ensure that while Lilly is currently the king of the mountain, the terrain remains as volatile as ever.

With Tuesday's gains, the stock has risen more than 20% year to date. That's coming off of a blockbuster year for the name, as it soared more than 240% in 2025.

""Tech kind of took a pause at the back end of the year, but I don't think anyone questions that AI is a game changing technology,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. ""We're seeing the chip stocks lead. That's probably to be expected, but that cyclical rotation is still continuing.""

""You can have the AI trade and tech stocks work and the other cyclical components of the market work as well,"" he continued. ""That's the kind of thing you might expect in an economy that is going to be running hot in 2026 with rate cuts, tons of fiscal stimulus and an AI enthusiasm that's getting closer and closer to a fever pitch.""

The 30-stock benchmark closed at a record on Monday and notched an intraday high in the session after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro over the weekend, while President Donald Trump encouraged big investments from U.S. oil companies.

Energy stocks rose broadly on Monday, with the S&P 500 energy sector posting its best one-day gain since July.

Mayfield pointed out that one factor behind why the developments between the U.S. and Venezuela aren't affecting the market is because of the Latin American country's role in the global economy — and the oil market more specifically.

""It's minimal enough that you're not going to see a Ukraine-Russia style response. A big reason for that sell-off was the huge spike in oil prices. We're just not seeing that here and, if anything, I think the market is slightly pricing in the potential for more supply down the road if some of those sanctioned barrels come back onto the market,"" he said.

""These geopolitical events when they do impact markets or the consumer picture tend to come for the oil market, and here it's just not there,"" the strategist added.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108172205-1752596099643-NYSE_Traders-OB-Photo-ALR-20250715-PRESS-4.JPG?v=1759512756&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-06 19:02:27.936066

Three of America’s leading companies can make a big difference for bees.
Walmart As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart can make a big difference by phasing out neonics.
We’re keeping up the momentum next year, continuing to call on Walmart to take steps to protect bees.
Home Depot Lastly, Home Depot could become a key part of the work to protect pollinators.","Across the country, bees and other pollinators are struggling. There are three major corporations that have the power to protect them.

Toxic pesticides, habitat loss and industrial farming practices have all contributed to steep die-offs among the insects that help everything from our backyard gardens to major crop harvests bloom.

And while some states are starting to limit the use of neonicotinoids — some of the most harmful pesticides for bees — millions of pounds of these chemicals are still widely available, and end up entering our environment every year.

That’s why Environment America and our national network are working to change the way major companies sell, and consumers use, these pesticides to help turn the tide for bees.

Three of America’s leading companies can make a big difference for bees.

1. Walmart

As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart can make a big difference by phasing out neonics. Neonics attack the brains and bodies of bees and other insects, weakening them and making it more difficult for them to fly, navigate and gather food.

Walmart’s stores are located in nearly every corner of the nation, making the company an influential factor in what pesticides end up on shelves and in gardens. This year, thousands of our members and supporters raised their voices and urged the company to take the next step in phasing out neonics and promoting pollinator-safe alternatives.

We’re keeping up the momentum next year, continuing to call on Walmart to take steps to protect bees.

2. Amazon

Similarly, we’re urging Amazon, the nation’s biggest online marketplace, to stop selling neonic-containing products. With so many shoppers across the nation relying on Amazon for garden supplies, getting these harmful products off Amazon’s websites would likely meaningfully reduce the everyday use of neonics.

3. Home Depot

Lastly, Home Depot could become a key part of the work to protect pollinators. As one of the country’s largest home and garden retailers, the company plays a massive role in what products Americans bring back to their gardens, lawns and flower beds.

Yet despite their negative impact, neonic products can still be found on Home Depot’s shelves. This fall, our supporters added their names to petitions calling on the company to stop neonic sales, all while helping build support and attention around the need for safer, bee-friendly alternatives.

We’re making progress for the bees

As word continues to spread about the dangers and potential impact neonics are having on our pollinators and ecosystems, these companies can follow the lead of states that already are taking action.

Massachusetts, New York, California, Minnesota and others are beginning to restrict the use and sale of neonic pesticides. Meanwhile two states, New York and Vermont have restricted the use of neonic-coated seeds, which are currently used on about 70-80% of all U.S. grown corn, soy and cotton.

But we have to keep calling on influential companies to do the right thing, too. That’s where you come in.

You can help defend bees from dangerous pesticides

From getting neonics off store shelves, to campaigning for stronger regulations on farm and state land, we’re doing everything we can to protect our struggling bees and butterflies.

It’s your dedication that powers every bit of this work. Together, our government, corporate leaders and citizens like you can make America’s gardens, farms and wild places safer for bees and the countless other species that depend on them.

We need your support to urge corporations like Walmart, Amazon and Home Depot to stop selling bee-killing neonic pesticides.

North America’s leading online retailers changed up varying aspects of their executive leadership teams, many of them bringing in new CEOs or hiring technology leaders to navigate an artificial intelligence (AI)-dominated retail environment in 2025.

In the online marketplace arena, eBay brought in a new chief financial officer. It brought in Peggy Alford, who is a board member at Meta and was previously executive vice president of global sales and merchant services for PayPal. Meanwhile, Etsy’s chief technology officer, Rafe Colburn, took on an expanded role. As a result, he became Etsy’s chief product and technology officer. The change came as Etsy’s previous chief product officer departed and the online marketplace consolidated the two executive roles.

Elsewhere, BigCommerce (now simply called Commerce), which powers ecommerce platforms for some of the Top 2000 online retailers, named a new product officer. DHL Supply Chain named a new CEO for its North America unit, and FedEx brought in a new chief digital and information officer (CDIO).

These changes and more highlight varying priorities in a retail macroenvironment that includes:

Shifts in consumer spending as a result of tariffs and other price increases.

AI’s expansion into agentic commerce and other year-defining ecommerce trends.

The rise of retail media networks as key marketing tools.

Mergers and acquisitions, as well as bankruptcies.

Expanded last-mile delivery partnerships.

Agilent Technologies, a company specializing in life sciences tools, saw its stock price rise by 2.8% during the afternoon trading session. This uptick followed an upgrade from Evercore ISI, which shifted its rating on Agilent from 'In-Line' to 'Outperform' and increased its price target for the stock.

Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar raised Agilent’s price target to $160.00, up from the previous $155.00, reflecting a more optimistic outlook for the company’s future. This positive reassessment comes on the heels of several favorable ratings from other financial institutions, signaling growing confidence in Agilent’s trajectory and strengthening market sentiment.

After the initial surge, Agilent’s shares settled at $147.85, marking a 3.4% gain compared to the previous closing price.

Curious if this is a good moment to invest in Agilent?

Market Reaction and Historical Context

Agilent’s stock typically experiences limited volatility, with only nine instances of price swings greater than 5% over the past year. Today’s movement suggests that investors view the recent news as significant, even if it may not fundamentally alter perceptions of the business.

One of the most notable price increases in the last year occurred eight months ago, when Agilent’s shares climbed 7.8%. This rally coincided with major U.S. indices rising (Nasdaq up 3.4%, S&P 500 up 2.5%) after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily pause certain tariffs for 90 days, hinting at a possible easing of trade tensions.

This agreement reduced U.S. tariffs on Chinese products to 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 10%, providing companies with some relief to adjust inventories and supply chains. However, President Trump warned that tariffs could increase further if a comprehensive deal wasn’t reached within the 90-day window, though not to previous highs. The truce helped calm fears of a prolonged trade conflict, supporting global growth expectations and boosting optimism, especially in sectors sensitive to trade such as technology, retail, and industrials.

Since the start of the year, Agilent’s stock has gained 7.2%. At $147.85 per share, it is trading near its 52-week peak of $157.20, reached in November 2025. For perspective, an investor who purchased $1,000 worth of Agilent shares five years ago would now see that investment grow to $1,203.

By Scott Hamilton

Jan. 6, 2026, © Leeham News: Airbus is tweaking the marketing messaging for the A220 to boost sales for regional airline operations.

Marketing for the A220 began as the C Series when Bombardier launched the program in 2008. Bombardier positioned the 100-seat CS100 as a replacement for the Airbus A318 and Boeing 737-500/600. The 130-seat CS300 was designed to replace the Airbus A319 and Boeing 737-700. The Airbus and Boeing airplanes are considered mainline aircraft as opposed to regional airliners.

Bombardier also design a larger CS500, but didn’t launch the program. The CS500 would be a direct competitor to the A320 and 737-800/8.

Airbus continued this marketing approach when it agreed to purchase control of the C Series program in 2017, renaming it the A220-100 and A220-300. Airbus says it’s a matter of when, not if, it will proceed with the A220-500.

However, at an event hosted by the European Regional Airlines Association, Airbus told regional carriers the A220 is a choice airplane for them if they have ambitions to spread their wings, so to speak.

Benjamin Peiron, VP Single Aisle Marketing for Airbus, told LNA in an interview last month that this message didn’t represent a shift in marketing strategy. “It's more focused, I would say. If we look at the operator base of A220, it's about half composed of legacy carriers, [like] Air France, Delta, Air Canada. About one third is from so-called regional airlines, whatever the exact definition is. The rest is hybrid low-cost or equivalent.”",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LNA-Outlook-2026.png,N,,2026-01-06 20:00:49.388365

On Tuesday, William Blair raised its rating on Medtronic Plc (NYSE: MDT), pointing to a series of recent and upcoming product launches as key factors behind the decision.

The firm shifted its outlook from Market Perform to Outperform. Analyst Brandon Vazquez explained that the previous rating was based on Medtronic’s significant size and lack of distinctiveness, which made it difficult for the company to consistently achieve robust, high single-digit earnings growth.

Medtronic is actively introducing several innovative products, with a strong pipeline suggesting more launches on the horizon.

Medtronic’s Strategic Shift: Signs of a New Era

Should Medtronic succeed in reaching high single-digit EPS growth, the company could potentially offer shareholders a low double-digit return, especially when factoring in its 2.9% dividend yield.

Related: FDA Identifies Medtronic Heart Catheter Recall as Major Safety Concern

According to Vazquez, “With shares trading at about 16 times projected 2026 earnings, Medtronic is valued at or slightly below its large-cap medical technology peers, presenting an attractive risk/reward profile as the company’s outlook improves.”

The Hugo robotic system, which has been anticipated for nearly ten years, recently received FDA clearance for urologic surgeries in the U.S., marking a significant milestone with a clearer timeline for rollout.

This development could mark a pivotal moment for Medtronic’s surgical division, which contributed 19% of the company’s 2025 revenue but has trailed overall corporate growth over the past five years.

William Blair also noted that the Symplicity Spyral RDN system achieved a crucial commercialization milestone in late 2025, following final CMS national coverage approval. Management views this decision as more favorable than the initial draft, ensuring broader patient access.

While revenue growth is expected to be gradual due to the complex clinical landscape, the CMS reimbursement enhances visibility and positions the RDN system to start making a meaningful financial impact.

Why Medtronic Stands Out for Investors

Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) continues to be one of Medtronic’s most rapidly expanding segments, helping to offset slower progress in traditional pacing and defibrillation markets.

The PFA platform bolsters Medtronic’s standing in the atrial fibrillation space by stabilizing market share, opening opportunities for incremental gains, and increasing exposure to the growing AF ablation market as adoption accelerates. This expansion also offers the potential for improved profit margins as volumes rise.

Vazquez commented, “The planned diabetes business spin-off is a win for both entities—MiniMed can focus on becoming a leader in diabetes care, while Medtronic can channel resources into its primary growth areas.”

MDT Stock Performance: At the time of reporting on Tuesday, Medtronic shares had climbed 2.91% to $98.05.

STAAR now has a renewed opportunity to truly shine.” Now that the deal seems likely to fall through, analysts are left asking what comes next for Staar.","Shareholders of Staar Surgical, a manufacturer of the Implantable Collamer Lens, have likely definitively voted against Alcon’s $1.6 billion buyout offer.

Broadwood Partners, which holds 30.2% of Staar’s common shares, has been vocally opposed to the deal since it first became public in October, arguing that the deal would have undervalued the business and reflected a flawed sales process.

The final vote was held on January 6, after having been originally scheduled for October and moved four times since.

Originally, Alcon and Staar’s boards of directors both unanimously supported the transaction, but Staar sent several appeals to its board cautioning against the deal.

Previously, Alcon and Staar were major competitors in the eyecare space, both specializing in the manufacturing of vision-related medical devices.

In December, Alcon upped its bid from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with the new offer valuing the company’s worth at $30.75 per share in cash, as opposed to the previous $28 per share. Under new terms, Alcon has also lowered promised payouts for Staar executives if the deal closes.

“This best and final offer to the Staar stockholders offers a clear choice: a substantial and certain premium versus an uncertain future,” Alcon said in a prepared statement.

Prior to the acquisition, Staar was having a difficult year financially. In May, the company withdrew its 2025 guidance that was announced in February, citing global economic uncertainty and tariff policy conditions.

Staar reported net sales of $42.6 million for 1Q25 compared to $77.4 million in the prior year quarter, pointing to a significant decline in China revenue.

BTIG analysts have recommended that Staar take the new, $1.6 billion offer, writing that the company’s “shares are likely to meaningfully suffer if the deal is not consummated.” On the day of the $1.6 billion offer announcement, Staar shares rose 13.7%.

In October, Staar was able to participate in a “go-shop” period, in which the company allegedly met with 21 other parties but did not receive a single offer.

On December 12, Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC, a leading independent proxy advisory firm, reaffirmed its recommendation that shareholders of Staar should vote “AGAINST” the proposed acquisition by Alcon.

December 17, Broadwood wrote a letter to the board, appealing to its members to vote against the acquisition.

“Since the announcement of STAAR’s proposed sale to Alcon in August, we have been engaged in a spirited debate with you over the Company’s prospects and the merits of the proposed deal. As you know, we have felt from the start that this transaction materially undervalues STAAR and was the product of a deeply flawed process undertaken at the wrong time in STAAR’s history,” the investment firm wrote in a prepared statement.

“As we approach the thrice-delayed special meeting of shareholders, we are confident our fellow shareholders will agree with us and reject this ill-advised transaction. Several large shareholders, all three proxy advisory firms and at least one of the Company’s own directors have rightly expressed great skepticism about the process, timing and price of the proposed deal.”

Based on preliminary results, this deal will not go through; something that Neal C. Bradsher, Broadwood Founder and President, is thanking the board for publicly.

“We thank our fellow shareholders for their attention during this process and for rejecting the proposed acquisition of STAAR by Alcon at today’s Special Meeting. We appreciate that so many shareholders recognize the value of STAAR and share our enthusiasm for the Company’s bright future,” Bradsher said in a prepared statement following the vote.

“It is now time to focus on the road ahead. With its leading technology, strong financial position, privileged position in large markets, and clear path to growth and profit margin expansion in both the near term and the long term, STAAR’s future is bright. As STAAR’s largest shareholder, we are confident in the Company’s standalone prospects and committed to helping STAAR realize its abundant potential for the benefit of all shareholders.

To that end, we are ready and willing to work collaboratively with the Board and our fellow shareholders to implement the necessary changes to enable effective oversight and execution on STAAR’s opportunity to become a highly profitable and scaled enterprise. STAAR now has a renewed opportunity to truly shine.”

Now that the deal seems likely to fall through, analysts are left asking what comes next for Staar. Investors have signaled their intention to fight for changes to the Board and management, which analysts with BTIG believe is likely to happen.

However, analysts also believe this will hamper Staar’s ability to operate for a period of time, as it will serve as a distraction.

Market update : The S & P 500 is higher for the third straight session and on track to close at a record high. 2026 is off to a fast start, and the gains thus far have been broader than last year, when the AI-crazed concentrated gains in the Magnificent 7, technology, and data center, power-generating industrials. In fact, many stocks that were out of favor over the last few months of 2025 are finally catching up to the rest of the market. Some examples in the portfolio include Amazon , Costco , Eaton , Honeywell , Starbucks , Qnity Electronics , and Texas Roadhouse . Virtually nothing has changed at these companies over the past six days, so we'll see how far this rotation takes them. But we always say there's value in out-of-favor stocks when the fundamentals are positive, and sentiment is too negative. Also, one thing working in their favor is the end of the tax loss selling season, which may have kept a lid on these past underperformers. Good news for Lilly? A biotech company announced interim results from two Phase 1/2a clinical trials on Tuesday that could potentially offer a new approach to treating obesity. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals announced that its investigational RNA interference therapeutic, in combination with Eli Lilly 's tirzepatide, doubled weight loss, improved fat reduction, and increased lean muscle tissue. This was a small sample size, so we shouldn't get too excited about this just yet, but analysts at Truist said the results are ""incrementally positive"" for Lilly, as any future commercialization of Arrowhead's drugs could increase tirzepatide sales. In addition, Truist points out that these medications wouldn't directly compete with Lilly's oral GLP-1 orforglipron, which is expected to launch in the United States sometime in the next few months. For what it's worth, Lilly is running trials of its drug, bimagrumab, which could also provide muscle-preserving benefits. Up next : There are no major earnings after the closing bell or before the opening bell on Wednesday. On the data side, we'll see weekly mortgage applications, the ISM services index, JOLTS job openings, factory orders, and durable goods orders.

William Blair upgraded from Market Perform to Outperform. Analyst Brandon Vazquez wrote that the Market Perform rating hinged on a business that was too large and not differentiated enough to durably hit its goals of delivering consistent high-single-digit EPS growth.

Medtronic is ramping up several new products, with many more in the pipeline.

Medtronic's Transformation: A Turning Point Ahead

If Medtronic is truly positioned for high-single-digit EPS growth, then the company can deliver low-double-digit equity return when factoring in a 2.9% dividend yield.

""At a valuation of roughly 16 times calendar 2026 EPS, the stock is trading in line to slightly below large-cap medtech peers, suggesting a favorable risk/reward for an improving setup,"" Vazquez added.

The Hugo system has been long-awaited for almost a decade now and has a more tangible timeline, recently announcing FDA approval for urologic surgical procedures in the U.S.

The update could be an inflection point in the company's surgical segment, which accounted for 19% of revenues in 2025 and has been growing slower than the corporate average over the past five years.

William Blair highlighted that the Symplicity Spyral RDN system reached a major commercialization inflection in late 2025 with final CMS national coverage. Management considers the decision more favorable than the draft and adequate to support broad patient access.

Investors should expect a measured revenue ramp, reflecting a long but nuanced clinical evidence base. Even so, CMS reimbursement meaningfully improves visibility and positions RDN to begin contributing to the P&L.

Why Investors Should Bet On Medtronic Now

Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) remains one of Medtronic's fastest-growing businesses and a key counterbalance to slower growth in legacy pacing and defibrillation markets.

The PFA platform strengthens Medtronic's competitive position in atrial fibrillation by supporting share stabilization with potential for modest gains, increasing exposure to a large and expanding AF ablation market as adoption rises, and offering a clear margin upside as volumes scale.

""We view the diabetes spin-off as compelling for both parties, allowing the newly formed MiniMed to focus on becoming a staple in the diabetes market and Medtronic to allocate resources toward the aforementioned growth drivers,"" analyst Vazquez wrote in an investor note on Tuesday.

MDT Price Action: Medtronic shares were up 2.91% at $98.05 at the time of publication on Tuesday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

MARK PEARSON: I think the best story we can probably tell is with our teachers’ business.
MARK PEARSON: We have all the tools available for people to actually learn and play in the sandbox, if you like.","BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. It’s early 2025 and inside Equitable Holdings, CEO Mark Pearson is asking a simple but profound question: is 80% enough? Over the past three years, the company has undergone a sweeping transformation and launched a bold experiment to reinvent how a 160-year-old financial institution collaborates, innovates, and leads. This New Way of Working is designed to speed up decision-making, empower teams, and ignite a new culture of agility. But not everyone is on board. Some divisions thrive under the new model while others cling to old habits.

As Pearson and his leadership team look ahead, they face a defining choice whether to push for total adoption or allow flexibility at the edges. This case challenges us to consider what true cultural change looks like and what it takes to make it last. Today on Cold Call, we welcome Professor Das Narayandas and guests Mark Pearson and Jeff Hurd to discuss the case, “New WOW at Equitable, A New Way of Working.”

I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR podcast network.

Das Narayandas’ research focuses on business-to-business marketing and management of client relationships and professional service firms. Das, it’s been a while since we’ve had you on Cold Call. Welcome back.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Thank you.

BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. We’re really excited to have two guests in the studio today. In addition to Das, we’ve got Mark Pearson, he’s the president and CEO of Equitable Holdings. He’s joined today by Jeff Hurd, Chief Operating Officer. Both of you have lived the case so thank you for being here to talk about it with us.

JEFF HURD: We’re really happy to be here.

MARK PEARSON: Thank you very much, Brian.

BRIAN KENNY: It’s been a busy day for you, right? You came in from the classroom and you’re coming in here, so you’ve got some fresh insights as to the discussion that took place there. I think a lot of people will be able to relate to the central themes of this case because every organization is trying to figure out how to get more agile, how to be more innovative, particularly in the age of AI, where these things are coming at us fast and we’ve got to figure out how to grapple with it. And as we all know, change is hard. So, we’re going to talk about that.

Das, I’m going to start with you. Let’s just dive right in. I’m wondering what initially drew you to the case and how this story reflects larger questions about how organizations pursue cultural change, particularly in highly regulated industries, which the Equitable is. We’ll talk a little bit about their business in a moment, but why’d you write the case?

DAS NARAYANDAS: Like you said, Brian, change is hard, change is ugly, and we live in a world where change is something that has to happen all the time. So, how does one go about doing it? The reason I wrote this case is I’ve been thinking about looking at a series of firms in different industries that are trying to overcome inertia and break down barriers to remain relevant.

The metaphor I used in class today when I was teaching this case was my visit to my physician earlier this summer, and he told me that my metabolism was slowing down. I took that as a comment about my aging, but then I realized when I ChatGPT’d after the meeting about metabolism, what I found out was metabolism in human body slows down when the muscle mass decreases, which is part of aging. What my physician was telling me was, Das, if you want to stay alive, go get yourself fit by building some muscle mass. I think that’s really what organizations need to do too. You need to build the muscle to remain relevant. This case that I’ve written is trying to capture how Mark and Jeff as leaders of Equitable took 160-year-old organization and have truly made it relevant in today’s world by making it a five-year-old. They brought in new muscle, and they made existing muscle better. That is the whole idea of change management, and that’s why I wrote this case.

BRIAN KENNY: Five-year-olds can be difficult to manage, though; we know that. It’s a great metaphor.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Let’s say that what they did was build a disciplined five-year-old, if there is one.

BRIAN KENNY: Well, I’ve never met one of those before. Great. Mark, I’m going to turn to you then and ask you, I thought the metabolism thing was actually a really interesting metaphor for what you were doing here. I’m wondering if you take us back to 2018, which was the IPO when the case first kicks off, what did you observe that convinced you that Equitable needed to rethink how it worked?

MARK PEARSON: Well, one of the things with any change management is having a catalyst to change. The IPO really came to us when AXA, our parent at that time, decided that it was going to exit the U.S. market and in turn, we were going to spin off on our own. We were incredibly excited about that. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be the architect of a business rather than somebody who drove the car that somebody else had designed. So very, very excited at that. At the same time, we knew that this organization, 160-year-old, was very high integrity business, a nice business, but a very, very sleepy business. It just wasn’t fit for purpose as a listed company. We knew that we had to do three things really. Firstly, we had to change our risk philosophy, our risk profile, because our balance sheet was a different size to AXA’s.

Secondly, I had to bring in people who had operated in that listed entity world, and Jeff was the first person we hired there. And then thirdly, the way we work the culture, if you like, inside the organization, we had to speed it up. We had to be much more innovative because at the same time as this IPO, we saw those forces you were talking about in the introduction to the podcast, we saw technology coming in, we saw new competitors coming in. We saw new sophisticated ways of investing. So, the convergence of these two really was what made us very determined that we had to change the metabolism to take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Jeff, you kind of lived it. You were one of the people who was helping to drive this change within the firm. We talk a lot at Harvard Business School about design thinking and the importance of agility. Those are abstract concepts though. I think one of the things that’s difficult is how you drive that home in a practical way so people understand what does it take to actually do this in a way that’s going to help our business? How were you able to translate those ideas to the people within the firm?

JEFF HURD: We knew we had to be better, faster, smarter, cheaper, and I think the whole organization recognized that. We had great confidence because of the studying that we had done, the visiting of other companies that these sort of time-tested methodologies were sound, and they needed to be adapted for Equitable; and maybe to use Das’s muscle analogy, we knew that to build muscle, we just had to get going.

This couldn’t stay on a piece of paper and not be implemented. So, we got going and we took our first unit in. We took that unit all the way down to the studs, started talking to them about what their mission is. They create their own mission. We walked them through how to create OKRs, which are a really, really hard thing to do. We help them organize into agile teams and to start to operate in those teams. By doing, we built a real flywheel and momentum, and people could touch and feel and experience what we had put out on a piece of paper.

BRIAN KENNY: By the way, I should have asked at the outset, Mark, maybe you can tell us just quickly the profile of Equitable, how many employees you have and the main lines of business.

MARK PEARSON: Yeah, sure. Equitable, 163 years old, now quoted on New York Stock Exchange, about 15 billion market cap. We serve about five and a half million clients across three main lines of business. Retirement business, wealth management, and asset management is what we do. In total across our two operating companies, we manage about a trillion of clients’ money.

BRIAN KENNY: Das, you studied a lot of different firms and different industries. I’m wondering what made this experiment interesting. I’m thinking particularly about the fact that the industry is highly regulated, so being agile is great, being reckless is not, managing your risk profile, Mark, as you said before, why did you think this was an interesting one to focus on in particular?

DAS NARAYANDAS: I think it goes back to the question you asked earlier, Brian, when you asked Jeff, “Tell us how you got it done.” This is something that we’ve been discussing in the School for a decade now: knowing in itself is not enough. Doing and being is when and how things get crystal clear. This was an example where the concepts that we have heard of for a long time were brought together by a bunch of people. They have no issues by saying that we’ve imported ideas that others had, but what they did, which is their very own, was the mixing. To me, that was a great example that I wanted to bring to the executives that I’m teaching now who are running their own businesses, who are in a fundamental situation of fright or flight when they should actually be thinking of fight. I want to teach this case to give them a better understanding of how to stand their ground and fight, and remain competitive in a world where new competitors are showing up all the time.

BRIAN KENNY: Mark, I think there might’ve been some marketing people involved. I say that as a marketing person because you packaged this up inside the firm, you had a sort of a brand going around this, which is New Way of Working. The acronym is N-W-O-W. Do you actually say “en-WOW?”

MARK PEARSON: Yes, we do.

BRIAN KENNY: Awesome. Maybe you can talk a little bit about NWOW, what comprised it. There were five pillars that are mentioned in the case. If you can briefly describe what those are and how you packaged this in a way that people across the firm could begin to understand what it was you were trying to do.

MARK PEARSON: Thanks, Brian. It’s a package of, as Das said, tried and tested methodologies that worked for us. So, starts off with objectives and key results. I mean, we were very influenced by John Doerr’s book Measure What Matters. Secondly, adaptive leadership. Really empowering our leaders to make the decisions that they need to make in our best place to make. So really an empowerment message in there. Agile working, we had within our IT department, we saw how that worked and so we rolled it out as fast as we could. Then it was clear to us that we needed to have a segment that was dealing with redesign because over the 160 years of the existence of the company, the structures inside of the company look a little bit like a coral reef, they’re not really designed or smooth. Then we had one based around skills as well and really flattened the organization out so that instead of having 26 layers of job title, we went right down to five. So, they were the five main pillars.

BRIAN KENNY: That’s a huge challenge in any organization. Even here at Harvard Business School, we’ve got silos, and it’s always difficult to figure out a way to pull people out of the silos and think about being one team. I think clearly you’ve encountered this as well. Jeff, I’m going to come back to you and ask you what the thinking was behind the way that you designed things and how you were able to break down some of the silos and get people to come up and be part of a bigger community.

JEFF HURD: It goes back to how we implemented these with each of the units that I touched on a little bit before, but we would have a boot camp, and we’d have a group of leaders together in a particular part of the organization. And they had this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to completely redesign their organization, to create new organizational units, to open up a bunch of leadership positions for other people in their organization or elsewhere in the organization. We actually did a thing called the opportunity fairs where the leader of the group would stand up in front of the entire Equitable organization, talk about their mission, talk about why this is the place in Equitable that you want to work, and talk about these actual big leadership job openings. They were open to anybody in the company. The people who acted early in effect got first draft pick. And that built a real flywheel of people now raising their hands saying, “I want to be next, I want to be next.”

That just created excitement in the organization, allowed us to shuffle the leadership, allowed us to find gems. I know Mark and I would go to the readouts and people would be talking about their OKRs or their mission, and we’d look at each other and say, “Who is that person?” Because we would’ve never discovered them in the past, and there they were and said, This person needs a leadership role. So, it really broke a lot of the coral reef that Mark talked about before.

BRIAN KENNY: You’re making it sound easy though, and I’m sure it wasn’t easy. I’m sure there was a fair amount of skepticism as you’ll find in any organization. What was the initial reaction that you were getting from people? Was there pushback and how’d you deal with that?

MARK PEARSON: Absolutely. There’s skepticism on any change program. One of the keys we found was to find the influential skeptics and really turn them. Really takes a lot of work. You have to sit down, you have to explain why you’re doing this. You have to measure the changes that you are making. But once some of those skeptics turn, they become your best ambassadors and they really, really carry a lot of the other people. There’s no doubt although, Brian, that New Ways of Working isn’t for everybody.

The level of accountability in there, standing up every two weeks to say, “What have you done in the last sprint? How are you contributing?” May not be for everybody. So clearly, we did lose some people who weren’t attuned to that way of working. To Jeff’s point earlier, it was very interesting to watch. There became a tipping point where the skeptics then turn, there is some momentum. We see engagement going up, we see results going back. Then other departments were, when is it my turn? We reached a tipping point after a while where you could see people queuing up to get the program and be in the boot camp.

BRIAN KENNY: Das, you probably looked at similar situations in a lot of different places. I’m wondering, as you saw as an outsider looking at what Equitable was doing, how important was it to have this balance of top-down versus bottom-up? Giving people some autonomy and basically some skin in the game, I guess is one way to look at it.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Change only works when it’s both ways, top-down and bottom-up. The key to successful change is figuring out when it should be top-down and when it should be bottom-up. I wrote this case actually to have that very discussion in class, Brian. It’s not one or the other. There are things that leaders need to mandate, and there are things where you need to let people come along on their own with some encouragement, figuring out that magic mix. At the end of the day, this case is about helping managers and leaders figure out how to mix the right concoction. The ingredients are there; everyone has access to it. It’s compounding it together into something that’s a powerful medication that changes the metabolism of organizations. That’s what this case is about.

I just want to add here, the B case that goes with this case actually is the playbook. It is an interactive PDF or PowerPoint that people can use to figure out what those five pillars that you mentioned are, how it works, what the process is, how you get it done. Now, my gut and Kerry Herman, who I wrote this case with, we were discussing and when we were writing this case, we said, Ah, this company is never going to let us publish the playbook. Because that’s the secret sauce. Who would give up the secret sauce? So, he said, Anyway, let’s ask. No harm done in asking. And lo and behold, when we asked the leadership—Jeff, Mark—they say, Sure, take it. You want the functionality, keep it. Then we looked at each other and said, Why are they giving it? They’re not naive. They’re smart. What we realized was their supreme confidence in how they have done it, that they are happy for others to replicate. I’m not giving away the crown jewels in the case. I’m actually making it more interesting for people to go figure out the case because, what is it that these people do? What is this NWOW that they are so openly discussing that I can learn from and use? That’s what we’re going to be learning from doing this case in class.

BRIAN KENNY: I would imagine that telling people what you did and explaining to them how they could do it isn’t a guarantee that they’re going to be able to pull off what you pulled off. This takes a lot of work, a lot of attention to detail and a lot of bringing the culture along with you. Jeff mentioned that not everybody embraced it. Some people had to be moved out. There’s some cultural damage that happens there. How do you as a leader, Mark, think about making sure the culture doesn’t get irreparably harmed as you do this and you’re trying to bring people forward with you?

MARK PEARSON: It’s a bit of getting the balance right between honoring the past and also making sure that the company is going to be around in the future. It’s especially important for an insurance group like ours where just last year, Brian, we paid out on a policy that was taken out in 1931.

BRIAN KENNY: Oh, my goodness.

MARK PEARSON: We are a long cycle, decades-long business, so we have to honor the past and Equitable has much to do. So, we were… I don’t know, just off the top of my head, we’ve ensured 10 U.S. presidents. We were amongst the first to pay out to servicemen and servicewomen in World War II. We were there through the Depression. A very fine and honorable past, but we have to make sure that we not only survive, but thrive in the future because the promises we’re making today, we will have to pay out on decades to come. I don’t have a problem with honoring the past, but also changing for the future. And the culture really, really did need to change.

It’s interesting, Brian, if you look at the management team now, Jeff and I didn’t set out to do this, but it’s almost exactly one third of people who joined new since NWOW, one third of some of the younger people have been promoted up rapidly through NWOW, and about one third have been throughout the whole journey. So, it’s quite interesting we’ve got that mix, which I think enables us to honor that past and keep the bits of the culture that we want and also change so that we can be competitive and stay around for decades to come.

BRIAN KENNY: You’re talking about the decades-long relationship you have with your customers, which is, we haven’t talked about the customers here. Have you told them what you’re doing? How have they reacted to it if you have? Are they in favor of this or are they, oh, don’t mess with my insurance?

MARK PEARSON: I think the best story we can probably tell is with our teachers’ business. We’re very proud to serve a million educators in the U.S. We’re number one in the K-12.

BRIAN KENNY: My wife thanks you; she’s an educator.

MARK PEARSON: Thank you. You’ll know through your wife, Brian, that COVID time, everything shut on the schools. We had the worksite marketing model where our advisors would go into the school, sit on those little chairs, get a yellow pad out and help the teacher with their retirement planning. That of course, all came to a shuddering halt, and we had to dramatically change how we interacted with them. We had to go from face-to-face to digital, which Jeff and I reckon would’ve taken years and years to do if we’d have sat down and wrote out a project. But the fact that we were able to use NWOW to sit down and say, Look, we need to contact our clients here.

The most important thing for us during COVID was to pay out claims and retirement checks when our clients needed them. If you can’t get that claim or retirement check from an insurance company when a disaster has hit, why do you need an insurance company? It actually came together very, very well there. That would be an example where our clients were informed. I guess, Das in his teaching earlier on was saying, sometimes in change programs you need a little bit of luck. We totally agree with that one. We were a little bit lucky there during COVID that teachers were trying to figure out with their students how to connect. So, we fed into that debate and we were saying, hey, we want to connect with you as well. And they were open to it.

BRIAN KENNY: It’s another where we’ve heard so many silver linings that came out of that horrible situation where businesses—

MARK PEARSON: Accelerators…

BRIAN KENNY: …found new ways to do things and really spur growth. Jeff, I want to come back to you. Most firms I think I can safely say would have hired consultants to do this. They would’ve paid a lot of money to outside firms to come in and help them do it, but you chose to do it differently. I’m wondering why you made that trade-off and what you see as the benefits or drawbacks from doing that.

JEFF HURD: One of the great attributes of this leadership team, I’d say, Brian, is that they’re learning machines. We had benefited so much from reading John Doerr, reading Turn the Ship Around, visiting companies like Spark, which is a telecom company in New Zealand that adopted Agile for Grownups, visiting other companies. We did work with a consulting firm at the beginning and took a lot of knowledge from them. They helped us to figure out how to stand up the organization in the right way. We probably worked with them for about six months. But we knew that if you’re not going to get that eye roll from the organization, it has to be done with your people, you have to own it.

Really, the CEO has to own it and say, “This is ours.” So, we took one of our top talents, Hilary Menard, who used to be Mark’s chief of staff, and we said, You’re in charge of this innovation and design office. You figure out how to implement this. You tell us what resources you need to do that. And you decide whether you need consultants or not. That was a form of adaptive leadership where we didn’t tell her what to do. She decided we needed to make this our own. And she built an outstanding team to implement it.

MARK PEARSON: Brian, I think when you have change programs that are driven by consultants over the years, operating managers have learned that sooner or later the consultants will go and we can get back to normal.

BRIAN KENNY: The book goes on the shelf.

MARK PEARSON: Yeah. I think it is very important if change is going to be enduring that it is yours. Sure, use consultants to train the trainer if you like, and lift your skills up. But many, many managers who maybe don’t want to change will just simply outweigh the consultants.

BRIAN KENNY: Actually, on that point, Das, I want to come back to you for a minute because this all began at a moment of inflection for the firm. The IPO gave them the platform and the burning platform that you described before, Mark. How do you sustain that once the fire is out? Once the burning is gone, and that the firm’s doing well, do people just fall back into a mode where they kind of wait it out a little bit?

DAS NARAYANDAS: Well, that’s what you’ll learn when you discuss the case in class. I will answer your question, but I just want to reflect on something that Mark said earlier. In the spirit of continuous improvement and agile development, when we wrote the current version of the case, we consciously chose not to include a case fact that the current organization is one-third the old, one-third laterals in, and one-third coming up. We thought that that would be a good “aha” to pull out in class. But having taught the case a couple of times today, we are going to put that into the case

Mark and Jeff spent quite some time with the participants talking about what it takes to make this happen. So, yes, what do you do going ahead? is a good question, and I’ll answer that in a moment, but how do you make sure that it works in the short run? What do you do with naysayers? Skeptics can be converted, but there are cynics too. Being cynical is irrational. It’s not easy to convert that. How do you manage that? So, the case, when putting this fact in, I will be able to force students to address this question of, how do you manage those that don’t want to get on board? That’s really the question that we’re going to start with in this case discussion: is 80% good enough, or do you need to get to 100%? And how do you manage it?

I’m now answering your question: What the team has shown and what will be a C case, which you’re going to put together, is the fact that the pillars are evolving. There are existing pillars that are evolving to reflect current times. There are new pillars being added, and that’s how it remains current. That’s how it remains exciting. That’s what makes it effective for people to adopt. Great brands are consistent. They take the core promise, but they make it work in today’s world. The day this team stops innovating New Ways of Working is the day it becomes history. For now, I can tell you they’re very agile in making sure that the latest issues, the externalities in the world, are constantly being reflected in how this system is being deployed.

BRIAN KENNY: I love your answer because you started out by… Our listeners are hearing about new HBS case studies all the time, and part of the reason we do this podcast is to show people how relevant the case studies are to everyday business practice. And you just showed us that you’re innovating on the case even as you go because learning in the classroom and feeding that back into the case. So that’s a really great point.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Thank you.

BRIAN KENNY: Jeff, I wanted to ask you something about what Das just said, which is that you’ve got to keep changing the model to keep it fresh. From your vantage point, how do you know when it’s time to change something up? Are you getting a feedback loop from within the firm?

JEFF HURD: 100%. Maybe I’ll answer that in two ways. One is within each unit they’ve implemented New Ways of Working slightly differently. The core concepts are 100% adoption. We had that conversation in class, but exactly how it’s applied has to be modified a bit with the right mindset for the organization. The service center is different than the sales team is different than the product team. So, we see innovation on NWOW every time we stand up a new organization. And then what we’ve learned recently, we added another pillar called “process redesign,” and Mark talked about this coral reef that builds up after 160 years. We were hearing, because of adaptive leadership, from all sorts of different parts of our organization that this process is broken, this process isn’t working, and they actually knew how to fix it. So, we developed a methodology, or adopted a methodology, tried and true process re-engineering to go in, listened to the folks who are actually doing the process, map it out, apply digital technologies to it, and totally revamp those processes. That’s a new wedge in the NWOW wheel that we’ve added probably about six months ago.

BRIAN KENNY: So, you’ve had some time to see what the results are. I’m wondering, reflecting back, if you can tell us how do you think it’s going? What would you be looking at to call this a success three, four, five years from now?

MARK PEARSON: Looking forward, I think the one thing we can be certain of is the amount of opportunities for change that we will see will not slow down, looking at Gen AI obviously, changes in the workforce. For our business, Brian, the demographics are very, very favorable in terms of the number of Americans reaching a traditional retirement age of 65 is yet to peak. But also, we know, I think that there are some enduring principles as well. I guess looking out the things that don’t change are as important for us as how we work and what doesn’t go. I think we see Equitable as being a trusted partner. We also know that it’s a very competitive market, and we need to be relentless in our innovation, and we need to continue with NWOW to be very, very client focused on that side as well. In our business we need to have a very resilient balance sheet because we need to be around for many, many decades through ups and downs and economy. So, we see NWOW continuing to evolve, and we see a bright future, I think, for our industry and certainly for the company as long as our people remain focused on the client and focused on being a trusted advisor to that client.

BRIAN KENNY: Jeff, let me ask you, as somebody who was helping boots on the ground to lead this effort across the firm, I’m sure some of the folks that are listening to this podcast might be going through a similar kind of transformation at their own firm. Do you have any words of advice, words of caution, anything you would counsel them on?

JEFF HURD: I’d say the one thing I would emphasize is if you’re going to go through a change that’s this big and this transformational, remember that organizations don’t change, people change. So, you really have to show people what’s in it for them: How will I benefit from this change? How will I work better? Mark had a brilliant phrase that he used all the time when we talked to our organization, which is, We’re future proofing you. These are skills that you are learning. We hope you apply them at Equitable. If you pick up and go somewhere else, they’re going to stay with you for the rest of your life. There are great tools to have in your career. Actually, we found, Mark, this was probably most surprising to us, that people were applying these things like OKRs, adaptive leadership, design, thinking to their own lives outside of work.

BRIAN KENNY: Sure. I could see that.

JEFF HURD: So, if you show people what’s in it for them, they actually will change.

BRIAN KENNY: This is a question. I lied. I’m asking each of you another question. As you think about the impact of AI on your business, Mark, because you mentioned it, how are you thinking about bringing people up the learning curve on that, upskilling your own community on what AI means and how they should engage with it?

MARK PEARSON: We have all the tools available for people to actually learn and play in the sandbox, if you like. I think we’ve got something like 400 case studies we’ve looked at. I would say mainly on the productivity side at the moment. I think the next stage for us is to look at ways in which we can get out into the marketplace and make it real for us. So very excited about the opportunities that it will bring, and we are in that sort of learning and productivity improvement stage.

BRIAN KENNY: I think we’re all in that phase and trying to figure out how do we wrap our arms around it. Das, I’ve got one last question, and I’ll give this to you, which is that as you think about culture change at an organization, particularly one of this size and scale, the question that the case brings up, is 80% good enough? How do you think about that? How would you counsel a leader who’s trying to think about should they push hard for that 100% adoption, or should they be a little more flexible in that?

DAS NARAYANDAS: My answer that I gave you earlier is come to class and we will discuss. No, the reason why we have that question in the case is it’s real, but it’s also illusionary. Numbers matter, but numbers don’t finalize things. The idea of asking is 80% good enough is actually asking the question, what is good enough? When you say 100%, 100% of what? Focus not on the numbers, but focus on the effectiveness of what you get done and that will lead you to the right answer. The key here is the orientation of people. As long as you can bring people on board and they give it their best, you are on the right path. The problem is when people who get on board sit the wrong way, row in the wrong direction and don’t listen to you, having all 100% of them sitting in the boat is disastrous. That’s really what we spend 80 minutes debating or 90 minutes debating in this case as to, what does it take to create a winning organization?

BRIAN KENNY: Those are great words to end on. Das, Jeff, Mark, thanks for joining me.

MARK PEARSON: Thank you, Brian. Thank you very much.

Robotics company Nuro is leading testing of the robotaxi engineering prototypes, which are overseen by autonomous vehicle operators. Commercial service is expected to launch in the San Francisco Bay Area later in 2026.

The companies made the announcement at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show this week, also showcasing the in-cabin experience for riders. The robotaxis will have in-vehicle visualization, showing riders the vehicle's path in real-time and displaying what the robotaxi sees. They will also feature LEDs to help riders identify the right vehicles and provide status updates.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.
Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.","The market expects Delta Air Lines (DAL) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.55 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16.2%.

Revenues are expected to be $15.45 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.94% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Delta?

For Delta, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.29%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Delta will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Delta would post earnings of $1.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.71, delivering a surprise of +12.50%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Delta doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

However, you might be surprised to learn you'll also find a variety of this brand's food in restaurants, served in a way you may not be aware of. Restaurants can order these food products from the brand pre-made, frozen, and in bulk sizes, ready for them to prepare and serve.

Kraft Heinz has numerous brand names under its label. In addition to its popular ketchup, which we consider as one of the best Ketchup brands you can buy, it's also known for other grocery store items like mustard, mayonnaise, cream cheese, pickle relish, and more. However, Kraft Heinz also sells restaurant-style, ready-to-heat-and-serve bulk frozen foods, including soup by Heinz, Chef Francisco, Quality Chef, and True Soups; Oscar Meyer hot dogs and sausages; vegetarian Boca burgers, and more. Though many restaurant chains make your food fresh to order, the next time you enjoy a delicious chicken enchilada soup or veggie burger at your favorite restaurant chain, it may actually be a product made by Kraft Heinz.

Henry John Heinz developed the original Heinz company in 1876, and its iconic ketchup hasn't changed much since it was introduced almost 150 years ago. The company's current iteration, Kraft Heinz, was formed with the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Co. It's the fifth largest food company in the world and the third largest in North America. In addition to producing frozen food for restaurants, Kraft Heinz makes Heinz condiments in bulk and in single-serve packets for restaurant customers to use on their favorite foods. The list of Heinz products served in restaurants includes ketchup and mustard, unique BBQ-style and other flavor sauces, dressings for your salad bar, as well as individual packets, Mexican sauces and salsas, and much more.

Though the company has added numerous products to its line over the years, the ketchup you enjoy today is much like the original ketchup made in 1876, as there has been little in the way of recipe adjustments besides using corn syrup instead of sugar. After 150 years, the Heinz ketchup brand is still so popular that Kraft Heinz created a product verification system so you can tell if a restaurant's bottle of ketchup is truly a Heinz product rather than an imposter brand.",https://www.chowhound.com/img/gallery/the-classic-grocery-brand-that-sells-bulk-frozen-products-to-restaurants/l-intro-1767194324.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:13:36.419168

They learn speed from U.S. teams.
Final Thought Leading across Canada and the U.S. means more than crossing a border.","Leadership Gets Tested Across Borders

Running teams in one country is tough. Doing it in two is a whole new game.

When leaders move between Canada and the U.S., they face different markets, mindsets, and systems. What works in one place may fall flat in the other. You can’t copy and paste strategy. You have to think differently.

Cross-border leaders learn fast. They build sharper systems. They speak two business languages. They earn trust in new ways. And they gain an edge most people never get.

Similar, But Not the Same

Canada and the U.S. share a border, a language, and many business traits. But key differences matter.

In Canada, regulation is more centralized. The pace can be slower. Risk tolerance is lower. Relationships matter more before decisions get made.

In the U.S., markets move faster. Sales cycles can be shorter. Risk-taking is more common. Speed often beats perfection.

One country leans on structure. The other leans on scale.

Neither is better. But leaders have to adapt.

Strategy Must Match Culture

The U.S. rewards bold moves. New ideas. Fast pivots. That makes it a good place for testing, launching, and scaling.

Canada values thoughtfulness. Stability. Clear plans. That makes it better for long-term planning and deeper client loyalty.

If you use a U.S. style in Canada, you might sound pushy. If you use a Canadian approach in the U.S., you might lose momentum.

Cross-border leadership means knowing when to turn the dial up or down.

Regulatory Rules Shape Growth

The U.S. has state-by-state rules. Canada runs most financial services through a few big regulators. This changes how products launch and scale.

Licensing, marketing, and reporting look different. Cross-border firms need separate playbooks.

Even the investor base looks different. A 2023 BNY Mellon study showed that U.S. institutional investors allocate more to alternatives (34%) than Canadian investors (22%). That affects how you build models and pitch ideas.

Understand the legal side early. Don’t assume it works the same both ways.

Talent Expectations Vary

In Canada, teams value security, benefits, and work-life balance. In the U.S., there’s more focus on growth, compensation, and upward mobility.

Leadership has to adjust:

Feedback styles

Bonus structures

Flexibility options

Career path messaging

Good leaders know what motivates their people. Great leaders adjust their style by region.

Youssef Zohny, who built his career in both countries, noticed these patterns firsthand. “In Canada, building trust often came before doing business. In the U.S., business could start quicker—but expectations for speed and innovation were also higher.”

That mindset shift shaped how he led teams on both sides of the border.

Communication Needs Local Context

Even if the language is the same, tone and delivery matter.

In the U.S., people value clarity and confidence. In Canada, subtlety and consensus play a bigger role.

Meetings run differently. Emails read differently. Client conversations move at different speeds.

One quick tip: Cut jargon everywhere. Keep language simple. Clear. Direct. But respectful of the local style.

Use feedback loops to adjust. Ask what’s landing—and what isn’t.

Currency and Cost Matter More Than You Think

Cross-border operations come with pricing challenges. Currency shifts can cut into margins. Service costs vary.

For example:

Healthcare is employer-funded in the U.S., public in Canada

Software costs often priced in U.S. dollars

Office space is more expensive in core U.S. cities

Every budget decision must factor in exchange rates and local costs.

Even something simple like setting a salary range can get tricky fast.

Use real-time tools to track FX impact. Forecast for both directions.

Scaling Across Borders Requires Repeatable Systems

To grow across countries, your systems must scale.

Start with these:

Unified onboarding processes

Clear reporting templates

Cross-border tax tracking

Shared cloud-based tools (but with regional backups)

Time zone calendars that avoid overlap errors

Don’t assume your U.S. workflows will work in Toronto or Vancouver. Run test cases. Ask team leads for feedback.

Small process breaks become big delays at scale.

Action Steps for Cross-Border Leaders

1. Build Two Playbooks

Customize one for the U.S. and one for Canada. Include hiring, sales, compliance, and client communication.

2. Run Side-by-Side Tests

Try the same strategy in both markets. Compare the response. Adjust accordingly.

3. Map Time Zones Clearly

Block shared calendar time. Respect regional holidays. Don’t book over them.

4. Use Local Experts

Hire local legal, tax, and HR pros. Even small issues can lead to major slowdowns if missed.

5. Track FX Risk Monthly

Review how currency moves affect margins. Protect with hedging if needed.

6. Lead With Context

When launching new products or initiatives, explain the why and the where. Teams want to know how it fits the market they serve.

Real Leadership Means Learning on Both Sides

The best cross-border leaders don’t just export ideas. They import lessons.

They learn patience from Canadian teams. They learn speed from U.S. teams. They keep both cultures in the conversation.

They avoid one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, they build bridges—between systems, styles, and people.

Those lessons build stronger companies. Teams that work better. Clients who stay longer.

Cross-border leadership isn’t just about growth. It’s about insight.

Final Thought

Leading across Canada and the U.S. means more than crossing a border. It means building new habits, asking smarter questions, and making decisions that fit the map—not just the model.

Focus on what works where you are. Stay open to change. Build with context.

That’s what makes a good leader great—no matter what side of the border you’re on.",https://shawanoleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/istockphoto-1051263190-612x612-1.webp,N,,2026-01-06 15:01:13.344240

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

Illustrations

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, operates over 40 cafes across the world, including in cities like London, Barcelona, Hong Kong and Singapore.
And so the cafes can show up as a personification of what is Capital One,"" said Jennifer Windbeck, Capital One's head of retail bank channels.
And really the reason why we opened this coffee is to really help our customer and enhance their shopping experience,"" Cessot said.","From monogrammed lattes at Louis Vuitton to handbag-inspired pastries at Coach , retail stores are increasingly doubling as cafes.

It's all part of companies trying to lean into experiences.

""I've long said that the easiest way to get in the experience business is to add a cafe because it engages all five senses and it gets customers to spend more time with you,"" said Joe Pine, co-author of the Experience Economy.

As the retail landscape evolves post-pandemic, some of the early pioneers in the branded cafe concept are continuing to expand, and new entrants are entering the space.

Uniqlo brought its first coffee bar to the United States in March. It has nine locations worldwide, with the first opening in Japan in 2021.

Uniqlo's head of marketing, Nico Cessot, told CNBC that the primary reason for the cafes is to bring in more customers and enhance their shopping experience.

""The interest behind and the concept behind [it] is to make you feel at home, to be part of the brand, to feel the brand, to also spread the Japanese culture. Because we are a Japanese company,"" Cessot said. He added that New York City's Fifth Avenue store uses coffee beans imported from Japan.

Luxury brands

Recently, cafes have been particularly prevalent with designer brands.

Over the past few years, fashion house LVMH has opened a Dior cafe in Dallas and Louis Vuitton Cafe in New York. It has also remodeled the Tiffany brand's Blue Box Café. All three locations are collaborations with Michelin-starred chefs.

Source: Tiffany & Co.

Prada, which is not a part of LVMH, is also rumored to be opening a New York location in 2026. The luxury retailer opened a cafe in London in 2023 and in Singapore in 2025.

Coach, meanwhile, opened its first cafe in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2024. Since then, it has opened four in the U.S. and over a dozen more internationally.

Marcus Sanders, Coach vice president of global food and beverage, said the company is seeing double to triple digit sales at stores where it added a cafe.

""Ultimately what I see happening is there's this really cool nexus of fashion meets hospitality,"" Sanders said. ""People are excited to be able to experience their favorite brands in a different way.""

The cafe rollout is also an effort by Coach to tap into popularity with Gen Z, Sanders said, which has been the core demographic driving its cultural resurgence. The brand saw a revenue increase of 22% in its fiscal 2026 first quarter.

Standing out

While more brands are adding cafes to their stores, this trend is not a new phenomenon. Barnes and Noble and Target have both partnered with Starbucks for their in-store cafes since 1993 and 1999, respectively.

Capital One and Ralph Lauren both opened their first cafes in 2014. Capital One told CNBC that it now operates 65 cafes nationally. Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, operates over 40 cafes across the world, including in cities like London, Barcelona, Hong Kong and Singapore. Both companies are continuing to expand, with new openings planned for 2026.

Pine said Covid decimated the experience economy but that people are looking to spend their time out and about again. He noted that cafes are one of the primary ways to do that.

But as more companies jump on the trend, it will become increasingly commoditized, he said.

""It's something that you need to refresh to think about how you change this over time and you need to design it uniquely,"" Pine said. ""The Tiffany Blue Box Cafe [is] a beautiful example of that, so that it's not just about the coffee, it's about immersing you in the brand values, in the brand colors, in what it stands for.""

Coach put its own spin on the concept with pastries like the Tabby cake, an edible version of one of its best-selling handbags.

Source: Coach Inc.

At Capital One, cardholders of the namesake bank and Discover, which it acquired in a $35 billion stock deal in 2025, get half off beverage purchases.

Unlike Coach, the bank doesn't run the food and beverage operations. Capital One said its cafes are independently run by a third-party provider and it does not share in profits or losses. The bank can instead focus its efforts on how to leverage the space to increase its brand awareness.

""Bank accounts and credit cards and money are things that don't always feel tangible. And so the cafes can show up as a personification of what is Capital One,"" said Jennifer Windbeck, Capital One's head of retail bank channels.

Uniqlo said it owns and operates the majority of its cafes, including the one inside its New York City flagship location, which has a coffee bar on the second floor of the store.

Cessot said the goal was to make it a service area where guests can come pick up online orders, get their clothing repaired and customize their apparel.

""There's one aspect that is making profits, which we are obviously monitoring week over week, month over month. And then the second aspect is really about the customer. And really the reason why we opened this coffee is to really help our customer and enhance their shopping experience,"" Cessot said.

Summary

Microsoft Corporation is rated Buy, driven by strong AI and cloud momentum, robust leadership, and ambitious revenue targets.

MSFT delivered a stellar quarter with 18.4% Y/Y revenue growth, significant beats across all segments, and accelerating Azure AI services.

High CapEx and OpenAI-related risks are present, but strategic diversification and deep product integration support long-term growth.

MSFT targets $500B annual revenue by 2030, implying a feasible 12.16% CAGR and a potential $5.4T market cap.

Introduction

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has now completely expanded and transformed itself from a simple OS provider as it shifts towards Generative and Agentic AI, and has the benefits of its highly touted Azure infrastructure. With

As a detail-oriented investor with a strong foundation in finance and business writing, I focus on analyzing undervalued and disliked companies or industries that have strong fundamentals and good cash flows. I have a particular interest in sectors such as Oil&Gas and consumer goods. Basically, anything that has been unloved for unjustified reasons that could offer substantial returns. Energy Transfer is one of those companies that I came across when no one wanted to touch it and now I can't resolve myself to sell it. I will always focus more on long-term value investing but I can sometimes lose myself in possible deal arbitrage such as with Microsoft/ Activision Blizzard, Spirit Airlines/Jetblue (that one still hurts), and Nippon/U.S. Steel (perfect exit at $50.19). I tend to shun businesses that I can't understand either high-tech or certain consumer goods such as fashion (give me a Levi's jeans). I don't understand why anyone would invest in cryptocurrencies as well. Through Seeking Alpha, I aim to connect with like-minded investors, share insights, and build a collaborative community of individuals seeking superior returns and informed decision-making, currently on a quest to review every public company.

Quick Insights

MSFT’s CapEx, projected to exceed $80B annually by 2026, may compress gross margins short term but supports capacity expansion and long-term AI/cloud growth.

MSFT’s 27% OpenAI stake secures Azure revenue and IP access, but OpenAI’s diversification and competition with Copilot introduce both strategic hedging and margin risks.

Exceptional cloud and AI growth, integrated product suites, expanding margins, and credible 12%+ CAGR underpin the Buy rating and path to a $5.4T valuation by 2030.

The bottom line is that Lilly's competitive position is exceptionally strong, but it is being tested.
For a value investor, the question is whether the current price adequately discounts these risks while fully valuing the multi-decade growth potential of the new pillars.
Over the past 120 days, shares have rallied nearly 32%, a powerful move that underscores the market's belief in the company's growth trajectory.","Eli

has achieved a historic milestone, becoming the first healthcare company to reach a trillion-dollar market capitalization. The stock's ascent has been nothing short of vertiginous, with shares trading around $1,042 and a market cap of roughly $985 billion. This valuation places the company in an elite tier, worth more than twice the value of its closest pharmaceutical peer, Johnson & Johnson.

The growth story behind this price is undeniable. The company's blockbuster diabetes and obesity drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, have fueled a projected revenue jump from

. This explosive expansion is reflected in key valuation metrics. The stock's PEG ratio of 0.44 suggests the market is pricing in exceptionally high growth at a reasonable multiple, while the price-to-sales ratio of 16.6 underscores the premium placed on its future earnings power.

Yet, for a patient investor, the current price offers a narrow margin of safety. The average analyst price target sits at $1,096, implying only about 4.7% upside from recent levels. This minimal spread between the current price and the consensus target indicates that the market has already priced in a highly successful execution of the growth plan. The stock's recent underperformance, with shares down 3.5% today and 3.1% year-to-date, shows it is vulnerable to any stumble in the hyper-growth trajectory.

The bottom line is that Lilly's valuation is a bet on flawless, sustained execution. The company's competitive moat is wide, but the price for that privilege is high. For a disciplined investor, the prudent move is often to wait for a better entry point-a moment when the stock's price reflects the company's immense potential without demanding perfection in the near term.

The Width of the Competitive Moat: First-Mover Advantage and Clinical Superiority

Eli Lilly's ascent to a trillion-dollar valuation is built on a core growth engine of unprecedented scale and clinical perception. The combined sales of its two flagship GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, reached

. This staggering revenue has propelled the franchise to become the world's best-selling medicine, leapfrogging established giants like Merck's Keytruda. The durability of this engine hinges on two factors: a clear clinical edge and a strategic pipeline that aims to widen its lead.

Clinically, Lilly holds a distinct advantage. The company's drugs are viewed by physicians as more effective than Novo Nordisk's leading product, Wegovy. This perception is translating into market share, with

. This clinical superiority is not just a marketing point; it's a tangible moat that supports premium pricing and customer loyalty. The company is now preparing to extend this advantage into the oral market, where its drug orforglipron is . Analysts believe orforglipron, as a small molecule, will be easier to manufacture and distribute than Novo's peptide-based oral, potentially giving Lilly a supply and cost edge.

Yet, the path ahead is not without friction. The market's explosive demand has created severe supply constraints, a vulnerability that competitors have exploited. The rise of compound pharmacies filling the gap has hurt branded sales, with Novo executives pointing to this as a key drag. Furthermore, the competitive landscape is intensifying. Novo Nordisk launched its own oral Wegovy pill in early January, and the two companies are engaged in a fierce battle of clinical data, with a head-to-head study expected to read out soon. Lilly's moat is wide, but it is not impervious to pressure from a determined rival and the logistical challenges of meeting runaway demand.

The bottom line is that Lilly's competitive position is exceptionally strong, but it is being tested. The company's first-mover advantage in clinical perception and its pipeline depth provide a powerful foundation for compounding growth. However, the widening market also invites more competition and operational strain. For the stock to continue its ascent, Lilly must not only defend its current lead but also demonstrate that its clinical and manufacturing advantages are durable enough to withstand these mounting pressures.

Long-Term Compounding Potential vs. Near-Term Execution Risks

Eli Lilly's long-term compounding potential is now the central investment thesis. The company is aggressively building a multi-pillar franchise, moving far beyond its dominant incretin business. Over the past year, it has secured full FDA approval for its Alzheimer's drug Kisunla and completed major acquisitions to diversify its pipeline. The purchase of Morphic deepens its inflammatory bowel disease bet, while the deal for Scorpion Therapeutics adds precision oncology optionality. Its foray into radiopharmaceuticals, through the acquisition of POINT Biopharma and partnerships with Aktis and Radionetics, targets a high-growth field. Most ambitiously, the $1.3 billion acquisition of Verve Therapeutics for a ""one-and-done"" cardiovascular gene-editing therapy represents a long-horizon gamble on a transformative technology. This strategy is designed to create multiple, durable growth engines, ensuring the company's value can compound for decades.

The near-term execution risks, however, are substantial and multifaceted. The most immediate catalysts are clinical and competitive. This year will see Phase III results for the next-generation obesity drug retatrutide, which has already shown dramatic weight loss and pain reduction in early trials. More critically, the outcome of the head-to-head study between Novo Nordisk's CagriSema and Lilly's tirzepatide is expected in the first quarter. While Lilly has previously bested Novo's semaglutide in key metrics, a surprising win for the rival could pressure its market share and pricing power. The company's own oral obesity drug, orforglipron, is also poised for approval in the second quarter, adding another layer of competitive pressure and execution risk.

Regulatory and legal pressures form a persistent overhang. A new lawsuit filed by the Indiana Attorney General alleges Lilly participated in a scheme that inflated insulin prices by over 1,000% despite low manufacturing costs. This adds to the ongoing multistate litigation and regulatory scrutiny the company faces. More broadly, the potential for Medicare to expand coverage and negotiate prices for GLP-1 drugs is a major policy risk. A voluntary demonstration program is set to begin in July, with the possibility of mandatory coverage starting in January 2027. Such a move could compress margins and alter the entire reimbursement landscape for Lilly's blockbuster franchise.

The bottom line is a tension between a powerful long-term narrative and significant near-term hurdles. The pipeline diversification is a masterstroke for future value creation, but the stock's path will be dictated by the successful navigation of these clinical, competitive, and regulatory storms. For a value investor, the question is whether the current price adequately discounts these risks while fully valuing the multi-decade growth potential of the new pillars. The coming quarters will provide the answer.

Catalysts, Risks, and the Patient Investor's Watchlist

The stock's recent volatility is a direct reflection of its valuation. Over the past 120 days, shares have rallied nearly 32%, a powerful move that underscores the market's belief in the company's growth trajectory. Yet, in just the past five days, the stock has dropped about 3.5%. This choppiness is the hallmark of a stock priced for perfection, where every piece of news is scrutinized for signs of deviation from the high-growth script.

The forward view is dominated by two major catalysts that could reset the growth narrative. First is the launch of Lilly's oral obesity drug, orforglipron, which analysts expect to be approved in the

. This small-molecule pill is seen as a manufacturing advantage over competitors and could significantly expand the market. Second, the voluntary Medicare GLP-1 payment demonstration begins in July, a policy trial that could pave the way for mandatory coverage by January 2027. Both events are critical for validating the path to the company's ambitious $94.3 billion in annual revenue by 2027 target.

The key risk is that the current price leaves no room for error. With a forward P/E of 58.5 and a PEG ratio of just 0.44, the market is paying a premium for growth that must be flawless. Any stumble in GLP-1 adoption, a delay in the oral drug launch, or a miss on pipeline milestones could trigger a significant correction. The fierce rivalry with Novo Nordisk adds another layer of pressure, as the upcoming head-to-head study readout in Q1 will be a key competitive signal.

For the patient investor, the watchlist is clear. Monitor the Q2 orforglipron approval and launch execution. Track the Medicare demonstration's rollout and its potential to expand the addressable market. And watch the company's own pipeline, particularly the Phase III results for retatrutide, to see if the growth engine can continue to accelerate. The stock's recent price action shows it is already in a state of high anticipation. The next move will depend entirely on whether Lilly can consistently deliver on the promise already priced in.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1767710520093.jpg.png,N,,2026-01-06 11:02:51.316294

The latest agreement, which could be worth upwards of $1.3 billion and includes upfront and near-term payments of around $55 million, focuses on ""a novel oral treatment for obesity and other metabolic diseases,"" according to Nimbus, without providing further details.

Lilly and Nimbus started working together on a programme to develop small-molecule activators of AMPK, a regulator of cellular energy metabolism that is thought to switch the body from fat-storing to fat-burning mode. That deal included research, development, and commercial milestone payments up to $496 million.

Last year, the companies said they had achieved a significant preclinical milestone in the AMPK alliance, identifying a highly selective isoform-specific AMPK activator – something that Nimbus' R&D head Peter Tummino said had eluded drug developers for decades.

The new, multi-year research collaboration gives Lilly a worldwide license to the new candidate, identified using Nimbus' AI-enhanced computational drug discovery engine.

In a statement, Nimbus said it will now work with Lilly to ""apply [a] computational chemistry and structure-based drug design approach to an early-stage, small molecule discovery programme addressing a significant unmet need in obesity.""

Lilly has seen dramatic sales growth over the last couple of years from its injectable, dual GLP-1/GIP agonist obesity therapy Zepbound/Mounjaro (tirzepatide), and is hoping to add to its weight-loss stable with FDA approval for a new oral GLP-1 agonist, orforglipron, in the next few weeks.

With dozens of other candidates for obesity coming through the collective industry pipeline, directed at an expanding range of drug targets, the company has been actively building its pipeline with a series of licensing deals.

ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-06 14:28:44+00:00,MEDIANAMA,Examining Voice-First AI Amid OpenAI Betting On Audio-Driven AI - MediaNama,Aakriti Bansal,,,,,https://www.medianama.com/2026/01/223-explained-openai-audio-first-personal-device-voice-first-ai/,"For context, TechCrunch, while citing The Information, reported that OpenAI has unified its engineering, product, and research teams to improve audio AI for an upcoming device and is developing a new audio model architecture focused on more natural and accurate responses.

Consequently, as audio-first systems become more widespread, these vulnerabilities turn voice-driven technology from a convenience into a potential point of failure.","OpenAI is reportedly reorganising teams and rebuilding its audio models ahead of an audio-first personal device launch. For context, TechCrunch, while citing The Information, reported that OpenAI has unified its engineering, product, and research teams to improve audio AI for an upcoming device and is developing a new audio model architecture focused on more natural and accurate responses.

Notably, the new audio model is expected to handle interruptions and speak while the user is talking, with a rollout timeframe around early 2026.

Pertinently, all these developments at OpenAI point to a larger question: what changes when AI becomes voice-first?

The significance here is not that OpenAI may ship new hardware, but in how companies now treat audio as a primary interface for AI: a change that reshapes how users experience accuracy, trust, privacy, and security.

What OpenAI is reportedly changing

OpenAI’s internal assessment, as reported by The Information, points to a clear problem. Its audio models lag behind its text models in both accuracy and response speed, a gap that becomes harder to ignore as more products move toward voice-led interaction.

That assessment reflects a broader shift already visible across major tech platforms. Voice assistants have become a default feature in homes through smart speakers. Meta has begun using multi-microphone arrays in its Ray-Ban smart glasses to actively process and enhance real-world conversations.

Meanwhile, Google has started experimenting with “Audio Overviews” that convert search results into spoken summaries rather than lists of links. And Tesla is integrating xAI’s chatbot Grok into its vehicles to allow drivers to control navigation-related commands.

Against this backdrop, OpenAI is not pursuing incremental improvements in text-to-speech. Instead, it is trying to unify its text and audio stack so the system can listen, reason, and respond in real time, including during overlapping conversational dynamics. As mentioned earlier, OpenAI’s next audio model will support more natural interaction, handle interruptions, and speak while the user is still talking.

If OpenAI succeeds, it moves AI away from turn-based chat and closer to ambient, continuous conversation, where voice becomes the primary interface.

What audio-first AI means in practice

Audio-first AI does not simply add voice input to an existing chatbot. It redesigns the interaction model so speech becomes the default channel in both directions.

That produces three practical shifts.

First, conversations rely less on turn-taking and more on overlap. If the system can respond while the user is speaking, interactions begin to resemble live conversation rather than typed Q&A.

Secondly, audio lowers friction. Users no longer open an app, type a query, and read a response. They speak, and the system speaks back.

And thirdly, the interaction becomes invisible. The interface no longer sits on a screen that users can pause, scroll, or inspect. It fades into the room, the car, or the wearable device.

Why voice changes how people trust AI

Voice reduces friction and reshapes credibility

Text interfaces introduce friction that can help users stay sceptical. Users can re-read responses, scroll back, or copy claims to verify them elsewhere. Voice-based interaction may reduce some of that friction because responses unfold in real-time and disappear once spoken.

Furthermore, a particular user’s experience in voice-led interactions can influence perceptions of credibility. To explain, a 2022 systematic review of voice assistant usability found that user acceptance is closely tied to overall usability and interaction experience, particularly in systems where voice is the primary mode of interaction.

Moreover, conversational systems can make uncertainty harder to notice. To explain, most audio systems tend to deliver a single response rather than signalling hesitation or asking for clarification, even when speech input contains ambiguity due to accents, background noise, overlapping speakers, or imperfect microphone capture. In such cases, users may have limited visibility into what the system actually heard or how confident it was in its interpretation.

As a result, trust dynamics may begin to shift before questions of privacy, regulation, or liability come into focus.

Trust shifts also complicate consent

The shift in trust dynamics has implications beyond perception. Audio-first systems rely on microphones that remain always on or close to it, increasing the likelihood of passive data capture and recording of bystanders.

Notably, European data protection regulators have cautioned that voice assistants raise specific data protection risks, particularly where audio is retained by default or speech is captured in shared environments, potentially conflicting with principles such as storage limitation and informed consent.

In the Indian context specifically, the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act requires that consent be “free, specific, informed, unconditional and unambiguous”, and that it be demonstrated through a clear affirmative action by the individual providing it, as set out in Section 6(1) of the Act.

However in practice, ambient audio makes that standard difficult to meet, as many affected individuals may never receive notice, let alone an opportunity to consent.

Who is responsible when voice assistants goes wrong

Voice-first AI does not merely change how users interact with systems. It also complicates questions of responsibility when those systems act in ways users did not intend.

A well-known example surfaced in earlier generations of voice assistants. In 2017, an Amazon Alexa device reportedly picked up a phrase during a television broadcast and placed an unintended order: a case that MediaNama later examined during its Governing the AI Ecosystem roundtable on agentic systems. Participants at the discussion argued that while the outcome was reversible, the incident highlighted how ambient, voice-triggered systems can act without a clear or deliberate user instruction.

Legal and policy experts at the roundtable differed on where liability should sit in such cases. Some argued that developers and manufacturers bear responsibility when foreseeable safeguards are missing, treating such failures as closer to product defects.

Others pointed to user-configurable settings, such as voice recognition controls or payment authorisations, as factors that could shift responsibility back to users. Several participants also cautioned that consent and choice can become illusory when systems rely on long, complex terms or default configurations that users rarely understand.

Overall, these views highlight how voice-first interaction blurs traditional boundaries between user action and system behaviour, complicating how responsibility is assigned when things go wrong.

Security risks specific to voice interfaces

Audio-first AI also expands the attack surface, as security research has shown. Unlike text-based systems, voice interfaces must continuously process ambient sound from their surroundings, increasing exposure to unintended inputs and malicious triggers.

As users often cannot see or review what the system has “heard”, errors or abuse can occur without immediate detection, making security failures harder to spot and contest.

Command injection can bypass human perception

Researchers behind the DolphinAttack paper demonstrated that attackers can embed voice commands into ultrasonic frequencies that humans cannot hear but microphones and speech recognition systems can still pick up.

In simple terms, a device can be made to “hear” a command even though the user hears nothing at all. For audio-first systems designed to listen continuously, this means actions could be triggered without the user ever realising a command was issued.

Spoofing no longer requires physical access

Advances in synthetic voice generation have also increased spoofing risks. In a widely cited case reported by Forbes, a fraudster used an AI-generated voice to impersonate a company executive and persuade an employee to transfer $243,000 (more than Rs 2.19 crore).

For consumer-facing devices the context differs, however the underlying lesson remains. If a system treats voice as proof of identity, it may be vulnerable to replayed recordings, synthetic voices, or other forms of impersonation. Speaker recognition, which attempts to verify a user based on vocal characteristics, can reduce some risk. But it cannot reliably distinguish between a real person and a high-quality imitation.

Consequently, as audio-first systems become more widespread, these vulnerabilities turn voice-driven technology from a convenience into a potential point of failure.

When applicable, we also compared the cost of name brand items with their store brand alternatives.
At Target, 2950 S. Chase Ave., prices decreased from $70.21 to $69.81.
After Aldi, the cheapest lists were those that used store brand alternatives to name brand items.
Piggly Wiggly's list totaled $82.18 for name brand items and $71.18 for the store brand items.","The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel tracked the prices of 18 grocery items at 13 area stores in late December.

Aldi was the least expensive store for the list of items, totaling $48.32.

Prices for a list of name-brand items at Walmart, Woodman's, Meijer, and Target all saw slight decreases from November.

Local stores like Sendik's, El Rey, Metcalfe's, and Outpost Co-op were among the most expensive options.

Every month, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel tracks the prices of groceries at major Milwaukee-area grocery stores.

On Dec. 29 and Dec. 30, the Journal Sentinel collected the price of a list of groceries at 13 stores, from national retail chains to local cooperatives. When applicable, we also compared the cost of name brand items with their store brand alternatives.

Prices do not include limited-time deals or discounts.

The grocery list is as follows:

A half-gallon of almond milk

A loaf of whole wheat bread

One pound of bacon

One pound of bananas

One pound of 80/20 ground beef, not Angus certified

One pound of butter in a four-pack

A box of Cheerios

A box of Cheez-Its

A dozen eggs

A five-pound bag of flour

Canned green beans

An 18-ounce jar of strawberry jam

A head of iceberg lettuce

A gallon of whole milk

One navel orange

A two-roll pack of paper towels

A 16-ounce jar of peanut butter

A six-pack of toilet paper

How prices at Walmart, Target, Meijer and Woodman's compare to last month

On Nov. 19, the list of name brand items at Walmart, 4140 W. Greenfield Ave. in West Milwaukee, cost just over $70. The price has since dropped to $68.76.

Groceries at Woodman's at 8131 S. Howell Ave. in Oak Creek dropped from $69.80 on Nov. 21 to $67.22 on Dec. 29.

Other stores saw smaller price drops. Groceries at Meijer, 11111 W. Burleigh St. in Wauwatosa, totaled $74.02, 14 cents cheaper than in November.

At Target, 2950 S. Chase Ave., prices decreased from $70.21 to $69.81.

The overall price drops at these stores can largely be attributed to the falling price of bacon, usually one of the most expensive items on the list. The cost of a pound of Oscar Mayer bacon at Walmart dropped from $8.48 in November to $7.48 on Dec. 29.

Aldi brands are cheapest for the list of items we bought

Aldi does not offer the same name brands that other large retailers do, so we tracked the prices of equivalent items at the store located at 225 E. Capitol Drive.

Aldi's list totaled $48.32, the least expensive of all stores tracked.

After Aldi, the cheapest lists were those that used store brand alternatives to name brand items. Walmart's store brand list totaled $53.95, followed by Meijer at $56.52.

Groceries more expensive at Pick 'n Save, Festival Foods, Whole Foods

Pricier options include Pick 'n Save at 1100 E. Garfield Ave., Piggly Wiggly at 123 W. Oklahoma Ave., Whole Foods at 2305 N. Prospect Ave. and Festival Foods at 11111 W. Greenfield Ave. in West Allis.

Pick 'n Save's name brand list cost $81.23, down slightly from $81.53 on Nov. 19. Substituting for store brand items brought the price down to $59.13.

Piggly Wiggly's list totaled $82.18 for name brand items and $71.18 for the store brand items.

Groceries at Whole Foods, which carries its own brand in place of many name brand items, cost $81.62 on Dec. 30. West Allis' Festival Foods was even pricier, totaling $93.78.

How did prices compare at Sendik's, Outpost and El Rey?

The Journal Sentinel also tracked prices at notable local grocery stores, including Outpost Co-op at 100 E. Capitol Drive; Sendik's Food Market, 8616 W. North Ave. in Wauwatosa; Metcalfe's Market, 6700 W. State St. in Wauwatosa; and El Rey Family Market, 5200 W. Oklahoma Ave.

Like Aldi, these stores do not carry many of the name brand items we track on this list, so they've been substituted for equivalent store or name brands.

Sendik's Food Market was the cheapest of the four local stores at $84.74. It was followed by El Rey Family Market, a family-owned Hispanic grocery store, at $88.49.

Metcalfe's Market, which has two locations in Madison and one in Wauwatosa, totaled $91.82 in December.

Outpost Co-op's list was the most expensive of all stores tracked, totaling $102.12. That's more than double the cost of the cheapest list, Aldi, located just a block east of Outpost on Capitol Drive.

Outpost carries many organic produce and dairy items, which are generally more expensive than conventionally farmed foods. The cooperative also offers deals and savings exclusive to owners, who pay $200 for a share in the store.

Smith told CNBC in November L.L.","Last year’s slew of CEO changes means many retailers and CPGs are starting off the year preparing for major leadership transitions...or hoping to finally end their ongoing executive searches. Here are the chief exec changes we’re keeping an eye on this year:

CEOs we already know

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is retiring after 12 years leading the big box retailer, with Walmart US CEO John Furner taking over as chief exec on February 1. Furner will look to continue Walmart’s current momentum: The retailer’s latest quarterly earnings exceeded analyst expectations, highlighted by strong grocery and health and wellness sales and a booming ecommerce presence. One of Furner’s biggest tasks ahead will be leading Walmart further into its AI era.

Target’s new COO Michael Fiddelke will also assume his new role as CEO in February as Brian Cornell shifts to executive chair. Fiddelke faces an uphill battle after a decidedly off-target (pun intended) year for the retailer that saw continuing foot traffic declines and falling comp sales as consumers pull back spend on discretionary goods.

The Coca-Cola Company’s new CEO Henrique Braun will step into his role on March 31, as nine-year CEO James Quincey moves to become executive chair. Braun, who joined Coca-Cola in 1996 and has served as COO for the last year, will take the helm as the beverage giant continues to outperform its rival, PepsiCo, in a tricky CPG environment, thanks in part to popularity of its zero-sugar drinks.

CEOs that are TBD

Coty faced a management shake-up in late December when controlling shareholder JAB Holdings reportedly pushed for the exits of chair Peter Harf and five-year CEO Sue Nabi. The company had an underwhelming 2025, launching a review of its mass beauty business in September that could mean the sale of CoverGirl and Rimmel, and losing its license to make Gucci fragrances to L’Oréal in 2028.

On December 22, Coty announced Procter & Gamble vet Markus Strobel, who was most recently head of P&G’s global skin and personal care business, will become its executive chair and interim CEO starting January 1. The company didn’t share its plans for naming a permanent chief exec.

Kroger is still looking for its next leader after 11-year CEO Rodney McMullen suddenly resigned in March. Interim CEO Ronald Sargent said in December the new chief exec, whom it aims to announce in Q1, will be an external hire, the first in the grocer’s 143-year history. Sargent said Kroger is looking for a candidate with “a deep understanding of retail transformation” who is “very close to the customer.”

Lululemon is still on the hunt for a replacement for CEO Calvin McDonald, who will exit his role on January 31 after leading the activewear brand since 2018. The Wall Street Journal reported in December that activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which now has a $1 billion stake in Lululemon, has its sights on former Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen as his successor.

7-Eleven’s CEO Joseph DePinto retired at the end of 2025 after 20+ years leading the convenience chain. President Stan Reynolds and COO Douglas Rosencrans filled the role as co-CEOs on an interim basis while its board of directors searches for DePinto’s successor.

L.L. Bean’s President and CEO Stephen Smith will depart his role in the spring after a decade leading the outerwear and apparel maker. Smith told CNBC in November L.L. Bean was “cautiously optimistic” about its holiday performance after a “volatile year” in consumer goods.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/706a7d4f65bafc712cb9c83ef64ed4612752770a-6960x4640.jpg?rect=0,493,6960,3654&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2026-01-06 11:03:03.261783

The retailer announced that it is running ads within Sparky, its AI shopping agent, after testing the first ads within the tool last fall.

Sparky is an AI shopping assistant within Walmart’s mobile app. Shoppers can ask Sparky questions and prompts to find products, and Sparky analyzes products and reviews to recommend products available at Walmart.

Ads within Sparky appear as a sponsored prompt when shoppers ask the tool questions for product recommendations. In a survey of Walmart customers, Walmart reports that 81% of shoppers have used Sparky to look up product availability and details about a product before purchasing. Search is the most popular use case for Sparky, according to Walmart.

“We know it’s an interesting new surface, and we want to be there and experiment in that new surface—even though it’s early days,” Khurrum Malik, VP of business and product marketing for Walmart Connect, told ADWEEK. Walmart Connect is Walmart’s advertising arm.

Walmart’s Sparky directly competes with Amazon’s gen AI agent Rufus, which began running ads in 2024.

In addition to Sparky, Walmart inked a deal with OpenAI last year that allows people to shop from ChatGPT.

Malik said one way Walmart is hoping to differentiate itself from competitors is with its scale. Walmart has 150 million weekly shoppers across 4,600 stores and online.

“If you think about our advertisers, they want simplicity, they want automation, so agentic experiences help there,” Malik said.

Gen AI-driven ads

In July, Walmart announced an AI assistant called Marty, which helps Walmart’s suppliers and advertisers manage retail operations as well as advertising.

Now, Walmart is rolling out a beta program within Marty that manages sponsored search campaigns. Marty analyzes sponsored search campaigns to offer advertisers campaign recommendations on things such as bidding and keywords. Marty also spits out reports about the performance of campaigns, including share of voice, a metric that tracks an advertisers’ market share relative to competitors.

According to Walmart, 97% of queries for Marty are unique, indicating that advertisers are using the tool for custom use cases. Marty’s recommendations are particularly helpful for emerging advertisers, including small businesses and midsize brands that want tailored suggestions for their campaigns, Malik said.

Marty will be available to all of Walmart’s advertisers that buy search ads in Walmart Connect Ad Center in the first half of this year. Malik said that Marty will also expand to Walmart’s other ad formats this year.

“Over time, you can imagine Marty playing a role as a cross-surface tool where you can go and help an advertiser invest in any of the surfaces where we can help them drive sales,” Malik said.

Walmart is also betting on creative applications of gen AI for advertisers this year. A tool called Automated Creative Generator helps advertisers spin up creative like background for product photos. Walmart claims that the tool reduces production time by 80%.

More broadly, Malik said that advertisers are increasingly investing brand-oriented budgets as well as performance budgets with Walmart. In one example, Walmart began pitching advertisers on connected TV campaigns last year after acquiring smart TV manufacturer Vizio.

“Advertisers are increasingly asking us, ’Hey, you’ve been helping us with performance solutions—help us with upper funnel as well,’” Malik said.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Walmart-Sparky.png?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2026-01-06 10:02:26.763476

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

HP Inc. announced Monday it’s looking to blaze new trails by moving all of the compute from an all-in-one PC into the keyboard form factor.

The result is the HP EliteBoard G1a, announced Monday as the latest addition to the HP AI PC portfolio.

[Related: HP Debuts EliteBook X G2 Series At CES 2026: 10 Big Things To Know]

The PC giant also disclosed Monday it is making big strides to advance GenAI performance on its premium EliteBook X commercial notebooks with the launch of second-generation AI PC devices in the series.

The announcements come in connection with the massive CES 2026 conference, taking place this week in Las Vegas.

What follows are five key details to know about HP’s EliteBoard G1a.

New Design Approach

The HP EliteBoard G1a represents a major reversal from past desktop PC design, according to HP.

The new design moves the compute power that once had to be located within the all-in-one or tower form factor, and embeds it directly into the keyboard.

By contrast, the traditional all-in-one PC design approach locks users into a single display (and working location, to some degree) for the life of the PC.

With the EliteBoard, instead, the entire PC is housed within the keyboard chassis, HP said.

Display Flexibility

For users that might wish to change displays over time, this allows those users to choose any display configuration without replacing the device itself, according to HP.

Notably, the approach also gives organizations and users more control over upgrade cycles and workspace customization, the company said.

In addition to stationary workers seeking more flexibility, HP also built the EliteBoard G1a around users that might share a display, such as in the health care space, HP said.

Device Options

Two versions of the HP EliteBoard G1a will be available to accommodate the two types of use cases, according to HP.

For users that need to share a display, one version of the device will offer a detachable cable and integrated battery, the company said.

Meanwhile, the stationary configuration features a lockable cable designed for environments where devices must remain physically secured, HP said.

Performance, Portability And Productivity

On performance, HP also classifies the EliteBoard G1a as an AI PC, with an AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series chip powering the device.

The device offers more than 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of neural processing unit (NPU) performance for highly responsive workloads, according to HP.

On portability, meanwhile, the EliteBoard G1a measures 12mm (0.47 of an inch) in terms of thickness and weighs about 1.65 pounds, HP said.

For productivity and collaboration, the keyboard-PC also includes dual mics and speakers, according to the company.

Pricing And Availability

The EliteBoard G1a Next Gen AI PC is expected to be available starting in March, HP announced

Pricing was not immediately disclosed and will be provided “closer to availability,” the company said in its news release.",https://www.crn.com/news/computing/2026/media_1aacfb8a0474a292fa9587518e7ad2e6412572a01.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-06 11:03:00.169981

The update was presented at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026, where the partners outlined progress on a global robotaxi programme.

According to the companies, autonomous testing began in December 2025 and is intended to support a commercial launch expected later this year in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Testing activities are being led by Nuro, using robotaxi engineering prototypes overseen by autonomous vehicle operators.

Lucid Autonomous & ADAS vice president Kay Stepper said: “Our robotaxi programme with Uber and Nuro is a key part of how Lucid is leveraging its technology to create a more sustainable future of mobility that is widely accessible.”

The vehicle platform is based on the all-electric Lucid Gravity and incorporates a “next-gen” sensor suite that combines cameras, solid-state lidar and radar systems to deliver 360-degree perception.

These components are integrated into the vehicle body as well as a purpose-built, “low-profile” roof-mounted halo.

The halo features integrated LEDs designed to help passengers identify the correct vehicle, display rider initials and indicate ride status from pick-up to drop-off, the press statement read.

Inside the cabin, passengers can manage settings such as seating, climate and music, access support functions, or request the vehicle to pull over, the press statement further added.

Visualisation screens display what the robotaxi is detecting and its intended route in real time, including interactions with traffic lights, pedestrians and surrounding vehicles.

The robotaxi is configured to accommodate up to six passengers and includes luggage capacity aimed at group travel.

Computing capability is delivered through NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor, part of the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform, supporting AI processing for autonomous driving.

Lucid said the on-road trials form part of Nuro’s safety and validation framework, which evaluates multiple functions across the full autonomy stack, including Nuro’s end-to-end AI foundation model.

Nuro co-founder and co-CEO Dave Ferguson added: “The debut of our production-intent robotaxi with Lucid and Uber is a significant milestone on our path to delivering autonomy at scale.”

The programme also incorporates closed-course testing and simulation to assess performance across a wide range of driving scenarios.

Subject to final validation, the companies expect the production-intent robotaxi to enter production later this year at Lucid’s manufacturing facility in Arizona.

Uber Autonomous Mobility & Delivery global head Sarfraz Maredia added: “Uber is proud to partner with Lucid and Nuro to bring a state-of-the-art robotaxi to market later this year.”

In December, Bloomberg News reported the fine would be EUR300 million (USD350 million) to close the investigation, which the Paris financial prosecutor's office has not confirmed.

Contacted by AFP, HSBC declined to comment but referred to a note from its third-quarter earnings statement in October, which cited an EUR300 million provision for an inquiry ""relating to dividend withholdings of certain legacy trading activities"".

The financial prosecutor's office launched in December 2021 inquiries into six large banks, which a source close to the case confirmed as HSBC, Credit Agricole unit Cacib, BNP Paribas and its Exane unit, Societe Generale and Natixis.

In September, Credit Agricole's Cacib was the first to accept a deal with French prosecutors, agreeing to pay EUR88 million .

The fraud is known as ""CumCum"" and involves an investor selling shares to another party just before dividend payment day, to avoid paying taxes, and then immediately repurchasing the shares, with both parties sharing the illicit proceeds.

It was exposed alongside a similar ""Cum-ex"" dividend tax fraud published by the media consortium in 2018.

The amounts involved in the ""Cum-ex"" frauds alone are suspected to have reached 140 billion euros (USD151 billion) over a period of 20 years, the media group said in 2021.

The aim is ""to avoid paying the tax applicable to the payment of this dividend,"" the consortium said.

Banks are suspected of acting as intermediaries in the practice and even charging a commission to the investors taking part.

In December 2022, a German court sentenced lawyer Hanno Berger, believed to be the original mastermind of the scheme, to eight years in prison.

HSBC shares were up 1.1% at 1,220.20 pence in London on Tuesday afternoon.

(HPQ) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","HP Inc. provides personal computing, printing, and other related technologies in the United States and internationally. Formerly known as Hewlett-Packard, the company changed its name in October 2015. It serves small- and medium-sized businesses, the public sector, and large enterprises.

Key challenges remain for HP in 2026 including changes in customer purchasing behavior and industry component availability. A difficult macroeconomic environment and lingering inflationary conditions do not bode well for the company’s outlook.

HP’s forecast for fiscal 2026 PC demand raises concerns regarding its growth prospects in the short-term. Management expects PC unit volumes to fall in the current year. Lower volumes and price pressures would make it harder to protect margins and meet earnings targets.

The computing giant faces stiff competition for its PC and printer businesses. The PC segment competes with the likes of Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and Acer. In the latest quarter, print revenues fell 4% year-over-year as office demand in North America and Europe remained soft. The print segment will likely continue to face structural challenges as customers reduce printing volumes and shift to digital workflows.

The Zacks Rundown

A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, HP HPQ is a component of the Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 14% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.

Stocks in the bottom tiers of industries can often be intriguing short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they’re part of a lagging industry, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.

HPQ shares have been underperforming the market over the past year. The stock is trading near a 52-week low even as the major U.S. indexes hover near all-time highs.

Recent Earnings Misses & Deteriorating Outlook

HP has fallen short of earnings estimates in four of the past six quarters. The technology company posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -2.6%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and HP is no exception.

The company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. Looking at the current fiscal year, analysts have slashed estimates by -9.64% in the past 60 days. The FY2026 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $3.00 per share, reflecting negative growth of -3.9% relative to the prior year.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.

Technical Outlook

As illustrated below, HPQ stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock has shown little in the way of a trend, widely underperforming the major indices. Also note that shares are trading below downward-sloping 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages – another good sign for the bears.

Image Source: StockCharts

HPQ stock has experienced what is known as a “death cross,” whereby the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Shares would have to make an outsized move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions. The stock has fallen more than 30% in the past year alone.

Final Thoughts

A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make its way to new highs anytime soon. The fact that HPQ stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups adds yet another headwind to a long list of concerns.

A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.

Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of HP until the situation shows major signs of improvement.

AI has been major focus of partnership

Mobile app use up 19% during 2025 Championships

Wimbledon has extended its official artificial intelligence (AI), cloud and digital transformation partnership with IBM, prolonging one of the most successful technology partnerships in sport.

The tech giant first teamed up with the All England Club (AELTC) in 1990. In 1995 they launched an official website and the arrangement now encompasses a wide a range of tools and infrastructure designed to support the tennis Grand Slam’s operations, data gathering and fan engagement activities.

This latest ‘multi-year’ renewal will amplify these efforts and extend the relationship well into a fourth decade.

AI has been a particular focus of the two’s efforts in recent years, with intelligent technologies used to automatically clip and package highlights packages for multiple digital platforms, create data-driven insights for fans, and personalise content.

Usama Al-Qassab, marketing and commercial director at the AELTC, told SportsPro AI last year that Wimbledon’s expanded use of AI helped drive mobile app usage by 19 per cent during the 2025 Championships, with the tournament recording a total 19.1 billion engagements across its digital, social and broadcast channels.

“We are delighted to have agreed a multi-year extension to our long-standing partnership with IBM,” said Al-Qassab. “For 35 years, IBM and the All England Club have embraced innovation and created world-leading digital experiences to bring our fans closer to The Championships. As we look to attract the next generation of Wimbledon fans from around the world, the AI-powered capabilities of IBM will be key to ensuring our future digital experiences are relevant, personalised and engaging.”

For IBM, the partnership has provided a high-profile use case and proving ground for its infrastructure, software and intelligent capabilities which are used across multiple industries. Other partners in the sports industry include the US Open and the Masters golf major.

“Our partnership with Wimbledon represents the very best of what a long-term, strategic collaboration can be. It’s rooted in shared values, trust built over time, and a joint commitment to constant innovation,” Jonathan Adashek, SVP, marketing and communications, IBM told SportsPro.

“We’ve set the bar for how sports properties can harness technology to modernise their operations, become more productive and create new loyalties that span generations of fans – all while staying true to their brand heritage.

“The same AI and data platforms we use to enhance the fan experience at Wimbledon are the ones we put into the hands of our clients in industries all across the globe. The partnership becomes a live showcase of how we are applying AI where it meaningfully improves how people experience the event.”

SportsPro says…

Wimbledon’s digital strategy has two clear goals. The first is to use technology to ensure the tournament runs as smoothly as possible, and the second is to engage fans in attendance in SW19 and those watching around the world.

Not everything has gone to plan, as demonstrated by the human error-related mishaps with electronic line calling (ELC) this summer, being evidence of that. But in general, most of its innovation has been successful.

For the past three decades, its partnership with IBM has been crucial to this mission – introducing many cutting-edge technologies and establishing best practices for the industry in the process.

Indeed, the Grand Slam claims its smartphone app was the first to include such detailed live sports data when it launched in 2009 and it was using ‘cognitive computing’ long before AI became the sports technology term de jour.

In many ways, it has been the prototype for the modern sports technology partnership, prioritising genuine technical need over gimmickry and marketing considerations – even if the commercial value of this deal is significant to IBM given the popularity of Wimbledon.

This extension continues one of the most celebrated partnerships in the industry, providing prestige to both parties, and providing plenty of reference cases for the industry to benefit from.

Price transparency and honest communication are now seen as key markers of brand credibility.
One in four consumers used generative AI shopping tools in 2025, and a further 31 per cent plan to adopt them in the future.
Data transparency remains a major concern, with 71 per cent of consumers worried about how generative AI uses personal information.
According to the report, brands that combine speed and personalisation with timely human support are more likely to earn long-term consumer loyalty.","Consumer priorities are shifting in 2026, with fairness emerging as a central element of perceived value, according to a new global consumer trends report from the Capgemini Research Institute. The report, titled What matters to today’s consumer 2026: How AI is transforming value perception, finds that concerns over declining purchasing power and financial uncertainty are prompting consumers to be more deliberate about how they save money and where they choose to spend.

The fifth edition of the annual report shows that consumers are balancing essential spending with intentional indulgences that provide emotional uplift. While many are embracing artificial intelligence to help navigate the marketplace, issues around data control and transparency remain significant, with consumers favouring brands that combine digital convenience with in-person support.

Price transparency and honest communication are now seen as key markers of brand credibility. Nearly three in four consumers (74 per cent) say they would switch brands for a lower regular price, while 71 per cent would do so if pack sizes or quality were reduced without clear notice. A majority of respondents consider shrinkflation to be unfair, with most indicating a preference for a small, clearly communicated price increase rather than discreet downsizing.

The research also finds that around half of consumers are buying smaller quantities and opting for cheaper alternatives to manage their budgets. However, brand trust remains strong in categories where quality and performance are critical. According to the report, 77 per cent of consumers across income groups avoid private labels for products such as electronics and baby care. At the same time, emotional factors continue to influence purchasing decisions, with seven in ten consumers seeking small indulgences to ease financial stress, highlighting that value is both practical and emotional.

“Value today goes beyond price and quality; it’s built on fairness, transparency, and emotional connection. Consumers want invisible AI that both empowers informed decisions and seamlessly blends convenience and emotional connection,” said Dreen Yang, Global Consumer Products & Retail Leader at Capgemini. “AI is increasingly reshaping the shopping experience, but success depends on clarity, responsible use, and safeguards that protect consumers. Brands that blend technology with trust and purpose will enjoy lasting loyalty.”

The report notes that AI is evolving from a functional tool into a trusted shopping advisor. AI now supports consumers by interpreting preferences and behaviours and by offering real-time assistance through chatbots and virtual assistants. One in four consumers used generative AI shopping tools in 2025, and a further 31 per cent plan to adopt them in the future. Despite this growth, only 19 per cent of consumers say they are willing to pay a monthly subscription or one-time fee for chatbots or virtual shopping assistants.

While adoption is increasing, consumers continue to express caution. The majority of shoppers (76 per cent) want the ability to set boundaries for AI assistants, and two-thirds say they trust AI more when it explains the reasoning behind its recommendations and actions. Data transparency remains a major concern, with 71 per cent of consumers worried about how generative AI uses personal information. Two-thirds of consumers also expect brands to disclose when advertising content is AI-generated.

The findings further show that technology alone is not enough to secure loyalty. Consumers want efficiency, relevance, and human connection to coexist. Nearly two-thirds of respondents want generative AI to deliver hyper-personalised content, and 65 per cent say technology has made shopping less stressful. However, more than seven in ten consumers still value human assistance for complex purchases, such as meal planning or resolving service issues. According to the report, brands that combine speed and personalisation with timely human support are more likely to earn long-term consumer loyalty.",https://static.businessworld.in/BW Style Pic (36)_20260106171724_ogImage_48.png,N,,2026-01-06 10:01:31.057267

The Light Straight + Multi-styler is scheduled for global release in 2027, with pricing details to be announced closer to launch.
As with the Light Straight + Multi-styler, pricing and additional specifications will be shared closer to commercial availability.","L’Oréal Groupe has unveiled two new beauty technology innovations that apply infrared light to hair and skin, reinforcing its long-term focus on science-led product development. Introduced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the Light Straight + Multi-styler and the LED Face Mask both received CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree recognition, highlighting their use of advanced light-based technologies to enhance performance while addressing common concerns around hair damage and skin ageing.

The announcement continues L’Oréal’s multi-year push to integrate scientific research, digital capabilities and hardware innovation into consumer beauty products. The company positions these developments as part of its broader ambition to evolve from a traditional beauty brand into a beauty technology leader, using scientific discovery to create more personalised, effective and preventative beauty solutions.

Barbara Lavernos, Deputy CEO in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology at L’Oréal Groupe, said the company’s latest showcase at CES reflects a long-standing belief that beauty and science are closely linked. She noted that L’Oréal continues to combine scientific advances with creativity to design beauty experiences that are both more effective and better adapted to individual needs, building on more than a century of research heritage.

Infrared light redefines heat styling with Light Straight + Multi-styler

The Light Straight + Multi-styler addresses one of the most persistent challenges in hair styling: heat damage. Traditional hair straighteners often reach temperatures of 400°F or higher, exceeding the threshold at which keratin begins to denature. Over time, this can weaken the hair cuticle, lead to breakage and reduce shine. According to a 2024 US consumer study conducted by L’Oréal, 58 percent of women surveyed said their hair damage was caused by heat styling.

Developed by L’Oréal Research and Innovation, the Light Straight + Multi-styler uses patented infrared light technology to deliver styling results at lower temperatures. The device’s glass plates never exceed 320°F, a significant reduction compared to conventional straighteners. Instrumental tests carried out by L’Oréal indicate that the device works three times faster than leading premium hair stylers while leaving hair twice as smooth.

At the core of the device is near-infrared light, which sits just beyond the visible light spectrum. This wavelength penetrates deeply into the hair fibre, reshaping the internal hydrogen bonds that determine hair texture and form. By targeting these bonds directly, the Light Straight + Multi-styler aims to achieve the desired styling effect while preserving the integrity of the hair cuticle, keeping hair smoother, shinier and stronger over time.

Guive Balooch, Global Vice President of Augmented Beauty and Open Innovation at L’Oréal Groupe, described the device as a shift from corrective styling to preventative care. He said limiting cumulative heat exposure from the outset helps protect the natural structure of hair, setting a new standard for precision styling and redefining expectations within the hairstyling category.

Beyond straightening, the Light Straight + Multi-styler is designed as a versatile, multi-function tool. It can also be used to curl hair, offering users greater flexibility without requiring multiple devices. The product incorporates smart internal sensors powered by proprietary algorithms and machine learning, allowing it to adapt to user gestures and deliver more personalised results.

The launch builds on L’Oréal’s earlier introduction of the Airlight Pro hair dryer, first revealed at CES 2024, which also uses infrared light technology. Together, the two devices form a complete infrared-based hairstyling routine focused on minimising damage while maintaining performance. The Light Straight + Multi-styler is scheduled for global release in 2027, with pricing details to be announced closer to launch.

LED Face Mask targets visible ageing with precision light therapy

Alongside its hairstyling innovation, L’Oréal also introduced the development of an LED Face Mask, further expanding its use of light technology into skincare. Currently in prototype form, the ultra-thin mask is made from flexible silicone and is designed to deliver targeted light therapy directly to the face. It was developed in collaboration with iSmart, a specialist in LED device innovation.

The LED Face Mask uses a combination of red light and near-infrared light, which L’Oréal believes will help combat visible signs of ageing, including fine lines, sagging and uneven skin tone. Each session lasts 10 minutes and is automatically timed, allowing the device to fit easily into daily skincare routines without adding complexity.

A key feature of the mask is its transparent support structure, which integrates a skin-safe microcircuit to precisely control light emission. The device delivers two specific wavelengths: red light at 630 nanometres and near-infrared light at 830 nanometres. These wavelengths are selected for their ability to visibly firm and smooth skin while promoting a more even tone, according to L’Oréal’s testing assumptions.

The design prioritises comfort and usability. Its lightweight, non-invasive construction allows it to sit closely against the skin, ensuring consistent light delivery across the face. By focusing on controlled, targeted exposure, L’Oréal aims to maximise visible results while maintaining safety and ease of use.

The LED Face Mask is expected to launch in 2027. In the United States, its release will be subject to the FDA 510(k) premarket notification process. As with the Light Straight + Multi-styler, pricing and additional specifications will be shared closer to commercial availability.

Together, the two CES 2026 showcases underline L’Oréal’s continued investment in longevity science, personalised beauty and device-led innovation. With a global research network spanning 21 centres across 13 countries and thousands of scientists and digital specialists, the group is positioning light-based technology as a core pillar of its future product strategy, extending beyond topical formulations into hardware that reshapes how consumers approach haircare and skincare at home.",https://www.techedt.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LOreal-brings-infrared-light-technology-to-hair-and-skincare-with-two-new-beauty-tech-innovations-at-CES-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 11:03:35.349651

LONDON, Jan. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) and The All England Lawn Tennis Club today announced a multi-year renewal of their long-standing, landmark technology partnership. From the launch of the Wimbledon website in 1995 and the mobile application in 2009, to the first integration of enhanced AI-powered solutions in 2017, IBM and the All England Club have collaborated for 36 years to deepen global fan engagement across Wimbledon's world-class digital platforms.

The successful partnership between IBM and the All England Club has long set the standard for creating engaging fan-facing features that have raised the bar for tech innovation in sport. Building on more than three decades of continuous innovation, the new agreement is focused on initiatives to expand the event's global reach and achieve a deeper fan engagement across Wimbledon's digital ecosystem in 2026 and beyond.

Teams from IBM and the All England Club work together year-round to co-create unique fan experiences – such as Live Likelihood to Win and Match Chat – that combine the significant quantity of data generated during The Championships with the deep AI capabilities of IBM watsonx. In 2025, these efforts contributed to a 16% year-on-year increase in engagement across all platforms, with more than 20 million fans closely following all the grass court action via the app and website. The app alone saw a 19% increase in engagement and received an outstanding average rating of 4.9 stars in app stores.

The partnership has also won multiple awards, including the All England Club being recognised as 'Sports Organisation of the Year' at the 2025 Sports Technology Awards, for the innovative use of AI and technology to transform the Wimbledon fan experience.

""We are delighted to have agreed a multi-year extension to our long-standing partnership with IBM,"" said Usama Al-Qassab, Marketing & Commercial Director, The All England Lawn Tennis Club. ""For 36 years, IBM and the All England Club have embraced innovation and created world-leading digital experiences to bring our fans closer to The Championships. As we look to attract the next generation of Wimbledon fans from around the world, the AI-powered capabilities of IBM will be key to ensuring our future digital experiences are relevant, personalised and engaging.""

""The All England Club is a visionary organisation, delivering one of the most globally recognisable properties in sport and broader culture. We are thrilled to continue working in lockstep as partners to serve up a world-class digital experience, driven by leading edge data and AI technology,"" said Jonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Communications, IBM. ""Whether onsite at SW19 or following from any corner of the globe for years to come, hundreds of millions of tennis fans can rely on having interactive digital features, powered by watsonx, to stay connected to the beauty, drama and excitement of The Championships.""

The FTC sued Instacart for deceptive practices including misleading ""free delivery,"" unclear satisfaction guarantees, undisclosed fees, and unlawful free-trial-to-paid memberships. Instacart has now reached a $60 million settlement to refund hundreds of thousands of consumers and impose future compliance restrictions.

Investigations found that Instacart's algorithmic pricing experiments led to significant price disparities (up to 23% higher for some users), exacerbating consumer frustration amid already high grocery prices and raising concerns about fairness and transparency.

The case reinforces that traditional consumer protection laws apply to AI-enabled markets. While the White House's AI Action Plan promotes innovation and minimal new regulation, it preserves FTC authority to enforce transparency, consent, and fairness in automated systems.

The action highlights a growing divide between consumer advocates, who argue automated and personalized systems can scale consumer harm and require strong enforcement, and industry groups, who warn that aggressive enforcement may chill AI innovation, investment, and competitive experimentation.

FTC's Settlement Action Against Instacart Reinforces Need for AI Systems Regulation

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Instacart for engaging in numerous deceptive tactics against consumers through unclear labels and disclosures, resulting in raised grocery prices and recurring memberships without consent. Instacart has agreed to settle through paying $60 million in refunds to affected customers.

Other internal and external research had already shown how Instacart's AI-driven pricing experiments impacted various family budgets. It was found that some quoted prices to consumers were up to approximately 23% higher than those shown to others, even for the same cart and time.

This AI-powered pricing tool, known as Eversight, allows for retailers to conduct price tests to gauge reactions of consumers and efficiency to higher and lower prices across different categories of items. Instacart's website noted that grocers who use this tool ""see revenue growth of 1 to 3%."" Instacart claimed these tests were randomized and, among other companies utilizing this tool, was scrutinized, emphasizing that ""consumers deserve to know when they are being placed into pricing tests. The FTC should require a prominent on-screen label,"" as stated by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

The practice of dynamic pricing raised concerns and increased consumer frustration with grocery prices already being at significantly higher levels. Reports from several nonprofit consumer advocacy groups found that the prices of items in Instacart baskets varied by an average of 7% across 437 shoppers in four cities testing for the same items at the same stores. Shortly after, the FTC sent Instacart a civil investigative demand for further information on Eversight.

This recent enforcement action against Instacart is an example of how traditional consumer protection principles continue to apply in increasingly automated and technology-driven markets. It reinforces that representations made and marketed to consumers about pricing, fees, or savings must be transparent, regardless of them being generated or influenced by algorithms or other advanced technologies.

The AI Action Plan released by the White House this past summer, while emphasizing the importance of fostering innovation and competition in artificial intelligence, does not carve out exemptions from existing consumer protection laws. It explicitly preserves and reinforces the role of agencies such as the FTC in addressing unfair or deceptive practices involving AI-enabled systems, as we previously covered. The enforcement action is grounded in traditional consumer protection law by addressing false advertising, undisclosed fees, and unfair practices harming shoppers. In contrast, the AI Action Plan leans toward market-friendly AI adoption and minimal federal constraints, leaving Big Tech and startups to consider how AI systems interact with consumer rights.

In the complaint, three components of Instacart's deceptive tactics were highlighted:

""Free Delivery"" Promotion

Instacart often advertised ""free delivery"" to new consumers on their first three orders, insinuating the absence of additional fees. This promotion was alleged to be false, as every order placed for delivery requires additional ""service fees"" to be paid for consumers to get their items delivered. In the complaint, the FTC stated that Instacart misrepresented certain charges by another name, despite functioning the same as delivery fees, whether they were service fees or small order add-ons. Both are related to delivery, with Instacart using them to offset costs.

There was an alleged failure to prominently disclose that service fees may apply, and consumers would only see this upon reaching the checkout screen at the end. Instacart's own internal research found that consumers felt this offer to be a ""bait and switch,"" with many users spending significant time on orders only to be met with hidden fees.

""100% Satisfaction Guarantee"" Protection

Instacart advertises that consumers can receive a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a refund if they are not fully satisfied with their services. This has been alleged to be misleading, as many consumers who were seeking refunds — e.g., for late deliveries — received appeasement in forms of credit that can only be used for future orders instead of original payment. The amount refunded was also almost always less than what the customer originally paid.

Per the written terms of Instacart's guarantee, it is only applicable to the fees paid on the order instead of the total cost. Previously, customers were able to access a self-service interface on Instacart's website and mobile app to report issues with orders and receive refunds without having to contact customer service. In 2022, the refund option was hidden to shift more consumers toward credits rather than refunding to the original form of payment.

Unlawful ""Free Trials"" into Paid Instacart+ Memberships

Instacart has a membership available for purchase, Instacart+, which allows for members to receive $0 delivery fees on orders over $10. Plans include a $99 annual membership and a monthly membership of $9.99 per month. To further entice consumers, Instacart provides several free trials, one specifically taking place for 14 days. Aside from the fine print at the bottom of screens on the mobile platform, there is no specific distinction on the amount that will be charged once the free trial ends, often it being the $99 annual membership.

The fine print ensures consumers that they can ""cancel anytime,"" yet when consumers realize they have been charged for a full membership without their consent and attempt to cancel it, they do not receive refunds despite not having placed any orders after being charged. The FTC asserted that there is no clear distinction of which membership is going to be charged and no consensual way for consumers to agree to continuing their subscription after the trial.

Next Steps for Instacart

Instacart has agreed to pay $60 million in refunds to settle the claims; the funds will be routed into a refund program and distributed to consumers who were charged misleading fees or enrolled in Instacart's recurring membership without clear consent. The FTC has stated that this payout will reach hundreds of thousands of affected customers, representing the wide-scale impact of Instacart's practices over many years.

Additionally, under the FTC's proposed settlement order, Instacart will be prohibited from making future misrepresentations about delivery costs, service fees, and guarantees per refunds, and will no longer be able to automatically enroll customers in paid memberships unless they opt in. Instacart has also been asked to bar its pricing tools driven by AI and various algorithms to ensure customers see accurate totals ""at a time when families are working hard to stretch their grocery budgets.""

Future Moves for Tech Companies and Consumer Protection

Consumer advocacy groups support the FTC's action, arguing that it demonstrates the continued relevance of traditional consumer protection laws as AI is developed. They emphasize that AI-enabled systems can increase harm at scale as well as the need for enforcement when deceptive practices are automated or personalized, signifying that companies must proactively audit AI tools for consumer harm to prevent such risks.

In contrast, several industry stakeholders and innovation-focused policy groups warn that aggressive enforcement could slow AI adoption and experimentation. An editorial in the Wall Street Journal and other pro-market commentators argue that algorithmic pricing tests and personalized user experiences are tools that can increase efficiency and consumer choice if properly deployed. They prefer federal guidance over enforcement-driven regulation surrounding AI compliance, with concerns that over-regulation may deter investment and disadvantage US companies in global competition.

Legal and policy experts argue that while the White House's AI Action Plan emphasizes deregulation and national competitiveness, it does not preempt agencies like the FTC from applying established statutes to AI-enabled conduct. The Tech Policy Press stated that it ""stifles local initiatives to uphold civil rights and shield communities from biased AI systems."" Companies are often then faced with dual options of fewer AI-specific rules but continued exposure to enforcement under general consumer protection standards.

Ultimately, the FTC's settlement order of Instacart highlights the unresolved tension at the center of AI governance and how best to encourage innovation and efficiency without eroding basic consumer protections. As pro-market voices caution that aggressive enforcement can impact beneficial experimentation, the FTC's action affirms that automation does not absolve companies of transparency, consent, or fairness obligations.

Real talk: is A stock a game-changer or just background noise in your portfolio?

The internet is sleeping on Agilent Technologies Inc – but should you? While everyone chases the next meme coin or AI rocket, this lab-tech heavyweight is quietly powering pharma, biotech, semis, and more. Real talk: is A stock actually worth your money, or just boomer science vibes?

We pulled fresh market data, checked multiple finance sources, and scanned the social feeds so you do not have to. Here is what is really going on with Agilent right now.

Stock data check: Based on live data pulled on 2026-01-05 around 20:00 UTC, Agilent Technologies Inc (ticker: A) was trading near the mid 140s in USD, with a market cap hovering in the tens of billions. Figures were cross-checked using at least two major finance platforms. If markets are closed when you read this, treat that as a last known zone, not a current quote.

The Hype is Real: Agilent Technologies Inc on TikTok and Beyond

Agilent is not some flashy consumer gadget brand, so you will not see unboxing videos every five seconds. But zoom in on nerd-Tok, biotech-Tok, and finance creators, and you start seeing a pattern: people who know what this company actually does are taking it seriously.

Think of Agilent as the backstage crew for the entire science show. Their instruments and software help drug makers test new meds, chip producers measure microscopic defects, and labs everywhere keep their data clean and legit. It is not viral on its own – but everything viral in health and tech kind of runs through companies like this.

Social clout right now is more “respect” than “hype-beast”. You are not getting the explosive virality of the latest AI darling, but there is a steady stream of analysts, engineers, and lab creators calling Agilent a “must-have backbone” for serious research and production.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So, is Agilent Technologies Inc a game-changer or a total flop for your portfolio? Let us break it down into three key angles you actually care about.

1. The Business Model: Picks-and-Shovels to Science

Agilent sells the stuff everyone else needs to do the cool things. Instruments, diagnostics, software, lab tools. Instead of trying to guess which single drug, chip, or therapy wins, Agilent gets paid by the companies fighting those battles.

This “picks-and-shovels” vibe means: when biotech, semis, and advanced materials are booming, Agilent can quietly ride multiple waves at once. It is less about going viral and more about being impossible to skip in high-end labs.

2. Price Performance: Is It Worth the Hype?

Recent share price action for A has lived in that classic quality-stock pattern: pullbacks when the market panics about rates or funding for biotech, followed by slow, stubborn comebacks when earnings show the underlying demand is still there.

Here is the real talk: this is not a lottery ticket. You are paying up for quality, stability, and long-term relevance. The valuation is usually not dirt cheap, but dips and corrections can turn it into a no-brainer for long-term holders who are fine skipping the day-trading drama.

If you are chasing a quick viral spike, this probably is not it. If you are cool stacking a science-backed, cash-generating name and letting time cook, it starts to look a lot more attractive.

3. Risk Level: Boring or Beautiful?

Agilent’s risk is more about macro and sector cycles than the company suddenly vanishing. If funding for pharma, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing slows down, lab budgets get tight and orders can slip. That is when the stock usually feels heavy.

But when innovation spending ramps back up – new drugs, new chips, new testing needs – companies like Agilent often quietly rebound. It is less roller coaster, more long, bumpy upward hike.

So is it worth the hype? If your hype is defined as stable growth, science exposure, and compounding… then yes. If your hype means moonshot overnight, then not really.

Agilent Technologies Inc vs. The Competition

No stock lives in a vacuum, and Agilent has some serious rivals in the high-end lab-tech game. Think Thermo Fisher, Danaher, Waters, and a few other heavy-hitters.

Main Rival Spotlight: Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)

Thermo Fisher is the big boss in this space – massive scale, deep product lines, huge reputation. When investors want “lab-tech blue chip,” TMO is often their first thought.

Clout War:

Thermo Fisher wins on name recognition and sheer size. Agilent wins on being a bit more focused, slightly more agile, and heavily tied to precision instruments and analytics that labs obsessed with data quality love.

Innovation Energy:

Both companies pour cash into R&D, but Agilent’s edge shows up in specialized analytical tools, chromatography, mass spec, and lab software that power serious research workflows. In the nerd corners of Reddit and professional forums, you will see real debates about whose instruments people prefer – and Agilent regularly gets love for usability and reliability.

Who Wins?

If you want the mega-conglomerate, all-in-one lab empire, Thermo Fisher probably wins. If you want a leaner, more instrument-and-analytics-focused play with strong margins and a bit more under-the-radar upside, Agilent has serious appeal.

From a clout angle, Thermo is the mainstream headliner. Agilent is the cult-favorite artist with a loyal fanbase. And sometimes, that cult favorite has the better performance upside when the crowd finally catches on.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So where do we land on Agilent Technologies Inc as an investment and as a hype play?

Social Sentiment: Not viral in the TikTok-sense, but strong respect among pros, finance creators, and science channels. This is more “must-have infrastructure” than “trending toy.”

Game-Changer Level: For your daily life? You might never touch an Agilent product. For the labs building the future of medicine, chips, and materials? Huge. Their tech is core to how experiments get done and verified.

Price Drop Potential: When the macro mood turns risk-off or funding fears hit biotech and semis, Agilent can see pullbacks. Those dips are when long-term investors quietly start circling.

Real Talk Verdict:

If you want fast thrills: probably a drop.

If you want a long-term, quality, science-backed name that benefits from multiple innovation trends without having to pick one winner: strong cop, especially on weakness.

This is the opposite of a meme stock: slow, serious, compounder energy. If that fits your strategy, Agilent deserves a hard look.

Recent trading action has the stock sitting in that mid-to-upper quality range: not penny stock cheap, not mega-cap stretched, but very much in the lane of a mature, profitable science company that the market already respects.

Analysts generally frame Agilent as a steady compounder rather than a moon mission. Revenue streams are spread across multiple end markets – pharma and biotech, diagnostics, chemicals, environment, and advanced manufacturing. That mix gives the business some defense when one vertical slows down.

On the fundamentals side, investors usually highlight:

Healthy margins for a hardware-plus-software business.

Recurring revenue from consumables, services, and software – not just one-off instrument sales.

Solid balance sheet vibes compared with more speculative tech names.

For US-based investors, A is a classic “own a slice of the lab infrastructure” move. You are not betting on one pill, one chip design, or one hot AI app – you are backing the toolbox companies use to build and test all of that.

If you are building a portfolio around themes like healthcare innovation, semiconductor quality, clean tech, or advanced materials, Agilent deserves a seat at the table. It might not trend on your FYP, but it could quietly trend in your portfolio statement over the long haul.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405030_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:03:09.977101

In Mexico, Walmart’s Cashi already had scale. What it needed next was the kind of regulated payments infrastructure that cannot be built overnight. Rather than rely on a global incumbent, Walmart acquired Trafalgar Asset Management’s (TAM) fintech arm, Trafalgar Digital, and used it to strengthen Cashi’s financial stack.

Among the firms building regulated, tech-first financial platforms in Mexico, TAM stands out.

In recent years, TAM has expanded beyond traditional investment activity to build infrastructure, governance and data capabilities that translate into practical financial services.

Through disciplined partnerships and incremental capability builds, rather than rapid feature sprawl, TAM has helped widen access to modern financial services while keeping governance front and centre.

A platform built for SMEs and regulation

The investor group, steered by Porfirio Sánchez-Talavera, has built a platform approach anchored in regulated infrastructure and scalable technology.

Across TAM’s fintech arm (Trafalgar Digital) and neobanking arm (Trafalgar SFP), the group applies AI, data analytics and automation to improve decisioning and customer experience, without compromising human oversight and regulatory discipline.

Trafalgar’s initiative to enhance its capabilities was undertaken with a particular demographic in mind.

Rather than casting a wide net, the firm focused on building infrastructure tailored to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

SMEs often face higher friction as slower underwriting, limited product fit and higher cost of capital, makes speed, data quality and governance decisive.

From local infrastructure to scalable impact

This specialisation enabled the group to pursue licensing and supervision with Mexico’s banking and securities regulator (CNBV).

The groundwork supported the launch of Trafalgar SFP as a SOFIPO, broadening the group’s ability to serve SMEs by providing access to formal credit and long-term growth pathways.

That strategy paid off. In April 2023, Walmart acquired Trafalgar Digital, integrating a regulated platform into Cashi’s fintech strategy and accelerating services such as real-time SPEI transfers.

By October 2025, Trafalgar SFP began operating as an authorised SOFIPO.

Trafalgar’s trajectory acts as a blueprint for scaling financial services through modern infrastructure and regulatory discipline, a model recognised in 2025 with shortlisting in two Banking Tech Awards categories, including Best Use of Tech in SME Banking.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8027e75518bb8aed5a1cb0b654ba0d11:9cce214811bf409d2e01de4528228ee2/trafalgar-building.jpeg.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 09:02:22.056435

In accordance with TORM plc's articles of association (""Articles""), the Board of Directors has today determined that the threshold date defined in the Articles (being the first time at which Oaktree and its affiliates have ceased to beneficially own at least one third of the issued shares, excluding any shares held in treasury) has occurred and is therefore set at today.

Shares of tax preparation company H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) jumped 3% in the afternoon session after investors wagered geopolitical tension would be contained following the U.S. military's operation in Venezuela, with the Dow hitting a fresh record.

Sentiment remained firmly ""risk-on"" for early 2026, with Wall Street prioritizing domestic economic strength over foreign turbulence. Analysts noted that while the event raises short-term supply questions, the market largely viewed the potential stabilization of Venezuela's vast oil reserves as a long-term economic positive.

The shares closed the day at $43.71, up 2.6% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us

H&R Block’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 5 months ago when the stock dropped 6% on the news that the company reported mixed second-quarter results, as an earnings miss and weaker-than-expected guidance for the upcoming fiscal year overshadowed a slight revenue beat.

The tax preparation company posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, well below analyst expectations of $2.83. Although revenue came in slightly ahead of forecasts at $1.11 billion, the focus remained on profitability. The earnings miss was partly due to a one-time tax benefit of $0.50 per share being pushed to the next quarter. Looking ahead, H &R Block's earnings forecast for fiscal 2026 of $4.85 to $5.00 per share also fell short of consensus estimates.

H&R Block is up 2.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $43.71 per share, it is still trading 30.7% below its 52-week high of $63.04 from April 2025.

In Las Vegas on Monday, the ride-hailing company announced that it was developing a driverless robotaxi prototype with EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle company Nuro.

While not as futuristic as Tesla’s Cybercab concept or Amazon’s Zoox, which has no steering wheel, the still unnamed Uber-designed version of Lucid’s Gravity EV is expected to arrive in the San Francisco Bay Area at some point this year. It’ll join Waymo and Zoox robotaxis already on the road there. The companies said that on-road testing started at the end of last year, which isn’t surprising as Nuro already holds driverless testing permits through the California DMV. In fact, Nuro-branded autonomous vehicles started popping up on San Francisco streets last month.

Eventually, the trio plan to offer the Level 4 robotaxi prototype everywhere Uber has a presence — if all goes well, that is.

Monday’s big announcement provided us with the first look at what the prototype, which at its core is a repurposed Lucid Gravity, could look like. At first glance, the prototype takes advantage of Nuro’s autonomous last-mile delivery know-how and Nvidia’s Drive Hyperion platform for real-time AI processing.

The passenger experience is indeed a combination of all the companies involved in this robotaxi project. Inside it looks like the Gravity, which seats up to six adults and has a large hatchback trunk for luggage, but has some robotaxi hallmarks like touchscreens, which allow you to customize the ride and control the interior climate, activate heated seats, and set music choices. In terms of support, the car features an autonomous vehicle customer support button and emergency stop setting.

In addition, the screens show passengers what the robotaxi sees on the road—similar to the way Waymo shows pedestrians, traffic signals, and other cars—all in real-time.

Less noticeable is the prototype’s sensor suite, which includes high-res cameras, solid-state LiDAR sensors, and radars. The sensors are built into the Gravity exterior and more visible on the roof, where it looks like a roof rack is riding on top of the Gravity.

Lights on this roof rack sensor unit will light up with different colors, display passenger initials (just like Waymo), and provide status updates, the companies said.

Missing from the announcement was more information about how customers could hail one of these robotaxis or get access to the cars once they start production. If I had to bet, I imagine that everything will be tied into the existing Uber app.

The robotaxi prototype is expected to be built at Lucid’s Arizona factory at some point later this year. Of course, it’ll have to pass autonomous validation benchmarks first before being deployed.

With Monday’s announcement, Uber’s efforts (and notorious failures) to take on autonomous driving on its own are officially gone.

ID38,Ralph Lauren,2026-01-06 11:03:15+00:00,Modern Retail,Why the AI shopping agent wars will heat up in 2026 - Modern Retail,Allison Smith,,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/technology/why-the-ai-shopping-agent-wars-will-heat-up-in-2026/,"But throughout 2025, new AI shopping agents sprouted left and right.
Alongside the big tech players, a wave of niche AI shopping startups emerged in 2025.
To win the AI agent shopping race, platforms will need to win over customers.
For those reasons, AI shopping startups with a specialized focus like Daydream may have a competitive edge against more mainstream AI tools heading into 2026.
Ultimately, the biggest hurdle facing any AI agent will be consumer adoption, according to Swap’s Pellerano-Rendón.","That dilemma is what led Bornstein to create Daydream, an AI-powered shopping platform focused on fashion. Daydream, which is still in beta, launched in June, a year after the company announced $50 million in seed funding. The platform lets users describe what they’re looking for in conversational language — or by uploading a photo — and receive personalized product recommendations in response.

Daydream is one of a growing number of tech startups, retailers and brands racing to hand off parts of the shopping journey to AI-powered agents — tools designed to research, recommend and, in some cases, buy products on a consumer’s behalf. In 2025, nearly every major retailer or AI incumbent entered the race for “agentic” commerce. Amazon expanded its Rufus shopping assistant with a new automatic-buying feature; OpenAI embedded checkout directly into ChatGPT; and Perplexity rolled out an AI-powered browser that prompted legal pushback from Amazon over how it accessed its site.

If 2025 was the year that companies laid the groundwork for agentic commerce, then 2026 will be the year retailers, tech giants and startups jockey to determine whose AI agent becomes the default interface for shopping — if consumers even adopt these AI agents en masse at all.

“We’re pre–Sputnik launch phase,” said Juan Pellerano-Rendón, chief marketing officer at e-commerce software startup Swap, which launched a new platform in September that creates AI shopping agents for brands to offer on their sites. “Everyone is building the spaceship, but no one has really launched it yet.”

Winning the buy box

Perplexity got a head start in the agentic shopping race when it unveiled an AI shopping agent for its U.S. subscribers in November 2024 that lets paying users research and buy products directly within Perplexity’s app or website.

But throughout 2025, new AI shopping agents sprouted left and right. Since September, OpenAI has announced several deals with major retailers — the latest partners include Target, Instacart and DoorDash — to let shoppers buy from their platforms directly within ChatGPT. Amazon released an agentic tool called “Buy For Me” that lets consumers shop other brands’ and retailers’ websites without leaving Amazon’s app. Even brands, including luxury players like Ralph Lauren, are launching their own AI-powered shopping assistants.

Alongside the big tech players, a wave of niche AI shopping startups emerged in 2025. New apps like Phia, a price-comparison platform co-founded by Phoebe Gates, and OneOff, which recommends products based on celebrity and creator looks, are targeting specific shopping use cases rather than trying to do everything at once. Even as these startups face competition from AI giants like OpenAI, investor interest remains strong. Phia, for instance, raised $8 million in September.

It’s still early days, and for the time being, shopping only accounts for a fraction of overall AI use. According to a working paper authored by OpenAI’s Economic Research team and a Harvard economist, around 2% of all ChatGPT queries are shopping-related — things like “recommend a laptop under $1,000” and “how much are running shoes.” Still, that comes to around 50 million shopping queries daily. Even a sliver of that activity could translate into enormous volume at scale.

The allure of agentic shopping is easy to understand. Online shopping has become overwhelming, with millions of products spread across multiple retailers, marketplaces and DTC sites, plus endless filters, ads and reviews to sort through. An AI agent, in theory, promises a shortcut: Instead of clicking around, shoppers can describe what they’re looking for in a sentence or two and get a short list of options that fit their needs. The idea is that the agent handles the busywork — weighing price, availability and quality — so shoppers can move more quickly toward a purchase.

To win the AI agent shopping race, platforms will need to win over customers. To some extent, that may give companies like OpenAI and Amazon an advantage because they can introduce agentic commerce features inside products consumers already use habitually. OpenAI announced in October that ChatGPT has reached 800 million weekly active users, up from 500 million in March. Meanwhile, Amazon captures 40% of all U.S. e-commerce spending, and 90% of its shoppers begin their searches directly on Amazon.com.

Scot Wingo, author of the Substack Retailgentic and founder of ReFiBuy, a company that helps brands and retailers optimize for agentic AI, said the quality of agents’ product recommendations will ultimately determine which platforms gain consumer trust. “GenAI knows far more about the shopper than Google ever did; the job now is to expand and contextualize the product catalog so the engine can map that shopper context to the right SKU,” he said. “There’s a big gap between tight, keywordy product catalogs and the context GenAI needs.”

In other words, shopping agents are only as good as the data they can access — and that’s where things get complicated. To make accurate recommendations, agents need more granular and standardized information — not just basic attributes, but detailed descriptions of fit, quality, durability, shipping timelines and inventory status. For decades, merchants have structured their product catalogs around search engine optimization, designed to match short, keyword-based queries rather than long, descriptive requests.

Shoppers now give AI agents far more context — dozens of words about who they are, how they’ll use a product and what they prefer — but most product catalogs were never built to absorb or respond to that level of detail. Closing that gap would require brands to add far richer context to every product, a labor-intensive process that goes well beyond basic fields like price or size. And some of the information agents would need is considered proprietary, so some merchants may be reluctant to share it with third-party AI platforms.

“Even if these agents don’t bother with the transaction and just offer themselves up as an alternative to Google search, there is still a lot of creating new information in new formats for each product that every merchant will need to do,” said Sucharita Kodali, a principal analyst at Forrester. “There will no doubt be holdouts.”

That tension is already shaping how the agentic shopping market is developing. Unlike many other retailers that have inked partnerships with third-party AI companies like OpenAI, Amazon has blocked off its site from outside agents. The move was likely intended to protect its $56 billion advertising business, which depends on shoppers browsing Amazon’s site, Modern Retail previously reported. Earlier this year, Amazon sued Perplexity, arguing that the AI startup improperly accessed its site, a legal fight that underscored how high the stakes have become as platforms jockey to control the future of AI-driven commerce.

But while the rise of AI shopping agents from ChatGPT to Daydream challenges Amazon, the e-commerce giant doesn’t need to worry about its retail empire being upended just yet, according to Kodali. That’s because Amazon already has stored payment credentials, consumer trust and habitual usage. In a July survey of 700 consumers conducted by Forrester, only about a third said they would be willing to complete payment through an answer engine at all, citing data privacy concerns.

To gain traction with consumers, and compete with the likes of Amazon, AI companies like OpenAI “need to get shoppers on board and convince them that it’s better to buy on ChatGPT than on a retailer’s website, which usually a third party can only do if the assortment is bigger or if the products are cheaper,” Kodali said. “So long as Amazon is a player in e-commerce, I don’t see ChatGPT ever winning the buy box over Amazon.”

Not the finish line

Building an AI agent specifically for shopping is no easy feat. Users shop with nuanced, conversational requests — “a dress for a wedding in Paris in the fall,” for example — which involve interpreting multiple factors — occasion, seasonality, location, style, color, fabric, price point and more, sometimes in a single query, Bornstein said. Standard LLMs struggle to reliably extract all pertinent details at once, often omitting or misinterpreting elements.

Indeed, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy recently told analysts that most AI shopping agents fail to provide a satisfactory customer experience. He said most lack personalization and often provide inaccurate pricing and delivery estimates. “We’ve got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange of value,” he said in October. Bloomberg reported that product recommendations from Amazon’s Rufus, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Walmart’s Sparky elicited fairly generic results when asked what to buy mom for Christmas.

Rather than relying on keyword searches or static filters, Daydream uses multiple AI models to interpret factors like occasion, seasonality and personal style. For those reasons, AI shopping startups with a specialized focus like Daydream may have a competitive edge against more mainstream AI tools heading into 2026. Bornstein declined to share revenue figures, but she said the platform’s catalog includes nearly 2 million products spanning more than 8,000 brands.

Ultimately, the biggest hurdle facing any AI agent will be consumer adoption, according to Swap’s Pellerano-Rendón. “There’s no innovation without utility,” he said, arguing that agents won’t improve unless consumers see enough value to keep using them. Right now, he said, the industry is stuck in a “chicken or egg phase,” where “the agent needs to get better, but also the consumers need to use it for it to get better.” Until shoppers consistently experience moments where an agent truly understands what they want — what he described as a “needle in the haystack feeling” — adoption will remain slow. “We’re still super, super early days, in terms of how people are using agents to shop,” he said.

Bornstein agreed.

“It’s going to take longer to perfect these experiences than anyone thinks,” she said. “It will happen, but 2026 will be a step along the way, not the finish line.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/12/Agentic-AI-.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:04:14.544435

The S&P Global UK services PMI business activity index edged higher to 51.4 points in December from 51.3 in November, but underperformed against the flash reading of 52.1.

The reading remained above the neutral 50-point mark separating growth from contraction, and indicated a rise in business activity for the eighth successive month.

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK composite PMI output index, a blend of the service and manufacturing sector readings, rose to 51.4 points in December from 51.2 in November to remain in expansion territory for the eight month in a row. However, it missed the flash estimate of 52.1 points.

""Lacklustre business activity growth continued across the UK service sector at the end of 2025,"" commented Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Moreover, the speed of expansion was softer than signalled by the earlier 'flash' survey in December and lower than seen on average in the second half of the year.""

He added that survey respondents ""noted sales headwinds linked to weak UK economic prospects, alongside challenging operating conditions due to factors such as sharply rising business costs and soft demand in major overseas markets.""

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 50.6 points in December from 50.2 in November, marking a 15-month high and remaining above the 50.0-point threshold.

The final reading was, however, below the earlier flash estimate of 51.2 points published in mid-December.

Like Mr. Lander, Mr. Goldman supports Mr. Mamdani’s proposals to provide universal, government-funded child care; to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers; and to create a new department of community safety to shift some responsibility from the Police Department.
(Mr. Goldman says he wrote in State Senator Zellnor Myrie’s name on Election Day.)
Many are now backing Mr. Lander, who raised his profile while running in the Democratic primary for mayor last year.
Like Mr. Goldman, Mr. Lander is Jewish and considers himself a Zionist.","In another district or another time, Representative Daniel Goldman of New York City would probably coast to re-election for his safely Democratic seat.

He is a well-spoken former prosecutor with liberal bona fides and a vast personal fortune. He won plaudits as the House’s chief investigator during President Trump’s first impeachment, and could reprise that role if Democrats take back the chamber.

But as he formally begins his campaign for a third term on Tuesday, Mr. Goldman, 49, is instead girding for the fight of his political life as he faces a primary challenge from Brad Lander, a popular former city official.

These are not easy times to be a Democratic incumbent, after all. With Mr. Trump upending Washington and rattling the world order, the party’s voters are actively reconsidering how their leaders should fight back and what they should stand for on issues including the economy and Gaza.

Mr. Lander, 56, has spent weeks contending that Mr. Goldman’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza has defied the residents of his Brooklyn and Manhattan district, and that his lawyerly approach is too timid for the moment. The challenger has the backing of the city’s politically powerful new mayor, Zohran Mamdani.

Now, Mr. Goldman is ready to have his say.

He will declare his candidacy on Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with a video highlighting his successes constraining Mr. Trump in court and Congress and his support for left-leaning policies like Medicare for All and a tax hike on the wealthy.

In an expansive interview over lunch at a diner in Manhattan’s Chinatown, Mr. Goldman pointed to a successful lawsuit he helped bring that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to grant members of Congress access to immigration holding cells as proof of concept.

“My approach to the job is to get results,” he said, “not revolutions.”

Mr. Goldman took swipes at Mr. Lander, arguing that his rival was only running for Congress as a fallback after Mr. Mamdani did not hire him for his administration. (Mr. Lander has rejected that suggestion.)

The congressman also questioned whether the activist tactics Mr. Lander had embraced — he was arrested last June at the immigration courthouse at 26 Federal Plaza while trying to escort a migrant facing detention — were actually effective.

“Civil disobedience is a very valid and important way to protest,” he said. “But I don’t know whether a single person has benefited from that other than perhaps Brad Lander, because he gets a lot of attention for it.”

And Mr. Goldman said he had resigned himself to the fact that his support for Israel, which he called central to his faith and his worldview, could come at a political cost as polls show Democratic opinions moving against the American ally after years of war.

“I understood that ran the risk of engendering a primary,” he said. But, he added that he had tried to make decisions around the conflict based on “what I genuinely thought was best for the state of Israel, the people of Israel, Palestinian civilians and the future state of Palestine.”

But the race between Mr. Goldman and Mr. Lander in New York’s 10th District may be among the highest wattage.

Connecting Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn, the district leans clearly to the left and voted decisively for Mr. Mamdani in November. It includes Wall Street, two Chinatowns, liberal affluent neighborhoods of brownstone Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish community of Borough Park.

Mr. Goldman, a Levi Strauss heir with little background in city politics, narrowly won the seat in 2022, when he spent nearly $5 million of his own money and progressive support fractured among three other candidates.

Since then, he has had one of the most liberal voting records in Congress. Like Mr. Lander, Mr. Goldman supports Mr. Mamdani’s proposals to provide universal, government-funded child care; to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers; and to create a new department of community safety to shift some responsibility from the Police Department.

His work on immigration has not been limited to court. He has turned his Lower Manhattan office, which sits just across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, into a triage center to help connect families of migrants who are detained with social and legal services.

“There are folks who believe that because of my presence there, far fewer arrests are made,” he said.

But progressives have always been wary of Mr. Goldman — of his wealth, his relatively shallow ties to community groups and, above all in recent years, his positions on Israel and the war in Gaza.

Mr. Goldman has repeatedly voted to send American military aid to Israel, and he declined to endorse Mr. Mamdani over concerns about his sharp criticism of the country. (Mr. Goldman says he wrote in State Senator Zellnor Myrie’s name on Election Day.)

Progressives were particularly upset when, not long after the war began, Mr. Goldman voted to censure Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, for her statements relating to it.

Many are now backing Mr. Lander, who raised his profile while running in the Democratic primary for mayor last year. Like Mr. Goldman, Mr. Lander is Jewish and considers himself a Zionist.

But he has moved leftward with his party’s base, supporting putting conditions on certain U.S. military aid to Israel and blocking the transfer of bombs and other heavy weapons outright. More than two years after the war began, he started calling Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide, a position few other Jewish elected officials have taken.

Among Mr. Lander’s supporters is Assemblyman Robert Carroll, a Brooklyn Democrat who endorsed Mr. Goldman in 2022, and now calls that decision “one of the poorest choices I made.”

“He did not just turn a cold shoulder on his constituents,” Mr. Carroll said recently. “He told his constituents he knew better.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06met-goldman-01-wjmk/06met-goldman-01-wjmk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:58:46.658101

Other city and state officials implemented bag-related policies on January 1.

Montgomery County’s Bring Your Own Bag law came into force on New Year’s Day.

Shoppers in the Maryland county are now charged 10 cents per paper bag.

Grocery stores are no longer providing plastic bags to shoppers at the checkout.

Shoppers are encouraged to use reusable bags.

Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group Inc. maintained its lead in net premiums written (NPW), holding the position for the 11th consecutive year with $308.8 billion, up 6.2% in 2024.

Allianz SE, which had led the nonbanking assets ranking for five straight years, dropped to second place despite a 6.2% rise in assets to $1.09 trillion. The rest of the top five remained unchanged, with China Life Insurance (Group) Co., Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd., and Prudential Financial Inc. ranking third through fifth.

AM Best compiled the rankings using BestLink data and additional research, published in the January 2026 issue of Best’s Review. Analysts said Berkshire Hathaway’s rise in asset rankings reflects the growing scale and diversification of large multinational insurers, which may increase competitive pressure on smaller or regional carriers.

UnitedHealth’s continued dominance in premiums highlights the ongoing concentration of the US health insurance market, which could influence pricing and product strategies globally. Additionally, the combination of strong asset bases and premium growth among the top insurers may allow them to expand into new markets or invest in emerging risks such as cyber, climate, and specialty insurance lines.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/023/0382_639032863710129491.png,N,,2026-01-06 09:02:09.666162

Huang has already described robotics — including autonomous vehicles — as Nvidia’s second-most important growth category after AI itself.
GPUs, CPUs, networking, and storage, all designed together to handle the immense (and environment-altering) compute demands of modern AI models at data center scale.","It’s hard to say whether Nvidia has ever truly been subtle with its announcements. At last year’s CES, CEO and founder Jensen Huang stunned the industry with the debut of the GeForce RTX 50 series alongside Nvidia Cosmos, its ambitious world-model initiative. This year’s show was more restrained on the consumer GPU front, but the message to CES 2026 attendees was still unmistakable: Nvidia wants it all.

""All"" isn't hyperbole. Nvidia is now the first company ever to surpass a $5 trillion valuation — an almost inconceivable figure — and Huang and company show no signs of slowing down. The company’s ambitions now span factories, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and nearly any domain that can be trained, tested, or perfected in simulation before ever touching the real world. If something can be modeled, Nvidia wants to power it.

Nvidia’s real obsession is physical AI

The biggest buzzword of the night was “physical AI,” Nvidia’s term for AI systems that don’t just generate content but actually act. These models are trained in virtual environments using synthetic data, then deployed into physical machines once they’ve learned how the world works.

Huang showcased Cosmos, a world foundation model capable of simulating environments and predicting movement, alongside Alpamayo, a reasoning model specifically designed for autonomous driving. This is the tech Nvidia says will power robots, industrial automation, and self-driving vehicles, as demonstrated by the Mercedes-Benz CLA, which was shown running AI-defined driving on stage. The company also revealed plans to test its own robotaxi service with a partner as soon as 2027, using Level 4 autonomous vehicles capable of driving without human intervention in limited regions.

Nvidia hasn’t announced where the service will launch or with whom it’s partnering, but the move signals a shift from being a behind-the-scenes supplier to actively participating in the self-driving race. Huang has already described robotics — including autonomous vehicles — as Nvidia’s second-most important growth category after AI itself.

No New GPUs

If you were waiting for new consumer GPUs, you probably noticed very quickly that there weren’t any. Nvidia didn’t announce a single new GeForce card, and that felt entirely intentional. Instead, Huang spent most of the keynote talking about Rubin, Nvidia’s next-generation AI platform that’s already in full production.

Rubin is described as more than just a chip, but an entire system. GPUs, CPUs, networking, and storage, all designed together to handle the immense (and environment-altering) compute demands of modern AI models at data center scale. Nvidia framed this as essential to keeping up with skyrocketing AI demand, where training costs, energy use, and bottlenecks are becoming existential problems.

The absence of gaming hardware shouldn't be considered a snub, but it is clear that Nvidia is no longer driven by gamers. It's kind of been clear that's been the case for a while, but today's conference really drove the nail in the coffin. Instead, the company's ambitions are driven by hyperscalers, governments, and anyone trying to automate everything that moves.

'Open' AI, powered by Nvidia hardware

The third major takeaway was Nvidia’s ongoing push to make itself unavoidable through openness — or at least Nvidia’s version of it. Huang repeatedly emphasized that the company isn’t just selling hardware, but open AI models that developers can actually use, fine-tune, and deploy (not to be confused with ChatGPT developer OpenAI). Nvidia now has open models spanning healthcare, climate science, robotics, embodied intelligence, reasoning AI, and autonomous driving, all trained on Nvidia supercomputers and released as foundational building blocks. They've practically become the corn of tech.

Even personal AI agents got some stage time, with demos of local agents running on Nvidia’s DGX Spark hardware. Nvidia aims to be the platform beneath every AI system, from massive data centers to individual desktops. It’s an elegant strategy — sell openness, but still own the pipes.

Taken together, the keynote felt like a declaration. Nvidia isn’t chasing CES hype cycles any more. It’s positioning itself as the backbone of an AI-powered world, where the most important announcements don’t happen on stage, and the most impactful products aren’t meant to fit under your desk.",https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06Xo82tWDIYCfuZRGSYuhmu/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1767660808.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:01:04.830607

HP updates its commercial laptop lineup with EliteBook X G2 Those looking for a more traditional portable computer will find options in HP's new lineup of EliteBook X G2 laptops.
The EliteBook X G2i features Intel's upcoming ""Panther Lake,"" Core Ultra 5, and Ultra 7 series processors, while the EliteBook X G2q (Q for Qualcomm) is powered by Snapdragon X2 Elite or X Plus processors, and the EliteBook X G2a (A for AMD) runs AMD Ryzen AI 5, 7, or 9 chips.
You can power the EliteBook X G2 with an included 65 W or 100 W power adapter (your choice).
In the case of the EliteBook X G2q, the modem comes from Qualcomm, while the AMD and Intel versions have HP R15 or R18 5G connectivity.","At most businesses today, the IT department gives laptops out to employees so they can easily take their work with them. But HP has a different idea: build a Windows computer into a full-size keyboard and let you carry that around, plugging into monitors and mice along the way.

Announced on Monday at CES 2026, the HP EliteBoard G1a looks like a standard desktop keyboard, complete with 93 keys, including a number pad. Its keys have a solid 2 mm of travel, more than most laptops, and felt OK to type on during our brief hands-on, but it's not mechanical so isn't the best keyboard money can buy. However, look at the back surface and you'll notice a small vent where air comes out and either two USB-C ports, or, on some SKus, a single port with a built-in USB-C cable that hangs off it like a tail.

The idea is that you plug the EliteBoard G1a into a monitor that has USB-C video input and allow it to send data and get power over a single wire. Connect a wireless mouse and you've got your workstation covered. Maintain a similar monitor and mouse setup at home and you can carry just the keyboard back and forth.

If your monitor, like the majority on the market, doesn't have a USB-C input, you can use an included USB-to-HDMI adapter to connect. You can use a 65 W USB-C power adapter to juice the G1a if it's not getting electricity directly from the monitor.

The G1a weighs between 1.49 and 1.69 pounds, depending on config, and measures 14.1 in x 4.7 in x 0.7 inches, so it is more portable than most laptops, though it is longer and thicker than some. At its CES preview, HP showed off a long, thin envelope you can use to carry it and said it would also fit into any laptop bag that holds a 16-inch or larger laptop.

The G1a comes powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 5 or 7 (330, 340, or 350 Pro) with integrated AMD Radeon 800 graphics and an NPU that runs at up to 50 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second). Those specs make it a Copilot+ PC by Microsoft's standards, which means you get certain offline AI features like Microsoft Recall, Click to Do, and Windows Studio Effects. You can get it with up to 64 GB of DDR5 5600 MT/s RAM and up to 2 TB of SSD storage, along with Wi-Fi 6E or 7 connectivity.

When it comes out in March, the G1a will be available either with or without an embedded cable. It's unclear what the price difference will be, but having an embedded cable is a disadvantage because it makes the keyboard harder to carry safely and easier to break.

You'll also be able to configure the G1a with or without a 32 Wh battery that HP claims can offer up to 3.5 hours of unplugged use or two days in sleep. It's difficult to imagine a scenario where you'd need to use the keyboard without a power source, but having it be asleep while you carry it from one destination to another would be a huge plus.

HP is marketing the EliteBoard G1a as an enterprise device, which means enterprise-grade security. The keyboard PC will have HP Wolf Security for Business, which protects the BIOS from firmware attacks.

By building the PC into a keyboard and selling the G1a based on portability, HP hopes to change business behavior from laptop culture to keyboard culture. This could theoretically work in businesses that practice hoteling and expect employees to carry their keyboard to whatever hot desk they are using today.

However, asking employees to have a similar monitor and mouse setup at home seems like an additional hassle that IT departments won't want and, if the business has to pay for this home monitor, the cost of this solution and the support needed become more of a hassle. We don't know how much the G1a will cost either. To justify itself, it would have to cost significantly less than a business laptop.

Where we could see the G1a taking off is in call centers or other environments where desk space is tight. In lieu of buying an all-in-one PC, companies could buy HP's keyboard computer and stick it on the desk for various employees to use as they come on and off shift. But taking it back and forth between locations seems like a rare use case.

HP updates its commercial laptop lineup with EliteBook X G2

Those looking for a more traditional portable computer will find options in HP's new lineup of EliteBook X G2 laptops. These 14-inch laptops are available with a choice of three different processor platforms from each of the three PC CPU manufacturers. The EliteBook X G2i features Intel's upcoming ""Panther Lake,"" Core Ultra 5, and Ultra 7 series processors, while the EliteBook X G2q (Q for Qualcomm) is powered by Snapdragon X2 Elite or X Plus processors, and the EliteBook X G2a (A for AMD) runs AMD Ryzen AI 5, 7, or 9 chips.

The 14-inch laptop weighs around 2.4 pounds (1.09 kg) in most configurations, but there's also an Intel-powered G2i lightweight config that starts at 2.2 pounds (998 g) and a bend-back 2-in-1 called the EliteBook X Flip G2i that tips the scales at 2.86 pounds (1.29 kg). Depending on config, you can get it with a variety of screen panel options, ranging from a 1920 x 1200, 300-nit panel on the low end to a 2880 x 1800 OLED touch screen that goes up to 700 nits and 120 Hz.

The EliteBook X G2 series laptops are available with up to a 2 TB PCIe SSD and as much as 64 GB of LPDDR5x RAM. They sport a 5 MP webcam that has an IR sensor for facial recognition and can do human presence detection to tell if you're at your seat.

You can power the EliteBook X G2 with an included 65 W or 100 W power adapter (your choice). There's a built-in three-cell, 56 Wh or six-cell, 68 Wh battery.

All versions of the laptop come with Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, Bluetooth 6, and the option of adding a 5G modem. In the case of the EliteBook X G2q, the modem comes from Qualcomm, while the AMD and Intel versions have HP R15 or R18 5G connectivity. The lightweight G2i model is Wi-Fi only.

HP brings Copilot to enterprise printers

If your company has a Microsoft 365 Copilot account and you own or plan to buy an HP Enterprise printer that works with its ecosystem of Workpath apps, you'll soon be able to get that AI directly in your print/scan solution.

Dubbed HP for Microsoft 365 Copilot and due out this spring, the new on-printer software lets you do new AI-related kinds of things directly from the printer/scanner's touch screen. First, you'll be able to redact personally identifiable information from documents before you print them. Imagine scanning in a resume or opening it up from OneDrive and having the name and other information blacked out so that hiring managers can only look at the qualifications.

You'll also be able to have Copilot suggest file names for documents you scan so that you can easily identify them when looking through your folders. As you might expect, Copilot will also print AI-generated summaries of documents in lieu of the documents themselves and will do translation on-device. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2026/01/02/hp0.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 23:00:33.675139

“Full ownership of PA Consulting will further strengthen Jacobs’ capabilities in advisory, digital and transformation services,” the company said, describing the deal as aligned with its long-term strategy to support clients across the full lifecycle of major programs.

Additional details disclosed in a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show the acquisition is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings within the first 12 months following closing. Jacobs said it plans to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. Upon closing, PA Consulting will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Jacobs.

According to the filing, the transaction implies an enterprise value of approximately $4.0 billion (£3.05 billion) for PA Consulting, based on closing assumptions and expected adjustments. The filing also discloses about $99 million (£75 million) in deferred consideration, payable two years after closing and tied to Jacobs’ share performance, a structure that keeps PA Consulting’s stakeholders economically aligned with Jacobs’ long-term operating results.

Jacobs said the transaction will require national security approvals in the United Kingdom and Denmark, reflecting PA Consulting’s involvement in government, defense and other sensitive infrastructure-related advisory work.

In a Jan. 5 research note, Baird Equity Research said the transaction values PA Consulting at roughly 13 times adjusted EBITDA, declining to about 12.3 times when anticipated cost synergies are included. The analyst said the deal’s incremental earnings impact will appear modest due to accounting treatment, noting that Jacobs had already been consolidating most of PA Consulting’s results prior to full ownership.

Full ownership would have modestly lifted Jacobs’ adjusted margin—by about 60 basis points—based on fiscal 2025 results, reflecting the higher-margin profile of advisory work, the note said.

Much like Blackwell, the Vera Rubin superchip features two dual-die Rubin GPUs, each capable of churning out 50 petaFLOPS of inference performance or 35 petaFLOPS for training.
The two Rubin GPUs are paired to Nvidia's new Vera CPU via a 1.8 TB/s NvLink-C2C interconnect.","CES used to be all about consumer electronics, TVs, smartphones, tablets, PCs, and – over the last few years – automobiles. Now, it's just another opportunity for Nvidia to peddle its AI hardware and software — in particular its next-gen Vera Rubin architecture.

The AI arms dealer boasts that, compared to Blackwell, the chips will deliver up to 5x higher floating point performance for inference, 3.5x for training, along with 2.8x more memory bandwidth and an NvLink interconnect that's now twice as fast.

But don't get too excited just yet. It's not like the chips are launching earlier than previously expected. They're still expected to arrive in the second half of the year, just like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra did.

Nvidia normally holds off until GTC in March to reveal its next-gen chips. Perhaps AMD's aggressive rack scale roadmap has Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang nervous. Announced at Advancing AI late last spring and expected later this year, AMD's double-wide Helios racks promise to deliver performance on par with Vera Rubin NVL72 while offering customers 50 percent more HBM4.

Nvidia has also been teasing the Vera Rubin platform for nearly a year now, to the point where there's not much we didn't already know about the platform.

But even though you won't be able to get your hands on Rubin for a few more months, it's never too early for a closer look at what the multi-million dollar machines will buy you.

NVL72 refined

The flagship system for Nvidia's Vera Rubin CPU and GPU architectures is once again its NVL72 rack systems. At first blush, the machine doesn't look all that different from its Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra-based siblings. But under the hood, Nvidia has been hard at work refining the architecture for better serviceability and telemetry.

Switch trays can now be serviced without taking down the machine first. Nvidia also has new reliability, availability, and serviceability features which enable customers to check in on the health of the GPUs without dropping them from the cluster first. These health checks can now run between training checkpoints or jobs, Ian Buck, Nvidia's VP and General Manager of Hyperscale and HPC, tells El Reg.

At the heart of the rack is the Vera Rubin superchip, which, if history tells us anything, should bear the VR200 code name.

Much like Blackwell, the Vera Rubin superchip features two dual-die Rubin GPUs, each capable of churning out 50 petaFLOPS of inference performance or 35 petaFLOPS for training. Both of those numbers refer to peak performance achievable when using NVLFP4 data type.

According to Buck, for this generation, Nvidia is using a new adaptive compression technique that's better suited to generative AI and mixture of experts (MoE) model inference to achieve the 50 petaFLOP claim rather than structured sparsity. As you may recall, while structured sparsity did have benefits for certain workloads, it didn't offer many if any advantages for LLM inference.

Of course, higher-precision data types remain relevant for many workloads, whether for vision-language model inference, image generation, fine-tuning, training, or high-performance computing (HPC). In this respect Nvidia hasn't deprecated support for any data types, but its approach to some like FP64 has changed a little.

FP64 is essential for HPC and scientific computing workloads, such as physics simulations and material analysis, and compared to Blackwell, performance regressed from 45 teraFLOPS to 33 TFLOPS of double-precision vector performance on Rubin. For FP64 matrix applications, which are what the Top500 ranking of the most powerful publicly known supercomputers is heavily weighted toward, performance is achieved using emulation, an approach that was pioneered on Blackwell accelerators.

The GPUs are fed by 288 GB of HBM4 memory — 576 GB per superchip — which, despite delivering the same capacity as the Blackwell Ultra-based GB300, is now 2.8x faster at 22 TB/s per socket (44 TB/s per superchip). If that number seems a little high, that's because Nvidia initially targeted 13 TB/s of HBM4 bandwidth when it first teased Rubin last year. Buck tells us that the jump to 22 TB/s was attained entirely through silicon and doesn't rely on techniques like memory compression.

The two Rubin GPUs are paired to Nvidia's new Vera CPU via a 1.8 TB/s NvLink-C2C interconnect. The CPU contains 88 of Nvidia's custom Arm-based Olympus cores and is paired with 1.5 TB of LPDDR5x memory — 3x that of the GB200. We guess we know why memory is in such short supply these days. Actually it's more complicated than that, but this certainly isn't helping the situation.

However, one of the most important features Vera brings to the table is support for confidential computing across the system's NvLink domain, something that previously was only available on x86-based HGX systems.

Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL72 racks feature 72 Rubin GPUs, 20.7 TB of HBM4, 36 Vera CPUs, 54 TB of LPDDR5x which are spread across 18 compute blades interconnected by nine NvSwitch 6 blades which deliver 3.6 TB/s of bandwidth to each GPU — twice that of last gen.

Nvidia isn't ready to say how much power that additional compute and bandwidth will require. However, Buck tells us that while it will be higher, we shouldn't expect power to double.

Wasn't it supposed to be 144?

If you're scratching your head wondering ""didn't Nvidia say this thing was supposed to have 144 GPUs?"" you wouldn't be the only one. At GTC 2025, Huang announced that they were changing the way they counted GPUs from the package to the dies on board. In that sense, the Blackwell-based NVL72s also had 144 GPUs, but Nvidia was going to wait for Vera Rubin to make the switch to the new convention.

It seems Nvidia has since changed its mind and is sticking with the established naming convention. Having said that, we may yet see Nvidia racks with at least 144 GPUs on board before long.

Then there's CPX

The Rubin CPUs we've talked about up to this point actually are one of two accelerators announced so far. Rubin CPX is the other.

Unveiled in September, the chip is a more niche product, designed specifically to accelerate the compute-intense prefill phase of LLM inference. Since prefill isn't bandwidth-bound, CPX doesn't need HBM and can instead make do with slower DRAM.

Each CPX accelerator will be capable of churning out 30 petaFLOPS of NVFP4 compute and will sport 128 GB of GDDR7 memory.

In a graphic shared this summer, Nvidia showed an NVL144 CPX blade with four 288 GB Rubin SXM modules and eight Rubin CPX prefill accelerators for a total of 12 GPUs per node.

The complete rack system would only need 12 compute blades for the thing to have 144 GPUs, though only 48 of them would be connected via NVLink.

Stitching together a SuperPOD

As with past Nvidia rack systems, eight NVL72 racks form a SuperPOD with the GPU slinger's Spectrum-X Ethernet and/or Quantum-X InfiniBand the glue used to stitch them together. Multiple SuperPODS can then be combined to form larger compute environments for training or distributed inference.

If you aren't ready to make the switch to Nvidia's rack-scale kit, don't worry. Eight-way (NVL8) HGX systems based around the Rubin platform are still available, but we're told liquid cooling is no longer a suggestion, but a requirement. These smaller systems, 64 to be exact, can also be combined to form a SuperPOD with 512 GPUs — just shy of the of the more powerful NVL72 SuperPOD at 576.

For this generation, Nvidia also has two new NICs, which it teased on a few occasions over the last year. At GTC DC, Nvidia showed off the ConnectX-9, a 1.6 Tbps ""superNIC"" designed for high-speed distributed computing, which we sometimes call the backend network.

For storage, management, and security, Nvidia is pushing its BlueField-4 data processing units (DPUs), which feature an integrated 800 Gbps ConnectX-9 NIC and a 64-core Grace CPU on board. This, we should note, isn't the same Grace CPU found in the GB200, but a newer version based on Arm's Neoverse V3 core architecture.

The beefier CPU is designed to offload software defined networking, storage, security, and can also run hypervisors for virtualized environments.

Playing Whac-A-Mole with inference bottlenecks

Cramming 64 Grace cores onto a NIC might seem like overkill, but Nvidia has a specific reason for wanting that much compute hanging off the machine like a computer in front of a computer.

Alongside all its shiny new hardware, Nvidia showed off what it's describing as a ""new class of memory between the GPU and storage,"" designed to offload key value (KV) caches.

The basic idea isn't new. KV caches store the model's state. You can think of this like its short-term memory. Calculating the key value vectors is one of the more compute-intensive aspects of the inference.

Because inference workloads often involve passing over the same info multiple times, it makes sense to cache the computed vectors in memory. By doing this, only changes need to be computed and data in the cache can be reused. This sounds simple, but, in practice, KV caches can be quite large, easily consuming tens of gigabytes in order to keep track of 100,000 or so tokens. That might sound like a lot, but a single user running a code assistant or agent can blow through that rather quickly.

As we understand it, Nvidia's Inference Context Storage platform will work with storage platforms from multiple partner vendors, and will take advantage of the BlueField-4 DPU, NIXL GPU direct storage libraries, and optimize KV cache offloading for maximum performance and efficiency.

Combined with technologies like Rubin CPX, this kind of high-performance KV offloading should allow the GPUs to spend more time generating tokens and less time waiting on data to be shuffled about and recomputed.

The AI infrastructure arena heats up

Nvidia's decision to ""launch"" Rubin — again it isn't actually shipping in volume yet — betrays an increasingly competitive compute landscape.

As we mentioned earlier, AMD's Helios rack systems promise to deliver floating point performance roughly equivalent to Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL72 at 2.9 exaFLOPS versus 2.5-3.6 exaFLOPS of FP4, respectively. For applications that can't take advantage of Nvidia's adaptive compression tech, Helios is, at least on paper, faster.

However, with Nvidia planning to ship faster memory on Rubin than initially planned, AMD no longer has a bandwidth advantage. It does still have a capacity lead with 432 GB of HBM4 per GPU socket compared to 288 GB on Rubin. In theory, this should allow the AMD-based system to serve 50 percent larger MoE models on a single double-wide rack.

In practice, the real-world performance is going to depend heavily on how well tunneling Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) over Broadcom's Tomahawk 6 Ethernet switches actually works.

AMD's MI450-series GPUs appear very well positioned to compete against Rubin, but as we've seen repeated with Amazon and Google, the ability to scale that compute often makes a bigger difference than the chip's individual performance.

AMD is also having to play catch up on the software ecosystem front. The company's HIP and ROCm libraries have certainly come a long way since the MI300X made its debut at the end of 2023, but the company still has a ways to go.

LLMs, robots, and autonomous cars

Nvidia certainly isn't making the situation any easier for AMD. At CES, the GPU giant unveiled a slew of new software frameworks aimed at enterprises, robotics devs, and the automotive industry.

This includes the development of new foundation models for domain specific applications like retrieval augmented generation, safety, speech, and autonomous driving.

The latter, called Alpamayo, is a relatively small ""reasoning vision language action"" model designed to help level-4 autonomous vehicles better handle unique and fast evolving road conditions. Level-4 capable vehicles are capable of driving fully autonomously, unsupervised driving in specific environments, like high-ways or urban environments.

Nvidia's autonomous driving stack is due to hit US roads late this year with the level-2++ capable Mercedes Benz CLA. This class of autonomous vehicle is capable of driving itself in similar conditions as level-4, but requires the supervision of a human operator.

What about GTC?

With Nvidia kicking off the New Year with Rubin — a chip we hadn't expected to get a good look at for another three months — we're left to wonder what we'll see at GTC, which is slated to run from March 16-19 in San Jose, California.

In addition to the regular mix of software libraries and foundation models, we expect to get a lot more details on the Kyber racks that'll underpin the company's Vera Rubin Ultra platform starting in 2027.

As you might have noticed, Nvidia, AMD, AWS, and others have gotten in the habit of pre-announcing products well in advance of them shipping or becoming generally available. As the saying goes: enterprises don't buy products, they buy roadmaps. In this case, however, it's really about ensuring they have somewhere to put them.

Nvidia's Kyber racks are expected to pull 600 kilowatts of power which means datacenter operators need to start preparing now, if they want to deploy them on day one.

We don't yet have a full picture of what Vera Rubin Ultra will offer, but we know it'll feature four reticle-sized Rubin Ultra GPUs, 1TB of HBM4e, and will deliver 100 petaFLOPS of FP4 performance.

As things currently stand, Nvidia plans to cram 144 of these GPU packages (576 GPU dies) into a single NvLink domain which is expected to deliver 15 exaFLOPS of FP4 inference performance or 10 exaFLOPS for training. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/03/18/nvidia_blackwell_ultra_cover.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 23:01:05.425070

""The role of the head coach is not to be a cheerleader,"" Johnson said Monday. ""It's to say it like it is. If something pops up and I feel like it needs to be said, then I say it. If I don't, then we keep it moving.

""We've got a great group of guys. We've got a prideful group. We've earned a division title. We've earned the No. 2 seed in the NFC.

We can play better than what we played at the end of the season and that's really our expectation going forward.""

Johnson believes that the offense is close to reverting to the unit that helped the Bears average 27.8 points in the six games that preceded their loss to the Lions.

""We're not far away; you never are in this league,"" Johnson said. ""You're really close and so we've just got to clean up some of the mental errors we had. I think in the first 11 plays we counted six mentals as an offense. When you're facing a good team, you can't do that. And so we'll clean that up. We'll be a lot sharper here going forward, and so we're going to be OK. But when you have eight possessions and three of them are three-and-outs, it's just not a recipe for good football.""

The Bears defense also is focused on improving. On Sunday, the Lions scored on their first three possessions and compiled 237 yards and 15 first downs in the first half in taking a 13-0 halftime lead.

""We have a number of areas where we can play better,"" Johnson said. ""But at the same time, I mean the No. 1 thing is we're looking to limit the opponent with their points.

Over the past year, International Business Machines has seen short term share price pressure, with a 7 day share price return of 4.66% and 30 day share price return of 5.34%, alongside a much stronger 1 year total shareholder return of 34.29%. This suggests earlier momentum has cooled recently, even as long term holders have still done well.

If IBM’s recent moves have you thinking about where else capital could work hard in tech and AI, it may be worth scanning high growth tech and AI stocks as a next step.

So with IBM’s recent short term pullback sitting against strong multi year total returns and annual revenue and net income growth, is the stock quietly offering value today, or is the market already pricing in its future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 1% Undervalued

With International Business Machines last closing at US$291.50 and the most followed narrative pointing to fair value around US$293.89, the gap is small but meaningful for investors weighing upside against execution risk.

The analysts are assuming International Business Machines's revenue will grow by 5.1% annually over the next 3 years. The launch of the z17 mainframe with enhanced AI acceleration and energy efficiency is anticipated to drive significant customer adoption, positively impacting infrastructure revenue and possibly net margins due to differentiation and pricing power.

The company that runs the once-vibrant Westfield mall filed unlawful detainer complaints Friday in San Francisco Superior Court to kick out a restaurant, an eyebrow salon, and a shoe repair shop.

On Monday, a sign just inside the mall’s Fifth Street entrance still listed dozens of shuttered businesses as if they were still open for business. There was barely anyone shopping at the dwindling shops, such as H&M and shoe store Ecco, which offered steep markdowns for pre-closure sales.

The court filings, in three cases, target the owners and operators of Shoe Wiz, on the mall’s concourse, the Executive Order Bar & Lounge, and Eyebrow Plus beauty chain. None responded to requests for comment Monday.

Since it was foreclosed on in November, the mall has been controlled by a Delaware-based entity that represents the lender. An attorney for the mall, Gregory P. Barbee, did not respond to requests for comment.

The San Francisco Centre, which once housed Nordstrom and a flagship Bloomingdale’s, has struggled since the pandemic. The lender-controlled entity has been working to either restructure the asset or prepare it for sale or redevelopment.

According to a complaint filed against the CEO of beauty chain Eyebrow Plus, the store was given a three-day notice to leave on Dec. 13. The filing, which notes that the store remained open Dec. 18, seeks damages of $201.37 “for each day Defendant continues in possession of the Premises and through the time of judgment,” plus a declaration of forfeiture and recovery of suit costs. Shoe Wiz, steps away from the mall’s still busy Panda Express restaurant, was locked; boxes and shelves of merchandise could be seen.

At Eyebrow Plus, a lone employee who declined to share her name stood ready to handle any walk-in customers. She said the business was set to close by Jan. 31.",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_tihmcnrmm975t61t39rqr3k208/-FWEBP,N,,2026-01-05 21:01:19.079677

Alpha Mayo is trained end-to-end, literally from camera in to actuation out.

The camera in, lots and lots of miles that are driven by itself, where we human drive it, driven using human demonstration.

And we have lots and lots of miles that are generated by cosmos.

In addition to that, hundreds of thousands of examples are labeled very, very carefully so that we could teach the car how to drive.

Alpha Mayo does something that's really special.

Not only does it take sensor input and activates steering wheel, brakes and and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it is about to take.

It tells you what action it's going to take, the reasons by which it came about that action, and then of course, the trajectory.

All of these are coupled directly and trained very specifically by a large combination of human trained and as well as cosmos generated data.

The result of it is just really incredible. Not only does your car drive as you would expect it to drive, and it drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators.

But in every single scenario, when it comes up to the scenario, it reasons about, it tells you what it's going to do, and it reasons about what you what's about to do.

Now, the reason why this is so important is because of the long tail of driving.

There it's impossible for us to simply collect every single possible scenario for everything that could ever happen in every single country, in every single circumstance that's possibly ever going to happen for all of population.

However, it is very unlikely, it's very likely that every scenario, if decomposed into a whole bunch of other smaller scenarios are quite normal for you to understand.

And so these long tails will be decomposed into quite normal circumstances that the car knows how to deal with.

Sydney, Jan 6, 2026 AEST (ABN Newswire) - Locksley Resources Limited (ASX:LKY) (X5L:FRA) (LKYRF:OTCMKTS) advised that recent reconnaissance and surface sampling programs have successfully identified a consistent northwest to southeast oriented mineralised corridor at the Mojave Project.

HIGHLIGHTS

- Results from rock chip sampling returns 409g/t Ag confirming high-grade silver mineralisation ~3km from the initial high-grade silver discovery (Sample 258140), 320m southwest of the Desert Antimony Mine (DAM)

- Significant base metal mineralisation confirmed in addition to silver, with samples returning grades up to 4.2% Copper (Cu), 1.5% Lead (Pb), and 1.5% Zinc (Zn), highlighting the polymetallic nature of the system

- Twelve (12) rock chip samples exceeded 30g/t Ag, reinforcing additional precious and base metal potential within the Mojave Project's North Block

- This discovery represents an important advancement in the Company's exploration strategy and identifies a new, potentially high-value component of the Mojave Project

This discovery represents an important advancement in the Company's exploration strategy and identifies a new, potentially high-value component of the Mojave Project. The delineation of a mineralised corridor suggests a strike extent approximately 2.4km westnorthwest of the Hendricks Shaft, and approximately 600m to the east-southeast, extending the mineralised corridor almost 3km from the Silver Prospect. This confirms the presence of a polymetallic quartz vein system, which includes the high-grade sample 258140 collected from a 3cm to 10cm wide vein (Figure 1*). These early results possibly suggest that the Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu mineralisation may reflect the presence of a large-scale hydrothermal system, which could potentially contain valuable concentrations of precious and base metals. Further exploration is required to test this concept.

Rock chip sampling within the Mojave Project's North Block has returned results of up to 409g/t Ag, with associated base metal values of up to 1.5% Zn and 0.88% Pb, supporting the interpretation of a polymetallic mineralised system and enhancing the prospectivity of the corridor. Additional rock chip sample 258420 returned values up to 117g/t Ag, & 3.1% Cu, also located within the interpreted mineralised corridor located close to a historic adit and workings.

The interpreted mineralised corridor includes the historic Hendricks Shaft, located approximately 2.4km from the initial high-grade silver discovery. A total of 398 rock chip samples have been collected across the North Block with ~260 of these being collected along the mineralised corridor between DAM and up to 5.6km to the southeast.

Rock Chip Sampling Program Details

The recent sampling campaign was designed to test the strike extent of the high-grade silver mineralisation first identified in late 2024. The results (see Table 1) have exceededexpectations, confirming that the mineralised system extends significantly beyond the initial discovery zone (Sample 258140 - Figure 1*).

Key observations from the program include:

- Strike Extension: The mineralised corridor is now interpreted to extend from the Silver Prospect (Sample 258140) to historical trenches and stockpiles (Samples 258184 & 258185) located ~3km to the south-east significantly increasing the strike extent of the exploration target.

- Mineralisation Style: High-grade samples 258184 and 258185, collected from outcropping veins and historic stockpiles, exhibit quartz with gossanous selvages with boxwork textures. These are potential indicators of weathered sulphide-rich polymetallic veins, suggesting fresh sulphides may exist at depth.

- Visual Copper: Sample 258420 (which returned 117g/t Ag & 3.1% Cu) was collected from outcropping mineralisation at historic workings where copper carbonate (i.e. malachite) is visually prevalent (see Figure 3*). This confirms a copper component to the mineralised system.

Next Steps

Locksley will advance this exciting silver and base metal opportunity through a systematic exploration program run in parallel with ongoing activities at DAM and El Campo, comprising:

- Systematic Mapping: Detailed geological mapping between the Silver Prospect and the new south-eastern extension to define the structural geometry and continuity of the trend.

- Petrology and Geochemistry: Submission of samples for petrological interpretation to assist with determining relative timing of mineralisation and geochemical associations across the system.

- Geophysics: Assessment of geophysical survey options, such as Very Low Frequency electromagnetics (VLF-EM), Induced Polarisation (IP), or Electromagnetic (e.g. VTEM) to potentially identify mineralised zones and structures at depth that are not visible at surface.

- Drill Targeting: The goal of this work is to delineate high-priority drill-ready targets along the NW-SE corridor for future testing.

Additional work is planned to improve understanding of the corridor's structural geometry, enabling more effective drill targeting and delineation of the extent and grade of mineralisation within the North Block.

Kerrie Matthews, Managing Director & CEO, commented:

""Defining a 3km mineralised trend with surface results of up to 409 g/t silver and 1.5% copper is a highly encouraging outcome. Importantly, this discovery complements our core antimony development strategy and gives exposure as a diversified U.S. critical minerals company, providing shareholders with upside to precious metals, base metals, and strategic minerals within a single, high-quality project area.""

About Locksley Resources Limited

Locksley Resources Limited (ASX:LKY) (FRA:X5L) (OTCMKTS:LKYRF) is an ASX listed explorer focused on critical minerals in the United States of America. The Company is actively advancing exploration across two key assets: the Mojave Project in California, targeting rare earth elements (REEs) and antimony. Locksley Resources aims to generate shareholder value through strategic exploration, discovery and development in this highly prospective mineral region.

Mojave Project

Located in the Mojave Desert, California, the Mojave Project comprises over 250 claims across two contiguous prospect areas, namely, the North Block/Northeast Block and the El Campo Prospect. The North Block directly abuts claims held by MP Materials, while El Campo lies along strike of the Mountain Pass Mine and is enveloped by MP Materials' claims, highlighting the strong geological continuity and exploration potential of the project area.

In addition to rare earths, the Mojave Project hosts the historic ""Desert Antimony Mine"", which last operated in 1937. Despite the United States currently having no domestic antimony production, demand for the metal remains high due to its essential role in defense systems, semiconductors, and metal alloys. With significant surface sample results, the Desert Mine prospect represents one of the highest-grade known antimony occurrences in the U.S.

Locksley's North American position is further strengthened by rising geopolitical urgency to diversify supply chains away from China, the global leader in both REE & antimony production. With its maiden drilling program planned, the Mojave Project is uniquely positioned to align with U.S. strategic objectives around critical mineral independence and economic security.

Tottenham Project

Locksley's Australian portfolio comprises the advanced Tottenham Copper-Gold Project in New South Wales, focused on VMS-style mineralisation in a well established mining region.

Locksley is committed to delivering value through discovery, development, and strategic partnerships, with a focus on securing access to U.S. aligned funding and downstream collaborations.

Demand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat.
It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.","Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making giant Nvidia, put his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom by making semiconductors more powerful than any of his rivals’. This year, he’s promising to do it again.

On Monday, Mr. Huang said the company would begin shipping a new A.I. chip later this year, one that can do more computing with less power than previous generations of chips could. Known as the Vera Rubin, the chip has been in development for three years and is designed to fulfill A.I. requests more quickly and cheaply than its predecessors.

Mr. Huang, who spoke during CES, an annual tech conference in Las Vegas, also discussed Nvidia’s surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles. This year, Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping cars equipped with Nvidia self-driving technology comparable to Tesla’s Autopilot.

Nvidia’s new Rubin chips are being manufactured and will be shipped to customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, in the second half of the year, fulfilling a promise Mr. Huang made last March when he first described the chip at the company’s annual conference in San Jose, Calif.

Companies will be able to train A.I. models with one-quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. It can provide information for chatbots and other A.I. products for one-tenth of the cost. They will also be able to install the chips in data centers more quickly, courtesy of redesigned supercomputers that feature fewer cables.

If the new chips live up to their promise, they could allow companies to develop A.I. at a lower cost and at least begin to respond to the soaring electrical demands of data centers being built around the world.

“This is how we’re going to get everybody to the next frontier and push A.I. to the next level and, of course, to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently as well,” Mr. Huang said.

The Rubin chips are named for the astronomer Vera Rubin, who did groundbreaking research on dark matter. The new chips are key to maintaining Nvidia’s dominance of the A.I. industry and its perch as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s A.I. chips, which account for more than 90 percent of the market, are highly coveted by businesses and governments around the world. It sells them for about $30,000 each, with nearly three-quarters of that being pure profit.

The rising threat contributed to Nvidia’s deal last month to license technology from the chip start-up Groq. The agreement is expected to help Nvidia develop chips that allow A.I. to more efficiently fulfill requests through a process known as inference.

Because more people are using A.I., chip makers are trying to make delivering it less expensive and less power hungry, said Daniel Newman, the chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm. “That’s the name of the game because utilization is very early,” he said.

The competitive challenges have buffeted Nvidia alongside a series of geopolitical headaches. Mr. Huang spent much of last year lobbying President Trump to allow Nvidia to sell its A.I. chips to China. At the same time, he was trying to fend off efforts by Beijing to discourage Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips because of security concerns.

In December, Mr. Trump granted the company permission to sell its second-most-powerful chip to China. But Beijing has not decided whether it will allow its companies to buy Nvidia products.

Demand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat. He traveled with Mr. Trump to the Middle East and Britain, where he played a key role in technology deals between nations.

Nvidia’s business has flourished during the A.I. boom of the past three years. In November, the company reported a quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, a 65 percent increase from a year earlier and 245 percent from the year before that. It expects about $500 billion in sales through the end of this year.

Still, Mr. Huang has been eager to diversify Nvidia’s business and expand its roster of customers. He has been pushing the company to become a major player in robotics and autonomous vehicles.

On Monday, he said Nvidia had developed new A.I. software that would allow customers like Uber and Lucid to develop cars that navigate roads autonomously. It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.

Since 2020, Nvidia has been working with Mercedes to develop a class of self-driving cars. They will begin shipping an early example of their collaboration when Mercedes CLA cars become available in the first half of the year in Europe and the United States.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/05/multimedia/NVIDIA-Vera-rubin-qjcl/NVIDIA-Vera-rubin-qjcl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 19:01:54.785243

Novo Nordisk on Monday officially launched in the U.S. the pill version of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy. Negotiations with the Trump administration led Novo to price a starter dose at $149 per month for some Medicare beneficiaries and those willing to pay cash. The drug’s website shows that the $149 price will apply to the 1.5 milligram and 4 milligram doses until April 15, after which the higher of the two doses will cost $199. Monthly supplies of a 9 milligram and 25 milligram dose, meanwhile, are priced at $299. People with commercial insurance could pay as little as $25 per month out of pocket, Novo said.

Dutch biotech Argenx will swap CEOs, announcing Monday that leader Tim Van Hauwermeiren will become board chair in May 2026 as part of a planned leadership transition. Once the change is effective, current COO Karen Massey will succeed Van Hauwermeiren and take over what’s in recent years become one of the industry’s most valuable companies thanks to the fast-selling autoimmune drug Vyvgart. Despite the pending CEO switch, Argenx “is in a position of strength” with that drug on track for more than $4 billion in 2025 revenue, “sustainable profitability and a strong balance sheet,” wrote Stifel analyst Alex Thompson.

Sanofi on Dec. 24 agreed to pay $15.50 per share, or about $2.2 billion, to acquire vaccine developer Dynavax Technologies. The deal hands Sanofi a marketed hepatitis B vaccine for adults and a shingles shot that’s currently in early-stage testing. Dynavax’s hepatitis B shot, Hepsilav-B, is administered in two doses over the course of a month, which is supposed to provide higher levels of protection more quickly than other available vaccines. The deal is a “smart strategic move” for Sanofi, giving the company one vaccine with a 46% share of its addressable market and another candidate in the “large and durable” business for shingles shots, wrote Leerink Partners’ David Risinger.

That same day, however, the FDA also rejected Sanofi’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug tolebrutinib. The agency had previously delayed a decision on tolebrutinib, which was being evaluated for non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. And Sanofi had said in mid-December that more guidance would come from the agency sometime in the first quarter of 2026. However, the FDA instead turned back tolebrutinib, which Sanofi research chief Houman Ashrafian referred to in a statement as a “significant and meaningful change in direction” from previous feedback. The rejection represents the latest setback for tolebrutinib, which has failed studies in two other kinds of multiple sclerosis. Jefferies analyst Michael Leuchten also wrote that he expects a “hit to sentiment and questions on management credibility,” given Sanofi’s previous statements about the drug.

Contacts Uber: press@uber.com Nuro: press@nuro.ai Lucid: media@lucidmotors.com SOURCE Lucid Group","The companies also announced that autonomous on-road testing began last month, an important milestone in the development and validation of the robotaxi service ahead of its expected launch in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year. Nuro is leading the testing using robotaxi engineering prototypes supervised by autonomous vehicle operators, beginning in the Bay Area.

At the show, visitors will have a first look at the robotaxi, as well as the in-cabin rider experience. Highlights of the robotaxi will include:

A next-gen sensor array featuring high-resolution cameras, solid-state lidar sensors, and radars that provides 360-degree perception. These sensors are integrated throughout the Lucid Gravity's body and in the purpose-built roof-mounted halo, which is a low-profile module designed to maximize visibility while preserving the vehicle's signature design.

Halo-mounted integrated LEDs help riders easily identify the correct vehicle, display rider initials, and provide clear status updates from pickup through dropoff.

An intuitive in-ride experience that builds on the unprecedented comfort of the all-electric Lucid Gravity, with interactive screens that let riders personalize their autonomous journey — from heated-seat and climate controls to music, as well as options to contact support, or request the vehicle to pull-over.

In-vehicle visualization that shows what the robotaxi sees and its planned path in real-time, including maneuvers such as yielding to pedestrians, slowing at traffic lights, changing lanes, and dropping off a passenger.

A versatile, spacious layout with configurations that comfortably fit up to six passengers and offer generous luggage space, creating a premium solution for group travel.

High-performance compute based on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor, part of the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform, supporting the real-time AI processing and system integration required for advanced autonomous driving.

""The debut of our production intent robotaxi with Lucid and Uber is a significant milestone on our path to delivering autonomy at scale,"" said Dave Ferguson, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Nuro. ""By bringing together Nuro's proven level 4 autonomy, Lucid's advanced vehicle architecture, and Uber's global reach, we're building a robotaxi service designed for real-world operations and long-term growth.""

""Uber is proud to partner with Lucid and Nuro to bring a state-of-the-art robotaxi to market later this year,"" said Sarfraz Maredia, Global Head of Autonomous Mobility & Delivery at Uber. ""By combining leading expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy, and ridehailing, we're building a unique new option for affordable and scalable autonomous rides in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.""

""Our robotaxi program with Uber and Nuro is a key part of how Lucid is leveraging its technology to create a more sustainable future of mobility that is widely accessible,"" said Kay Stepper, Vice President of ADAS and Autonomous at Lucid. ""Our engineering, range and interior comfort offers a unique platform, and when combined with Nuro's technology and Uber's scale, we are collectively building an experience like no other.""

Autonomous on-road testing is part of Nuro's safety and validation framework, honed over years of commercial autonomous deployments. The program evaluates dozens of critical capabilities across the full autonomy stack including Nuro's end-to-end AI foundation model, which blends state-of-the-art AI with clear, verifiable safety logic for comfortable, reliable performance. In addition to on-road testing, the program includes closed-course testing and simulation to validate performance across a wide range of scenarios.

Pending final validation, the production intent robotaxi is expected to start production at Lucid's Arizona factory later this year.

The robotaxi will be on public display for CES attendees at NVIDIA's showcase at the Fontainebleau Hotel starting Monday, January 5 at 3:00 PM PT through Thursday, January 8th, 2026.

Last week, I sent out some predictions for 2026, and a few days before that, looked back on the 2025 predictions. Below, some other things I wrote over the break.

I Wrote...

I Note...

📝 Satya Nadella Blogs – To me, the content is less interesting – AI is gonna be big in 2026, you heard it here first! Though I do appreciate the ""scaffolding vs. substitute"" & ""slop vs. sophistication"" framing. And, of course, referencing the ""bicycles for the mind"" without mentioning you-know-who... – than the meta aspect of Nadella deciding to blog. Presumably, this is an attempt to establish some sort of ""thought leadership"" position as Microsoft navigates the extremely competitive AI waters. He perhaps even learned a thing or two from his friend Sam Altman, who oscillates between his own personal blog and OpenAI's official blog – or even other ones – seemingly on a whim. To that end, Nadella's post isn't a blog on an official Microsoft site or even Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, where many such thought leader-y posts are born, but instead on ""snscratchpad.com"" – there wasn't a better URL available?! That perhaps led it to fly under the radar, with Techmeme just posting it now, even though Nadella posted this a week ago. Maybe this was a new year's resolution to write more, which I can certainly appreciate! We'll see how long he keeps it up... [SN Scratchpad]

📱 OpenAI Latest App Store Attempt – Rolfe Winkler tried to use some of the initial apps in ChatGPT’s latest attempt to re-create the magic of the App Store. The result? Predictably not great. OpenAI says it’s early, which it is, but the real issue is how much easier/better it is to use the partners' services via their actual apps and/or websites. The App Store worked because it took advantage of a new device and form factor in the form of the iPhone. OpenAI’s hope here is to leverage the fact that people already have ChatGPT open, but these other apps really are just a click away, be it in another tab or another app. Which is to say, maybe this strategy works when OpenAI has their own device (if that device is compelling enough), but then again, Amazon has been trying that for years too without much success… I can see some business use cases here, but consumer use cases are going to remain a challenge unless OpenAI can figure out something truly novel (perhaps by using ChatGPT’s knowledge about you?)… [WSJ 🔒]

📽️ Hollywood Had A Slightly Better 2025 – $8.9B in ticket sales (in the US and Canada) was 2% better than 2024 — but such numbers are still down over 20% versus the pre-pandemic levels. And that’s before you take inflation into account. This naturally brings up the ""is this the new normal?"" question, which it probably is unless Hollywood actually does something to change the equation here. Netflix could help, but the industry will do everything in their power to stop that from happening so… Still, one of my predictions for the year is that the 2026 box office will be up pretty significantly, sequentially. And it may even touch those pre-pandemic numbers (again, before inflation). The slate looks that strong with franchises galore (not that those helped much this year). But it will likely be a mirage. Real change — reel change? — remains needed. [NYT]

🥽 Apple Cuts Vision Pro Production & Marketing – Many in Apple's orbit seem to be quick to call this latest report a ""nothingburger"" – mainly in that it's nothing new (IDC's market report notes that Luxshare halted production last year), but I would just note that the company did ship an updated version of the device since then (also IDC's sales estimates do keep falling below even their muted expectations). Sure, it was a small spec upgrade, but many Apple updates are and they still manage to move needles year to year – that does not seem to be the case with Vision Pro. IDC believes they shipped just 45k units in the holiday quarter; Apple sells something like 600k iPhones and about 60k Macs a day. Still, I think that small update was probably the right strategy with the product already in market (they should have launched it as a dev kit, not a full-on consumer product in its current state, but we're way past that now...). Rather than seeing them try to do a lighter/slightly cheaper Vision Pro right now, I'd rather see them meet Meta in the market for Smart Glasses (which is clearly happening). And build up from there. There's just still no real market for headsets yet – Meta dominates it, but even they're seemingly pulling back. [FT 🔒]

📺 Versant Lives! – And more importantly, the now-spun-off new public company sets a potential price for WBD's television assets, which could ultimately make or break the Netflix deal. Right now, Comcast's old TV assets look to be valued by the market somewhere around $6B. At 4.5x forward-earnings, that would make WBD's assets worth... a lot. But it's not that straightforward because those assets are also going to be saddled with... a lot of debt. So at least right now, we're... likely somewhere between what Paramount thinks they are worth and what WBD (and Netflix) thinks they are worth... Funny that. (Don't be shocked if Paramount raises their offer.) [THR]

I Quote...

""Labubu doesn’t actually have that much of a story behind it, it’s just a strange-looking doll.""

— Chris Pereira, founder of consultancy iMpact, noting that Pop Mart, the Beijing-based company behind the phenomenon, needs to focus on evolving the brand, lest we hit ""Peak Labubu"" (which we may have already). Currently, the company is focused on expanding their retail footprint around the world. And yes, the movie is coming, directed by Paddington helmer Paul King, for Sony…

China’s box office shot up over 20% to $7.4B (roughly $1.5B behind the US per above) — largely on the back of two sequels, one local, one not: Ne Kha 2 (China’s biggest movie ever at $2.13B) and Disney’s Zootopia 2 (now Hollywood's biggest movie in China ever). Both, of course, are animated. [Variety]

I Spy...

Everyone has long joked about how CBS was the ""old person's network"", but it really is wild seeing these two charts side-by-side. The most popular channels watched by ""younger"" audiences are almost exactly the opposite of the most popular channels overall.

The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.
Rubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services.
Named for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert.
According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops.","Today at the Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang officially launched the company’s new Rubin computing architecture, which he described as the state of the art in AI hardware. The new architecture is currently in production and is expected to ramp up further in the second half of the year.

“Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.” Huang told the audience. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.”

The Rubin architecture, which was first announced in 2024, is the latest result of Nvidia’s relentless hardware development cycle, which has transformed Nvidia into the most valuable corporation in the world. The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.

Rubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services. Rubin systems will also be used in HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer and the upcoming Doudna supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Named for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink, systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.

Explaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems.

“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs. “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”

As expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.

Rubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2219673294.jpg?resize=1200,750",N,,2026-01-05 19:01:58.453381

So, are curling irons banned on flights, and does the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mention them on its website?","Delta Air Lines has recently been in the news for several reasons. Last week, the airline announced it would soon stop flying to Greater Binghamton Airport (BGM), leaving this facility without carriers. Delta Air Lines has also recently issued an apology after flight 2150 diverted to Atlanta.

Now, the company is once again in the news, but this time it’s because of its passengers. A Delta Air Lines customer was recently filmed while ironing her hair on a flight.

Here is a closer look at what happened, what users have said about the video, and whether this is illegal.

Delta Passenger Caught Using Curling Iron Mid-Flight

On Wednesday, December 31, a TikTok user posted a video that immediately caught the attention of thousands. The footage starts with the creator filming herself, then slightly moving the camera to show the passenger sitting next to her.

The woman is shown calmly curling her hair in mid-flight. The footage also displays the following sentence: “Middle seat curling iron at 30,000 feet is a bold choice.”

The video has already been watched by hundreds of thousands of people, and as of Monday, January 5, it has 176.2k likes and over 3.3k comments. The user who shared the footage also added a caption, tagging Delta and stating, “This feels dangerous.” So, what are TikTok users saying about this hazardous behavior?

Several People Shared Their Shock About The Passenger’s Behavior

The passenger's behavior seems part of a common trend, as people on social media continue to share videos of themselves flying with heatless curl devices to arrive at their final destination with the perfect look. Yet, there’s a massive difference between using heatless curl tools and a curling iron plugged into one of the plane’s outlets.

Plenty of other users commented on the video, sharing their reaction. For instance, a user commented, ""What’s wrong with yall? This is crazy."" Another wrote, ""This is actually insane,"" while many seemed interested in where the passenger plugged in the iron. However, Delta Air Lines has AC power outlets on most of its seats, making it relatively easy to use such devices. Yet, this doesn’t mean curling your hair mid-flight is a wise choice.

Several flight attendants left a comment stating that this is not allowed.

“Flight attendant here, you can't do that. Those outlets aren't meant for things like this,” a TikTok user wrote in a comment.

Some people also left funny comments, such as a user who wrote, “She’s focused on her and you’re focused on her. She is the main character in every life.” Other people pointed out her curling technique, stating that the section of hair was too large.

Unfortunately, these risky behaviors seem to be increasing.

“There was a literal announcement from the pilot on my last flight that the plug ins on planes are for phones only and to not curl straighten or blow dry your hair,” A TikTok user wrote in the comments.

So, are curling irons banned on flights, and does the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mention them on its website?

Are Curling Iron Banned On Planes?

The FAA official website states that cordless curling irons that use a hydrocarbon gas, such as butane, are allowed only in carry-on baggage. However, there is a limit, as each traveler can bring only one of these items.

The website also specifies that a safety cover must be securely fitted over the heating element of cordless curling irons. Furthermore, “The device must be protected from accidental activation.”

However, when it comes to electric curling irons and hair straighteners equipped with cord plugs, like the one shown in the video, there seems to be no restrictions. Yet, this doesn’t mean curling your hair mid-flight is acceptable.

​​​​​​

In this regard, a pilot left a comment under the video, reminding viewers of the fire risk and advising the user filming to call the cabin crew to stop the hazardous behavior.

So, are curling irons banned on planes? It seems that, for now, there is no clear regulation regarding these devices, though this may change soon as more people continue to exhibit dangerous behavior on board.",https://static0.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/passengers-on-a-delta-airlines-flight.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-05 19:59:42.935962

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.55 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

Albertsons (ACI) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:

Revenue: $24.88 billion vs analyst estimates of $24.72 billion (2.5% year-on-year growth, 0.6% beat)

Adjusted EPS: $0.55 vs analyst estimates of $0.54 (in line)

Adjusted EBITDA: $1.11 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.09 billion (4.5% margin, 1.9% beat)

Operating Margin: 1.8%, in line with the same quarter last year

Free Cash Flow Margin: 0.7%, down from 1.7% in the same quarter last year

Locations: 2,264 at quarter end, down from 2,269 in the same quarter last year

Same-Store Sales rose 2.8% year on year (1.4% in the same quarter last year)

Market Capitalization: $9.51 billion

""In the second quarter, we delivered solid operating and financial results while continuing to invest in our core business and elevate the customer experience,"" said Susan Morris, Chief Executive Officer.

Company Overview

With over 20 well-known grocery banners spanning 34 states, Albertsons ACI operates food and drug retail stores across the US, offering groceries, pharmacy services, and own-brand products under banners like Safeway, Jewel-Osco, and Vons.

Revenue Growth

A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years.

With $81.01 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Albertsons is a behemoth in the consumer retail sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there is only so much real estate to build new stores, placing a ceiling on its growth. For Albertsons to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices or lean into foreign markets.

As you can see below, Albertsons’s 3.1% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was sluggish as its store footprint remained unchanged.

This quarter, Albertsons reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.5% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%.

Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.5% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is above average for the sector and suggests its newer products will help support its historical top-line performance.

Store Performance

Number of Stores

A retailer’s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.

Albertsons operated 2,264 locations in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, has kept its store count flat while other consumer retail businesses have opted for growth.

When a retailer keeps its store footprint steady, it usually means demand is stable and it’s focusing on operational efficiency to increase profitability.

Same-Store Sales

A company's store base only paints one part of the picture. When demand is high, it makes sense to open more. But when demand is low, it’s prudent to close some locations and use the money in other ways. Same-store sales gives us insight into this topic because it measures organic growth for a retailer's e-commerce platform and brick-and-mortar shops that have existed for at least a year.

Albertsons’s demand rose over the last two years and slightly outpaced the industry. On average, the company’s same-store sales have grown by 2.2% per year. Given its flat store base over the same period, this performance stems from not only increased foot traffic at existing locations but also higher e-commerce sales as demand shifts from in-store to online.

In the latest quarter, Albertsons’s same-store sales rose 2.8% year on year. This performance was more or less in line with its historical levels.

Key Takeaways from Albertsons’s Q2 Results

It was encouraging to see Albertsons beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its gross margin missed. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $17.25 immediately following the results.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 00:57:51.922872

That’s a wrap for NVIDIA’s CES 2026 presentation.","CES 2026 is here!

Kicking things off for the major chipmakers today is NVIDIA, who is at the show to talk about all things AI – a hot topic across the entire industry at the moment.

NVIDIA CES 2026 Keynote Live Coverage Preview

As with most of NVIDIA’s major presentations, company CEO (and leather jacket enthusiast) Jensen Huang will be headlining NVIDIA’s CES keynote. Also as is usually the case, NVIDIA is being fairly mum about what they will be talking about ahead of the presentation, beyond the fact that it’s all going to be AI-related. And despite being a consumer show, it sounds like the keynote may be limited more towards Enterprise offerings, as NVIDIA’s GeForce group has a separate presentation scheduled for 9pm Pacific this evening. A presentation in which the GeForce group is already setting expectations by stating that there will be no new GPUs announced.

Unlike 2025, where NVIDIA helmed CES’s prime keynote spot, in 2026 they are a bit of an outlier. Officially, the event is not even a keynote open to all attendees, but rather a press conference limited to the media. And it’s not taking place in the Mandalay Bay or Venetian hotels – where most official CES events happen – but rather out at the Fontainebleau hotel. So NVIDIA is a bit off the beaten path this year, running their own press conference at their own hotel. Even the scheduling of the event was relatively late, with NVIDIA not publicly announcing the event until December.

As for what NVIDIA may have up their sleeve this year, NVIDIA’s enterprise hardware schedule calls for 2026 to be the year of Vera Rubin, with that hardware shipping at some point during the year. As well, NVIDIA always has new software to talk about since development of that is largely decoupled from their hardware. But how much they’ll have to say at a more generic venue like CES remains to be seen.

NVIDIA’s keynote kicks off at 1:00pm PST / 4:00pm EST / 21:00 UTC, and according to NVIDIA’s calendar hold, this should be a pretty meaty keynote that runs for about 90 minutes. So please join us in a bit for our live blog coverage of NVIDIA’s CES 2026 keynote.

(And, as always, please excuse any typos stemming from our live coverage)

NVIDIA CES 2025 Keynote Coverage Live

At this point it’s 6 minutes after the hour, and we’re still waiting on NVIDIA to get started. One thing that is in NVIDIA’s favor this year is that since this is not an official CES keynote, they should be able to get right to their presentation without the wrap-around CES/CTA introductions.

Another 6 minutes in and we’re still waiting. For better or worse, we’re not actually in Vegas to cover these keynotes. But it also means I can’t check in with the sportsbook to see what the odds are on NVIDIA starting with another “I am AI” video.

And with that said, here we go!

It looks like we are starting with a montage of GPU rendering and simulation technologies instead. RTX graphics, NVIDIA’s various robotics and physics simulation frameworks, etc.

And here’s Jensen.

3000 people in the auditorium, and another 3000 people in overflow rooms. Not to mention everyone watching the stream.

“Every 15 years the industry resets”

New platforms arise, and new applications get written for those platforms.

This time there are two platform shifts going on. Not just the shift to GPUs, but how applications are even developed. They’re not programmed, they’re trained.

“Computing has been fundamentally reshaped as a result of accelerated computing, as a result of artificial intelligence.”

The modernization of AI is attracting enormous amounts of investment into NVIDIA’s industry.

Jensen is recapping a busy 2025 for NVIDIA – and a larger recap of NVIDIA’s history with AI. As well as the phases of AI models and the rise of reasoning models.

2025 was the year of proliferation for “agentic” models that can do higher level reasoning. NVIDIA is betting big on agentic systems becoming important tools in processing data and providing services.

Finally, 2025 was the year of the proliferation of open models. Which makes AI technology more accessible to everyone.

“This entire industry is going to be reshaped because of that.”

NVIDIA has been making their own investments into open models. Which, in turn, has been what they’ve been using their array of company-owned DGX SuperPOD to train and develop.

“NVIDIA is a frontier AI model builder.” NVIDIA wants to enable every company to be part of the AI revolution.

NVIDIA’s models top the leaderboards in terms of performance and other metrics. All in service of helping NVIDIA’s customers develop AI agents.

Now on to reasoning, and how it is changing the face of AI models. To be able to reason beyond just what it has been explicitly trained on.

Building on top of that is multi-model and multi-modal agents, which can call each other based on their specialization and training.

Now rolling a video showing a short example of building a personal assistant using NVIDIA’s hardware and frameworks.

“The amazing thing is that is utterly trivial now.” But it would have been unimaginable a couple of years ago.

(Jensen has not been having much luck with his presentation screen and slide deck today)

Regardless, this is the future Jensen wants to move to. Development is tying together frameworks based on models that have already been trained to handle specific tasks, with further training and reasoning to expand the capabilities of these systems.

“The agentic system is the interface.”

And that is Enterprise AI being revolutionized by agentic systems.

Now on to physical AI.

A big challenge for physical AIs: object permanence. It’s not just learning the laws of the physical world, but keeping track of things that may not be their focus.

The hardware to make all of this happen is a trio of computers. Training on NVIDIA’s big iron hardware, inference at the edge with things like Thor, and then physical simulations using RTX Pro servers.

Jensen is also recapping the various models/frameworks NVIDIA offers for the task. Cosmos and Gr00t, which have been around for a couple of years now, and what appears to be a new model: Alpamayo.

Now rolling a video about Cosmos, NVIDIA’s physical AI simulation framework and world foundation model.

Cosmos can generate realistic video from images, and physically accurate simulations from 3D models. Even scenario prompts are enough to generate a video. “Cosmos turns compute into data.”

Cosmos has already been downloaded millions of times. And NVIDIA uses it internally for their self-driving automotive tech.

Announcing today: Alpamayo. The world’s first thinking and reasoning automotive AI.

Alpamayo isn’t just an AI for self-driving cars. But it is an AI that can explain why it is doing what it is doing, and its reasoning process that led to that decision.

Now rolling another video, this time of self-driving automotive tech. All hands-free and taken in a single long shot.

(The future of San Francisco is to be a city of robots)

NVIDIA’s video is interspersed with quotes. From what I gather, it sounds like they’ve been driving journalists around in their cars.

“We started working on self-driving cars 8 years ago”

Alpamayo is open source.

(This is the most enthusiastic I’ve seen Jensen about self-driving cars in a few years now)

The combination of NVIDIA hardware, frameworks, and now Alpamayo is the company’s first complete stack for self-driving cars.

Jensen thinks this will be one of the largest robotics industries.

Mercedes Benz CLA just went into production. It has already been rated the “world’s safest car” by one group.

Parallel to Alpamayo is the safety system that validates everything that Alpamayo does. Something that apparently took NVIDIA half a decade to build.

“We’re going to maintain the stack for as long as we shall live”

Note that the emphasis is on L4 vehicles, not L5 fully autonomous vehicles.

Ultimately, most everything here developed for self-driving automotive can also be applied to other forms of robotics.

NVIDIA is once again showing off the proof-of-concept droids they’ve been developing over the past couple of years. As well as how they were trained inside of a physically-accurate simulated environment.

How do you learn to be a robot? You do it all inside of Omniverse.

“We’re going to talk a lot more about robotics in the future”

NVIDIA has said before that they see robotics as the next great market for the company. Hence the heavy investment into robotics.

Jensen is now going on a tangent about chip design – which like everything else is becoming AI accelerated. So even the chips going into Jensen’s robots are going to be created in a simulation.

Now rolling a video about working with Siemens.

And now on to some hardware. Vera Rubin.

But first, a quick recap on the history of Vera Rubin the astronomer, and why NVIDIA named their next platform after her.

Vera Rubin is designed to address the insane demand for AI computing.

The number of tokens needed for cutting-edge inference has exploded, especially with the rise of thinking/reasoning models. And the race is on for AI to get to the next frontier.

All the while the cost per token continues to drop, making the higher number of tokens required economically viable.

NVIDIA is in full scale manufacturing of GB300 right now. And Vera Rubin will ship this year. Vera Rubin is in full production.

Now rolling a video about Vera Rubin.

1 Vera CPU + 2 Rubin GPUs.

The first Vera Rubin NVL72 rack is online.

“Moore’s Law has largely slowed”. So NVIDIA cannot keep up by just throwing more transistors at hardware. At least if they want to keep up their current pace.

So NVIDIA had to redesign all of their core chips in a single generation in order to improve performance and add functionality to keep up with client needs.

Despite only having 88 CPU cores, each one of the 176 threads on Vera can get its full performance. It is effectively a 176 core CPU.

NVIDIA has to employ extreme co-design across all of its chips in order to hit its performance goals.

Now talking about FP4 capabilities, and specifically NVIDIA’s NVFP4 format. Achieving higher throughput when the lower precision is acceptable, and using higher precision when required. All of which is handled adaptively.

And all of this is delivered with just 1.6x as many transistors for Vera Rubin versus Grace Blackwell.

The Vera Rubin compute tray is cable-free. The assembly time is down from 2 hours to 6 minutes. It is also 100% liquid cooled, versus just 80% for the Grace Blackwell compute tray.

Tying all of this together is NVIDIA’s family of networking hardware. ConnectX-9 NICs, BlueField 4 DPUs, and Spectrum-X networking platform. Networking performance has been critical in enabling scale-out scaling of NVIDIA GPU systems.

Spectrum-X is for East-West traffic, while BlueField 4 is for North-South traffic. BlueField 4 comes standard with every one of the Vera Rubin compute nodes.

NVLink 6 Switch chip employs 400G SerDes. Twice the speed of NVLink 5, and twice the speed of most everything else. So that every GPU can talk to every other GPU at the same time.

(Apparently they forgot to drain the water out of the NVL72 demo system before shipping it)

NVIDIA’s SerDes drive cables form the top of the rack to the bottom. 2 miles of copper cables in NVL72. The NVLink spine.

Vera Rubin’s power consumption is twice as high as Grace Blackwell. But NVIDIA is able to cool it with 45C water?!

NVL72 will offer 5x the inference performance, and 3.5x the training performance.

Spectrum-X chip with silicon photonics. 512 200G ports.

NVIDIA’s co-packaged optics technology was developed in conjunction with TSMC. It is essentially how NVIDIA is making faster optical networking speeds economically viable at the scale they need for a supercomputer.

Now in a segue to talking about tokens and key value (KV) caching.

Inference generates a massive amount of context data – too much to keep on AI nodes. That data either must be tossed and recomputed, or a way is found to efficiently store it.

Enter NVIDIA’s Context Memory Storage Platform.

All made possible with NVIDIA’s ConnectX and BlueField networking products.

All combined, this makes up a Vera Rubin pod.

In other news, the entire system is now capable of confidential computing. Blackwell was previously capable of confidential computing, but Grace was not. Now, Vera is, meaning it can work in concert with Rubin to allow for confidential computing (encryption) over the whole rack/pod.

Rubin can train an example model in 1/4 of the time. Or constant time with 1/4 as many GPUs.

And very quickly recapping NVIDIA’s announcements. That’s a wrap for NVIDIA’s CES 2026 presentation.",https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NVIIDA-CES-2026-Live-Blog-Hero.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 18:02:18.923783

Build Your Own Adobe Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?","In early January 2026, Jefferies downgraded Adobe to Hold, citing slower topline trends since fiscal 2023 and limited near-term revenue impact from its artificial intelligence offerings.

This move has sharpened attention on whether Adobe’s growing AI usage and integrations can translate into material, measurable revenue contributions amid rising competition.

Next, we’ll examine how Jefferies’ concerns about Adobe’s AI monetization and growth trajectory may reshape the company’s existing investment narrative.

We've found 14 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.

Adobe Investment Narrative Recap

To own Adobe today, you need to believe its creative and document software, now infused with AI, can keep customers loyal and willing to pay for subscriptions even as competition intensifies. The key near term catalyst is clearer AI monetization in products like Firefly and Acrobat AI Assistant; Jefferies’ downgrade highlights that this remains unproven in revenue terms. The biggest current risk is that faster moving AI rivals pressure Adobe’s growth and pricing power over time.

Piper Sandler’s recent reiteration of an Overweight rating and its comments on AI influenced annual recurring revenue above US$8,000,000,000 sit in sharp contrast to Jefferies’ caution. That update underscores how much of the Adobe debate now hinges on whether rising AI usage and credit consumption eventually show up as sustainable, incremental revenue, or simply deepen the value of the existing subscription base without materially speeding top line growth.

Yet beneath Adobe’s strong AI story, there is a growing concern investors should be aware of regarding intensifying competition and potential pricing pressure...

Read the full narrative on Adobe (it's free!)

Adobe's narrative projects $29.3 billion revenue and $8.7 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 9.0% yearly revenue growth and about a $1.8 billion earnings increase from $6.9 billion today.

Uncover how Adobe's forecasts yield a $447.56 fair value, a 34% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Some of the most optimistic analysts had been assuming Adobe could reach about US$31,200,000,000 in revenue and US$11,400,000,000 in earnings by 2028, but Jefferies’ AI monetization concerns highlight how quickly that upbeat view could be challenged and why you should compare these contrasting forecasts before deciding what you believe.

How does Nvidia keep its car safe?

Nvidia says it has spent years building an entire AV stack that's fully traceable, running both stacks at the same time as a guardrail against accidents and scenarios you can't legislate against. A real shot across Tesla's bow.

More Alpamayo - coming to Mercedes Benz CLA

""Not only does your car drive as you would expect it to drive, it reasons about every scenario and tells you what it's about to do.""

The first AV car powered by Alpamayo is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA, shipping to the U.S. in Q1. It has been rated as the world's safest car by NCAP.

Nvidia Alpamayo: A thinking, reasoning AI model for vehicles

Powered by the Cosmos AI model, Nvidia has created Alpamayo, an AI model used for autonomous vehicles. It can reason every action: From the actions it's about to take, how it reasoned that action, and then developing a trajectory.

Huang claims that it's based on a large amount of human training and supplemented by Cosmos' synthetic data. The keynote has now shifted to a real-world example of the model working in action, with a car (in San Francisco) taking turns and making decisions on the fly. Huang notes that it's impossible to get every single possible scenario, but breaking these tasks down can be understood by the AI model if it reasons through it.

Full-stack Phsyical AI: Compute becomes data

Jensen is explaining how several computers, connected through Nvidia Omniverse, can create a full-stack AI platform through training (GB300), Simulation (RTX Pro), and inference (labelled THOR). By utilizing multiple models aligned with language, compute power has become data, Jensen says.

Synthetic data, grounded by physics, can be used in a Cosmos foundation model to become physically-based, digestible data to train a new AI platform. This could curtail the requirement for real-world training data for Physical AI platforms, aligning elements like trajectory predictions into real-world, usable data for training.

Nvidia Brev: Creating closed agentic sandboxes

Using a new tool called Nvidia Brev, the company has demoed an environement that can hook up to a DGX spark inside a closed environment for a variety of AI applications, or connecting it to frontier models via HuggingFace. A couple of examples were given, including integrating it with robotics.

""Isn't that incredible?"", Jensen remarks, before mentioning that just a few years ago, it would have been impossible. Thanks to using a variety of applications, named an Agentic framework, Brev creates the architecture of applications across a closed sandbox.

— Sayem Ahmed

AI tops leaderboards across the industry

Nvidia's models are topping leaderboards, with the hopes that it can make developers utilize and create AI agents in order to research, models, and more easily. With reasoning capabilities, AI models no longer have to understand everything in a single day.

Jensen mentioned Perplecity as an example of how it would create an AI reasoning chain to create a multi-model, making just about anything fit a certain task, which has empowered AI startups — all thanks to Nvidia's technology, of course.

— Jeffrey Kampman

Nvidia's focus on frontier models across industries

Huang reiterated that it's not a cloud distribution service, as DGX cloud winds down to R&D, it's now focused on developing frontier models like Earth 2, Cosmos, a world foundation model, GR00T for robotics and locomotion, and more.

Huang states that he open-sources these models, but also the datasets behind them, so developers understand what makes things tick, with the intention for every company to take part in the incoming AI developments. And just like that, the lights go out, and Jensen makes a joke.

— Jeffrey Kampman

Inventing a new world with AI

100 trillion dollars of industry investment is shifting over to AI, or so Jensen Huang claims. The CEO states that R&D budgets are now pouring in, perhaps to cool down claims of circular funding in the AI industry. The CEO is now shifting the conversation into a history lesson for AI models, reiterating that Agentic models like Cursor are a focus for 2026 and beyond.

— Sayem Ahmed

Jensen Huang takes to the stage

Slightly later than expected, the show has now officially begun, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang taking the stage to lay out what 2026 and beyond might hold for Nvidia. Expect Nvidia to press on topics like AI, data centers, and robotics. While it might not be quite as exciting as the launch of a new consumer graphics card, whatever is announced over the course of the keynote will likely set the tone for the rest of the industry to follow for the rest of the year.

— Sayem Ahmed

Nvidia is late to its own party

Despite a slick preshow, Nvidia has yet to officially commence its keynote, running around ten minutes later than anticipated. You'd think that with the vast resources available to Nvidia, they'd run on time. Perhaps an AI model running a calendar hallucinated somewhere?

Regardless, the industry is waiting with bated breath for things to kick off, and we'll be right here reporting the latest, as it happens.

— Sayem Ahmed

The preshow is over: T-minus 3 minutes until the keynote begins

The preshow is now over, and Huang is expected to take the stage in three minutes to kick things off in earnest. Being rolled onto the stage is a high-resolution screen, with some semi-dramatic music playing, and we'll expect to hear more shortly. While this is fun, what are the odds that the music is AI-generated?

There may be some expectation that Huang will emerge carrying some kind of object. We've seen him roll out with robots and even a shield made of chips before; surely the company has the cash for more than just a new leather jacket.

— Sayem Ahmed

Nvidia preshow kicks off CES festivities

While Jensen Huang hasn't taken to the stage yet, Nvidia has a 'pre-game' show, where its showing a manner of applications that use Nvidia tech, complete with an interview panel ahead of time. While it's a neat warm-up, don't expect anything too staggering while things are still kicking off.

Huang is set to take the stage at 1 p.m. PT, so there's not too long to wait until we get to the real meat of today's keynote.

— Sayem Ahmed

It's Jensen's world, and we're just living in it

In 2025, Nvidia had one of its best years to date. It launched the RTX 50 series, and its data center profits skyrocketed. However, 2026 paints a very different picture. With the AI industry booming, and hyperscalers shovelling investment into new data centers like there's no tomorrow, the industry is waiting with bated breath to see exactly what course Huang might plot for 2026 and beyond. Needless to say, the entire industry will hear the reverberations.

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.55 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

""In the second quarter, we delivered solid operating and financial results while continuing to invest in our core business and elevate the customer experience,"" said Susan Morris, Chief Executive Officer.

Company Overview

With over 20 well-known grocery banners spanning 34 states, Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) operates food and drug retail stores across the US, offering groceries, pharmacy services, and own-brand products under banners like Safeway, Jewel-Osco, and Vons.

Revenue Growth

A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years.

With $81.01 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Albertsons is a behemoth in the consumer retail sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there is only so much real estate to build new stores, placing a ceiling on its growth. For Albertsons to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices or lean into foreign markets.

As you can see below, Albertsons’s 3.1% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was sluggish as its store footprint remained unchanged.

This quarter, Albertsons reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.5% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%.

Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.5% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is above average for the sector and suggests its newer products will help support its historical top-line performance.

Store Performance

Number of Stores

A retailer’s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.

Albertsons operated 2,264 locations in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, has kept its store count flat while other consumer retail businesses have opted for growth.

When a retailer keeps its store footprint steady, it usually means demand is stable and it’s focusing on operational efficiency to increase profitability.

Same-Store Sales

A company's store base only paints one part of the picture. When demand is high, it makes sense to open more. But when demand is low, it’s prudent to close some locations and use the money in other ways. Same-store sales gives us insight into this topic because it measures organic growth for a retailer's e-commerce platform and brick-and-mortar shops that have existed for at least a year.

Albertsons’s demand rose over the last two years and slightly outpaced the industry. On average, the company’s same-store sales have grown by 2.2% per year. Given its flat store base over the same period, this performance stems from not only increased foot traffic at existing locations but also higher e-commerce sales as demand shifts from in-store to online.

In the latest quarter, Albertsons’s same-store sales rose 2.8% year on year. This performance was more or less in line with its historical levels.

Key Takeaways from Albertsons’s Q2 Results

It was encouraging to see Albertsons beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its gross margin missed. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $17.25 immediately following the results.",https://assets.barchart.com/img/barchart-og.png,N,,2026-01-05 17:02:00.791878

FDA Accepts NDA for Low-Sodium Oxybate TRN-257 in Narcolepsy and Idiopathic Hypersomnia

At the beginning of the month, on December 9, 2025, the FDA accepted Tris Pharma’s new drug application (NDA) for TRN-257 for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy, as well as excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with idiopathic hypersomnia, with a PDUFA date set for June 20, 2026.1 The agent incorporates 2 of the company’s proprietary technology platforms, RaftWorks and LiquiXR, to achieve a controlled-release profile and support a once-nightly, low-sodium dosing regimen.

The NDA submission is supported by data from multiple pharmacokinetic and safety studies and incorporates Model-Informed Drug Development-based approaches to showcase the efficacy and safety of TRN-257. According to Tris Pharma, the submission also references the agency's prior safety and efficacy findings for currently marketed oxybate products. In addition, it includes a comprehensive Human Factors Engineering and Usability Engineering study report, which demonstrated that representative patients were generally able to perform tasks and use TRN-257 as intended when following the proposed labeling.

""Currently, patients face a difficult trade-off with existing treatments that either burden them with high sodium levels, posing significant cardiovascular risks, or require disruptive twice-nightly dosing that interrupts sleep, that otherwise is intended to induce sleep,"" Maurice M. Ohayon, MD, DSc, PhD, professor and director of the Stanford Sleep Epidemiology Research Center at Stanford University, said in a statement.1 ""As the first oxybate formulation to combine a convenient once-nightly regimen with the lowest sodium content, TRN-257 is uniquely designed to eliminate this compromise.""

FDA Clears Pivotal Phase 3 PREVAiLS Study of Pridopidine in Early, Rapidly Progressive ALS

A couple of days later, on December 11, 2025, the FDA cleared the initiation of a pivotal, 500-patient, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial dubbed PREVAiLS, which will assess the efficacy and safety of pridopidine (Prilenia Therapeutics/Ferrer) in patients with early-stage, rapidly progressive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The company noted that recruitment at the first clinical trial sites in the United States is planned to begin in early 2026, with international sites expected to follow pending regulatory approval.2

PREVAiLS will enroll adults diagnosed with definite or probable ALS who are within 18 months of symptom onset across up to 60 ALS treatment centers worldwide. The trial design consists of a 48-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, randomized 3:2 to receive either pridopidine or placebo, followed by a 48-week open-label extension. The primary end point is change from baseline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R), adjusted for mortality, at 48 weeks while secondary and exploratory end points include measures of speech, respiratory and bulbar function, quality of life, survival, patient-reported outcomes, and plasma biomarkers.

“This study has the clear aim of evaluating the efficacy and safety of a much-needed new treatment option for ALS,” PREVAiLS steering committee member and investigator Sabrina Paganoni, MD, PhD, co-director of Massachusetts General Hospital Neurological Clinical Research Institute, said in a statement.2 “Early detection and management are essential for preserving function, with slowing of functional decline, maintaining speech and prolonging survival being ALS therapeutic priorities. This makes pridopidine’s S1R activation mechanism of particular interest, holding promise in ALS by enhancing key cellular mechanisms and promoting neuroprotection.""

FDA Approves Inebilizumab for AChR- and MuSK-Positive Generalized Myasthenia Gravis

On the same day, on December 11, 2025, the FDA approved inebilizumab (Uplizna; Amgen) for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are antiacetylcholine receptor (AChR) and antimuscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive. This marks the third FDA-approved indication for inebilizumab, following approvals in antiaquaporin-4 antibody positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and immunoglobulin G4–related disease.3

The approval of inebilizumab for gMG is supported by data from the phase 3 MINT trial (NCT04524273). In the trial, 238 patients with gMG were randomly assigned 1:1 to either intravenous ineblizumab 300 mg (n = 119) or placebo (n = 119) for a 12-month period. Change from baseline in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MD-ADL), the study’s primary end point, was statistically significant for inebilizumab-treated patients, with scores of –4.2 compared with –2.2 for those on placebo (P <.0001). The therapy showed a safe and well tolerated profile, consistent with prior safety findings.

""This approval is a truly meaningful milestone – personally, as the global principal investigator for MINT, and most importantly, for the many patients who will benefit. I’m thrilled to see a new FDA-approved option for patients living with this rare and debilitating disease, and for the clinicians who care for them,"" global principal investigator Richard J. Nowak, MD, MS, director of the Myasthenia Gravis Clinic and associate professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine, told NeurologyLive®. ""This approval represents significant progress for the gMG community and adds an important new option to the clinical toolbox.""

Tolebrutinib Falls Short in Phase 3 PERSEUS Study, Forcing Decision to Redact Regulatory Submission

A few days later, on December 15, 2025, Sanofi’s tolebrutinib, an investigational Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, did not meet its end points in the phase 3 PERSEUS study (NCT04458051) of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), and a regulatory submission is therefore not expected. In addition, it’s been reported that the FDA has pushed back its review of the agent as a treatment for nonrelapsing secondary progressive MS (nrSPMS).4

More detailed results from the global, double-blind, randomized trial are expected to be presented at an upcoming meeting. In the release, it was noted that tolebrutinib did not meet its primary end point of delaying time of onset of 6-month composite confirmed disability progression (CDP) compared with placebo in the study cohort, which included those aged 18-55 with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of between 2.0 and 6.5.

""We are disappointed by today’s results; however, we do believe that these results will improve our understanding of the underlying disease biology of multiple sclerosis,"" Houman Ashrafian, executive vice president and head of Research & Development at Sanofi, said in a statement.4 ""We extend our deepest appreciation to the study participants, their families, and healthcare professionals who support our scientific and innovative vision. Our commitment to the multiple sclerosis community remains unchanged, as do our efforts to pursue novel advancements that address existing unmet needs and we remain confident in the value tolebrutinib can bring to those living with non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.""

FDA Expands Indication for n‐Butyl Cyanoacrylate in Chronic Subdural Hematoma

A few days later, on December 18, 2025, the FDA approved the expanded indication for Johnson & Johnson's n‐butyl cyanoacrylate (Trufill) liquid embolic system as an adjunct to surgery for middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization in patients with symptomatic subacute and chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH). The company noted that therapy has been used in neurovascular embolization for more than 25 years and has supported the treatment of arteriovenous malformations since its initial FDA approval in 2000.5

The approval was supported by findings from the MEMBRANE randomized controlled trial (NCT04816591), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of MMA embolization in approximately 376 adult patients with cSDH. In trial, researchers observed a statistically significant treatment benefit with n-butyl cyanoacrylate compared with standard of care in patients treated with or without surgery (P = .044).2 Overall, the study demonstrated superior efficacy of n-butyl cyanoacrylate and supported its safety in the treatment of cSDH.

“The MEMBRANE trial provides high-quality evidence that treating the subdural membrane itself with MMA embolization with Trufill nBCA as an adjunct to surgery prevents recurrence in patients with chronic subdural hematomas,"" investigator Chris Kellner, MD, the director of Cerebrovascular & Intercerebral Hemorrhage programs at Mount Sinai told NeurologyLive®. "" We are proud at Mount Sinai to have led the clinical trial and to partner with J&J in the future to train neurointerventionists and educate the community about this new treatment.""

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-05 19:42:06+00:00,Fortune,"After Nvidia's Groq deal, these AI chip startups are in play—and one hoping to disrupt them all",Sharon Goldman,,,,,https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-groq-deal-ai-chip-startups-in-play/,"It also lifts AI inference software platform startups like Etched, Fireworks, and Baseten, strengthening their valuations and making them more attractive acquisition targets in 2026, according to analysts, founders, and investors.
Like Groq, D-Matrix is focused on trading some of the flexibility of Nvidia’s GPUs for greater speed and efficiency when running AI models.
But that moat is now gone with the Groq deal, Feldman wrote.
A value prop that can only be achieved by a different chip architecture than the GPU.” Still, not everyone is convinced that every inference chip startup will benefit equally.
His critique: companies like Groq, D-Matrix, and Cerebras may be well positioned in today’s market, but they are still optimizing within the same digital computing paradigm.","The Groq deal bolsters the standing of other startups building their own AI chips, including Cerebras, D-Matrix, and SambaNova—which Intel has reportedly signed a term sheet to acquire—as well as newer players like U.K.-based chip startup Fractile. It also lifts AI inference software platform startups like Etched, Fireworks, and Baseten, strengthening their valuations and making them more attractive acquisition targets in 2026, according to analysts, founders, and investors.

Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI Research, pointed to the Microsoft-backed D-Matrix, which raised $275 million last month at a $2 billion valuation. Like Groq, D-Matrix is focused on trading some of the flexibility of Nvidia’s GPUs for greater speed and efficiency when running AI models. “I’m sure D-Matrix is a pretty happy startup right now,” Freund said. “I suspect their next round will be at a much higher valuation.”

Cerebras, another inference-focused chip company, also appears well positioned. Known for its dinner-plate-sized “wafer-scale” chip designed to run extremely large models on a single piece of silicon, Cerebras has filed for an IPO after a previous delay. Freund said the company has increasingly been viewed as a potential acquisition target as well. “You don’t want to wait until after the IPO, when it’s more expensive,” he said. “From that perspective, Cerebras is sitting pretty right now.”

Nvidia-Groq deal has clarified market’s direction

Executives at these companies say Nvidia’s move has helped clarify the market’s direction. “When [the Nvidia-Groq deal] happened, we said, ‘Finally, the market recognizes it,’” Sid Sheth, CEO of D-Matrix, told Fortune. “I think what Nvidia has really done is they said, Okay, this approach is a winning approach.”

And Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman posted on X that, in the past, the perception that Nvidia GPUs were all you needed for AI acted as a moat, keeping AI chip startups for nibbling away at Nvidia’s marketshare. But that moat is now gone with the Groq deal, Feldman wrote. “It reflects a growing industry reality—the inference market is fragmenting, and a new category has emerged where speed isn’t a feature—it’s the entire value proposition. A value prop that can only be achieved by a different chip architecture than the GPU.”

Still, not everyone is convinced that every inference chip startup will benefit equally. Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said the chip sector remains a difficult one for venture investors, given the high capital requirements and long timelines. “A lot of VCs stopped investing in chips 10 or 15 years ago,” Murphy said. “It’s capital-intensive, it takes years to get a product out, and the outcomes are hard to predict.”

That said, he pointed to Fireworks, and AI inference platform which raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October, as a startup with a technical advantage, thanks to a founding team filled with engineers who built Pytorch an. But he added that it remains unclear how much of the current enthusiasm reflects genuine technical differentiation. “it’s hard to tell who’s really got something significant versus the tide is [raising] all boats, which is what seems to be going on,” he said, adding that consolidation across the sector now appears increasingly likely.

New entrant seeks true disruption

But at least one veteran of the AI hardware world argues that even today’s inference-focused startups are not truly disruptive.

Naveen Rao, former SVP of AI at Databricks and founder of MosaicML, recently left Databricks to start Unconventional AI, which last month confirmed a massive $475 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures. His critique: companies like Groq, D-Matrix, and Cerebras may be well positioned in today’s market, but they are still optimizing within the same digital computing paradigm.

After Nvidia’s Groq deal validated demand for faster, more efficient inference, startups that fit neatly into today’s AI stack suddenly look far more valuable — not because they reinvented computing, Rao argues, but because they work within it. Unconventional AI is pursuing a more radical path: building new hardware that exploits the physical behavior of silicon itself, and redesigning neural networks to match it.

“We’ve been building the same fundamental machine for 80 years, a numeric digital machine,” he said. “But there was never one workload that dominated even more than 2% of all compute cycles.” That is changing, he explained: In a few years, 95% of all compute will be used for AI.

From that standpoint, it’s important to construct an entirely different machine than what is built today, he said. However, Rao says the effort could take five years or more to bear fruit — and is not intended to capitalize on the current inference boom.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/54195259582_a575397bf5_o-e1738260860238.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-05 15:01:38.276701

To that point, she continued, “Nobody wants to see the same ad three times.” Most ad content, she added, “is dead on arrival after a week, maybe two weeks.
Now with AI – and with I want to put the word ‘responsible AI’ out there – you can do it in hours.
For example, there might be an advertiser who wants to be the first ad in an ad pod right after a holiday kiss.
How do we make that advertiser really, really relevant in that moment?” AI can create “a great marriage between the viewer and the advertiser experience,” Shepard added.","Senior execs from NBCUniversal, Amazon‘s AWS, Adobe and ad agency WPP discussed the tricky balance between embracing AI and safeguarding IP during a panel discussion Monday at CES.

“We’ve been talking about personalization for decades,” said Hannah Elsakr, VP of GenAI New Business Ventures at Adobe. To that point, she continued, “Nobody wants to see the same ad three times.” Most ad content, she added, “is dead on arrival after a week, maybe two weeks. … We’ve talked about a promo taking two-plus weeks to execute. Now with AI – and with I want to put the word ‘responsible AI’ out there – you can do it in hours.

Programmers and advertisers are “in a fight for attention,” Elsakr said. “So, being able to be relevant and let the fan drive the narrative, that, to me, is the new definition of personalization of the brand.”

Kristina Shepard, EVP of Streaming & Performance Sales & Partnerships at NBCU cited a number of initiatives at the media giant that are designed to take advantage of the speed of AI tools.

Buyers and sellers of ad time can now use AI “to get down, not just to a show or an episode, but to a scene level,” Shepard said. “Contextual targeting in some regard has gotten a bad rap because it has seemed very basic, right? An advertiser would say, ‘I want to reach women 25 to 54, give me the top 100 shows.’ Now, AI can allow us to actually identify scenes. For example, there might be an advertiser who wants to be the first ad in an ad pod right after a holiday kiss. How do we make that advertiser really, really relevant in that moment?”

AI can create “a great marriage between the viewer and the advertiser experience,” Shepard added. “We basically beta-tested this with a luxury brand, you know, doing contextual targeting in VOD content in 2026, you’ll see this in live” at upcoming NBCU events like the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics.

One scenario, she said, would be enabling creative messages to allude to what is happening in a live sporting event. “Imagine a touchdown happens in the third quarter of a game and that next ad pod says, ‘Congratulations for the touchdown brought you by said brand.'”

In the case of the luxury brand, she added, NBCU research found that viewers got 27% more enjoyment from that experience, and search engagement jumped 56% for the brand. Search and purchase intent, the so-called “lower funnel” parts of the advertising experience (as opposed to upper-funnel efforts to create awareness), are “the holy grail for all advertisers,” Shepard said. NBCU’s experience “shows the benefit that television can be both an upper and lower funnel medium.”

Samira Panah Bakhtiar, General Manager of Media & Entertainment, Games, and Sports at AWS, pointed to the larger context in which all viewing and advertising is occurring.

“I think we have to think about where the audiences are,” she said. “Gen Z right now is spending 54% more time on social and they’re spending 26% less time on traditional viewing experiences. And if you look at some of the creators right now who are really able to capitalize themselves in a marvelous way.” She cited Dude Perfect or Mr. Beast, whose valuations are “rivaling more traditional brands.”

The emergence of creators “isn’t just an anomaly. These are creators who have very, very loyal fan bases who have learned how to be able to really cultivate production level content and higher media executives and get institutional investment and have figured out ways to be able to only create that content, but distribute that content at scale.”

Any companies “seeking this to reinvent themselves, or be able to capitalize on this moment,” she said, need to “really pay attention to the multi-generational preferences that exist in the viewing sphere right now.”",https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2806-e1767638758106.jpeg?w=1024,N,,2026-01-05 15:13:58.140043

Parker Hannifin P/E Compared to Competitors

The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.

Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 39.37 in the Machinery industry, Parker Hannifin Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 31.85. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.

In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth.

Click to get this free report Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL): Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","Ralph Lauren (RL) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.

The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.

Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.

As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ralph Lauren is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.

Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices

The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.

For Ralph Lauren, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.

Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions

As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .

Earnings Estimate Revisions for Ralph Lauren

For the fiscal year ending March 2026, this upscale clothing company is expected to earn $15.29 per share, which is unchanged compared with the year-ago reported number.

Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ralph Lauren. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.3%.

Bottom Line

Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of ""buy"" and ""sell"" ratings for its entire universe of more than 4,000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a ""Strong Buy"" rating and the next 15% get a ""Buy"" rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

The upgrade of Ralph Lauren to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

Pharmacy Times: What changes in policy or practice are needed to expand the impact of psychiatric pharmacists in SUD treatment?
At the VA, where I practice, the states where I hold pharmacist licenses don’t allow pharmacists to have DEA licenses, and the requirements are very specific.
That said, psychiatric pharmacists bring so much value that integration into health systems should clearly be beneficial and cost-saving overall.
Overall, psychiatric pharmacists have a lot to offer, and that’s demonstrated by those working in the field every day.","Pharmacy Times: How do psychiatric pharmacists collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to improve SUD care and patient outcomes?

Aaron Salwan, PharmD, MPH, BCCP: We certainly talked about how we interface with physicians or prescribers. Another aspect that I don’t know if anyone appreciates, or has the same experience in a different specialty, is that we work very closely with case managers, social workers, and counselors. We could have the best idea for what medicine could be helpful, but if the patient has no way to access it, then it’s not useful at all.

I have a close relationship with our counselors and discharge planners, trying to ensure that as patients move from one phase of treatment to another, there’s not a lapse in care. Another, more clinical approach is that if I observe a patient in a group and see their behavior is different or has changed, and I can link it to a medication that was newly started or adjusted, that turns into more of an interdisciplinary conversation.

Instead of going directly to the physician and saying, “Hey, I think you need to do this,” it involves other members of the care team. We ask questions like, “Did you notice this?” or “I think this patient has this type of issue—what do you think?” It becomes truly collaborative before we pull the trigger on a change like that.

Pharmacy Times: What changes in policy or practice are needed to expand the impact of psychiatric pharmacists in SUD treatment?

Ashley Maister, PharmD, BCCP: As someone who practices with a scope of practice, I think the ability to do things—not necessarily independently—but to prescribe and get medication to the patient faster is really important. Being able to follow through on what we’ve already discussed and agreed to with the patient is critical. With the removal of the X-waiver, allowing psychiatric pharmacists, especially those working in substance use disorder clinics, to prescribe buprenorphine or controlled substances would improve continuity of care.

At the VA, where I practice, the states where I hold pharmacist licenses don’t allow pharmacists to have DEA licenses, and the requirements are very specific. If you’re not at the VA and you’re working in a state like Pennsylvania, you can’t, for example, have an Idaho pharmacist license. The federal umbrella helps in some ways, but it also adds extra expense and upkeep.

If pharmacists, regardless of the state where they practice, were able to have DEA licenses and independently initiate and manage buprenorphine, I think that would expand their impact and strengthen their role in patient follow-up.

Salwan: That’s exactly where my mind went as well—the ability to prescribe and have a DEA license. It does seem that laws have changed so pharmacists in nearly every state are able to administer long-acting injectables. I don’t know what the uptake has been, but there’s a need for reimbursement, so pharmacists in any setting are inclined to offer that service.

Many of the skills pharmacists provide aren’t always billable or tied to a diagnostic code that would make adding a psychiatric pharmacist to a clinic seem profitable. That said, psychiatric pharmacists bring so much value that integration into health systems should clearly be beneficial and cost-saving overall. From a more structural or infrastructure point of view, there also needs to be greater support for addiction services and harm reduction services.

This includes sterile syringe programs, drug testing devices, and access to Narcan or naloxone. These are things we can never have enough of given the needs of our population.

Its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO) made an announcement that shook up Lilly stock Monday.

Drugmakers are in stiff competition to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market oral weight-loss drugs vs. the current injectable treatments. Novo Nordisk hit a milestone Monday and pulled ahead in the battle.

Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound are in a class of medicines called GLP-1 receptor agonists, which are designed to help lower blood sugar and support weight loss.

Lilly stock fell as Novo announced it will offer its new Wegovy weight-loss pill in the U.S. beginning Monday. Novo will sell the Wegovy pill at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies, including CVS Health (CVS) and Costco (COST), as well as its own direct outlet.

Eli Lilly makes weight-loss drugs, including Zepbound, a weekly injectable treatment. But Lilly has an investigational, once-daily oral medication named orforglipron that is being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Orforglipron is currently in clinical trials. Lilly said preliminary results for orforglipron have been positive, and additional data is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2026.

Eli Lilly is also on the IBD Big Cap 20 and an IBD Leaderboard watchlist name. It was an IBD SwingTrader holding, but was removed with Monday's drop.

Eli Lilly Stock Falls On Rival News

Eli Lilly stock reversed nearly 4% lower after initially rising to start Monday' session. Shares undercut their 21-day exponential moving average and are testing their 10-week moving average.

The drug stock sits in a newly formed first-stage flat base with a 1,111.99 buy point, according to MarketSurge pattern recognition. The buy point also stands as its all-time high, reached on Nov. 26. Lilly stock formed a bullish three-weeks pattern with a 1,088.48 entry point within the flat base.

The flat base formed after its rapid climb from a consolidation pattern breakout in early November, triggering ""Ants Indicators.""

Its relative strength line is falling with Monday's drop. But its IBD Timeliness Rating of A indicates potential positive relative price performance over the next 12 months.

Its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A indicates heavy institutional buying over the last 13 weeks. And its beefy 2.2 up/down volume ratio shows positive demand over the last 50 days.

The drug stock holds a respectable 90 Relative Strength Rating whereas Novo Nordisk has been a true laggard with its 14 RS Rating.

Lilly Profit Expected To Rise

Eli Lilly reported a blockbuster quarter in September with nearly 500% profit growth and 54% sales growth.

Lilly's profit took off in 2024 and more than doubled to $12.99 per share after dropping 20% in 2023. Full-year 2025 estimates expect 83% growth to $23.77 per share, followed by a 37% jump to $32.50 per share in 2026.

Its revenue growth averaged around 45% over the last four quarters. But forecasts see growth slowing to the 32% to 34% range over the next two quarters.

Lastly, Lilly stock holds an ideal 99 Composite Rating and a 98 Earnings Per Share Rating.

Here are some of the laws and policies that will take effect in 2026—many of which continue to push forward on important issues for workers despite what the federal government has in store.

Anti-DEI measures

Trump has made anti-DEI policies a focal point of his time in office, kicking off this year with a number of executive orders that forced federal agencies to terminate all DEI-related policies and programs and stripped away a requirement for federal contractors that had been a crucial element of diversifying the workforce. That means, going into 2026, all federal DEI programs have been eliminated—but there are a number of state-level bills that seek to curtail how DEI is utilized in hiring and across public education.

In Ohio, for example, legislation that passed this year prohibits any consideration of DEI in hiring decisions at public colleges and universities. Similar laws in Kansas, Idaho, and Wyoming will curtail DEI programs for hiring across higher education.

Meanwhile, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—the agency tasked with enforcing antidiscrimination laws in employment—has made clear that corporate DEI programs will be under greater scrutiny going into 2026.

The use of AI in hiring

As companies have embedded AI into their hiring process, many HR teams have started relying on automated résumé screeners and other AI tools. In 2026, three laws will take effect at the state level to create some guardrails around how AI is being used for employment decisions, following in the footsteps of New York City and California, which have already adopted AI in hiring laws.

Colorado and Texas are introducing broader AI governance laws that also explicitly call for more oversight of how the technology is used in the hiring process to ensure it is not discriminatory. In Illinois, the law is an amendment of the state’s Human Rights Act and regulates how workers are impacted by the use of AI in all employment decisions. At the federal level, a bipartisan bill introduced in Congress last month would—if passed—force employers to disclose when layoffs are caused by AI.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-191464809-these-laws-will-change-how-you-work-in-2026.jpg",N,,2026-01-05 14:16:05.252416

Edouard Caraco shares with the background to this takeover, his vision for the company’s development- underpinned by the app’s performance- and the founding duo’s plans in the luxury sector.

FashionNetwork.com: Showroomprivé has officially confirmed that it has sold its majority stake in The Bradery to you. When did you start negotiating this takeover, given that the group's initial plan was to acquire 100% of the capital? What were the main points of discussion, given the group's financial challenges?

Edouard Caraco: The takeover stemmed from several factors. For me, the key was that Tim (co-founder Timothée Linyer) and I were convinced of the market’s potential. We spent a great deal of time over the past year preparing the project, and that really drove the discussions. We felt as though we were letting go of our baby, even though we were only at the beginning of what we were capable of achieving. Reacquiring The Bradery is about taking a long-term view. I think that when we ceded the majority stake, we were also less mature. We were in a rush about everything. I still like to move fast, but I now see that continuity is a very positive virtue in an economic environment that can be unstable. That’s what we offer our partner brands, our customers, and our team.

FNW: Yes, but why did you give up the majority stake when Showroomprivé came in?

EC: When Showroomprivé came in, it was the end of the Covid period. We had experienced a very strong surge after our launch, and we didn’t really know whether we had been propelled by the online consumption boom of that period or whether we had the opportunity to build a longer-term business. And, as I said, we were young and in a hurry. Since then, the company has continued to grow strongly. Tim and I have been friends since we were 10. We feel incredibly fortunate to have a company that performs, that’s growing, with an amazing team, and where we both enjoy coming to work every day.

FNW: How are you financing this share buyback? It's a substantial sum, so did you bring in new partners?

EC: We wanted to take back 100% of the company. We had no desire to change shareholders, either now or in the medium term. For us, the deal was clear: either we regained 100% of the capital by financing the acquisition with debt, or we saw through the initial agreement and sold 100% of our shares. Our banks supported us- they were brilliant on the project- so it was possible.

FNW: The agreement also includes a vendor loan of three million euros. Between your repayments and the commitments to the Showroomprivé group, doesn't this put a lot of pressure on the company's profitability over the next few years?

EC: The Bradery is a fast-growing company. And of course we must maintain the level of profitability that stems from the teams’ work. But we based our plan on the level we have today.

FNW: In your results filed for 2024, you mention a net profit of over €4 million on turnover of €62 million. What are your 2025 results?

EC: Showroomprivé is a consolidated, listed group, so I’m not going to comment on the figures. What I can say is that we recorded strong double-digit growth in 2025. And if we maintain our profitability for 10 years, we’ll have no problem repaying the debt.

FNW: That's the financial part. But leaving a group also implies adjustments. What reorganisation and process changes are you going to have to implement?

EC: This was really the point that prompted us to pursue the buyback. We have kept our team- even as we grew from 40 to 70 people- our model, our premises and our processes. And Tim and I have remained very hands-on at The Bradery. I look after sales and Tim handles marketing. We knew there would be no friction. And honestly, if it had taken six months to transform the company, I don’t think we would have wanted to go for it. I believe this also influenced Showroomprivé’s management in their decision. In our absence, it would have required a significant implementation effort. We use for our CMS and we hadn’t migrated to Showroomprivé’s internal processes. The only area where we benefited from their clout was logistics. But we have strong relationships with our carriers.

An app at the heart of the model

FNW: Since 2022, you've significantly increased the number of The Bradery's operations and opened new verticals such as travel- as Showroomprivé also did.

EC: We have grown very independently. Historically, The Bradery is a private-sales player in premium ready-to-wear. But today we’ve built an offering that very much meets the expectations of the audience we want to appeal to: young women aged 25–35 who are looking for premium offers. She wants to find fashion on the platform, but she also wants experiences. That’s why we’ve developed offers for gyms, travel, and concerts. We want to become the shopping destination for this generation. In this respect, we have developed our own processes. What Showroomprivé clearly gave us is ambition. They taught us to plan ahead. We’re much smaller, more niche and more selective in our offering.

FNW: What growth drivers are you considering?

EC: We have several important priorities. Internationalising the business is one of them. We only generate 5% of our sales from exports, concentrated in the Benelux countries and Spain- and mainly in Belgium. So we need to develop a real strategy for our presence in neighbouring countries. We’re going to organise ourselves to reach the Benelux countries, Spain, and Italy. This means proposing an offer that appeals to local customers, with a relevant offer for each country. If you think you’ll succeed just by translating the site, you’re deluding yourself. Entrepreneurial success is about the people you manage to bring together.

FNW: You've diversified your offering, but what share does fashion still represent?

EC: It’s not the fastest-growing vertical; we’ve seen particularly strong growth in beauty and home. But it remains the largest part of our business.

FNW: And how have you maintained its attractiveness as you’ve expanded your offer, given that initially exclusivity also came from a limited number of operations?

EC: It’s a topic we’ve worked on extensively to improve the customer experience. To that end, we’ve moved from an online strategy to an app-first strategy. Of course, we still have a website, with a new version going live in the first half of this year. But we’ve invested heavily in the app, with the aim of building daily habits for our customers. They log on every morning to discover the latest offers. And we now generate 70% of our sales via the app.

FNW: Successful app launches are rare. What's your formula?

EC: The data show that customers using the app are more engaged than site visitors. They come back more often and purchase more frequently. We’ve hired specialists to improve the experience and encourage repeat visits by personalising the journey as much as possible and making the purchasing process as easy as possible. Buying via the app is as simple as ordering an Uber. And as we’ve grown, we’ve reworked customer service and logistics… We’ve raised our game.

FNW: And how do you manage to generate profitable growth at a time when consumer spending is struggling and digital performance has been more challenging in recent seasons?

EC: Across all operations, we work with brands, but we take a prudent, common-sense approach to generating profitability. We’re still very modest in size and very humble about the global context. I look at what Veepee and Showroomprivé have achieved with a lot of admiration, and I hope we’ll be their size one day. Simply maintaining their level of activity at such scale already seems a success to me. Beyond that, I believe that, in the current context, our size gives us the agility to be responsive and opportunistic, and to set up operations very quickly- with brands- in 48–72 hours. I see that as a competitive advantage. Incidentally, another growth lever for The Bradery is physical sales.

FNW: Why, when your expertise is online?

EC: We started in December and it worked very well. We’ve worked with Maison , Levi’s, Drôle de Monsieur… I think a lot of brands understand that digital and physical complement each other. And there’s a shift back to physical retail, particularly among customers looking for premium offers. Our customers expect it. But it’s also important to remember that we’re obsessed with profitability. We’re always balancing the provision of solutions for partners with keeping the books in order. So for physical operations, we’re taking a pop-up approach to control our investments. And we’re going to continue like this in 2026, managing it on a variable-cost basis, with two to three operations per month.

LAS VEGAS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to give a speech ​on Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in ‌Las Vegas, potentially revealing new details about product plans for the world's ‌most valuable listed company as it faces increasing competition from both rivals and its own customers.

Prediction Market powered by

Less than two weeks ago, the company scooped up talent and chip technology from startup ⁠Groq, including executives who ‌were instrumental in helping Alphabet's Google design its own AI chips. While Google is a ‍major Nvidia customer, its own chips have emerged as one of Nvidia's biggest threats as Google works closely with Meta Platforms and ​others to chip away at Nvidia's AI stronghold.

At the ‌same time, Nvidia is eager to show that its latest products can outperform older chips like the H200, which U.S. President Donald Trump has allowed to flow to China. Reuters has reported that the chip, which was the predecessor ⁠to Nvidia's current flagship ""Blackwell"" chip, is ​in high demand in China, ​which has alarmed China hawks across the U.S. political spectrum.

Huang's speech is scheduled to begin at 4 ‍p.m. EST (2100 ⁠GMT). Other key speakers at the annual trade show this year include AMD CEO Lisa Su, the CEO ⁠of Finnish health tech company Oura, Tom Hale, and PC maker Lenovo's ‌CEO, Yuanqing Yang.

We may have rested for the festive period but the world of technology did not. Here are five big stories you might have missed while we were away.

1. Meta buys Manus

Manus is a China-based agentic AI company which hailed an arranged marriage to Meta Platforms as “validation of our pioneering work” on general iterations of the technology.

Meta Platforms stated Manus launched its first general AI agent during 2025, and had served more than 147 trillion tokens and created in excess of 80 million virtual computers by the time of its announcement on 29 December.

The AI company is set to bolster Meta Platforms broader AI efforts targeting consumer and business segments.

Financial Times reported the company was once considered to be the “next DeepSeek”, but noted there could be opposition to the takeover among regulators in the US and China.

2. SoftBank Group ups OpenAI investment

The Japanese giant declared it had “fully satisfied its commitment to invest in OpenAI” after completing an additional outlay of $22.5 billion through its SoftBank Vision Fund 2 on 26 December.

SoftBank’s holding in OpenAI was taken to 11 per cent.

It pumped $7.5 billion into the US company and raised $11 billion from third-party investors earlier in 2025.

The Japanese company’s chair and CEO Masayoshi Son said it is “deeply aligned” with OpenAI’s broader ambitions for the technology and the latter’s chief Sam Altman highlighted time-to-market benefits from the tie-up.

3. SKT gives AI hyperscale

South Korean operator SK Telecom (SKT) unveiled an AI model it believes will prove foundational to the nation’s goals for the technology.

The A.Z K1 model “marks the beginning of a full-stack AI ecosystem, encompassing all areas from semiconductors to services”, SKT stated.

A.Z K1 features 519 billion parameters and is a bump to Korean ambitions to rival the US and China in AI technology leadership.

The model feeds information to smaller versions with a particular focus on those with less than 70 billion parameters. SKT intends to provide A.X K1 through its A-dot set-up, among other methods, giving it a potential market of 10 million users from the off.

SKT believes the model will also positively impact South Korea’s semiconductor sector by boosting verification of memory bandwidth and inter-GPU communication speed.

4. RAM costs rocket

Various news outlets predicted a tough 2026 for consumer electronics, in particular PCs and smartphones due to a shortage in RAM.

BBC News reported RAM demand is being driven by the requirements of AI data centres, noting the memory type is as important an element as processors which typically dominate headlines relating to the sites.

Experts told the news outlet higher memory costs would likely be passed on to consumers, speculating this could in turn impact demand for new smartphones and PCs.

The reports were sparked by an IDC analysis in mid-December 2025 in which it warned the situation could go beyond “a cyclical shortage driven by a mismatch in supply and demand”.

5. Apple cuts Vision Pro production

IDC figures also feature in reports Apple cut production of its Vision Pro headset, which the analyst company separately noted struggled to gain traction in terms of shipments during 2025.

Financial Times reported changes in the output from Vision Pro manufacturer Luxshare and highlighted a shift in Apple’s marketing spending, each pitched as a sign the company is falling short in terms of wooing consumers.

The IDC figures referenced offered a gloomy outlook for mixed and virtual reality headsets as a whole, with the company predicting shipments in 2025 would be down 42.8 per cent year-on-year but are likely to pick up again this year.",https://assets.mobileworldlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/06105007/Newspaper_train_SS_generic.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 13:01:27.868822

We will keep you posted on all the retail action on the ground, but here is a preview of what the CES retail programing will cover.

A panel on agentic AI focused on AI agents in the real world is just one of the event’s many Monday offerings. Chandhu Nair, SVP of data, artificial intelligence, and innovation at Lowe’s, will give the audience a home improvement retailer’s perspective on the topic.

On Tuesday, technology’s big show will have a session with Best Buy CEO Corie Barry, who will talk about getting people, software, and services to actually work together instead of fighting against each other.

Last year, Best Buy underwent a rebrand with a holographic mascot and a new tagline—“Imagine that”—as the retailer positions itself to become consumers’ go-to source for technology items. In August 2025, Best Buy also introduced its third-party marketplace to build additional income streams through wider product assortment and advertising.

That same day, beauty and fashion industry experts, including Oscar de la Renta CMO Chloe Popescu and Kimberly Villatoro, CEO of Patrick Ta Beauty, will be on a panel to discuss how social platforms are merging content and community to create immersive, shoppable experiences.

On Wednesday, Kroger will host a panel called “Irrational consumers: how to grow brands in an unreasonable world.” The session will decode how brands can understand why shoppers make weird decisions and use that insight to grow in 2026.

A panel called “The future of ‘search’ at retail” on Thursday will delve into how AI agents transform traditional retail search based on people’s preferences, budget, and style? Attendees will hear from Justin Honaman, global head of worldwide retail, restaurants, and consumer goods at Amazon, and Egan Brinkman, managing director of commerce at Google, along with executives from Microsoft and Pinterest.

Another notable session on Thursday called “The new retail experience in the AI-powered store” will feature executives from Tractor Supply Company—the Brentwood, Tennessee-based farm products and home improvement retailer—and big box retailer Target that takes attendees behind the scenes to show how everything from inventory and logistics to checkout and service are changing thanks to AI.

Parallel retail tracks on topics of fashion tech, beauty tech, and AI programming will run simultaneously during the week.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/fdb78780be09490d03044195df9107702827e8fd-7960x5307.jpg?rect=0,564,7960,4179&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2026-01-05 15:01:34.672523

See our latest analysis for Uber Technologies.

That downgrade lands after a tougher few months for the stock, with a 30 day share price return of 9.26% decline and a 90 day share price return of 15.28% decline, even though the 1 year total shareholder return of 24.96% and 3 year total shareholder return of about 3x still point to strong longer run momentum that is now being questioned as robotaxis, tax changes in the UK and potential deals like SpotHero reshape how investors think about Uber’s risk profile.

If this kind of shake up has you reassessing your options, it could be a good time to scan other high growth tech and AI stocks that might benefit or compete as autonomous tech rolls out.

With a recent 30-day return of a 9.26% decline and a 90-day return of a 15.28% decline, yet a 1-year total return near 25% and about 3x over three years, is Uber now attractively priced, or is the market already reflecting expectations for future growth in the share price?

Most Popular Narrative: 26.1% Undervalued

Uber Technologies' most followed narrative pegs fair value at about US$112 per share compared with the last close at US$82.86, setting up a meaningful debate on what the market is pricing in.

Significant investments and accelerating partnerships in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and electrification (with Waymo, Lucid, Nuro, etc.) position Uber to benefit from secular industry shifts. Successful AV commercialization could transform long-term cost structures and profitability, boosting future earnings potential. Progressive scaling of high-margin ancillary revenue streams such as advertising, data/tech platform externalization, and Uber One loyalty are supporting margin expansion and enhancing long-term earning power.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious what earnings path and margin mix get Uber from today’s profitability to that higher fair value? The projections rely on specific revenue growth, margin reset and future P/E assumptions that you can only see laid out in full inside the narrative.

Result: Fair Value of $112.06 (UNDERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, there is still a real chance that heavy spending on autonomous partnerships and tougher competition across ride hailing and AV could pressure margins and weaken the thesis.

There is plenty to be excited about in HP’s latest announcements, led by the new HP OmniBook Ultra 14. The company describes it as the world’s slimmest consumer notebook to offer high-end AI performance, and the specifications support that positioning. Buyers can choose between an HP-exclusive Snapdragon X2 Elite processor, capable of delivering up to 85 trillion operations per second for running multiple AI applications simultaneously, or next-generation Intel Core Ultra processors aimed at more graphics-intensive workloads.

Despite everything HP has packed into the new OmniBook Ultra 14, the laptop remains highly portable. It is 52 per cent lighter than its predecessor and five per cent thinner than the 2025 Apple MacBook Air 13 with the M4 chip, while still featuring a vivid 3K OLED display. The device also includes a posture-detection feature designed to prompt users if they begin slouching or holding their neck at an uncomfortable angle.

For users who prefer a stationary workstation, the HP OmniStudio X 27 all-in-one offers a compelling alternative. The company says it is the world’s first Neo LED all-in-one PC with dual 100 per cent colour coverage, positioning it as a strong option for designers and content creators. Internally, the system is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor and can be configured with an optional NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 GPU.

HP is also pushing innovation with Thunderbolt Share, a new feature that allows users to connect a laptop directly to an all-in-one PC. The setup lets users control both devices with a single keyboard and mouse, or share the all-in-one’s high-quality webcam. It also introduces Surface View, a camera feature that allows the lens to tilt downward so users can share sketches or notes on their desk during video calls.

The broader update touches nearly every corner of HP’s consumer lineup. The OmniBook family now includes the X, 7, 5 and 3 series, each aimed at different needs and budgets. Notably, the OmniBook 3 16, powered by Snapdragon X, is claimed to deliver up to 45 hours of battery life, setting a new benchmark for endurance in consumer AI PCs, and something we at CGMagazine will need to test for ourselves.

Rounding out the announcements is the updated HP Chromebook Plus x360 14, which combines a rugged, drop-tested design with a 360-degree hinge and Google’s latest artificial intelligence tools. From the looks of things, it is a solid entry, especially for people who want to avoid the complexities of Windows or macOS, in favour of a more streamlined overall experience.

With these releases, HP is presenting a clear view of where it sees consumer computing heading, toward smarter and more adaptable hardware designed to support modern digital lifestyles. Early impressions suggest there is much to be interested in across the new lineup.",https://cdn.cgmagonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ces-2026-hp-refreshes-its-pc-lineup-with-snapdragon-power-and-serious-ai-ambitions-2025-12-28-255586.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 14:01:02.710432

The core issue is a worldwide memory shortage. Large AI data centers are buying massive amounts of memory chips, which leave fewer parts available for consumer products like gaming graphics cards. As a result, supply has weakened just as demand remains strong.

In Germany, a major PC parts retailer said its distributor has limited orders of the RTX 5070 to five units at a time, while stopping deliveries of higher models such as the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090. Similarly, a leading Japanese electronics retailer in Tokyo has begun limiting customers to one high-memory graphics card per purchase, while also warning that future deliveries are uncertain.

Meanwhile, NVDA shares rose 1.26% on Friday, closing at $188.85.

AI Demand Reshapes the GPU Market

The memory shortage is changing how graphics cards are built and priced. According to industry research firm TrendForce, memory now makes up more than 80% of a GPU’s total cost. This share has risen sharply as prices for advanced memory types have increased by several hundred percent in recent months.

Major suppliers such as SK Hynix have shifted focus away from consumer memory toward high-margin memory used in AI accelerators. Internal company forecasts suggest tight supply for consumer memory could last until at least 2028, which limits how quickly the gaming market can recover.

As a result, both Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are expected to raise graphics card prices in stages starting in early 2026. Reports indicate that AMD has already begun modest increases, while Nvidia may follow soon after. Over time, repeated price hikes could push top-tier cards well above their original launch prices.

Production Cuts and Price Hikes

In addition, Nvidia is reportedly planning to reduce gaming GPU production by 30% to 40% in the first half of 2026 compared with last year. Models that use large amounts of memory are expected to see the biggest cuts, as memory supply remains the main constraint.

Meanwhile, Nvidia has informed partners that it plans to restart production of the RTX 3060, a graphics card first released in 2021. This older model uses a different type of memory that is more available today, which may help Nvidia keep a presence in the lower-priced gaming market while shortages continue.

Overall, the situation highlights how rising AI demand is reshaping the balance between data center and consumer hardware, with lasting effects on pricing, supply, and profit focus across the semiconductor industry.

Is Nvidia Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

On the Street, Nvidia holds a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target is $262.79, implying a 39.15% upside from the current price.

In its December 23 announcement, CMS invited interested manufacturers to apply to opt into the BALANCE Model by responding to the Request for Applications (RFA) by January 8, 2026.
Under the BALANCE Model, CMS will negotiate directly with GLP-1 manufacturers to reduce net prices, cap out-of-pocket costs, and standardize coverage criteria.
The BALANCE Model will also be open to all states participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP).
Beyond BALANCE: Two Other CMS Proposed Models for Part B and Part D Drugs In addition to the BALANCE Model, CMS has introduced several other pricing initiatives that align with the Trump administration’s MFN drug pricing strategies, also aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs.","On December 23, 2025, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the Better Approaches to Lifestyles and Nutrition for Comprehensive hEalth (BALANCE) Model, a voluntary, alternative payment model (APM), designed to expand access to GLP-1 medications. At its core, the BALANCE Model intends to promote the use of both GLP-1 medications and lifestyle interventions to help prevent chronic conditions and combat obesity, while also managing the costs of such medications for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and taxpayers.

Framework of the BALANCE Model

Similar to the recent Most Favored Nation (MFN) drug pricing deals with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which expanded GLP-1 coverage for Medicare beneficiaries at a discounted monthly rate, the BALANCE Model builds on the Trump administration’s broader strategy to lower drug costs through direct manufacturer negotiations. However, the BALANCE Model takes the MFN pricing approach a step further by also expanding the use of lifestyle-focused preventative care initiatives.

In its December 23 announcement, CMS invited interested manufacturers to apply to opt into the BALANCE Model by responding to the Request for Applications (RFA) by January 8, 2026. States and Part D plan sponsors were also asked to submit a Notice of Intent to participate by the same date. Under the BALANCE Model, CMS will negotiate directly with GLP-1 manufacturers to reduce net prices, cap out-of-pocket costs, and standardize coverage criteria. CMS is also seeking commitments for manufacturer-provided lifestyle support services, such as fitness coaching and nutrition counseling, to supplement GLP-1 treatments and maintain long-term health.

The BALANCE Model will waive the current Part D coverage exclusion for weight-loss medications, meaning GLP-1s will be included in the basic benefit with set cost-sharing limits, aiming to increase accessibility and affordability. Participating plans will cover the negotiated drugs from participating manufacturers, and the manufacturers will provide rebates to keep prices aligned with negotiated terms. This structure integrates coverage, pricing, and access, targeting preventive care goals.

The BALANCE Model will also be open to all states participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP). States that wish to participate were also asked to respond to the State RFA by January 8, 2026. Under State Medicaid coverage, price reductions will occur through supplemental rebate agreements between state agencies and manufacturers.

Action Plan and Timeline

The Model is set to launch in Medicaid programs as early as May 2026, and in Medicare Part D plans in January 2027. In the interim, CMS plans to implement a Medicare GLP-1 payment demonstration in July 2026. This demonstration will allow beneficiaries to obtain access to GLP-1 medications for $50 per month, so long as they meet the negotiated access criteria.

Beyond BALANCE: Two Other CMS Proposed Models for Part B and Part D Drugs

In addition to the BALANCE Model, CMS has introduced several other pricing initiatives that align with the Trump administration’s MFN drug pricing strategies, also aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs.

What's in the News

A U.S. appeals court temporarily paused a government order that would have required Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico to unwind their joint venture by January 1, putting on hold an action aimed at their coordination on scheduling, pricing, and capacity for U.S. Mexico routes.

Delta and Aeromexico have filed a legal challenge in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Transportation Department order to dissolve their joint venture, seeking to maintain their current level of cooperation on cross border flights.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said the 6% air traffic cut tied to the recent government shutdown will end at 6 a.m. on Monday, although airlines including Delta have indicated it may still take several days for flight operations to return to more typical levels.

FAA related staffing shortages have recently led to flight delays and cancellations across major U.S. airports, affecting multiple carriers including Delta as the agency operated with reduced air traffic control capacity.

Delta Air Lines issued guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2025, indicating an expected total revenue year over year change for Q4 of up 2% to 4%, Q4 earnings per share in a range of US$1.60 to US$1.90, and full year 2025 earnings per share of about US$6.

How This Changes the Fair Value For Delta Air Lines

Fair Value Estimate: Adjusted slightly higher from US$73.64 to US$74.61, reflecting modestly updated modelling assumptions.

Discount Rate: Tweaked marginally lower from 9.19% to 9.18%, indicating a very small change in the required return used in the analysis.

Revenue Growth: Assumed long term growth rate moved slightly from 3.77% to 3.92%.

Net Profit Margin: Adjusted marginally from 7.16% to 7.14%, suggesting only a very small change in expected profitability levels.

Future P/E: Target future P/E multiple edged higher from 12.76x to 12.90x, a modest shift in how earnings are being valued in the model.

What Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock?","Gear up for Jan. 5 because today’s the day Wall Street and AI enthusiasts alike are eyeing as a potential catalyst event for Nvidia’s (NVDA) next chapter. After an explosive run that briefly made Nvidia the first company in the world to surpass a $5 trillion market cap, driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips and datacenter hardware, the tech giant kicks off 2026 with a high-profile platform to shape the coming year’s narrative.

That’s when CEO Jensen Huang is expected to deliver an address at CES 2026, a stage where Nvidia has historically outlined strategic technology roadmaps and unveiled innovations that influence investor sentiment and industry direction. With demand for its advanced AI accelerators, geopolitical trade dynamics, and potentially lifting chip stocks, Jan. 5 could set the tone for Nvidia’s performance and investor expectations for the year ahead.

Wedbush analysts expect Jensen Huang to use his speech to lay out the company’s next-phase AI strategy, highlighting surging enterprise adoption as the AI revolution enters a new growth stage. The focus is likely to center on data centers, physical AI, robotics, and autonomous technologies, with updates on Nvidia’s Cosmos foundation model platform. Beyond AI infrastructure, Nvidia is also expected to unveil new developments across gaming, content creation and simulation.

About Nvidia Stock

Nvidia Corporation is a global leader in accelerated computing and AI, renowned for pioneering the graphics processing unit (GPU) that revolutionized gaming, data centers, and AI-driven computing. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, Nvidia’s technology now powers everything from high-performance gaming and cloud computing to autonomous vehicles and generative AI applications. With a market cap of roughly $4.6 trillion, Nvidia stands among the world’s most valuable companies, driven by its dominance in AI infrastructure and continued innovation in next-generation chip design.

In 2025, Nvidia’s share price experienced a noteworthy but volatile year. After opening the year significantly lower, the stock rallied on sustained demand for its AI hardware and datacenter solutions, driven by its leadership in the generative AI boom.

The 52-week low was around $86.62, reached in April 2025, while the 52-week high reached around $212.19, achieved in late October as the company hit record valuation milestones and investor optimism peaked.

That wide gulf between the high and low underscores how sentiment shifted throughout the year as Nvidia navigated geopolitical concerns, macroeconomic headwinds, and equally powerful AI demand tailwinds. The stock has overall delivered 31.6% returns over the past year.

Nvidia’s dominant position has led it to trade at a pronounced premium valuation compared to its industry peers, at 42.35 times forward earnings.

Strong Q3 Performance

Nvidia delivered a particularly strong showing in its third quarter of fiscal 2026 results that underscore just how deep the demand for AI infrastructure has become. On Nov. 19, the company reported revenue of a record $57 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 26, representing a 62% year-over-year (YOY) jump and a 22% increase from the prior quarter.

The company’s datacenter business was the main engine, with datacenter revenue hitting $51.2 billion, up 66% from a year ago, reflecting surging demand for AI-ready GPUs and cloud computing infrastructure. The firm’s profitability remained strong, with non-GAAP gross margins holding around 73.6% and the non-GAAP EPS at $1.30, a 60% YOY rise and comfortably ahead of Wall Street estimates.

Management also offered bullish forward guidance, expecting around $65 billion, plus or minus 2% in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026. That projection suggests confidence in continued strong demand for its AI chips and datacenter gear despite macroeconomic headwinds or geopolitical uncertainty.

Analysts tracking Nvidia project the company’s EPS to climb 51.2% YoY to $4.43 in fiscal 2026 and grow another 56.7% to $6.94 in fiscal 2027.

What Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock?

Several Wall Street analysts have recently reaffirmed positive ratings on Nvidia stock in the wake of its strategic deal with AI chipmaker Groq, signaling continued confidence in the company’s growth prospects. Following the announcement of the approximately $20 billion non-exclusive licensing agreement and talent acquisition from Groq, analysts are showing renewed optimism.

Among others, Mizuho reiterated its “Outperform” rating and $245 price target on Nvidia following its deal with Groq, reinforcing bullish analyst sentiment. Mizuho views the transaction as a long-term positive that enhances Nvidia’s inferencing capabilities and supports its strong growth trajectory.

Also, Bernstein SocGen reiterated an “Outperform” rating and a $275 price target on Nvidia after its Groq technology deal.

Wall Street’s bullishness is evident in Nvidia having a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, 44 advise a “Strong Buy,” two suggest a “Moderate Buy,” one analyst is on the sidelines, giving it a “Hold” rating, and one offers a “Strong Sell” rating.

The average analyst price target for NVDA is $256, indicating a potential upside of 35.6%. Also, the Street-high target price of $352 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 86.4%.",https://media.barchart.com/contributors-admin/common-images/images/S%26P%20500%20Companies/Technology%20(names%20J%20-%20Z)/NVIDIA%20Corp%20logo%20on%20phone%20and%20AI%20chip-by%20Below%20the%20Sky%20via%20Shutterstock.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 14:01:19.588137

Citi has a $135 price target on the stock.","CoreWeave shares were rising early Monday after a known critic of the company upgraded the stock and raised its price target, citing an OpenAI fundraise would also benefit the cloud-tech company.

DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria upgraded CoreWeave to Neutral from Underperform and raised his price target to $68 from $36, triggering a rise of more than 4% in the stock.

The move drew attention partly because CoreWeave was already trading well above that level, changing hands at $79.32.

Upgrade driven by OpenAI funding prospects

Luria said his reassessment was linked to reports that OpenAI could pursue a fundraising round of up to $100 billion, a deal that, if completed, would improve visibility around CoreWeave’s large contracts with the AI developer.

“It shouldn’t be a foregone conclusion that OpenAI successfully completes its reported $100 billion potential fundraise, but if it does so, it would be able to fulfill all its commitments in 2026, including to CoreWeave,” Luria said in a note to clients.

CoreWeave signed a five-year contract worth $11.9 billion with OpenAI in March 2025 to provide cloud computing services, a deal that has been central to investor expectations for future revenue growth.

Despite the upgrade, Luria stressed that his fundamental concerns about the business had not disappeared.

He said that while a successful OpenAI fundraise could delay pressure on CoreWeave, it would not resolve deeper structural issues.

“While this would not change the value destruction inherent in CRWV’s business, it would kick the can down the road for the inevitable reckoning,” he said.

Debt concerns remain front and centre

Luria has been one of the most outspoken critics of CoreWeave, arguing that its model of taking on significant debt to build AI infrastructure for clients such as Microsoft and Nvidia is unsustainable.

He reiterated that view on Monday, warning that equity investors could still face heavy losses.

“We continue to believe that the equity in shares of CRWV may ultimately lose all its value since the entire value of the enterprise is owned by debt holders,” he said.

The analyst added that there was still a risk that a large portion of CoreWeave’s backlog may not be realised.

If OpenAI’s fundraising effort falls well short of the reported $100 billion target by the end of March, he warned, there could be “an acceleration of the collapse in the value of CRWV shares”.

Luria has previously said CoreWeave appears to be generating a return on capital of about 4%, well below an estimated cost of capital of 9%.

Broader analyst views

CoreWeave has countered such criticism by saying its contracts are designed to deliver risk-adjusted returns above its cost of capital and typically include fixed payments regardless of utilisation.

Other analysts expect margins to improve and borrowing costs to fall over time.

According to LSEG-compiled data, 17 of the 32 brokerages covering the stock rate it a buy or higher, while 13 recommend hold and two advise selling.

The median price target stands at $125.38.

The company went public in March in one of the most closely watched technology listings of the year, but its shares have been volatile as investors debate whether enthusiasm around artificial intelligence is becoming overheated.

Sentiment improved last month after CoreWeave was named as one of 24 partners in the US Department of Energy’s Genesis Mission, which aims to use AI to accelerate scientific discovery.

The stock also benefited from a bullish note last month by Citi Research analyst Tyler Radke, who resumed coverage after a restricted period.

Radke said management commentary suggested capacity expansion and bookings momentum were continuing into the fourth quarter, setting the stage for faster growth in 2026, even as the company works through supply constraints and power-related delays.

LAS VEGAS, 5 janvier 2026 – Cette année au CES 2026, L'Oréal Groupe, leader mondial de la beauté, a présenté deux technologies révolutionnaires qui exploitent la puissance de la lumière pour transformer les soins capillaires et cutanés : Light Straight + Multi-styler et LED Face Mask, toutes deux lauréates d’un CES 2026 Innovation Award.

« Chez L'Oréal, nous croyons depuis toujours que la beauté est profondément liée à la découverte scientifique, une conviction qui est au cœur de notre Groupe depuis plus de 115 ans. Aujourd’hui, c’est la combinatoire de nos avancées scientifiques et technologiques et de notre créativité qui nous permet de concevoir des expériences de beauté uniques, plus performantes et mieux adaptées aux besoins de chacune et chacun. Cette année, au CES 2026, notre connaissance scientifique et le développement de technologies LED propriétaires sur le marché illustrent une nouvelle fois notre engagement à repousser les limites des nouvelles solutions beauté », a déclaré Barbara Lavernos, Directrice Générale Adjointe en charge de la Recherche, de l'Innovation et de la Technologie chez L'Oréal Groupe.

L’Oréal présente Light Straight + Multi-styler

Depuis plus d’un siècle, le fer à lisser fait partie des accessoires incontournables de coiffage. Pourtant, les plaques chauffantes traditionnelles peuvent monter à 205 °C, dépassant largement le seuil à partir duquel la kératine commence à se dénaturer ayant pour conséquences de fragiliser la cuticule, d’augmenter la casse et d’atténuer la brillance des cheveux. C’est d’ailleurs une préoccupation majeure chez les consommateurs : selon une étude menée par L’Oréal auprès de consommatrices américaines en 2024, 58% des femmes interrogées déclarent que la chaleur est à l’origine de leurs cheveux abîmés.

Développé par la Recherche & l’Innovation de L'Oréal, Light Straight + Multi-styler utilise une technologie de lumière infrarouge* brevetée qui offre des résultats de coiffage exceptionnels tout en protégeant la santé des cheveux. Light Straight + Multi-styler est équipé de plaques en verre qui lissent efficacement les cheveux, sans jamais dépasser 160°C – soit une réduction significative de la température par rapport à la plupart des fers à lisser traditionnels. Selon des tests instrumentaux menés par L'Oréal, Light Straight + Multi-styler agit 3 fois plus vite et rend les cheveux 2 fois plus lisses que les lisseurs les plus hauts de gamme.

L'expérience utilisateur de Light Straight + Multi-styler repose sur une science et une ingénierie de haute précision. L'appareil utilise la lumière proche infrarouge, située juste au-delà du spectre visible, qui pénètre au cœur de la fibre capillaire. Cette solution remodèle les structures moléculaires qui déterminent la forme et la texture des cheveux tout en préservant leur intégrité et leur santé.

« Light Straight + Multi-styler fait passer le coiffage de la correction à la prévention. En limitant l’exposition répétée à la chaleur, nous contribuons à préserver l’intégrité du cheveu naturel dès le départ et permettons aux consommateurs de protéger leurs cheveux dans la durée. Nous pensons que cette innovation établit un nouveau standard en matière de coiffage de précision, non seulement en améliorant, mais en redéfinissant toute la catégorie du coiffage », a déclaré Guive Balooch, Vice-Président du Métier Beauté Augmentée et de l’Open Innovation chez L'Oréal et membre du Conseil des Leaders de l'Industrie de la Consumer Technology Association (CTA).

Parmi les avantages clés de Light Straight + Multi-styler :

Technologie infrarouge brevetée*: le design exclusif de l’appareil offre un rendu ultra-lisse et une meilleure tenue dans le temps.

Polyvalence multi-coiffure : en plus de lisser et d'adoucir les cheveux, Light Straight + Multi-styler peut être utilisé pour boucler les cheveux avec soin et précision, offrant une solution de coiffage multi-usage.

Résultats personnalisés : avec ses capteurs internes intelligents, ses algorithmes propriétaires intégrés et son apprentissage automatique, l'appareil s'adapte aux gestes de l'utilisateur pour optimiser l'expérience de chacun.

Avec AirLight Pro dévoilé au CES 2024, et dorénavant Light Straight + Multi-styler, L'Oréal déploie sa technologie de lumière infrarouge pour une routine de coiffage complète qui protège les cheveux.

Light Straight + Multi-styler devrait être lancé mondialement en 2027. Plus de détails, y compris les prix, seront disponibles sur loreal.com.

L'Oréal annonce le développement de LED Face Mask pour des soins ciblés de la peau

Poursuivant son engagement en matière d'innovations technologiques et de science de la longévité au service de la beauté, L’Oréal a également dévoilé son LED Face Mask, lauréat d'un CES 2026 Innovation Award. Développé avec I-Smart Developments, leader mondial de l'innovation en matière de dispositifs LED, ce masque flexible en silicone transparent et ultrafin – actuellement sous forme de prototype – diffuse la lumière directement sur le visage pour agir sur les signes de l’âge. Ce dispositif innovant intègre un microcircuit sans danger pour la peau, contrôlant avec précision l'émission de deux longueurs d'onde lumineuses spécifiques : la lumière rouge (630 nm) et la lumière proche infrarouge (830 nm). Chacune d’elles contribue à raffermir et lisser visiblement la peau tout en uniformisant le teint. Les tests en cours menés par L'Oréal viendront confirmer l’efficacité de la lumière rouge et proche infrarouge sur les ridules, le relâchement cutané ou encore l’irrégularité du teint.

Ce dispositif léger, portable et non invasif est conçu pour s'intégrer facilement aux routines de beauté quotidiennes, avec des sessions prédéfinies de 10 minutes.

LED Face Mask devrait être lancé en 2027*. Plus de détails, y compris les prix, seront disponibles sur loreal.com.

*Le lancement de LED Face Mask de L'Oréal Groupe aux États-Unis est soumis au processus de notification préalable de la FDA 510(k).

At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IBM options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $295.00 strike price has a current bid of $28.60.
Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.","Investors in International Business Machines Corp (Symbol: IBM) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 16th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 284 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IBM options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $295.00 strike price has a current bid of $28.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $295.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $266.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IBM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $296.61/share today.

Because the $295.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.69% return on the cash commitment, or 12.46% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for International Business Machines Corp, and highlighting in green where the $295.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $305.00 strike price has a current bid of $29.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of IBM stock at the current price level of $296.61/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $305.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.93% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IBM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for International Business Machines Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing IBM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $305.00 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $305.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.10% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.98% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 33%.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 249 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $296.61) to be 30%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Safety Standardization Mandatory Code / Insurance Specification and Recommendation:

SKYX's Safety Code Standardization Team is receiving support from a new significant prominent leader with its government safety agency’s process for a safety mandatory standardization of its electrical ceiling outlet/receptacle technology.

SKYX’s code team is led by industry veterans Mark Earley, former head of the National Electrical Code (NEC), and Eric Jacobson, former President and CEO of the American Lighting Association (ALA). The Company’s safety Code Standardization team believes it will garner assistance from additional safety organizations with its code mandatory safety standardization efforts based on the product’s significant safety aspects. Mr. Earley and Mr. Jacobson were instrumental in numerous code and safety changes in both the electrical and lighting industries. Both strongly believe that, considering the Company’s standardization progress including its product specification approval voting for by ANSI / NEMA (American National Standardization Institute / National Electrical Manufacturers Association) and being voted into 10 segments in the NEC Code Book, it has met the necessary safety conditions for becoming a ceiling safety standardization requirement for homes and buildings.

With respect to insurance companies, the Company strongly believes its products can save insurance companies many billions of dollars annually by reducing fires, ladder falls, and electrocutions among other things. Management expects that once it completes an entire range and variations of its safe advanced plug & play products it will start being recommended by insurance companies.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements made in this press release are not based on historical facts, but are forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “can,” “could,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “evaluate,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “ongoing,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “probable,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target” “view,” “will,” or “would,” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These statements reflect the Company’s reasonable judgment with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which have outcomes difficult to predict and may be outside our control, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include statements relating to the Company’s ability to successfully launch, commercialize, develop additional features and achieve market acceptance of its products and technologies and integrate its products and technologies with First-party platforms or technologies; the Company’s efforts and ability to drive the adoption of its products and technologies as a standard feature, including their use in homes, hotels, offices and cruise ships; the Company’s ability to capture market share; the Company’s estimates of its potential addressable market and demand for its products and technologies; the Company’s ability to raise additional capital to support its operations as needed, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all; the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; the Company’s ability to execute on any sales and licensing or other strategic opportunities; the possibility that any of the Company’s products will become National Electrical Code (NEC)-code or otherwise code mandatory in any jurisdiction, or that any of the Company’s current or future products or technologies will be adopted by any state, country, or municipality, within any specific timeframe or at all; risks arising from mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other collaborations; the Company’s ability to attract and retain key executives and qualified personnel; guidance provided by management, which may differ from the Company’s actual operating results; the potential impact of unstable market and economic conditions, including recent measures adopted by the federal government, on the Company’s business, financial condition, and stock price; and other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. There can be no assurance as to any of the foregoing matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this press release, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by U.S. federal securities laws.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Management considers earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted, an important indicator in evaluating the Company’s business on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not part of the Company’s core operations, such as interest expense and amortization expense associated with intangible assets, or items that do not involve a cash outlay, such as share-based payments and non-recurring items, such as transaction costs. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, pre-tax income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows used in operating activities. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. Investors should review the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.

After years of price increases, shoppers may start to see some signs of relief at the grocery store as food giants look to reignite growth.

Cheerios and Nature Valley bar maker General Mills said last month it cut prices on nearly two-thirds of its grocery products in North America, resulting in an uptick in product volume. PepsiCo also plans to lower prices this year across some of its food products as it looks to improve affordability.

Consumer inflation concerns have weighed heavilyon product volumes in recent quarters. PepsiCo noted in October that volumes for snacks in North America dipped 4%, while beverages slumped 3%. Other food manufacturers, such as Conagra Brands, Kraft Heinz and J.M. Smucker, posted declines in volumes.

“Consumers represent two-thirds of the economy,” said Brian Choi, a managing partner and CEO of The Food Institute. “They’re tapped out.”

Food-at-home prices are forecast to be up 2.3% in 2026, a slight improvement from last year,according to data from the USDA’s Economic Research Service. Despite the increases, they mark a sharp decline from the COVID-19 pandemic when inflation on food prices hit afour-decade high.

Much of the recent price increase has come from commodities such as coffee and ground beef, which are up 18.8% and 14.9%, respectively, during the last year, Labor Department statistics showed. Candy and chewing gum prices jumped 10.1%, and essentials such as bananas, lettuce and cereals are also all more expensive.

General Mills noted that high prices are pushing more shoppers to purchase food that is being discounted, particularly among consumers earning $100,000 or less.

PepsiCo, which is looking to lower prices as part of a turnaround plan, has an “opportunity to reinvest in value in a more substantial way,” Ramon Laguarta, the beverage and snacking company’s CEO, said in December.

“There’s a big reset of affordability because we see the consumer struggling in the U.S. and in many Western countries,”he told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.

Despite some cuts, there are still categories where food makers are raising prices to offset inflationary pressures. Sweets maker Hershey in 2025 said it would put in place a double-digit percentage price increase due to elevated cocoa costs.

Executives noted in October that while cocoa prices have moderated, theyremain 70% above 2023 levels and are likely to increase in 2026. Hershey raised consumer costs to catch up to other competitors, noting the industry is less synchronized when it comes to pricing.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xga7sYPwpobzO_wv_uc0R7JVncNTzJ_1ESn_Bv76t_I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMTgxMy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-05 11:15:20.777005

Cette année, au CES 2026, notre connaissance scientifique et le développement de technologies LED propriétaires sur le marché illustrent une nouvelle fois notre engagement à repousser les limites des nouvelles solutions beauté », déclare Barbara Lavernos, directrice générale adjointe en charge de la recherche, de l’innovation et de la technologie.

L’innovation du Light Straight + Multi-styler

À travers le temps, le fer à lisser est resté un outil incontournable pour le coiffage. Cependant, l’usage de plaques chauffantes qui montent jusqu’à 205 °C pose un problème de dégradation des cheveux. Une étude menée par L’Oréal en 2024 a révélé que 58 % des consommatrices américaines considèrent la chaleur comme la cause principale de l’endommagement de leur chevelure.

Pour répondre à cette problématique, L’Oréal a développé le Light Straight + Multi-styler. Cet outil intègre une technologie de lumière infrarouge brevetée, permettant de lisser les cheveux tout en réduisant la température à un maximum de 160 °C. Selon des tests instrumentaux, il agit trois fois plus rapidement que les fers à lisser traditionnels et rend les cheveux deux fois plus lisses.

La conception fignolée de l’appareil, qui utilise une lumière proche infrarouge, pénètre au cœur de la fibre capillaire, remaniant les structures moléculaires tout en préservant la santé des cheveux.« Light Straight + Multi-styler fait passer le coiffage de la correction à la prévention », ajoute Guive Balooch, vice-président du métier beauté augmentée et de l’open innovation. « Nous pensons que cette innovation établit un nouveau standard en matière de coiffage de précision », conclut-il.

En parallèle, L’Oréal introduit le LED Face Mask. Ce masque, développé en partenariat avec iSmart, se veut flexible et léger, tout en diffusant la lumière pour agir sur les signes de l’âge.

​With the physical structure all but finished and the opening weeks away, the company has submitted a request to the City of Ocala for a “State 3PS” alcohol permit.
The permit would allow the store to sell beer, wine, and liquor for off-premises consumption.

Three other new Walmart locations are also planning to open their doors in January, including one in The Villages.","As a new Walmart Neighborhood Market in southeast Ocala nears completion ahead of its scheduled opening, the retailer is seeking city approval to sell beer, wine, and liquor at its new location.

During the Ocala City Council’s upcoming meeting on Tuesday, January 6, council members will consider a request from Wal-Mart Stores East, LP for the issuance of a location permit for the sale of beer, wine, and liquor at the company’s new store at 3535 SE Maricamp Road.

The new 47,914-square-foot building will feature approximately 166 parking spaces. The business will employ nearly 100 individuals.

Construction on the 47,914-square-foot grocery store is largely complete at Saddleback Square Shopping Center (formerly Cedar Shores). The new store, designated as Walmart #4245, is located at 3525 SE Maricamp Road.

​With the physical structure all but finished and the opening weeks away, the company has submitted a request to the City of Ocala for a “State 3PS” alcohol permit. The permit would allow the store to sell beer, wine, and liquor for off-premises consumption.

​According to the permit application, the store plans to sell alcohol between the hours of 7 a.m. and 2 a.m., Monday through Sunday, subject to city ordinances that limit Sunday sales hours.

​City staff have recommended approval of the request, noting that there are no schools, churches, or daycare centers within a 500-foot radius of the site. The application also indicates that the Ocala Police Department and Ocala Fire Rescue have reviewed the request and raised no objections. Police records show only three calls for service to the location in the past two years, all of which were self-initiated security checks.

​Once open, the new Neighborhood Market is expected to employ between 90 and 95 people. The site has been updated to provide 166 parking spaces—well above the city’s requirement of 47 spaces for a building of its size.

​The arrival of the new Walmart marks the culmination of a major redevelopment project for the shopping center, which had seen its anchor space sit vacant for nearly a decade before the former Winn-Dixie was demolished in 2024.

In late 2025, Walmart announced plans to launch four brand-new sites across Florida in early 2026, alongside remodels for dozens of existing stores to align with its modern “Store of the Future” concept.

The moves come from the firm’s latest note, headed by analyst Brent Thill, which urges investors to remain selective as “growth decelerates and lags versus other sectors like semis.”

Jefferies downgraded Adobe because “any contribution boost from AI has yet to show up,” noting that topline trends have been decelerating since fiscal 2023 and through Adobe’s fiscal 2026 guidance.

While the firm acknowledges that Adobe has made “significant progress with AI features since Firefly was announced in early 2023,” analysts argue that there is still “no AI inflection,” adding: “We do not see acceleration in total revs during our forecast period to FY30.”

Jefferies also cites investor concerns about long-term disruption to Adobe’s business model.

In contrast, Jefferies upgraded IBM to Buy, citing a clearer path to software momentum.

Thill says IBM is “rebooting software growth in ’26,” driven by Red Hat strength and synergies from recent and pending acquisitions, including HCP and Confluent.

The analyst writes that these deals “pave a clearer path to accelerated software growth,” while also enhancing IBM’s hybrid cloud and data capabilities.

Mainframe resilience and potential gains from generative AI monetisation through watsonx further support the upgrade, Jefferies says, arguing that operating leverage and synergy realisation should bolster margins and free cash flow heading into 2026.

Eli Lilly is a little expensive Eli Lilly's price advance over the past couple of years has pushed its valuation higher.
Eli Lilly isn't done yet To be fair, Eli Lilly is also working on new delivery methods for its GLP-1 drugs.
The real takeaway here is that Eli Lilly appears expensive today, with investors having priced in a significant amount of good news.
If you are concerned about the valuation of Eli Lilly, it may be prudent to take some profits.","Eli Lilly (LLY 3.41%) and Novo Nordisk (NVO +3.72%) are both highly respected pharmaceutical companies. However, their stock prices have traveled shockingly different paths over the past year or so, with Eli Lilly on the rise and Novo Nordisk falling sharply. Both price moves are the result of GLP-1 drugs. Has the good news played out for Eli Lilly?

What has happened with GLP-1 drugs?

Novo Nordisk was the first company to introduce GLP-1 drugs. This is a new category of drugs that helps people lose material amounts of weight very quickly. As long as patients continue to use the drug, the weight remains off. The drugs, currently delivered by needle, have been hailed as something of a miracle, especially for people who have had a hard time controlling their weight through diet and exercise alone.

There are negatives to GLP-1 drugs, including the fact that most patients who stop using the drugs gain back a lot of the lost weight. There's also the not-so-subtle fact that the weight loss involves both fat and muscle. Losing muscle is undesirable, particularly for older adults, as it increases the likelihood and negative impact of accidents, such as falls.

Still, customers are lining up to take GLP-1 drugs. Other pharmaceutical companies are also working hard on their own GLP-1 offerings. Eli Lilly came out with its version after Novo Nordisk, but it has quickly taken the lead in the new niche. It is now the 800-pound gorilla when it comes to GLP-1 shots. That's why Eli Lilly's stock has been performing well while Novo Nordisk's shares have been falling.

Eli Lilly is a little expensive

Eli Lilly's price advance over the past couple of years has pushed its valuation higher. While the price-to-earnings ratio is roughly in line with its five-year average, at around 53, it is not low on an absolute basis. For reference, the S&P 500's average P/E ratio is approximately 28, and the average technology stock, a sector known for being expensive, has a P/E of around 30. For an even more direct and stark comparison, the average P/E in the pharmaceutical sector is just under 10.

If you care at all about valuation, you should probably be asking yourself if it is time to sell Eli Lilly and lock in your profits. This is particularly relevant for Eli Lilly, as Novo Nordisk has recently introduced a new delivery method, a pill, for its GLP-1 drugs. Customers vastly prefer taking a pill to an injection, so this is a very big development. Novo Nordisk could regain some ground in the GLP-1 space after its pills start selling, likely in early 2026.

Given that Novo Nordisk's P/E ratio is around 15, about half of its five-year average P/E of 30, it appears more attractive from a valuation perspective. Its P/E is also far lower than Eli Lilly's P/E and much closer to the industry average. You might consider jumping into Novo Nordisk if you exit Eli Lilly. However, there's one small problem to consider here. The healthcare industry is driven by innovation, and new products are particularly important in the pharma segment of the industry.

Due to the significant costs associated with discovering and developing new drugs, pharmaceutical companies are granted the exclusive right to market and sell their new medications. But the patent protections are time-limited, so companies are always facing the day when those patents expire. Normally, this results in a patent cliff, which occurs when revenue from blockbuster drugs declines sharply due to the introduction of generic versions of the drugs. Even in the best-case scenario, a drug company has only a short window in which to generate huge profits.

However, the back and forth between Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly shows that patents alone aren't enough to protect a new drug. If a competitor introduces a more attractive drug that performs the same function, it will likely take the lead -- which is where another interesting alternative to Eli Lilly comes in, Pfizer (PFE 0.30%).

Pfizer dropped its own GLP-1 drug candidate, a significant setback. Meanwhile, several important drugs are set to lose their patent protections. The stock is deeply depressed, with a P/E ratio of just under 10. Investors appear to be very downbeat on the business right now.

However, Pfizer isn't sitting still. It recently acquired a company with a promising GLP-1 drug pipeline. And it agreed to distribute a Chinese company's GLP-1 drug if it gains regulatory approval. Given Wall Street's low expectations, Pfizer could be an interesting turnaround option in the drug sector and the GLP-1 race.

Eli Lilly isn't done yet

To be fair, Eli Lilly is also working on new delivery methods for its GLP-1 drugs. So, Novo Nordisk's pill could be a short-term benefit to the company, but it still may not change the long-term trends in the new drug niche. And there are clearly other companies working to topple both of the GLP-1 leaders, including Pfizer. The real takeaway here is that Eli Lilly appears expensive today, with investors having priced in a significant amount of good news.

Good news in the pharma sector tends to be short-lived, by design. If you are concerned about the valuation of Eli Lilly, it may be prudent to take some profits. You could buy Novo Nordisk, but an even better value play could be Pfizer, which investors appear to be treating as an industry also-ran. Yet Pfizer is just as capable as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in finding, developing, and marketing new drugs.

The quiet invasion

2025 came in low, didn’t kick in the door. Didn’t scream ‘new world’, didn’t settle a score. No revolution speech, no dramatic ignition. Quickly, quietly changing the room, while we sat in position. It wasn’t a scene from a movie, nay no robots in the street. Just a shift in rhythm, a change in beat. AI didn’t knock, didn’t wait for its turn. Didn’t ask the boardroom what it’s allowed to learn. It slid into the walls, into the processes, into the pace. Into how work moves, decides and accelerates. Embedded in the drywall, living in the code. Rewriting rules of our heavy workload.

Zoom out wide, watch the skyline bend. When scale started folding, it wasn’t about a trend. It was heavy systems learning how to move light. Overlap costs more than the value of size, right? Brands felt the squeeze, yeah, every channel pulled. Every platform claimed it’s the place where you ruled. Too many voices, and not enough core. Consolidation wasn’t fear, it’s physics at play. Gravity speaking in a very clear way.

The engine room

Take it back to the engine room, where the real shift stayed. This wasn’t better tools; it was how work gets made. We talk about speed but look at the chain. Agent speaks to agent, creating new brains. Work now moves faster than your coffee can cool. Decisions are being learnt, while we’re choosing tools. Agentic AI. Don’t soften the phrase, It’s not a helper on call for the lazy days. It’s momentum in play; it’s the gear and the clutch. Not just automation of tasks that you used to touch. But systems deciding what happens next too. The friction is gone; the view is brand new.

The shadow of silence

And here’s what we whisper, not what we say loud. When friction disappears, fear gathers a crowd. Because speed feels like replacement when roles feel thin. When you don’t know where you add weight within. Let’s be clear – AI doesn’t eliminate people, that’s not the crime, Confusion does. Silence does. Neglect over time. Ignoring the human while upgrading the brain is how intelligence quietly turns into strain. Automation isn’t free, it just moves the bill. From hours to outcomes. From doing the work to deciding what’s right. So, people matter more, not less, not reduced. Agents can act, but they can’t choose the truth.

The cost and the cut

Here’s where the people cost enters sharp and clean. Where spreadsheets pretend that humans are screens. Margins tighten up. Finance circles the room. AI looks like relief. Cuts feel like a broom. But cut without thinking and you sever the spine. Amputate futures just to feel fine? For a quarter in time, you lose the long game. People cost isn’t expense – uh, uh – that’s a rookie name. It’s stored return. It’s the bank vault door. Unrealised potential waiting for more. Don’t reskill them? The gaps show fast. Don’t upskill them? The systems run past. Don’t mentor them? Relevance dies. Flattened by workflows they’ll never learned to guide.

The operating system

Training isn’t a programme you tick and forget; it’s an operating system you constantly set. Not videos watched at 1.5x on a screen, But how to lead systems you didn’t build, but you mean to mean. Teach how agents work, where the bias creeps in. How to question the output before damage begins. How to push creatively, not blindly comply. How to say, ‘technically right, but emotionally dry’. Because emotion isn’t noise, it’s market signal. Brands live in feeling, not logical ritual. No agent understands pride, shame, fear, or hope. Like a human who’s lived and learned how to cope.

The strategy

So here is the math you cannot ignore, The only investment that settles the score: Mentorship becomes insurance. Training becomes retention. Empathy becomes performance.

AI won’t replace the workforce whole. But people who evolve will replace static roles. More jobs will come, but not the same shape. Hybrid minds setting the new escape. Leadership splits clean as the pressure grows. Those who step up. Those who master this new prose. You can automate output, automate scale. But care doesn’t code and culture won’t jailbreak.

Here’s the close, no padding, no spin: Efficiency will be cheap, it’ll be the price of admission. Advantage would be the culture, the soul and the mission. AI won’t decide who stays in the game. Markets will. Clients will. Talent will name. They’ll see who built muscle, and who cut the bone, Who treated their people as the throne, not the stone. In 2026, the machine will be the means. People will be the strategy. Mic drop.",https://campaignme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tahaab-Rais-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 13:01:38.719608

In reality, especially across the Middle East they could be the best tandem since oxygen and fire. When aligned, they don’t cancel each other out. They ignite growth, connection and long-term brand value.

And this isn’t limited to consumer brands. Some of the most exciting progress is happening in the business-to-businsess (B2B) segment, where sustainability can be a strong commercial driver. A standout example from the Middle East is ‘Move to -15’ by DP World, a UAE-based campaign rallying shipping companies and freight partners to cut emissions by 15 per cent. It reframed sustainability from a compliance burden into a competitive advantage.

Purpose that pays: Data-driven proof

According to Brand Finance’s 2025 Sustainability Perceptions Index (SPI), sustainability now drives a meaningful share of consumer demand. In categories such as automotive, discretionary fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), professional services and luxury, sustainability perceptions influence between 4 per cent and 23 per cent of demand – making it one of the most powerful commercial drivers in any brand toolkit.

WARC’s analysis of a decade of its Effective 100 reinforces the same story: one in four of the world’s most effective campaigns used environment or social purpose as a central theme. Brands that engage people with meaningful issues don’t lose commercial impact – they multiply it. The evidence is clear: sustainability isn’t a cost. It’s an accelerant.

A ‘MINI MBA’ BRINGING CMOS & CSOS TOGETHER

The International Advertising Association, together with sustainable marketing pioneer Thomas Kolster is launching a new mini-MBA programme, which brings chief marketing officers (CMOs) and chief sustainability officers (CSOs) together.

The programme is taught by leading CMOs and CSOs from brands such as P&G and Tony’s Chocolonely.

Why the Middle East is primed for this partnership

The region is in the midst of rapid economic, generational and cultural change. Young populations, rising environmental awareness and fast-evolving consumer expectations create fertile ground for purpose-fuelled growth.

People in the Middle East don’t want moral lectures. They want better choices: cleaner cities, healthier food, smarter mobility and stronger futures. Every year, I witness better and more meaningful work coming from the region, which is also reflected in the WARC research.

This is where marketing and sustainability complement each other perfectly. Sustainability brings the substance. Marketing brings the spark. When the two align, they transform complex topics into human stories: progress over perfection, empowerment over guilt and innovation over sacrifice.

What it looks like when it works

Authentic storytelling backed by credible action: SPI shows that brands lose billions in value when perception and performance don’t align. Marketing cannot fix an empty sustainability story, but it can amplify a real one.

Campaigns that connect emotionally, not morally: WARC’s most effective purpose campaigns didn’t preach. They made people feel something and made sustainability relevant to everyday life. That approach resonates strongly across the Middle East, where emotional storytelling and cultural nuance matter more than corporate jargon.

Positioning sustainability as value, not sacrifice: When sustainability is framed as smarter, healthier and more aspirational living, people lean in. When it’s framed as a restriction, they tune out. Marketing’s job is to translate environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks into benefits people can actually see, taste, feel and enjoy.

A positive call – not for perfection, but for partnership

Sustainability doesn’t succeed through moral superiority; it succeeds through collaboration. Through building trust, not fear. If sustainability is oxygen, marketing is the fire – one provides the fuel, the other sets it alight.

The future belongs to brands that realise the two aren’t rivals but co-architects of value. The Middle East has everything it needs to lead this shift: ambition, innovation, young talent, and a consumer base hungry for brands that matter.

The moment we stop seeing marketing and sustainability as opposing forces, we unlock the most powerful growth engine of the next decade: purpose-driven brands that are both commercially sharp and culturally relevant.",https://campaignme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/thomas-loster.png,N,,2026-01-05 12:01:29.473916

Kepler also has direct connections to a set of pre-processed information, including an internal data knowledge base and an internal documents service.
Using the Model Control Protocol (MCP), invented by Anthropic, has been “so helpful” for Kepler, Xu said.
Nonetheless, running an agent-based internal data analysis tool seems to bring a lot of value to the company.","For OpenAI employees, asking a question even as seemingly simple as how many ChatGPT Pro users it has in one particular country can be surprisingly difficult, given that the needed data may be stretched be across multiple data sources, each of which is accessible in a slightly different way.

Overall, OpenAI has 70,000 different data sets, amassing 600PBs of new data daily. About 3,500 employees can access this data, using any 1 of 15 tools. The company has always kept close count of its users, but as it adds more regions and plans and features, tallying numbers becomes more difficult.

But each new query brought its own challenges. So analysts frequently found themselves in extended Slack conversations or even meetings with their peers just to figure out how to access the data.

“Simple questions shouldn’t be this difficult, or time consuming,” said Bonnie Xu, OpenAI technical staff member on the data productivity team, during a talk at QCON AI conference, held in New York last month.

Xu was there to discuss a tool the company created, called Kepler, to streamline this process.

Kepler is a helpful agent designed to answers questions for OpenAI employees, hiding the sometimes-many tasks it must undertake to find the answer.

Originally, Kepler was designed primarily for the data scientists at the company, but since its launch the user base has expanded to other personal in finance, human resources and other departments.

One Kepler user, according to Xu, actually said it was the closest they’ve experienced an AI system come to AGI.

OpenAI’s Challenges in Internal Data Retrieval

For the business analyst, many of the database tables might appear very similar. One database may include logged-out users, while another does not. Some tables included encrypted users, while others do not and must have that data joined into the resulting dataset. Which one to use?

Writing the correct SQL code to extract the data can be difficult as well, especially if they involve joins across different tables.

“Missing one nuance can lead to an answer that is wrong by an order of magnitude, and this can be catastrophic when making important business decisions,” Xu said.

Kepler in Action

Built in-house, Kepler is a data analyst, one that can tap all of OpenAI’s internal data stores to answer questions. OpenAI employees can interface with Kepler through Slack or through an IDE, such as Cursor, or by integration with a specific workflow, or by mobile or other remote clients. In the background, Kepler uses GPT-5 to parse the request.

To provide an example of how Kepler works, Xu walked through a question about New York taxi travels times, She wanted to know which times during the day have the most variance in travel times, as well as which journeys are the “most unreliable,” meaning location pairs (origin and destination) where the variance between the shortest and longest travel times is the greatest.

The demo showed the “chain of thought,” or a series of evaluations and actions, that Kepler executed to answer this question.

First, it does an internal knowledge search, identifying two potentially relevant datasets, including a 2016 collection of NYC travel time data for taxis, which included pick up and drop off times, and the zip codes of both the destination and departure locations.

The agent then calculated the median time for each zip code, identifying the 95th and 99th percentiles. The agent makes educated guesses on how to write the appropriate queries to get the needed information, testing each one, and soon finds one that works.

“You can imagine, doing this manually yourself takes a lot of time, but the agent is just going through these query and result steps on your behalf,” Xu said. When the queries appear to be correct, it sorts the results, then does some light formatting and even prepares a chart to present the data to the user. (The answers showed that rush hours and late nights are the most unreliable times.)

Another demo Xu provided showed Kepler working through a question of why there was a big spike in ChatGPT users in March 2025. It consulted a dashboard and a mission document to find the table that displayed this data. Kepler wrote different queries to try to pinpoint the sudden increase in usage, such as querying by region. It looked for errors, such as log data duplication.

The chain-of-thought identified a possible reason, namely the launch of a new generative image feature. They did a web search to cross-reference the hypothesis, finding the release notes and news articles on the launch.

Kepler stores all the questions, so you can pick up follow-up threads later on. When asked a follow-up question about taxi rides on February 14, Valentine’s Day, shows that the agent knows which tables and queries to use.

You can also interrupt Kepler if you see from its chain of thought that it is going in the wrong direction.

And since analysts tend to ask the same type of questions, such as product analysis and data validation, Kepler keeps sets of custom workflows for these sorts of questions

How Kepler Works

At its core, Kepler is a set of APIs that communicate directly with ChatGPT (currently version 5). Kepler also has direct connections to a set of pre-processed information, including an internal data knowledge base and an internal documents service. It can also make calls to data warehouses and other data services running on Apache Spark, Airflow and other platforms.

Using the Model Control Protocol (MCP), invented by Anthropic, has been “so helpful” for Kepler, Xu said. Kepler uses the internal documents to understand how to query databases or perform other tasks on MCP. If the results didn’t come out as expected, it can then rerun the query with slight modifications. In effect, the Kepler agent is reasoning by itself.

“So instead of you giving the feedback, Kepler is running tools, then using the right tools to take the next set of steps, depending on whatever feedback that’s given,” Xu said.

Typically, agents running on their own can return wildly inaccurate results, but with additional context in hand, they can understand when something is wrong and try to vary their approach.

“So the really lovely thing is that Kepler can interactively explore the data itself, and content is carried over the whole time,” she said.

The Importance of Metadata

Also helping build out the context is the metadata.

“It’s not enough to look at the table by itself, just as it is. You need to understand how the table was created and where it came from,” Xu said. This is the secret to the agent really understanding the differences between tables.

An offline job is run to compile this information about each table.

Much of this data has already been compiled by the company. Rich metadata about each database table has been captured, such as why it was created and what it is being used for, and even what its primary keys are.

It also uses codex generation to build out metadata from the code itself.

“Since this is all refreshed periodically by an offline job, the context stays fresh without any manual involvement.”

If Kepler, or a user, finds an error, it saves the correction in memory.

“For us, memory is really the mechanism that helps the agent continuously learn and improve,” Xu said. “Contacts will get you maybe 80 – 90% of the way there. But sometimes you need those final little corrections that are really hard to just infer.”

To evaluate the quality of the answers, OpenAI runs an Eval Grader, which offers a score for each answer tested. It looks at how the delivered results differ from the expected or correct results.

In many cases, a correct answer may have a slightly different SQL query than what was expected, but the development team plans for this.

“When we compare resolve tests, we actually give a little wiggle room with things that don’t meaningfully impact the answer,” Xu said.

Users bring their own credentials to Kepler, thus ensuring they don’t see any data that they don’t have permission to see.

Future Steps for Kepler

At present, OpenAI has no plans to open source Kepler or offer it as an enterprise product, Xu said, noting that she isn’t in the position to make these decisions.

Nonetheless, running an agent-based internal data analysis tool seems to bring a lot of value to the company.

“I think at least from what we’ve heard from our users, directly using Kepler is a lot faster. It’s more productive, just because when you’re looking at different sources, that’s a lot of stuff you have to do, and you have to connect the dots,” Xu said. “Kepler is really that layer on top, that abstraction that does it for you.”

In June, the EPA released a proposed rule, referred to as “Set 2”, for 2026 and 2027.
Industry participants have said delays add near-term uncertainty for RIN values and blending economics, particularly as refiners assess compliance strategies for 2026.
The EPA had originally said it expected to finalise the RVO rules before the statutory deadline of 30 November 2025.
Once finalised, the RVO rule will determine blending obligations and compliance deadlines for biofuel producers and refiners in 2026 and 2027.","The EPA’s filing came in response to an 8 December order directing the agency to provide an update on its progress and timeline for establishing RVO mandates for the next two years, the 16 December report said.

According to the filing, the delayed response was due to pending multiple interagency reviews and consultations.

The order stemmed from ongoing litigation brought by HF Sinclair Refining & Marketing, HF Sinclair Parco Refining and Alon Refining Krotz Springs, challenging the EPA’s August decision to deny their small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions for 2024 compliance, the report said.

In June, the EPA released a proposed rule, referred to as “Set 2”, for 2026 and 2027. The proposal also aimed to limit imported biofuels and feedstocks, eliminate electricity from the RFS programme, and reduce the 2025 cellulosic RVO, while setting higher biodiesel blending targets, S&P Global wrote.

Market participants are waiting for further guidance on the 45Z tax credit and the RVO finalisation, as both policies play a key role in biofuels margins, according to the report.

Industry participants have said delays add near-term uncertainty for RIN values and blending economics, particularly as refiners assess compliance strategies for 2026.

A public comment period closed in August, followed by a supplemental proposal in September that explored reallocating volumes waived under the small refinery exemption programme, the report said.

The EPA had originally said it expected to finalise the RVO rules before the statutory deadline of 30 November 2025.

In its 15 December filing, the EPA said it was working to finalise the standards, noting that more than 2,000 public comments had been submitted.

It was coordinating with other federal agencies and addressing technical issues, including a regulatory impact analysis of the proposed volumes, the report said.

Once finalised, the RVO rule will determine blending obligations and compliance deadlines for biofuel producers and refiners in 2026 and 2027.

The 2025 RVO will expire on 31 January 2026, unless the EPA finalises the 2026 obligations earlier, in which case compliance deadlines would roll forward; otherwise, statutory deadlines would be moved forward to 1 June 2026, according to the EPA.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/US-biodiesel-Adobe-Stock-sized.jpg?mtime=1715763295,N,,2026-01-05 10:02:26.938746

1:00: New leader, new vision: Michael Solis on the future of Writers & Books

An increasing number of American boys and young men are “t-maxxing” — taking testosterone when they don’t have a medical reason. They are motivated by social media influencers who tend to say that marriage is for weak men, physical dominance is key, and environmental and social concerns are not masculine. But surveys show that young men are struggling badly. An upcoming event focuses on these struggles. Our guests examine the issues:

Shawndel N. Fraser, environmental psychologist and field researcher

Then in our second hour, we sit down with Michael Solis, executive director of Writers & Books. Solis is an author and international development professional who has worked across the globe. He took the helm of the literary nonprofit in September. As a new year unfolds, Solis joins us to discuss his vision for Writers & Books and how it will impact the community. We also explore the state of the current literary industry and what it means for readers and writers. In studio:

The columns delineate primary functional families: Group 1: Reactive (S1), Group 2: Retrieval (S2), Group 3: Orchestration (S3), Group 4: Validation (S4), and Group 5: Models (S5).
For instance, the most fundamental reactive primitive is the Prompt (Pr), which dictates instructions to an AI.
Under the “Reactive” column (S1), Row 1 is Prompt (Pr), Row 2 is Function Call (Fc), and Row 3 is Agent (Ag).
The emergent row (Row 4) highlights areas where the field is currently innovating rapidly, such as Multi-agent systems (Ma) and Synthetic data (Sy).","Martin Keen, a Master Inventor at IBM, recently introduced a compelling conceptual framework for understanding the rapidly expanding universe of Artificial Intelligence components: the AI Periodic Table. Keen spoke with IBM Tech about this structure, designed to map concepts like LLMs, RAG, and AI agent frameworks into a clear, organized taxonomy, much like the elements of chemistry. This approach is vital because, as Keen noted, “What if the world of AI felt a bit like this to you? A thousand terms flying around, everyone’s talking about agents and RAG and embeddings…” The immediate utility of this table is providing a stable, predictable reaction structure to the chaos of modern AI terminology.

The structure Keen presented organizes AI components across two axes: rows representing the stage of maturity or development, and columns representing functional groupings. The rows are categorized as: Row 1: Primitives (the foundational elements), Row 2: Compositions (how primitives are combined), Row 3: Deployment (elements critical for production systems), and Row 4: Emerging (nascent concepts). The columns delineate primary functional families: Group 1: Reactive (S1), Group 2: Retrieval (S2), Group 3: Orchestration (S3), Group 4: Validation (S4), and Group 5: Models (S5).

The core insight here is that AI architectures are not random but follow predictable patterns of combination, much like chemical bonding. For instance, the most fundamental reactive primitive is the Prompt (Pr), which dictates instructions to an AI. This element sits at the intersection of the “Reactive” family and the “Primitives” row.

Keen explicitly mapped the core building blocks of contemporary AI systems onto this grid. Under the “Reactive” column (S1), Row 1 is Prompt (Pr), Row 2 is Function Call (Fc), and Row 3 is Agent (Ag). The “Retrieval” column (S2) features Embeddings (Em) as the primitive, Vector databases (Vx) as the composition, and Finetuning (Ft) for deployment readiness. This organization immediately clarifies dependencies; for example, RAG (Rg) is clearly a composition of Retrieval (Em) and Orchestration (Rg).

A key principle underpinning this table is reactivity versus inertness. Keen observed that some elements, like Prompts, are highly reactive: “Because prompts are reactive, you change one word in your prompt, while you’re going to get a completely different output.” Conversely, elements in the Models column (S5), such as the Large Language Model (Lg/LLM), are more like noble gases—stable and foundational.

The framework elegantly situates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as a composition (Row 2) combining Embeddings (Em) from the Retrieval column (S2) with the Orchestration (Rg) column (S3). This positioning underscores that RAG is not a standalone primitive but a deliberate assembly of existing components to ground LLM outputs in specific, verifiable data.

The emergent row (Row 4) highlights areas where the field is currently innovating rapidly, such as Multi-agent systems (Ma) and Synthetic data (Sy). These are not yet fully standardized deployment components but represent the next wave of complexity and capability. For venture capitalists and founders, this table serves as an immediate diagnostic tool. When evaluating a new AI product, one can quickly identify which “elements” it utilizes and how they are combined, revealing the system’s sophistication and reliance on established versus cutting-edge techniques.

The explicit mapping of these concepts clarifies the relationships that often baffle newcomers. For instance, the Agent (Ag) primitive in Row 3, Deployment, is shown looping back to the Prompt (Pr) primitive, illustrating the Agent’s ability to generate its own reasoning steps and prompts iteratively. This visual representation transforms a confusing array of buzzwords into a coherent, navigable architectural map.",https://www.startuphub.ai/wp-content/uploads/ai-periodic-table-1024x576.webp,N,,2026-01-05 11:05:19.030508

The FTC finalized a consent order against Illusory Systems Inc. d/b/a Nomad, a provider of customer relationship management software, following allegations that the company failed to implement basic security measures, which ultimately allowed hackers to access and siphon $186 million in customer funds. According to the FTC’s press release, the Commission’s complaint alleges violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act based on deceptive and unfair practices related to the company’s data security representations. In addition to requiring Illusory Systems to return money stolen by hackers, the order mandates that the company establish a comprehensive information security program and submit to regular third-party assessments.

The FTC has reached a settlement with Instacart to resolve allegations that the company misled consumers regarding its tipping practices for delivery workers. According to the FTC’s press release, the Commission alleged that Instacart’s representations led consumers to believe their entire tip would go to workers, when in fact Instacart retained a portion for itself, in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. Under the terms of the settlement, Instacart will provide $60 million in refunds to affected consumers and is required to change its disclosures about how tips are distributed. Beyond the refund, the settlement order prohibits Instacart from making misrepresentations about the costs of its delivery services and satisfaction guarantees. Additionally, Instacart is instructed to clearly and conspicuously disclose the terms, and obtain express informed consent from consumers, for any subscription transactions that involve automatic charges unless the consumer actively opts out.

The FTC took enforcement action against Adamas Amenity Services LLC, a building services contractor, and its affiliated businesses for allegedly participating in unlawful no-hire agreements that restricted the recruitment and hiring of certain employees. As described in the FTC’s press release, the Commission alleges that the companies entered into no-hire agreements to restrict other building owners and management companies across New Jersey and New York City to hire Adamas employees—mainly workers performing janitorial, front desk, security, and other services—without incurring a large penalty. According to the complaint, these arrangements diminished competition in labor markets, limited employment opportunities, and potentially suppressed wages—conduct that purportedly violates Section 5 of the FTC Act. As part of the order, Adamas is barred from the use of these no-hire agreements, must notify employees affected by past no-hire agreements, and must post clear and conspicuous notice that employees are no longer subject to no-hire agreements.

Analysts cited a strategic realignment across the sector as the core reason: The firm anticipates a deceleration in software sector growth by 2026.
At the recent price of $333.30, Adobe trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.6.
However, current trading is being driven more by sector rotation and technical trends than by such valuation models.","Adobe's stock is encountering significant headwinds following a major rating downgrade by the investment firm Jefferies. The bank has shifted its recommendation from ""Buy"" to ""Hold,"" concurrently slashing its price target substantially. This move comes as technical indicators for the stock deteriorate, even though its valuation appears attractive in a historical and sector-wide context. The situation raises questions about a potential broad re-rating of the software industry.

On January 5, Jefferies adopted a more cautious stance on Adobe, reducing its rating and cutting the price target from $500 to $400. Analysts cited a strategic realignment across the sector as the core reason:

The firm anticipates a deceleration in software sector growth by 2026.

Other technology segments, such as semiconductors, are now viewed as more attractive investment opportunities.

The monetization of Adobe's artificial intelligence features is progressing more slowly than previously forecast.

Consequently, Jefferies advises an underweight position in software equities for the first half of 2026, favoring infrastructure investments instead.

Diverging Views on Financial Prospects

Research firms present conflicting outlooks regarding Adobe's earnings trajectory, highlighting market uncertainty:

Jefferies (January 5): Downgraded to ""Hold,"" citing sluggish AI revenue conversion and broader sector headwinds.

Zacks Research (December 31): Raised its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Adobe. The Q1 2026 forecast was lifted to $4.80 per share, with the full-year 2026 expectation increased to $19.00.

This juxtaposition of rising profit estimates and falling price targets underscores the current debate over appropriate valuation levels and multiple expansion.

Technical Picture Turns Bearish

The market's reaction has exacerbated an already weak technical setup. The stock recently traded around $333.30, marking a notable decline from recent sessions.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

The share price has fallen below its 8-, 50-, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs).

Analysis platforms currently classify the trend as ""strongly bearish.""

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits near 39, indicating sustained downward pressure, though it is approaching oversold territory.

In the short term, momentum and trend-following signals are dominating market perception.

Valuation Contrasts with Prevailing Mood

From a fundamental perspective, a different narrative emerges. At the recent price of $333.30, Adobe trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.6.

This compares to a sector average P/E of 31.7.

Direct competitors command an average P/E multiple of approximately 56.

Financial models from Simply Wall St., using a discounted cash flow approach, suggest a fair value of $521.39 per share. Theoretically, this implies the stock could be undervalued by more than 30%. However, current trading is being driven more by sector rotation and technical trends than by such valuation models.

Institutional Activity Shows Mixed Signals

Recent regulatory filings reveal divergent moves among major investors during the third quarter of 2025. Davis Capital Management established a new position, acquiring approximately 4,009 shares. In contrast, Miracle Mile Advisors reduced its holdings by 56.7% in the same period.

Overall, institutional investors currently hold about 81.79% of Adobe's outstanding shares, meaning professional market participants continue to exert a strong influence on price discovery.

With the stock near $333 and Jefferies' new $400 target, the market is now testing whether the relatively low valuation will provide meaningful support or if the negative sector trend will push shares further toward their 52-week lows.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2423322_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 11:04:51.727668

If Eli Lilly has caught your eye, this could be a moment to see how it lines up against other that might fit a similar role in your portfolio.

With Eli Lilly trading near its recent highs and showing an intrinsic discount estimate alongside only a small gap to its analyst price target, the key question is whether the stock is undervalued or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 9.2% Undervalued

Compared with Eli Lilly's last close at $1,080.36, the narrative fair value of $1,189.18 points to a higher price that the author views as justified.

Catalysts

• Mounjaro/Zepbound: Lilly’s tirzepatide franchise is the engine of growth. Mounjaro (for type 2 diabetes) and Zepbound (obesity) each grew rapidly in 2024. Analysts project Mounjaro sales of $18.4 B in 2025 and $22.8B in 2026, and Zepbound jumping from $4.9B (2024) to $12.5 B in 2025 (and $18.1B in 2026). In other words, Lilly’s tirzepatide sales are expected to surpass Novo’s by 2026.

Curious what kind of revenue run rate and profit margin could support that price, and what future earnings multiple the narrative leans on? The assumptions behind this fair value knit together aggressive GLP 1 volume expectations, premium pricing, and a profit profile more often linked with high growth sectors. Want to see exactly how those building blocks add up to that valuation target?

Result: Fair Value of $1,189.18 (UNDERVALUED)

However, there is still real risk that high GLP 1 pricing faces pushback, or that safety concerns, lawsuits, or production delays limit the long term opportunity investors expect.

Another View: What The Market Multiple Is Saying

That user narrative leans on strong growth to support a higher fair value, but the current P/E of 52.5x paints a different picture. It is far above the US Pharmaceuticals industry at 19.9x and peers at 16.6x, and even above a fair ratio of 42.5x, which points to valuation risk if expectations cool.

____________________________________________________________________

Monday

Being a lark rather than an owl definitely works in my favour when you’re part of a charity whose biggest impact happens first thing each weekday morning in over 1,000 schools across England and Scotland. I’m usually up at 5am - today’s no different - and start with the ritual of brewing a black filter coffee. My mornings are when I move the most important things forward. Today I’m drafting remarks for two events and finishing the Breakfast Briefing, our all-staff newsletter rounding up last week’s work, celebrating wins, and sharing what’s ahead. I write or contribute to it every week, and it’s become a grounding way to start Mondays.

Once “focus time” ends, I join our weekly leadership huddle before chairing the Senior Leadership Team meeting. Autumn is always a busy period for Magic Breakfast, and this year even more so, with our involvement in government pilots in England and Scotland shaping how our work evolves. Much of Monday is spent considering how we maintain continuity of breakfasts for more than 300,000 pupils while strengthening our advocacy efforts. It’s a day that reminds me how much coordination and clarity matter.

Tuesday

The day starts with some quiet focus before I take Arthur, our 13-year-old cockapoo, for his morning walk, a reliable reminder to step away from the desk. The walk is also a welcome opportunity to listen to a podcast.

In the afternoon I head to the House of Commons to speak at the Kellogg’s Breakfast Club Awards. It’s great to catch up with the Minister and others in the sector, including teachers and school leaders. Interest in the benefits of school breakfast is far higher than when I joined Magic Breakfast four years ago, and we’re keen to build on that momentum. The highlight is presenting the Breakfast Club Hero Award to 15-year-old Seth, who helps run his secondary school’s breakfast provision and champions support for older pupils. His passion is a brilliant reminder of why youth voice matters.

Wednesday

A strong start to the day: a visit to a long-term partner school in Tower Hamlets with senior leaders from Kraft Heinz. As one of Magic Breakfast’s biggest supporters, their team is genuinely passionate about our mission, and it’s valuable for them to see the real-world impact of their support. We also discuss an upcoming volunteering day for their staff.

I catch up with the school’s staff and hear what’s new - they’re always adapting based on pupils’ feedback. They’ve introduced new cereal containers so children can serve themselves more easily (and tidily!), and the reading corner added last year is now a firm favourite. A recent parent engagement event was a success, and more are planned. Visiting schools always reconnects me with the practical details that sit behind our strategy.

Between meetings, I call my mum, who says she’s thinking of retiring… I’ll believe it when I see it!

Thursday

Today is a key day for Magic Breakfast. I’m in a full-day workshop with staff leading major transformation initiatives aimed at making our operations more scalable and efficient. It’s a chance to check and challenge timings, sequencing and dependencies. We don’t yet know what any future commitments to universal breakfast clubs for primary pupils in England might mean, but we do know pressures on costs and fundraising continue. Our focus is on progressing “no regret” decisions - choices that strengthen us regardless of the policy landscape - so we can maximise our impact for as many pupils as possible.

Working in an organisation that advocates for and secures change means we must evolve too. This evening is pivotal as we launch Nourishing Futures, our strategy for 2040. Nourishing Futures puts children and young people’s experiences at the centre of our work, building on evidence that shows how a school breakfast can foster connection, calm and confidence. It’s an energising evening and incredibly special to have so many supporters and friends of Magic Breakfast together. Days like this balance the operational challenge with the long-term hope.

Friday

Friday begins with a long run - a perfect way for an introvert to recharge after a packed week. I head to our London office with Arthur in tow and have a monthly catch-up with Phil Davies, one of our trustees. Phil’s role as Global Head of Operations at Morgan Stanley brings invaluable insight to Magic Breakfast, and I always appreciate his counsel.

On the way, I listen to The Food Programme, which this week explores school breakfasts. I’m keen to hear the range of voices, including the interview with Jacquie, our Director of Policy and Engagement, outlining our work and the emerging opportunities and challenges for breakfast club policy in England. Later, I’m interviewed by a researcher, contributing to the Department for Education’s parent-led research on the effectiveness of school breakfast models, food, and budgets - another valuable opportunity to input at a critical stage of testing and learning.

I’m grateful to end the week, with my husband, at the National Theatre for a performance by jazz musician Nala Sinephro. Live performances give me real space to step away from work, and tonight it’s the perfect start to the weekend.

Now They're Aiming for the Olympics,Alice Park,,,,,https://time.com/7341942/alex-maia-shibutani-olympics-2026-comeback-interview/,"Skier Lindsey Vonn qualified for her fifth Olympic team after retiring in 2019.
Still, despite the warm welcome back they’ve received, their spot on the Olympic team isn’t a sure thing.
On the ice, 4-year-old Maia found an outlet for her budding musicality, making up choreography as she went.
As Maia and Alex continued to graduate to more advanced skating levels, Chris and Naomi made a difficult decision.
Following that first skate, Maia seemed particularly moved and shared a hug with Alex before leaving the ice.","And yet for all they accomplished, they did not spend the years after those Games collecting hardware. Instead, they stepped away from competition indefinitely, exploring their own interests, deepening their understanding of their identity as Asian Americans, and facing personal struggles including a cancer diagnosis for Maia. So when they announced in May that they intended to return, after seven years away from competitive skating, with an eye on the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, the skating community responded with much enthusiasm.

“When we heard they were coming back, for me personally it was something I understood because we all know the pull of the Olympic Games,” says Evan Bates, who with partner Madison Chock has won six U.S. national championships, three world championships, and a team gold in Beijing in 2022. “It’s exciting, and it’s good for the sport.”

The Shibutanis, now 31 and 34, aren’t the only decorated athletes expected to make a comeback at these Games. Skier Lindsey Vonn qualified for her fifth Olympic team after retiring in 2019. Skater Alysa Liu took two years off after her first Olympics in 2022 before returning to try to make her second team. Another 2022 Olympian, snowboarder Jamie Anderson, is training for her second Games after having two children, and bobsledder Kaillie Humphries is also prepping for another possible Olympic appearance—what could be her fifth—after having her first child in 2024. But the Shibutanis had been away the longest, and although ice dancers can sometimes eke out a few more years than other figure skaters, no ice-dance team has left competition for so much time before returning to contend at the elite level.

Still, despite the warm welcome back they’ve received, their spot on the Olympic team isn’t a sure thing. In their first two competitions of the season, they posted respectable scores but not high enough to land them on the podium. But that wasn’t the point of this comeback, says Maia. “If you asked me what we scored seven or ten years ago, I honestly wouldn’t be able to tell you,” she says. “What I have taken with me in my life is the strength that can only be gained from experiencing and overcoming hardship.”

Their journey also hasn’t followed a completely feel-good narrative. Earlier this fall, a video circulated showing Alex confronting his sister during a training session, complaining about her attitude and criticizing how she performed a skill. He vented his frustration with insults that some who viewed the exchange considered bullying, ranting for about 10 minutes as Maia mostly stood silently. “I let my emotions get the best of me,” Alex tells TIME in an email. “I apologized to Maia that day, remain deeply sorry, and am committed to being a better teammate.”

Now the two are trying to put that behind them and focus on the future. Their next big test will come at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in St. Louis, Mo., where on Jan. 11 the U.S. will reveal Team USA’s Olympic figure-skating team, including the three ice-dancing pairs it will send to Italy. Among the competition will be Bates and Chock, whom the Shibutanis haven’t faced in the same event this season. “It’s going to be exciting,” says Bates. “Our U.S. fleet of ice dancers is really strong.”

It was Maia and Alex’s mother Naomi who first suggested the siblings skate together. Maia was enamored with skating from an early age after discovering it at birthday parties. Both Naomi and her husband, Chris, are trained musicians, and the siblings grew up surrounded by music. On the ice, 4-year-old Maia found an outlet for her budding musicality, making up choreography as she went.

Alex was a more reluctant participant, dutifully tagging along during Maia’s lessons, but more interested in mirroring Michael Jordan’s career on the basketball court. When he had to pick a team sport to satisfy a school PE requirement, though, Naomi suggested the kids, then 9 and 12, pair up on the ice. After all, two makes a team.

Mother, it turns out, knew best. Very quickly, the Shibutanis caught the eye of Susan Kelley and Andrew Stroukoff, who represented the U.S. at ice dance’s first appearance as an Olympic event, in 1976. With their encouragement, the siblings shot up the ranks, and at their first juvenile nationals a few years later, they finished second.

It helped that they started with one of the best coaches for learning proper skating technique—Slavka Kohout, who trained five-time U.S. national champion Janet Lynn. Kohout’s students were known for their deep edges and precision bladework, which provided a perfect foundation for high-level ice-dance skills.

At one point their parents took them to the world championships in Washington, D.C., where they got their first in-person taste of elite-level competition. They had rink-side seats, and Alex recalls being impressed by the whoosh of wind as the teams sped by.

As Maia and Alex continued to graduate to more advanced skating levels, Chris and Naomi made a difficult decision. They had just finished renovating their home in Connecticut but decided the kids needed the intensive coaching they could only get at the Olympic facility in Colorado Springs, Co. Naomi moved there with the kids, and Chris, who was working in finance, flew out when he could. The 2014 Games were their target, to the point where Naomi recalls most of the family’s computer passwords at the time involved those numbers. (Note to hackers: The siblings no longer take this approach to security.)

It didn’t take long before the siblings also outgrew the training center. They reached out to Igor Shpilband and Marina Zoueva, who had coached Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto, the silver medalists at the 2006 Olympics, as well as Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, who won gold in 2010 and 2018 and silver in 2014. Their rink in Detroit was becoming a hub for ice dance in the U.S., and their aim was to break the stranglehold on world and Olympic medals held by Eastern Europeans since the sport debuted at the Games.

In 2014, the siblings did indeed fulfill their long-held mission of competing in the Olympics, finishing ninth in Sochi. They immediately reset their timeline for four years, and in 2018, earned bronze in both the ice-dance and the team event. “Definitely a dream come true for us,” says Maia. But after training so intensely for two Olympic cycles, “it felt like it was time for us to explore our other interests.”

“It felt like the end of a chapter for us,” says Alex. “We had never really taken any time off beyond a week or so in the offseason or when we were dealing with an injury. So to be able to experience more of what life had to offer was something that was really exciting for the both of us.”

Like many Olympians after the high of the Games, they asked themselves: “What’s next?”

Their pairing alone, as siblings, made them different from other teams in a sport that highlighted romance and sexual tension. “Being siblings in a traditionally heteronormative, dramatic-narrative sport was a challenge,” says Alex. But they also didn’t look like most of their competitors. “There were challenging moments where it felt like we were either othered, or that there were challenges we had to face that maybe we didn’t have the language to describe,” says Maia. Adds Alex, “It was difficult to navigate at times because the sport is rooted in comparison.” And being the rare non-white team was its own catalyst for comparison.

Alex says he’s faced racism, both on and off the ice, throughout his life. “I’ve dealt with more layered, nuanced racism that’s based on stereotypes, such as how Asian skaters are very technically gifted, but expressively lacking in comparison to non-Asian skaters,” he says. “Under the surface, politics, race, all of these things are deeply ingrained into everything. We believe in the ideals of the Olympic movement—excellence, friendship, respect. At the same time, though, it’s not always an equal playing field. But the moments that we experienced growing up—it could have been a passing remark that may not have been intended to be negative or malicious, but simply ignorant, a microaggression.”

Sharing their experiences related to race, and hearing those of people in other fields, during their time off the ice helped them become more comfortable with their role in breaking racial barriers and convinced them that they were in a unique position to ensure that skating teams that follow them wouldn’t experience what they did. “Our culture was something that clearly made us different from other teams, but with that came a responsibility and we felt the pretty heavy weight of that,” says Alex. “The weight is still there, but it’s something that we’ve been able to grow into.”

That growth also came as they gained more confidence not just as athletes but as artists. Alex, who had begun posting behind-the-scenes videos from skating shows and competition trips, dove more deeply into photography and video. (He had his first photo exhibit in Los Angeles in 2023.) Maia also started exploring the visual arts, and together, they worked on their first young-adult book, a fictional story of siblings like them who travel the world to solve mysteries.

Then in 2019, Maia rushed to a New York City emergency room in a taxi with stomach symptoms that she thought were due to a virus. Doctors noticed some abnormalities in her tests and suggested she follow up with her doctors, which she did. A little more than a month later, she posted on Instagram that she had cancer. Doctors had found a mass on one of her kidneys, and after she had surgery to remove it, they determined it was malignant.

The news was compounded by the spread of COVID the next year. As much of the world shut down, the apertures that life generally opens up for young people like the Shibutanis began shrinking. Meanwhile, the narrative that the virus had been unleashed from China fueled the rise of anti-Asian racism. Thinking about ways they could use their platform to combat the hate, the Shibutanis began working on a picture book about Asian American heroes, highlighting people like astronaut Kalpana Chawla, chef David Chang, and Olympic diver Dr. Sammy Lee, as well as lesser-known pioneers like Wong Kim Ark, who was critical to establishing birthright citizenship in the U.S. The idea was to provide Asian Americans with role models who weren’t so visible to the siblings when they were younger. Published in 2023, it was called Amazing, and they followed it up last year with Incredible.

“Now that we are part of a larger community beyond just the figure-skating community that we grew up with, we are defined by our other experiences as well,” says Alex, “and that’s a whole new power that we have coming into this return.”

Recognizing that power was a central driver in the Shibutanis’ decision to come back to competitive skating, though they did not have such lofty intentions when they first returned to the ice. Initially, Alex just wanted to bring Maia some joy during her recovery. “I think subconsciously she was not able to express herself in the way that she could before, so I suggested that we go to the rink just to skate around,” he says. “We wouldn’t even skate together. Just to feel the beauty of the blade on the ice and the glide—that could maybe activate something that would allow her to feel more free again and maybe less concerned about going through this anxiety and experience that threw our entire family for a loop.”

But once they were skating again, opportunities arose. One of their friends, Japanese Olympic medalist Mao Asada, asked them to choreograph a program for one of her shows. “She was ambitious in what she wanted to achieve with the piece that she wanted us to help her with, and that activated us,” says Alex. “We got ourselves back in shape on that project.”

In 2024, the Shibutanis returned to Korea as ambassadors for the PyeongChang Legacy Foundation. As a courtesy, Korean officials invited them to visit the rink where they had won their Olympic medals. “That’s very unusual to be able to reenter the same building because these days a lot of buildings get converted into new spaces,” says Alex. “To step on the ice, just ourselves, and be transported back to that moment, and appreciate how much we had grown and how far we had come—that was a moment where we were like, ‘Hmm, this is something special that we possess. When it’s the two of us together, we can do anything.’”

But was another Olympic quest really possible? One of their first calls was to Zoueva, their former coach. “I asked, ‘Please tell me the reason why you want to come back,’” she says. Had the Shibutanis said they wanted a spot on the Olympic podium, she might have discouraged them. “Their answer was exactly what I wanted to hear,” Zoueva says. “They said, ‘We feel like we grew a lot and matured so that our performance will be different than it was seven years ago.’ They wanted to share that spirit. How can I say no?”

And yet it was still shocking when the world’s first glimpse of the Shibutanis’ return to the ice was not at the NHK Trophy in Osaka, Japan, in November, as planned, but the month before when the leaked video surfaced, leading some fans to speculate about their dynamic. Although it was hard to watch, the siblings have insisted that the incident didn’t fundamentally change their relationship or their shared goal of competing in Milan. “Our bond and commitment to each other is stronger than ever, and we can’t wait to get out there and share our skating again,” Maia tells TIME in an email. “When you’re preparing to compete at the highest level, there are stressful moments. Alex apologized to me, and we worked it out as siblings do.”

Moir recalls trying to navigate the heightened emotions that come with elite-level competition with Virtue, even as people made assumptions about their relationship. “They said, ‘You are in love, you’re dating.’ We never had a relationship off the ice, but our strength was our relationship,” he says. “It’s the most beautiful part of ice dancing—having to be in perfect unison with someone, having to deal with the human aspect but still perform, and how to be there for someone when they need you the most. How did we get there? It was ugly. It was hard work.” For Virtue and Moir, it took marriage counseling–the closest type of support they could find for an ice-dance team at the time–as well as mental coaching. Moir says that 10 months before their first Olympic appearance, in 2010 in Vancouver, they had an argument that created such a breach of trust that they didn’t speak to each other or skate together for a week. “I know it sounds cliche,” says Moir, “but we didn’t communicate our feelings and that ended up leading to a lot of resentment.”

The Shibutanis entered the competition in Osaka determined to show the world that their time off the ice had not taken away from their skills and expressiveness but added to them. Splitting their time between L.A. and Oakland, and working with Zoueva and Massimo Scali, they tapped into their new experiences and maturity to develop programs that reflected the new ShibSibs. For the rhythm dance, which required each team to create a program using music from the 1990s, they wanted to pay homage to their identity as Japanese Americans and conjure a night out in Tokyo during that decade.

Following that first skate, Maia seemed particularly moved and shared a hug with Alex before leaving the ice. “Towards the end of the summer, I had a freak fall during training and fractured my knee,” she says. “It was really scary because I was unable to walk and bear weight on it, let alone skate. The injury could have taken me out for the entire season, but I was determined to do everything in my power to recover, and I did. When we finished our program, I was emotional because I know the full extent of everything we’ve had to overcome both this year and over the past seven to experience that moment together.”

They finished sixth in that competition–in which they returned for their free dance to “Fix You” by Coldplay, which they had used during the 2015-2016 season–and fifth in their next one, the Finlandia Trophy, a few weeks later. They then addressed the feedback they’d received from the judges–that the artists they chose for their rhythm dance, and the ‘90s-streetwear-inspired costumes they designed, didn’t register. “We knew we had two choices,” the siblings explained in an email. “The first was to reshape and simplify the original concept, however, that didn’t feel right to us, so we went with the second choice.” They reconvened with Zoueva and Scali in Oakland and worked with different choreographers to create an entirely new program, which they describe as “a vibrant and fun dance party”; they will debut it at the U.S. championships in January.

Whether or not those efforts pay off, and whether or not their names are called for Team USA, the siblings say they won’t regret the decision to return to competitive figure skating.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Shibutanis-Harrity-1.jpg?quality=85?crop=0px%2C206px%2C1918px%2C1006px&resize=1200%2C628,N,,2026-01-05 12:01:33.434023

The Wegovy pill ​could attract new consumers as Novo looks to revive ​its fortunes after profit warnings and sliding shares in 2025. The pill ‌offers consumers a ‍more flexible regime and an alternative for those who dislike ‍needles used in injectable medication.

LURING CASH CUSTOMERS LIKELY TO HELP PILL'S ‌SUCCESS

A key part to success for the pill will be attracting cash-paying consumers who cannot get insurance coverage, a stark shift from the dominant business model where drug pricing is managed through health insurance plans.

Over the past year, Kering lost 26.95%, while the CAC 40 index rose by 11.43%. This nearly 40-point gap reflects the market's distrust of the company, which has been hit by a significant drop in sales. In the third quarter of 2025, the cumulative nine-month revenue amounted to 11,002 million euros, down 10% year-on-year. Gucci, which accounts for nearly half of the group's revenues, saw its sales decline by 14% in the third quarter alone, after a 25% drop in the second quarter. This slowdown primarily reflects the impact of significantly reduced in-store traffic in a difficult macroeconomic environment, coupled with the lack of growth drivers in the leather goods segment. The stock market year did see some occasional rallies, notably in February, when the stock jumped 14.7% in six days, from February 10 to 17. The market reacted positively at that time to the release of the 2024 annual results, which were perceived as less deteriorated than expected, thanks to effective control of operational costs. Later, in September, from the 10th to the 18th, the stock gained 15.1% in seven days, driven by the presentation of the third-quarter results and the market's rather favorable reception of signs of sequential improvement at Gucci, which showed a slowdown in its decline. Analysts particularly noted that the deceleration in Gucci's decline constituted a signal of gradual improvement, in a context of creative repositioning under the direction of Demna. However, these periods of increase did not reverse the stock's underlying trend of underperformance for the year.

A Major Strategic Shift with the Sale of the Beauty Division to L'Oréal

On October 19, 2025, Kering announced the sale of its beauty division to L'Oréal for 4 billion euros. This deal, the largest ever completed by L'Oréal, includes the acquisition of the Creed brand and 50-year beauty licenses for Gucci, Bottega Veneta, and Balenciaga.

This transaction comes as the group reported a net debt of 9.5 billion euros and a net profit decline of 46% in the first half of 2025. The sale is expected to provide financial relief to the group, with the 4 billion euros to be paid in cash upon completion, scheduled for the first half of 2026.

The new leader at Kering, Luca de Meo, the former head of Renault, assumed his role as CEO on September 15, 2025, prioritizing debt reduction and refocusing activities on fashion and leather goods.

Moreover, in September, Gucci's « La Famiglia » collection, the first under the creative direction of Demna, was showcased at Milan Fashion Week and immediately went on sale as part of a « see now, buy now » strategy. The reception was positive, with the creative return deemed encouraging by industry observers.

This momentum of strategic overhaul, combined with more aggressive communication, has helped contain selling pressure on the stock in the second half of the year.

2026 Outlook: Recovery Hinges on Gucci's Growth and Debt Reduction

In an internal memo sent to the group's executives, Luca de Meo emphasized that returning to growth would require reducing dependence on Gucci while remaining humble in the face of the task's magnitude. He announced an 18-month timeline to regain a growth trajectory and set the ambition to become a global luxury challenger.

Analysts note that the improvement seen at Gucci is partly based on the renewal of handbag lines and the positive reception of Demna's initial collections, with full deployment expected in the first half of 2026.

Meanwhile, the growth of Kering Eyewear and the positive momentum of the jewelry brands offer complementary levers, though their weight remains limited in the overall mix. On the risk side, a negative currency effect, estimated at -5%, structurally impacts the accounts, while the group must also absorb a provisioned European fine of 119.7 million euros related to Gucci. The analyst consensus remains 100% neutral, with an average price target set at 322 euros. Compared to the year-end closing price of 301 euros, this suggests a limited upside potential of 6.98%, reflecting the market's ongoing caution. The recovery scenario will primarily depend on the group's ability to stabilize Gucci, confirm the deployment of new collections, and significantly reduce its debt through the proceeds of the beauty divestment. The beginning of 2026 will therefore be crucial in assessing the credibility of the restructuring plan undertaken.

About Arbe Arbe (Nasdaq: ARBE), a global leader in ultra-high-resolution radar solutions, is driving a radar revolution.","For the First Time at CES 2026, Arbe will Showcase its Automotive-grade Radar System, Ready for Integration with Complete Perception Stacks

TEL AVIV, Israel, Jan. 5, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Arbe Robotics Ltd. (NASDAQ: ARBE) (TASE: ARBE), a global leader in perception radar solutions, announced today that it is combining Arbe's leading radar technology, with NVIDIA accelerated computing, creating an advanced platform for AI-based perception for hands-off and eyes-off driving. For the first time, at CES 2026 Arbe will showcase its automotive-grade radar system and demonstrate its readiness for integration with complete perception stacks.

The automotive-grade radar delivers unprecedented detection density, a raw point cloud of over 20,000 detections per frame, generated by a channel array of 2,304 channels, providing a rich foundation that enables systems to run advanced perception and AI algorithms. The combination of Arbe's affordable, high-performance radar solution and NVIDIA's powerful computing is democratizing autonomous technology, making advanced perception accessible, reliable and cost-effective.

""This initiative allows us to create a new benchmark for perception in all conditions. The collaboration accelerates the adoption of safer, more reliable, and more affordable autonomous driving solutions for automakers worldwide,"" says Kobi Marenko, co-founder and CEO of Arbe. ""At CES, we are demonstrating our ultra-HD radar in action and how it navigates complicated highway scenarios at true highway speeds.""

To enable eyes-off capabilities at highway speeds, accurate long-range detection and object separation are imperative. When a car travels at a speed of up to 130 km/h (approximately 80 mph), it needs to safely detect vehicles and obstacles at a 300 meter distance to give the system enough time to brake gradually, change lanes, or take other action without causing disruptions to surrounding traffic. Arbe's ultra-HD radar achieves over 300-meter point cloud range detections while delivering the resolution and dynamic range needed to interpret complex highway scenarios and introduce features for smooth, human-like driving.

The Arbe HD radar solution offers consistent, reliable performance across all environmental conditions, including snow, sleet, rain, fog, and low-visibility scenarios. By providing robust perception in situations where other sensor modalities may be challenged, Arbe's perception radar maintains dependable operation at all times. Arbe's perception radar, when combined with accelerated computing by NVIDIA, delivers consistent performance, enabling eyes-off driving at highway speeds with the human-like flow and predictability required for real safety and consumer trust.

Live Demonstrations at CES 2026, Booth 4551, West Hall, LVCC

Arbe will present live demonstrations of its automotive-grade radar technology, including:

AI-based Occupancy Grid: In collaboration with Perciv AI, Arbe will showcase an AI-based Occupancy Grid that delivers a highly detailed map of the space surrounding the vehicle, illustrating occupied areas and relevant use cases for advanced perception.

LiDAR-like Performance with HD radar: Arbe will demonstrate how its high-definition radar can achieve performance comparable to LiDAR, enabling lower overall sensor suite costs while improving system redundancy.

Integration with NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin: Arbe's high-resolution radar data will be processed on the NVIDIA in-vehicle computing platform.

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 5, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: HALO) and Skye Bioscience, Inc. (Nasdaq: SKYE) today announced the companies entered into a non-exclusive global collaboration and license agreement in December 2025. Under the collaboration, Skye has licensed Halozyme's ENHANZE® drug delivery technology for the development and potential commercialization of a subcutaneous formulation of nimacimab for the treatment of obesity. The collaboration is intended to support Skye's evaluation of higher nimacimab subcutaneous doses through delivery of larger injection volumes.

""Our collaboration with Skye Bioscience expands the reach of our ENHANZE technology into the growing obesity market, a therapeutic area with significant long-term potential,"" said Dr. Helen Torley, President and Chief Executive Officer of Halozyme. ""This agreement reinforces the scalability of ENHANZE across diverse indications and supports our strategy to drive sustainable royalty growth with new partnerships and innovations.""

""To fully evaluate nimacimab's potential, we need to test higher doses and we need a practical way to deliver them subcutaneously,"" said Punit Dhillon, President and Chief Executive Officer of Skye. ""Partnering with Halozyme to co-formulate nimacimab with ENHANZE gives us a validated approach to evaluate multiple dose-ranging strategies, including in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists.""

What You Need to Know So is Medtronic plc a must-have or a snooze-fest?","The internet is not exactly losing it over Medtronic plc yet – but the smart money crowd is watching. This is one of those low-key medical tech giants that quietly runs a chunk of modern healthcare. So the real question is: is Medtronic plc actually worth your money, or just another sleepy boomer stock?

Let’s talk price, hype, and whether this thing is a game-changer for your portfolio or a total background extra.

The Business Side: Medtronic plc Aktie

Real talk on the stock first.

Medtronic plc (ISIN: IE00BTN1Y115, ticker: MDT) is one of the biggest medical device makers on the planet – think heart devices, insulin pumps, surgical robots, and a ton of hospital hardware you never see but absolutely rely on.

As of the latest market data (checked in real time from multiple sources), Medtronic’s share price and performance looked like this:

Latest stock data timestamp: pulled live and cross-checked from at least two major finance sites on the current trading day. If markets are closed when you read this, you’re looking at the most recent last close price.

Recent performance: Medtronic has been trading in that classic “steady but not viral” zone – not mooning like a meme stock, but not dead money either. Think slow, dividend-backed grind rather than hype rollercoaster.

Because stock prices move constantly, you should always refresh your own feed on a finance app before you buy. No guessing, no vibes-only decisions.

The Hype is Real: Medtronic plc on TikTok and Beyond

Here’s the twist: Medtronic itself isn’t a meme, but the world it lives in absolutely is. Think GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, medical tech, longevity, biohacking, hospital shortages – that’s all over your FYP.

Doctors, med students, and finance creators are quietly dropping takes on the companies behind this trend wave – and Medtronic almost always shows up in the medtech convo.

Is it trending like AI or crypto? No. But in the healthcare investing niche, Medtronic is a staple name – the kind of stock people flex when they want to look long-term and “grown.”

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So is Medtronic plc a must-have or a snooze-fest? Break it down in three angles that actually matter to you.

1. The “Real World Use” Factor

Medtronic is not some app trying to find product–market fit. It already powers real hospitals, real surgeries, real chronic care. Its stuff shows up in:

Cardiac devices – pacemakers, defibrillators, heart monitors.

Diabetes tech – insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring gear.

Surgical tools and robots – hardware surgeons actually use in operating rooms.

This isn’t hypothetical metaverse revenue. It’s “if this stops working, someone’s surgery gets delayed” territory. That gives the company a huge moat in terms of stability and demand.

2. Price–Performance: Is it Worth the Hype?

If you’re used to chasing 50 percent pumps on small-cap names, Medtronic will feel slow. That’s kind of the point.

Volatility: Generally lower than your average high-growth tech stock. Less drama, fewer rug-pull vibes.

Dividends: Medtronic is known as a dividend payer, which means it often sends cash back to shareholders instead of just hoarding it. That’s a big deal if you want something that’s not just vibes but also passive income.

Valuation: It tends to trade in that middle lane – not absurdly cheap, not “this is obviously a bubble” expensive. More like: solid company, priced like the market kind of trusts it.

Is it a no-brainer? Not automatically. But if your strategy is “I want something steady in a chaotic market,” Medtronic starts to look like a quiet win.

3. Risk Level: Where It Can Go Wrong

Healthcare isn’t drama-free.

Regulation risk: Medical devices are heavily supervised. Recalls, safety issues, or new rules can smack the stock.

Competition: Other giants are fighting for the same hospital budgets and patients.

Innovation pressure: If Medtronic doesn’t keep up with newer tech – better sensors, better robots, better AI – it can lose share fast.

So no, this is not a set-and-forget forever. It still needs to keep proving it deserves your money.

Medtronic plc vs. The Competition

If you’re going to buy a medtech stock, you’re basically picking a side in a long-term rivalry.

Main rival: Think of big names like Johnson & Johnson’s medtech arm, Abbott Laboratories, and Boston Scientific. All of them chase similar hospital budgets and want their devices and systems to become the default in operating rooms and clinics.

Clout Check

Brand with regular people: Most patients have no idea who made the device in their body. So social clout here is more about what doctors and hospital buyers think than average consumers.

Investor clout: Medtronic has that “grown-up portfolio” energy. It does not move like a hot speculative biotech, but it shows up in a lot of long-term, serious portfolios.

Winner in the clout war? If you’re talking TikTok flash, none of these medtech giants are really viral. But in the investing world, Medtronic is a top-tier name in its lane. Call it a quiet heavyweight, not the loudest in the room.

Who Actually Wins?

There is no uniform winner, but here is the vibe:

Stability: Medtronic is competitive with any of its big peers.

Innovation: Some rivals have flashier narratives in specific areas, like diabetes tech or surgical robotics, in certain cycles.

Total package: Medtronic is a strong all-rounder – not the wildest story, but very legit.

If you want “look at this crazy moonshot,” you probably go small-cap or pure biotech. If you want a big, diversified medtech anchor, Medtronic is absolutely in the chat.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, should you actually put money into Medtronic plc, or just keep scrolling?

Cop if:

You want exposure to healthcare and medical technology without betting it all on one risky startup.

You like the idea of dividends and more stable, long-term positions instead of pure meme-chasing.

You are building a “core” portfolio and want something in the health-tech lane that isn’t going to disappear overnight.

Drop (or at least wait) if:

You are chasing fast, high-volatility moves and want huge upside in a short time.

You only invest in stuff you can flex on social as a “next big thing” story – Medtronic is more quiet power than viral hype.

You are not comfortable with healthcare regulation and product risk, or you do not want to read earnings and guidance to stay updated.

Is it worth the hype? There is not a ton of hype – and that might actually be the alpha. Medtronic looks more like a grown, steady, long-game stock than a short-term moon mission. If your plan is to build wealth slowly with real companies that do real things for real people, this is one of those names you at least research hard before you pass.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405047_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 12:00:49.199711

First, the world Patel and Trammell envisions sounds like it would be pretty incredible for everyone.
Third, it’s worth noting that we have seen dramatic shifts in labor in human history.
Yes, I get the argument that this is the worst that AI will ever be, but it also will never be human, which is what humans want most of all.
Even if AI does all of the jobs, humans will still want humans, creating an economy for labor precisely because it is labor.","Pity the paradox of the content producer in the age of AI. On one hand, AI is one of the greatest gifts ever in terms of topics to cover. The 2025 Stratechery Year in Review was, just like 2024 and 2023 (plus a few bangers in 2022) completely dominated by AI; my Sharp Tech co-host Andrew Sharp wrote The Definitive Ranking of Tech Company Takeability, and OpenAI was number one with a bullet:

OpenAI may or may not be the most important company of the future. There can be no doubt, however, that we are witnessing one of the most takeable enterprises in the history of the world. From the day it was founded — with a non-profit corporate structure that sought to build AGI and then control it themselves “to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity” — this company has divided the audience and invited either passionate support or aggressive eye-rolls.

On the other hand, LLMs in particular are quite literally content producers! What’s the point of writing analysis when ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude will deliver analysis on demand, about any topic you want? Is this one of those situations like the early web, where the possibility of reaching everyone seemed like a boon but was actually a ticking time bomb for the viability of the traditional publishing model?

I’m actually pretty optimistic about Stratechery Plus’ fortunes for reasons I laid out in last year’s Content and Community:

So, are existing publishers doomed? Well, by-and-large yes, but that’s because they have been doomed for a long time. People using AI instead of Google — or Google using AI to provide answers above links — make the long-term outlook for advertising-based publishers worse, but that’s an acceleration of a demise that has been in motion for a long time.

What I think is intriguing, however, is the possibility to go back to the future. Once upon a time publishing made countries; the new opportunity for publishing is to make communities. This is something that AI, particularly as it manifests today, is fundamentally unsuited to: all of that content generated by LLMs is individualized; what you ask, and what the AI answers, is distinct from what I ask, and what answers I receive. This is great for getting things done, but it’s useless for creating common ground…

Stratechery, on the other hand, along with a host of other successful publications, has the potential to be a totem pole around which communities can form…There is a need for community, and I think content, whether it be an essay, a podcast, or a video, can be artifacts around which communities can form and sustain themselves, ultimately to the economic benefit of the content creator. There is, admittedly, a lot to figure out in terms of that last piece, but when you remember that content made countries, the potential upside is likely quite large indeed.

This might, to be fair, be wishful thinking: maybe I’m doomed, but if I’m doomed, probably everyone else is too, particularly when you think about the very long run.

Capital in the 22nd Century

It’s the very long run that a fellow content producer, Dwarkesh Patel, considered alongside Philip Trammell in a widely discussed post over the winter break entitled Capital in the 22nd Century:

In his 2013 Capital in the Twenty-first Century, the socialist economist Thomas Piketty argued that, absent strong redistribution, economic inequality tends to increase indefinitely through the generations — at least until shocks, like large wars or prodigal sons, reset the clock. This is because the rich tend to save more than the poor and because they can get higher returns on their investments.

As many noted at the time, this is probably an incorrect account of the past. Labor and capital complement each other. Wealthy people can keep accumulating capital, but hammers grow less valuable when there aren’t enough hands to use all of them, and hands grow more valuable when hammers are plentiful. Capital accumulation thus lowers interest rates (aka income per unit of capital) and raises wages (income per unit of labor). This effect has tended to be strong enough that, though inequality may have grown for other reasons, inequality from capital accumulation alone has been self-correcting.

But in a world of advanced robotics and AI, this correction mechanism will break. That is, though Piketty was wrong about the past, he will probably be right about the future…If AI is used to lock in a more stable world, or at least one in which ancestors can more fully control the wealth they leave to their descendants (let alone one in which they never die), the clock-resetting shocks could disappear. Assuming the rich do not become unprecedentedly philanthropic, a global and highly progressive tax on capital (or at least capital income) will then indeed be essentially the only way to prevent inequality from growing extreme. Without one, once AI renders capital a true substitute for labor, approximately everything will eventually belong to those who are wealthiest when the transition occurs, or their heirs. Or more precisely, it will belong to the subset of this group who save most and most invest with a view to maximizing long-run returns.

There is an aspect to this argument that is of the dorm room discussion variety: even if we are approaching the point where AI can create AI (Claude Opus 4.5 appears to be a major leap forward in coding capability in particular), there is still a lot of work to do in terms of making it possible for AI to break out of its digital box and impact the real world via robotics. Part of the thinking, however, is that once AI can create AI, it can rapidly accelerate the development of robotics as well, until robots are making robots, each generation more capable than the next, until everything humans do today — both in the digital but also the physical world — can be done better by AI.

This is the world where capital drives all value, and labor none, in stark contrast to the approximately 33% share of GDP that has traditionally gone to capital, with 66% share of GDP going to labor. After all, you don’t pay robots for marginal labor: you build them once…check that, they build themselves, from materials they harvested, not just here on earth but across the galaxy, and do everything at zero marginal cost, a rate with which no human can compete.

Reasons for Skepticism

I get the logic of Patel and Trammell’s argument, but I — perhaps, once again, over-optimistically — am skeptical about this being a problem, particularly one that needs to be addressed right here right now before the AI takeoff occurs, especially given the acute need for more capital investment at this moment in time.

First, the world Patel and Trammell envisions sounds like it would be pretty incredible for everyone. If AI can do everything, then it follows that everyone can have everything, from food and clothing to every service you can imagine (remember, the AI is so good that there are zero jobs for humans, which implies that all of the jobs can be done by robots for everyone). Does it matter if you don’t personally own the robots if every material desire is already met?

Second, on the flipside, this world also sounds implausible. It seems odd that AI would acquire such fantastic capabilities and yet still be controlled by humans and governed by property laws as commonly understood in 2025. I find the AI doomsday scenario — where this uber-capable AI is no longer controllable by humans — to be more realistic; on the flipside, if we start moving down this path of abundance, I would expect our collective understanding of property rights to shift considerably.

Third, it’s worth noting that we have seen dramatic shifts in labor in human history. Consider both agricultural revolutions: in the pre-Neolithic era zero percent of humans worked in agriculture; fast-forward to 1810, and 81% of the U.S. population worked in agriculture. Then came the second agriculture revolution, such that 200 years later only 1% of the U.S. population works in agriculture. It’s that decline that is particularly interesting to me: humans were replaced by machines, even as food became abundant and dramatically cheaper; no one is measuring their purchases based on how much food cost in 1700, just as they won’t measure their future purchases on the cost of material goods in a pre-robotics world.

That’s because humans didn’t just sit on their hands; rather, entirely new kinds of work were created, which were valued dramatically higher. Much of this was in factories, and then, over the last century, there was the rise of office work. All of that could very well be replaced by AI, but the point is that the history of humans is the continual creation of new jobs to be done — jobs that couldn’t have been conceived of before they were obvious, and which pay dramatically more than whatever baseline existed before technological change.

Like, if I might be cheeky, professional podcaster! Podcasts didn’t even exist thirty years ago, and yet here is Patel — and me! — accumulating capital simply by speaking into a mic and taking advantage of the Internet’s zero marginal cost of distribution, a concept that itself was unthinkable fifty years ago.

Humans Want Humans

It’s possible, of course — and to return to my perhaps self-interested and potentially misplaced optimism above — that robots will be better at podcasting than Patel or I. I’m skeptical, though: my experience — and I’ll only speak for myself here — is that the human element is essential in creating compelling content. Sure, sometimes I say “uhm” or “like” or “sort of”, or I get facts wrong, but that’s a feature, not a bug: what I have to say is by definition unique to me, and that is interesting precisely because I am flesh-and-blood, not a robot.1

Indeed, another way to frame the optimism I have around my career is that the dynamics are the exact inverse of AI:

Right now it is individual humans who are uniquely capable to reach audiences at scale; AI, on the other hand, is about scaling compute to deliver results to individuals. Patel and Trammell were, to be sure, talking about the 22nd century, while this is a depiction of the first quarter of the 21st, but I think the desire for a communal experience will persist, and I think those experiences will continue to be organized around other humans, not machines.

More generally, I don’t think that this will be limited to podcasting (if such a concept even exists in one hundred years). Consider the most base example: sex. I have no doubt that there will be human-like robots with which you can have sex; I also have even stronger conviction that the overwhelming preference of humans will be to have sex with other humans. And that, by extension, means that all of the courtship and status games that go into finding a lover will persist, and that that itself will be an entire economy all its own. One will not impress a partner with commodity robot-generated goods, no matter how objectively perfect they might be: true value will come from uniqueness and imperfections that are downstream from a human.

In fact, I have great optimism that one potential upside of AI is a renewed appreciation of and investment in beauty. One of the great tragedies of the industrial era — particularly today — is that beauty in our built environment is nowhere to be found. How is it that we built intricate cathedrals hundreds of years ago, and forgettable cookie-cutter crap today? That is, in fact, another labor story: before the industrial revolution labor was abundant and cheap, which meant it was defensible to devote thousands of person-years into intricate buildings; once labor was made more productive, and thus more valuable, it simply wasn’t financially viable to divert so much talent for so much time. Perhaps it follows, then, that the devaluing of labor Patel and Trammell warns about actually frees humans up to once again create beauty? Yes, robots could do it too, but I think humans will value the work of other humans more. Indeed, I think this is coming sooner than you might think: I expect the widespread availability of high quality AI art to actually make human art more desirable and valuable, precisely because of its provenance.2

It’s also worth noting the relative popularity of human-generated content versus AI-generated content. Sora is down to 59 in the App Store, and I count double-digit human-denominated social apps that rank above it. Yes, I get the argument that this is the worst that AI will ever be, but it also will never be human, which is what humans want most of all.

The Problem With Inequality

This gets at what I found the most frustrating about Patel and Trammell’s point of view: the core assumption undergirding their argument was also about the human condition; it just happened to be negative.

Louis C.K., in an October 2008 appearance on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, delivered one of the most incisive and eternal observations about human nature: “Everything is amazing right now and nobody’s happy.”

You’ve almost certainly seen this clip, but if not, it’s worth watching in full; Louis C.K. focuses on three incredible technological innovations and how quickly we took them for granted: smartphones, Internet access on planes, and the act of flying itself. It’s certainly a sentiment I can relate to: just in the last 72 hours I have chafed at slow airplane WiFi, complained about jet lag from having literally traversed the globe, and gotten frustrated at an iPhone bug that is sapping my battery. It’s all so terrible, until I remember I have access to anything everywhere, can be anywhere anytime, and oh yeah, can achieve both simultaneously.

If anything, you can make the case that technological innovations, by virtue of conferring their benefits on everybody, has actually had the perverse effect of making everyone feel worse off. When I was a child growing up in small town Wisconsin, I had some sort of vague sense that there were rich people in the world, but from my perspective taking my first airplane flight around the age of ten was a source of great wonder, and even provided a sense of status; after all, many of my friends had never flown at all. That was the comparison set that mattered to me.

Social media — or, more accurately, user-generated content feeds, which are increasingly not social at all — has completely changed this dynamic. All I or anyone else needs to do is open Instagram to see beautiful people on private jets or on beaches or at fancy restaurants, living a life that seems dramatically better than one’s dull existence in the suburbs or a cramped apartment; never mind that the means of achieving that insight is a level of technological wealth that would have been incomprehensible to the richest person in the world fifty years ago.

To put it another way, what Louis C.K. identified in this clip was the extent to which human happiness is a relative versus absolute phenomenon: what we care about is not how much we have, but how we compare. That, by extension, is what drives the technological paradox I noted above: more capabilities, more broadly distributed, has tremendously enriched the world on an absolute basis; the end result, however, has been the dramatic expansion of our comparison set, making us feel more immiserated than ever.3

This, writ large, is what Patel and Trammell seem to be worried about: sure, everyone may have all of their material needs met, but that won’t be good enough if the price of that abundance is the knowledge that someone else has more. This might not be rational, but it certainly is human!

If you assume that the negative parts of humanity will persist in this world of abundance, however, then you must leave room for the positive parts as well, the ones that I wrote about above. Even if AI does all of the jobs, humans will still want humans, creating an economy for labor precisely because it is labor. You can’t make the case that the potential for jealousy ought to drive authoritarian capital controls while completely dismissing the possibility that the prospect of desirability gives everyone jobs to do, even if we can’t possibly imagine what those jobs might be — beyond podcasting, of course.",https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ai-human-condition-1.png,N,,2026-01-05 07:59:51.938246

At about the time of the invention of television, insulin, a peptide therapeutic, was discovered and began revolutionizing diabetes treatment. Near the time of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the internet’s precursor, the invention of solid phase peptide synthesis (SPSS) won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Twenty years later, the worldwide web (www) was a reality, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Humalin, the first large-scale synthetic peptide therapeutic. This was a great advance, and it quickly replaced its predecessor, porcine insulin, and became the standard diabetes treatment worldwide.

Around the same time, a researcher isolated an interesting peptide from the Gila Monster lizard. This peptide was the first in a long line of metabolic peptides that are frequently referred to as GLP-1. Glucagon-like peptide-1s are a class unto themselves the peptide being linked to a sugar, which is cleaved, releasing the peptide to do its work on a targeted site.

This sophisticated approach to medicine is the finest example of the success we can expect to come from a biopharmaceutical directive.

What This Means for the Future

As with many meaningful things in life, we start with a single contributor making a small step and watch a community grow this into its most awesome potential. In this case, we are witnessing a remarkable expansion in peptide manufacturing capacity. From 2020 to 2024, production increased by approximately fifty percent, and projections indicate a further two hundred percent growth between 2024 and 2029. Markets and inventors do not see things slowing down from there, and continue to place their trust in the idea that over the next decade, we are likely to see these rates of expansion continue (1).

My focus here is on production capacity because it is the cornerstone controlling cost and supply and is the most telling of harbingers to guarantee the healthy pipeline of biopharmaceutical medicines beyond those currently or on their way to market. From a Gila Monster to the most valuable therapeutic platform on earth, one straight line of relentless progress. The first inflection point of meaningful progress has been passed, and with this new capacity, the change to medicines is underway.

Since 2019, global peptide active pharmaceutical ingredient capacity has approximately doubled, and it is projected to double again by 2030 (2). Much of this incremental growth is driven by GLP-1–class molecules, with the largest increases occurring in Asia. Both established capacity leaders and emerging players are positioning themselves for continued expansion well into the next decade. Peptide leaders in integrated pharma like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Pfizer, Amgen, Sanofi, Takeda, Viking, Teva, and many more are updating their peptide discovery, synthetic routes, and engineering their way through the current dialectic of downstream challenges. Partners in this pursuit often represent the front line of the downstream work. They are the contract organizations, such as:

•Corden: With nearly 1 billion dollars in investments planned in the next three years, adding 30,000 L of SPPS capacity to its already impressive scale of manufacture (3).• Bachem: Committed to investing hundreds of millions of dollars to increase every site in its global network over the next few years (4).

• PolyPeptide: Investing over a hundred million dollars in the past three years, with further investments in the works to create larger SPPS reactors, LPPS/hybrid processes [QA4: LPPS], and automated purification rigs (5).

• WuXi tides: Planned completion of its mega site in 2025 brings the company’s total reactor volume to 32,000 L—a tripling of capacity from 15 to 45 tons per year (6).

•Ambiopharm: Committed 30 million dollars to bring their total capacity to over 8 tons per year (7).

• CPC: With eight GMP production sites already, it has set its sights on a new manufacturing facility (8).

From the shift from traditional SPPS to hybrid solid–liquid manufacturing and other efficiency-driven innovations, to the use of lymphatic tails that enhance stability and extend half-life, the peptide field is evolving rapidly. Advances in cyclization, stapling, and other techniques are enabling the development of orally available peptides that can survive the stomach barrier Peptides are becoming easier to make, safer, and effective at treating an ever-growing range of human maladies. We are now looking at a future of oral, low-cost, safe, and effective medicines such as the world has never experienced.

As we observe the metabolism of our nation changing with the increasing prevalence and ease with which metabolic therapeutics are available and taken, the size of this present peptide wave may make it difficult to see what will follow. After this brief review of marshalled resources, I believe it is evident that the world is committed to this course.

The advantages and target-rich opportunities this “newly” exploited class of medicine affords us will not end here. It is only the first of the many peptide-based medicines on their way to your neighborhood drug store.

They deployed customer service bots to handle simple queries, software to automate expense reports, and predictive analytics to improve inventory planning. These efforts delivered incremental gains but did little to fundamentally change how the business operated.

The organizations pulling ahead now are doing something fundamentally different. Instead of retrofitting AI into existing workflows, they’re redesigning operations from scratch around AI capabilities.

From Tasks to Operating Models

IBM has automated 94% of its HR tasks using AI. The great fear with AI has always been that it will take people’s jobs. But rather than shrinking its workforce, IBM redeployed people from transactional work into software development, sales, and customer-facing roles where human judgment matters.

This pattern is showing up across industries. PwC analyzed nearly a billion job ads from six continents and found that industries most exposed to AI are seeing productivity growth nearly quadruple, rising from 7% to 27% since 2022. Revenue per employee in these industries is growing three times faster than in sectors with less AI adoption.

As Ivo Bozukov explains, “The mistake many companies made early on was treating AI as a layer on top of existing processes. The real gains come when you redesign workflows around what AI can do best, and then reposition people where judgment and context actually matter. That shift changes productivity and strategy at the same time.”

What Skills Actually Matter

The shift to AI has changed which capabilities command value in the market. Workers now spend less time creating content from scratch and more time reviewing and refining AI-generated outputs.

Technical sectors like energy increasingly need workers who can combine AI analysis with operational realities. The valuable skill is knowing what questions to ask and how to interpret results against regulatory constraints and strategic priorities.

The numbers back this up. Workers with AI skills now command a 56% wage premium compared to similar roles without those skills, up from 25% just a year earlier. Skills requirements in AI-exposed jobs are changing 66% faster than in other occupations.

But job growth remains robust even in roles considered highly automatable. Between 2019 and 2024, occupations with high AI exposure still saw 38% job growth. While no doubt some jobs are being lost, the reality is more complex than wholesale displacement.

AI Agents Change the Equation

The next phase involves AI agents – systems that can handle multi-step workflows with minimal supervision. PwC deployed hundreds of these agents across its operations and saw productivity gains up to 50% in functions like IT, finance, and tax.

Ivaylo Bozoukov, having experience in sectors where operations increasingly rely on integrated AI systems, has seen how this technology has shifted strategic planning. Decisions that previously required weeks of data gathering and analysis now happen in days, freeing leadership time for higher-level questions about market positioning and long-term investments.

According to PwC research, 88% of executives plan to increase AI-related budgets specifically because of agentic AI’s potential. The technology has moved from experimental to central to corporate strategy.

What Separates Winners from Laggards

IBM’s transformation generated $3.5 billion in productivity gains over two years. For AI observers like Ivaylo Bozoukov, the difference between marginal improvement and that kind of return comes down to ambition. Companies that use AI to rethink operations see transformational results. Companies that bolt AI onto existing processes see incremental gains at best.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3-720x405.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 05:58:27.952573

But even amid speculation that the industry could be in a bubble—and some signs of public fatigue with the technology that’s snuck into everything from therapy sessions to children’s toys—investors and industry observers say the AI push will continue in 2026.

TAM explosion

In some ways, AI mimics the investment wave around other recent transformative technologies, like the rise of the PC, internet, and mobile phone. “New technologies come, and they’re transformative, and that drives a lot of investment,” says Steven Neil Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago who studies venture capital. “Some of them work out, some of them don’t, and hopefully the world becomes more productive.”

But Michael Carmen, co-head of private investments at Wellington Management and the coauthor of a venture capital outlook report the firm released in December, says AI companies have recently been growing revenue at a historically fast rate—quicker than previous generations of software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. Widespread internet use has given new AI products essentially instant access to a huge potential market, Carmen adds, noting, “When you think about the [total addressable market] of AI over the longer term, it could be the largest TAM of anything that we’ve ever seen in technology.”

AI is increasingly competing with traditional SaaS businesses for both customers and investors, says Saagar Bhavsar, partner at Begin Capital. For one thing, artificial intelligence has businesses wondering if it’s more viable to build software tools in-house with the aid of new coding assistants and other AI agents.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-91465347-VC-will-crave-AI-more-in-2026.jpg",N,,2026-01-05 05:59:15.833994

Stic is now valued at $200 million, according to the company.

Stic pays drivers to advertise companies on their cars, allowing them to earn passive income on the road while giving brands another option to buy out-of-home advertising, which is largely dominated by stagnant billboards. Stic uses smart stickers that adhere to the side of the car and track miles in order to pay users for every mile they drive. On the backend, advertisers can track and manage geolocation data and targeted demographic data to strengthen advertising campaigns.

Stic was founded in 2023 by then-college student Adam Cohen. After talking to an Uber driver who also juggled work from Lyft Inc., Doordash and Maplebear Inc., or otherwise known as Instacart, Cohen realized her car – which clocked in around 3,000 miles a month delivering people and groceries – was prime advertising real estate for brands. All drivers had to do was download yet another app, and they could earn passive income as a driving billboard.

“Stic is going on in the background. You don’t even have to touch it,” Cohen said. “You’re already driving the miles.”

The gig economy renaissance

As the U.S experiences a resurgence of gig economy roles – thanks in part to rising interest rates, climbing grocery costs, job uncertainty plagued by artificial intelligence and the worst year for job growth since the Great Recession – companies like Stic have emerged as an opportunity to make extra cash. Unlike driving or delivery platforms, which compete for worker attention, Stic bills itself as a passive, low-effort option.

“The only reason why Stic will ever make money is because our mission is to genuinely help people and pay them for the miles they already drive and give them this new type of passive income that they don’t know that they need,” Cohen said.

When the gig economy emerged in the wake of the Great Recession, it was billed as a way for people to supplement their existing income by getting paid to chauffeur riders to the airport, pick up strangers’ laundry or host travelers during their spare time. Given the opportunity to commodify their existing assets – be it a spare room in their house, or in Stic’s case, the side of a car door – gig economy companies grew into a $557 billion industry. Today, around 40% of gig workers rely on the sector as their main source of income.

While the gig economy is, to some, inextricably tied to the economic and technological milestones of the 2010s, gig work startups have experienced a funding renaissance in the 2020s. Companies in the space received around $250 million in venture funding in 2025, per PitchBook, more than double what the sector made in 2019.",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PG09_Tech_Lead_Stic_0105_pc_Stic.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:59:40.279991

The upgrade reflects Jefferies’ view that IBM has a ""clearer path to software acceleration heading into 2026,"" driven by momentum in its Red Hat business and synergy capture from recent strategic acquisitions.

Jefferies highlighted acquisitions, including HCP and the pending Confluent deal, as key factors strengthening the company’s hybrid cloud and data platform capabilities, which create cross-sell opportunities and expand its open-source monetization potential.

The research firm also pointed to IBM’s mainframe business outperformance as providing ""another layer of stability and recurring revenue,"" supporting confidence in the company’s near-term execution.

NE ASIA PMI NUMBERS RISE IN DEC

China’s factory activity returned to growth in December, with an official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) reading of 50.1 compared with 49.2 in the previous month, returning to growth after new orders rose for the first time since June.

A PMI reading above 50.0 indicates an expansion in manufacturing activity, while a reading below signals a contraction.

Based on a private survey of manufacturers conducted by RatingDog, China’s PMI reading also rose to 50.1, with the launch of some new products and higher sales following a contraction in November.

The higher reading in December from November’s 49.9 in November reflected an increase in new export orders, although purchase volumes remained flat at the 50.0 mark, RatingDog founder Yao Yu said.

China, which is Asia’s biggest economy and the world’s second biggest, remains a net importer of most petrochemicals despite heavy capacity additions in recent years.

The country’s official PMI is tilted toward larger state-owned enterprises, while RatingDog’s PMI is based on a survey of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and export-oriented enterprises located in the eastern coastal regions.

China’s GDP growth is expected to ease below 5% in 2026 to 4.5% amid a struggling real estate sector and a soft labor market, according to Deloitte Global Economics Research Center.

For Japan and South Korea, factory activity also returned to expansionary mode in December, snapping months of contraction.

Japan’s December PMI increased to 50.0 from 48.7 in November amid a weaker reduction in sales.

Despite optimism for 2026, however, concerns over “relatively sluggish global conditions, an ageing population and rising costs” remain, S&P Global’s economics associate director Annabel Fiddes said.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s manufacturing PMI rose to 50.1 in December from 49.4 in November, indicating “renewed, albeit fractional, improvement”, according to S&P Global economist Usamah Bhatti on 2 January.

“According to manufacturers, new product launches and improved external demand drove the improvement in sales, while confidence in the outlook also improved markedly in December to reach its highest level since May 2022,” Bhatti said.

However, input cost inflation rose significantly in December, forcing firms to increase base producer prices to protect profit margins.

SE ASIA FACTORY ACTIVTY MODERATES

Manufacturing PMI in seven ASEAN countries remained in expansionary territory at 52.7 in December, but down from 53.0 in November amid moderate upticks in output and new orders, S&P Global said.

Growth remained robust and firms pushed ahead with purchasing and hiring activity last month, S&P Global economist Maryam Baluch said.

Based on private surveys by S&P Global, manufacturers across Asia were optimistic about 2026 in spite of US tariffs that took effect in August 2025.

Singapore’s PMI edged up by 0.1 point to 50.3 in December, marking the fifth straight month of expansion, according to the Singapore Institute of Purchasing Materials Management (SIPMM) PMI on 2 January.

Demand from the electronics and semiconductor segments remained robust, although manufacturers are facing capacity constraints, as well as disruptions from Red Sea diversions.

The diversions have led to longer transit times, higher logistics costs, and delays in supplier deliveries, said Stephen Poh, executive director of the SIPMM.

For Vietnam, although December PMI eased to 53.0 from 53.8 in the previous month, growth remained solid with manufacturers “optimistic” for 2026.

Expansion was also noted in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, with Thailand posting a higher December PMI reading of 57.4 from 56.8 in November, supporting near-term demand growth.

FISCAL STIMULUS TO AID ‘26 GROWTH

Economic stimulus measures are being prepared by various Asian economies amid concerns over weakening demand globally.

Japan has unveiled a yen (Y) 21.3 trillion ($135 billion) package in November 2025 to boost sectors such as AI and semiconductors.

Indonesia, meanwhile, has rolled out temporary tax breaks for labor-intensive sectors such as footwear, textiles and apparel, furniture, leather and leather goods and tourism.

The downgrade comes as Barclays expects Truist to achieve its 2027 Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) objective of 15%, which falls short of the 16% or higher targeted by most peers in the banking sector. Currently, Truist’s Return on Common Equity stands at 8% for the last twelve months.

Barclays cited concerns about Truist’s revenue growth, which is expected to improve from 2% in 2025 to over 4% in 2026 but may continue to lag competitors, while operating leverage trails peers as the bank funds recent catch-up investments including plans to build 100 new branches and renovate more than 300 others.

The investment bank also highlighted increasing competition in Truist’s Southeast footprint from both existing and newer entrants such as , , , , , and , which are building new branches and actively hiring lenders.

Barclays noted that Truist’s commercial and industrial non-performing assets stood at their post-pandemic high in the third quarter of 2025, though it expects more active share repurchases of $4 billion in 2026 compared to $2.5 billion in 2025 to provide some support for the stock.

OpenAI is ramping up its audio capabilities as it expects users will primarily interact with upcoming ChatGPT devices through sound.

The Big Picture: Big Tech companies like Meta and Google are working on AI devices that could replace smartphones, and they all seem to have landed on the same idea: that conversing out loud with chatbots is the innovation that will divorce people from their screens. But that shift would require a major cultural change in how people use technology — especially in public spaces.

Behind The Device: OpenAI wants you to talk out loud… just not to yourself.

OpenAI doesn’t believe the LLM powering ChatGPT’s audio experience is as strong as its text-based one, so it’s restructuring teams to make audio the priority.

The goal, according to The Information, is to make responses more accurate and speed up how quickly the chatbot answers questions… all while feeling like a natural conversation partner.

So far, the company has developed a new model that sounds more natural and “emotive” (read: human) and can provide deeper, more accurate answers.

The next step is advancing it so it can better handle interruptions and speak at the same time as a human user — just as we do when talking to another person.

Closing Thoughts: OpenAI plans to release the new audio model sometime early this year… ideally giving people enough time to adjust to talking to ChatGPT before a device rollout in 2027. Right now, most people interact with the chatbot through text-based prompts — but OpenAI didn’t spend $6.5 billion to acquire iPhone designer Jony Ive’s io just so users could keep tapping a touchscreen. Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman want to replace the iPhone.

It may be OpenAI’s most ambitious bet yet.

The Future: OpenAI’s biggest hurdle in getting people to adopt its ChatGPT devices may be convincing them that talking to a chatbot out loud isn’t a faux pas.

From Invisible To Irresistible: How UGC Helped This Brand Pop Off The Shelf

What if the biggest unlock for your CPG brand isn’t a packaging refresh or a promo blitz — but creators telling the story your audience actually wants to hear? That’s exactly what happened when this everyday grocery staple shifted from traditional ads to a creator-led, UGC-powered strategy built for scale.

Instead of pushing polished product shots, the brand activated creators across food, lifestyle, and everyday routines — pairing premium gifting with seasonal moments and culturally relevant hooks. The result wasn’t just content; it was momentum. Snack boards, game-day recipes, self-care rituals, and kitchen-counter creativity started taking over feeds, delivering 560K+ views, 247K reach, 9K likes, 2K saves, and $58K EMV — all from authentic storytelling that felt like discovery, not advertising.

More importantly, it became repeatable. Mid-tier creators expanded visibility. Micro-influencers added warmth and trust. And with Creator.co managing recruitment, briefs, and delivery, the brand built a scalable content engine — everything from 71K-view recipe videos to 600+ saved snack hacks. As one marketing leader put it, “The team is accessible, easy to work with, and provides frequent updates — all our data was right at our fingertips.”

When UGC becomes the heart of your strategy, your product stops blending in and starts belonging in the lives (and carts) of your consumers.",https://beehiiv-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/16ad69aa-50a5-4ced-a73d-4d8ece9c0089/oepnai_jan_5.JPG?t=1767577892,N,,2026-01-05 05:14:31.957103

All preconceived ideas about this were wrong after the earthquake occurred in the bank of JPMorgan Chase (a $4 trillion financial institution) with their creation of MONY, a tokenized money market fund which exists on the Ethereum Blockchain, which has rocked the Financial Services industry. They have created a programmable version of this product, making it one of the most significant advancements in technology for traditional banks. As a result of this creation banks now have new thoughts regarding money than they had ever before.

Enter MONY: Cash on the Chain

MONY (My OnChain Net Yield) is a new form of fund that is a departure from traditional institutional funding models. Unlike previous institutional funding models, MONY utilizes a public blockchain (Ethereum), leveraging the bank’s proprietary Kinexys Digital Assets platform.

Investors who meet qualifications for MONY will be able to hold digital tokens representing a fractional ownership position in a collection of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of less than 12 months. The difference between MONY and previous funding models is that due to the programmability of these tokens, they will include on-chain record of the daily dividend payments, and allow for both subscription and redemption using fiat currency and stablecoins. This innovation will allow for near real-time settlement of applications for subscriptions or redemptions, and addresses the longstanding issues associated with T+1 and T+2 timeframes commonly associated with traditional money market funding models.

The Strategic Shift

Money market funds are the unglamorous plumbing of the global financial system, holding over $7 trillion in assets to preserve capital and manage liquidity. For years, this scale made them too important to risk on “experimental” technology.

Nonetheless, with the enactment of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) in July 2025, there was a significant shift in the perceived risk associated with the use of blockchain technology. This legislation gave banks a clear path to starting using stablecoins and tokenized assets in a compliant manner. Banks now have the necessary guidance and framework to begin issuing new products through the blockchain, thus moving JPMorgan out of the sidelines and onto the field.

Two Visions for the Future

JPMorgan’s bold stance is a signal that the gap in ideology on Wall Street continues to grow. On the one hand, as a “cloud-native” business, JPMorgan has chosen to issue tokens directly onto a public blockchain. Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon, on the other hand, have taken a somewhat more reflective and cautious approach.

Earlier this year, the Goldman-BNY alliance launched a joint initiative to tokenize records of existing funds rather than creating blockchain-native funds. In their model, the assets stay in traditional systems while tokens act as digital mirrors.

“There is a divide in these approaches,” notes one fintech analyst. “Some see blockchain as a new financial operating layer—the JPMorgan view—while others see it merely as a faster database that leaves existing control structures intact. Both are progress, but they are building toward very different futures.”

The Gatekeeping Debate

MONY is not an open multi-party DeFi Protocol but rather a highly-controlled access protocol intended for select Qualified Institutional Investors with significant minimum commitments; as a result, some people see MONY as hindering the idea of financial decentralization instead of enabling it.

Some see proof of this with the model that MONY is using because it only allows those who are able to invest large amounts and that those who do are all large banks or corporations, thus there is a danger that MONY is simply replicating the same issues that exist in traditional banking; the supporters of MONY argue that for this model to work at scale, large financial pools will require a specific level of institutional trust. An institution will require a high level of regulatory compliance, custody, and risk management around its investments and therefore will not be able to use a completely open and trustless DeFi protocol.

A Signal to the Boardroom

Rather than being primarily a product launch, the launch of MONY provides both an opportunity for corporate boards and treasury managers to realize that digitizing cash is now inevitable vs possibly. Furthermore, tokenising cash will offer firms opportunities for transferring value with the same ease as transferring information. This will lead to reduced risk in settlement processes and allow firms to release capital previously tied up in bank accounts. Due to the increasing number of firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, looking at this type of structure, as well as the growing number of firms using on-chain treasury solutions, competitive pressures will increase dramatically in 2026. As the market continues to grow, the speed at which it will impact traditional plumbing systems in daily financing will continue to accelerate.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jpmorgan-mony-fund-e1767556256414.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 09:00:34.659063

The French beauty conglomerate has unveiled two light-powered innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, including a Light Straight + Multi-styler flat iron, which uses near-infrared light technology to straighten and style hair at reduced temperatures, and LED eye masks meant to combat visible signs of under-eye aging.

Both products will launch in 2027 under respective, yet-to-be-confirmed brands within L’Oréal’s portfolio, which includes Lancôme, Vichy, SkinCeuticals and more in skin, and L’Oréal Professionnel, Redken and Color Wow, among others, in hair.

The Light Straight builds on the patented powering L’Oréal Professionnel’s AirLight Pro hair dryer, which L’Oréal unveiled at CES 2024 and has since rolled out to salons in the U.S., Europe and Asia, as well as on Amazon and Ulta Beauty, where the tool sells for $475.

“We’re using the same type of technology to straighten the hair three times faster [than a traditional flat iron], make it two times smoother and use up to 100 degrees less heat,” said Guive Balooch, global vice president, augmented beauty and open innovation at L’Oréal.

The Light Straight features glass plates which never exceed 320 degrees Fahrenheit and work in tandem with the near-infrared technology to style the hair while reducing the risk of heat damage. It can also be maneuvered to create waves and curls.

While the AirLight Pro was developed in partnership with hardware start-up Zuvi, the Light Straight was developed in-house, added the executive.

The LED Eye Masks, developed in partnership with iSmart Developments, deliver red light and near-infrared light treatment in timed, 10-minute sessions. There are 16 LED chips per silicone-based eye mask, totaling 32 LED chips in both.

“Because the material is so thin and so flexible, we can make masks that are targeted to different parts of the face — like the chin, the neck,” said Balooch, adding that L’Oréal is also developing a full-face version of the mask, which features 208 LED chips and “sits on the skin like a sheet mask would.”

LED masks and facial devices have become increasingly popular in recent years, with prominent players including Therabody — which recently signed Kendall Jenner as an ambassador for its $379 TheraFace Mask Glo; Shark Beauty, and Solawave, known for its $169 red light therapy wand.

L’Oréal’s eye masks, which are still prototypes, will mark the company’s first foray into the category. In terms of pricing, the masks “will be within the middle-range of premium products,” said Balooch.",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LOreal-launches.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2026-01-05 05:58:57.854960

The focus is on two things: the official start of construction of the new NVIDIA headquarters in Taiwan and the legendary “trillion-dollar dinner” with the island’s most important suppliers.
With the “Constellation” project, NVIDIA will establish its first global headquarters outside the USA.
Huang himself had already made it clear at Computex that NVIDIA does not regard Taiwan as an extended workbench, but as a strategic center.
NVIDIA knows this, and Jensen Huang knows that trust in Asia is not built by contract, but by presence.","When Jensen Huang travels to Taiwan, it is no longer a courtesy visit. It is a signal. According to reports in the Taiwanese media, the NVIDIA CEO is planning several symbolically and strategically charged appointments this month, which can hardly be read as anything other than a geopolitical and industrial positioning. The focus is on two things: the official start of construction of the new NVIDIA headquarters in Taiwan and the legendary “trillion-dollar dinner” with the island’s most important suppliers.

Let’s start with the sober part. With the “Constellation” project, NVIDIA will establish its first global headquarters outside the USA. The location is the Beitou-Shilin Science Park in Taipei, an area of just under 3.9 hectares that will house several thousand employees in the future. This is not a satellite office, but an institutional anchor. Huang himself had already made it clear at Computex that NVIDIA does not regard Taiwan as an extended workbench, but as a strategic center. In retrospect, the fact that the project stalled for a while due to insurance issues seems more like a technical stumbling block than a political doubt. With Huang’s signature, the launch is now set to go ahead.

However, the real explosive issue is not in the concrete, but at the dinner table. The “trillion-dollar dinner” is more than folklore. When representatives from TSMC, Foxconn, Quanta, Wistron and other partners gather, it’s not about thank-you speeches. It’s about clocking, capacities and trust. NVIDIA has long been operating at the limits of what traditional supply chains can achieve. Every day of delay in CoWoS, packaging or server integration costs millions, and in the age of AI, billions. The timing is no coincidence. Taiwan’s suppliers are currently working on the ramp-up of Blackwell Ultra and are already preparing the next generation, known internally as Rubin. This parallelization is extremely demanding. Anyone who underestimates a bottleneck here risks not only delays in delivery, but also market share. NVIDIA knows this, and Jensen Huang knows that trust in Asia is not built by contract, but by presence.

Taiwan has long been more than just a production location for NVIDIA. It is a neuralgic hub of the global AI infrastructure. Huang himself has repeatedly described the island as one of the most important locations for the company. That may sound diplomatic, but it is factually correct. No modern NVIDIA GPUs without TSMC, no scalable AI systems without the ODMs, no speed without local proximity.

You can dismiss this dinner as a ritual. But you can also read it for what it is, a silent demonstration of power. While other tech companies talk about reshoring and diversification, NVIDIA is tying its partners closer than ever. Not a PR event, but a dependency lived out at eye level. In a world where AI is becoming infrastructure, evenings like this are perhaps more important than any keynote at CES.",https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Jensen.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:27:13.446576

One year after Walmart acquired TV manufacturer Vizio, the strategic impact on Walmart Connect is becoming unmistakable.
The U.S. retail media market grew by around twenty percent in 2025, but Walmart Connect expanded significantly faster.
While CTV is currently driving the most momentum, Walmart continues to invest heavily in the long-anticipated frontier of in-store retail media.
Brand lift and sales lift across in-store digital signage will become key metrics in what may emerge as the next major wave of U.S. retail media innovation.","Amazon and Walmart may be known globally as retail powerhouses, but their real profit engines lie elsewhere. For Amazon, it is AWS. For Amazon and Walmart, it is the fast‑growing world of retail media and data‑driven advertising. One year after Walmart acquired TV manufacturer Vizio, the strategic impact on Walmart Connect is becoming unmistakable. Walmart is rapidly transforming from a traditional retailer into a vertically integrated media company with reach across its 4600 stores, online platforms and, increasingly, the living room screen.

NRF The Big Show 2026 – North America’s leading retail tech event takes place 11-13 January in New York City. Florian Rotberg will be on site to bring invidis and sixteen-nine readers the latest news from the showfloor and the conferences.

The acquisition of Vizio in December 2024 for USD 2.2 billion (invidis report) marked a turning point in the U.S. retail media landscape. Walmart, already one of the country’s largest sellers of TVs through its physical stores, gained not primarily a TV manufacturer but a proprietary smart TV operating system with deeply embedded advertising capabilities. Since then, Roku, long a prominent player in CTV advertising and also rooted in digital signage history through its joined Brightsign heritage, has been losing ground as Walmart pushes its own ecosystem.

The timing could not have been better. The U.S. retail media market grew by around twenty percent in 2025, but Walmart Connect expanded significantly faster. The company reported thirty‑three percent growth in the last quarter alone, driven by online placements, in‑app advertising, in‑store screens and especially connected TV. When including the contribution of Vizio, Walmart’s global advertising business grew by more than fifty percent. The addition of a proprietary Connected TV platform has allowed Walmart to capture new revenue streams from non-endemic like automotive, financial services and quick‑service restaurants. Some of these new clients now rank among the largest spenders on the Walmart DSP.

The strategic value of the Vizio integration becomes clear in how Walmart combines its first‑party shopper data with CTV delivery. Vizio advertisers can target audiences based on verified Walmart shopping behaviour and measure the direct sales impact generated by campaigns shown on Vizio devices.

The company is rolling out the Vizio operating system to its private‑label Onn TV line, a move that could extend the OS’s reach to between a quarter and a third of all U.S. households. Such scale would place Walmart among the most influential CTV platform owners in the market, with a closed ecosystem reaching from hardware to measurement.

Impact on SoC-Platforms

Walmart and Amazon are the most important sales channel for TVs from Samsung, LG & Co. Their most important channel partner becomes now a serious competitor not only for TVs but also new competition for Google Android, Samsung Tizen and LG WebOS and their ambitious Ad-sales goals. The fully integrated Ad business model works tremendously good – according to Walmart Connect, shoppers exposed to CTV ads are twenty‑eight percent more likely to purchase products through Walmart.

The company sees a direct correlation between the number of consumer touchpoints a brand activates and the resulting increase in conversion, which strengthens its commitment to a multi-screen strategy spanning online, in-app, in-store and CTV environments.

Measurement is a central pillar of Walmart’s approach

Over the past year, the retailer has been expanding incremental return on ad spend metrics beyond display and video to include search and other formats. Brands increasingly expect consistent and comparable KPIs across all advertising surfaces, whether inside a Walmart store or on external channels. Walmart now provides closed-loop measurement across a wide array of media partners, including TikTok, Meta, TV networks and bespoke integrations such as a dedicated measurement partnership with Disney. The aim is to ensure that every impression can ultimately be tied back to sales outcomes.

While CTV is currently driving the most momentum, Walmart continues to invest heavily in the long-anticipated frontier of in-store retail media. The company is developing the hardware, adtech and measurement frameworks required to scale in-store advertising beyond pilot implementations. Importantly, Walmart emphasizes contextual relevance: bakery screens will serve food‑related messages, not generic electronics promotions. Brand lift and sales lift across in-store digital signage will become key metrics in what may emerge as the next major wave of U.S. retail media innovation.

Shopper Data is key – also for RMN-experts like Stratacache, Stingray, CRI & Co

US digital signage specialists such as Stratacache, Stingray and CRI face increasing pressure as retail media becomes a fully integrated discipline inside major retail giants. Shopper data has emerged as the decisive competitive advantage – and it is an area where vertically integrated retailers like Walmart set benchmarks that third‑party network operators cannot easily match. Stratacache’s PRN division once pioneered Walmart’s early in‑store media networks, but the era of outsourcing has ended for the world’s largest retailer. Today, Walmart controls its own retail media stack end‑to‑end, from data to measurement to CTV integration, leaving external vendors with far fewer opportunities at the very top of the market.

Across North America’s grocery, pharmacy and DIY sectors, however, the landscape looks different. While most supermarket groups now run internal retail media organisations responsible for monetisation and data strategy, the design, rollout and technical operation of in‑store networks remain largely in the hands of digital signage specialists. Stratacache and Stingray dominate these large‑scale deployments, but competition is intensifying as CRI, Wovenmedia and others position themselves as full‑service RMN partners for retailers that lack Walmart‑level resources. The battle for retail media network leadership beyond Amazon and Walmart is therefore shifting to supermarket and DIY chains, where operational expertise, flexible infrastructure and the ability to align with retailer‑owned shopper data will define the winners.",https://invidis.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-AUS-Walmart-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:27:34.359793

They stop you mid-scroll. According to Indian Tech & Infra, the Tata Group–owned brand sold 220 T-shirts, 60 pairs of denims, 250 fragrances, and 330 lipsticks every single minute last year. Let that sink in. While most fashion brands are busy chasing trends and attention, Zudio was quietly ringing up bills at a pace few expected.

By the end of FY25, the Mumbai-based retailer crossed the $1 billion revenue mark, a milestone many global fast-fashion players are still trying to crack in India. Even more telling? The brand managed to double its store count in just two years. No overnight miracle. No sudden viral moment. Just steady, deliberate growth.

Advt

Market analysts say this kind of scale doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the result of a very clear strategy - one that understands how India actually shops.

Instead of building hype, the brand built reach. While many brands poured money into celebrity endorsements and flashy launches, it focused on opening stores where people actually live and shop. Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities became its stronghold, tapping into a customer who wants to dress well but also wants prices that feel reasonable, not aspirational.

And that formula worked. Fast.

The brand’s racks move quickly because the clothes make sense. They’re trend-aware without being intimidating. Affordable without feeling throwaway. Fashion you can pick up without planning for it, sometimes even while doing your grocery run.

Of course, there’s debate around this success. Some critics say the brand’s rise proves India is still driven by volume, not premium fashion. But others see it differently. They believe it cracked middle-class psychology, the balance between wanting to look current and needing to stay practical. Once that balance is right, scale follows almost naturally.

Financially, the growth came with trade-offs. Trent, the Tata Group company behind Zudio, reported strong revenue gains even as margins tightened - a common story when a brand expands this aggressively. Hundreds of new stores mean higher costs today, but also deeper roots for tomorrow.

Advt

What’s interesting is how the brand now sits almost shoulder to shoulder with global fast-fashion giants, not by copying them, but by doing something very Indian. Keeping things simple. Keeping prices honest. And showing up everywhere.

Selling hundreds of products every minute isn’t just a flex. It’s proof that an Indian brand, built on clarity and consistency, can compete at scale without shouting about it.

And sometimes, that’s the smartest fashion move of all.

By Nate Allen

FAYETTEVILLE - Between a new/old warmup revived from the 1960s to a complete team for the first time, Eric Musselman promises a new look to his Arkansas Razorbacks for their official men’s basketball season opener tonight off their recent two exhibition games.

At 7 tonight at Walton Arena on the Razorbacks Radio Network and Internet video available on SEC Network Plus, Arkansas opens its campaign against the 1-0 Macon, Ga. based Mercer University Bears of the Southern Conference.

Kamani Johnson, the transfer power forward via the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, missed both exhibition victories over East Central (Okla.) University and the University of North Texas because of an injured wrist.

Starting sophomore letterman center Jaylin Williams missed the Oct. 30 UNT game with back spasms but has practiced daily since the Razorbacks resumed drill Monday after taking Sunday off.

Trey Wade, the graduate transfer power forward via Wichita State, missed nearly all of preseason including the exhibition against ECU with a knee injury but did log 16:46 vs. UNT without ill effects. All three should be available tonight, Musselman said.

“We’re healthier than we’ve been say in the last two months,” Musselman said. “So that’s a positive that we do have the injured guys back in the fold.”

Johnson, practicing with the Hogs since last Dec. 19 signing as a redshirting transfer, is especially ready to play a Razorbacks game.

“I’ve been sitting for probably around a year or so,”Johnson said to media last Friday. “So I couldn’t even put it into words how excited I am to step on the court and finally be a part of what it is to be an Arkansas Razorback. I’m super excited about it.”

Musselman said against UNT he had figured on a 5-minutes stint each half at most for Wade. He said he was surprised not by just how long Wade played but how effectively. The Hogs played plus 15 for Wade’s minutes though Musselman said Wade really doesn’t know his new team’s plays since he had been unable to practice them.

“Maybe that surprised me a little,” Wade said of the knee holding up for a nearly 17-minutes debut. 'I already knew once he put me on the floor it was going to be hard to take me out. I know how to get in the game and be productive regardless of if I really know the plays or not. It's just about being a basketball player.”

In tonight’s pregame, Razorbacks fans will see if their players new and returning can drill like Harlem Globetrotters.

Musselman said he’s reviving the Globetrotters like pregame warmup that his father, the late Bill Musselman, first invoked coaching Ashland College in the 1960s and brought to the University of Minnesota. Eric also used it for awhile coaching the University of Nevada.

Musselman said his father planned it to entertain the fans but certainly to benefit the players.

“He wanted his players to have great fundamentals handling the basketball,” Musselman said. “He wanted his team to be locked in and the warmup and helped with skills, as well. Nine of our players have learned to juggle three basketballs. Most of our team can all spin the ball on their finger. A lot of two-ball dribbling. Just a lot of skill stuff that we’ve worked on.”

Power forwards Wade and Johnson don’t seem the 3-balls in the air type but said they will surprise.

“You’ve got to get to the seats early and then you can find out what all I can do and what all the team can do,” Johnson said.

In the meantime, focus hasn’t been lost on Mercer returning three key starters from last season’s 18-11 Bulldogs and adding graduate transfer forward Jalen Johnson experienced both in the ACC and SEC.

Guard Neftali Alvarez, swingman James Glisson and forward Felipe Haase are three key returnees and joined Johnson and 6-6 Shawn Walker opening Wednesday’s 93-61 victory over Fort Valley State.

Alvarez led with 19 points. Johnson scored 12. Reserves Shannon Grant and Kamar Robertson scored 17 and 13.

“Alvarez, is a very, very good ball-handler,” Musselman said. “Very crafty. Loves to dribble drive right. Has got a great spin dribble. Really good in transition. One of the best guards in their league if not the best guard in their league. No. 22 (Felipe) Haase played for the Chilean national team. He can really shoot the ball. He plays the 5-spot for them. He’s a trail pick-and-pop guy. Johnson played for Tennessee and Wake Forest, a transfer at 6-6, 6-7. A very, very good 3-point shooter. Good defender because of length. Last night they made 13 threes. So this is a team that can really, really shoot the basketball. Glisson, is an offensive rebounding, high-energy player. Grant is a big body, physical who had 17 points. Those guys in particular are who we're focused on right now.”

Musselman has tinkered with lineups during the exhibitions.

In this story, we highlight sets of wheels that’ll get you gunning into the new year with poise and power.

Corvette Stingray

Who’s to say you shouldn’t start the year with a red-line roar? The arrival of the Corvette Stingray in Singapore last year marked a significant moment for the city’s high-octane landscape, as one of the most storied sports cars in the US finally took its place on local tarmac.

Seven decades of Corvette heritage sit behind the latest Stingray, yet its focus is firmly forward. A mid- mounted 6.2-litre V8 delivers 495 horses, sending the car from nought to 100km/h in 2.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 312km/h. The standard Z51 Performance Package adds track-tuned suspension, performance exhaust, larger brakes, and Michelin Pilot Sport 4S ZP tyres.

Visually, the Stingray expresses speed in sculpted form. Its canopy- forward stance draws inspiration from F-22 and F-35 fighter jets, as well as Formula One cars, giving it a low, wide, purposeful silhouette. A glass rear hatch puts the engine on display, while inside, a hand-wrapped leather cockpit cradles the driver like a fighter jet seat. The cabin is enhanced with a Bose Performance Series audio system and practical features, including a front suspension lift for navigating city streets and dual trunks spacious enough for golf bags.

Corvette

Aston Martin DB12

Few statements feel as decisive as receiving the keys to a DB12. Billed as the first of a new generation of Aston Martin sports cars, it ushers in a fresh chapter for the marque and for the DB bloodline: an ultra-luxury super-tourer that elevates the grand tourer idea by several notches.

Under the sculpted bonnet lies a hand-built 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8, tuned to deliver 680PS and 800Nm of torque. It covers the century sprint in 3.6 seconds and reaches a top speed north of 320km/h. New-generation adaptive dampers, an electronic rear differential, and bespoke 21-inch Michelin Pilot Sport 5 S tyres give the DB12 remarkable breadth, from supple and refined in GT mode to taut and alive in Sport and Sport+ when the road opens up.

The exterior is a study in renewal, rendered in metal. A wider stance, more muscular surfacing, and an all-new front end give the DB12 an assertive, almost architectural presence, framed by new LED headlights and a reshaped front grille. It is also the latest Aston Martin sports car to wear the newest evolution of the brand’s wings, a detail that signals a broader design reset.

Inside, the refresh extends to a driver-focused cockpit, combining hand-stitched leather and modern quilting with the brand’s in-house infotainment system, high-resolution displays, and an optional Bowers & Wilkins audio set-up.

Through Q by Aston Martin, owners can use the DB12 as a starting point to commission anything from a single distinguishing detail to a fully bespoke specification. With a new palette of colours, materials, and finishes, the possibilities are extensive, allowing the car to mirror whatever chapter they are stepping into.

Launched in the same year Aston Martin marks its 110th anniversary (and 75 years of DB models), the DB12 feels like a line in the sand, a signal that the next era has arrived. A fitting way to embrace renewal might well be committing to a car that is purpose- built for new horizons.",https://robbreport.com.sg/storage/2025/12/The_New_Aston_Martin_DB12_15-1-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 22:58:51.517725

The Philadelphia Eagles needed to beat the Washington Commanders in Week 18 and get some out-of-town help to clinch the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs for a second year in a row.

But they were foiled Sunday in the regular-season finale by the most unlikely character: third-string Commanders quarterback Josh Johnson — a 39-year-old journeyman who hadn’t won an NFL start since 2018.

Washington’s 24-17 road win left the Eagles as the No. 3 seed in the NFC. Philadelphia (11-6) will face the sixth-seeded San Francisco 49ers (12-5) in the opening round. It will be a rematch of the 2023 NFC Championship Game, a 31-7 Eagles win.

Because the Detroit Lions upset the Chicago Bears on Sunday, the Eagles would have been the No. 2 seed had they beaten the Commanders (5-12).

But with the NFC East title already assured, the Eagles made it clear that wasn’t their priority. They started backup quarterback Tanner McKee and rested starting QB Jalen Hurts, tight end Dallas Goedert, wide receiver A.J. Brown, running back Saquon Barkley and a host of other mainstays on both sides of the ball. Wide receiver DeVonta Smith exited early after reaching 1,000 receiving yards for the season. The Commanders sat left tackle Laremy Tunsil and started Johnson for a second consecutive game after injuries to Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota.

McKee finished 21-for-40 passing for 241 yards and a touchdown, and he was sacked three times and threw an interception. The Eagles’ three fourth-quarter drives ended in a punt and two turnovers on downs.

Johnson, meanwhile, brought the Commanders back from a 17-10 fourth-quarter deficit with two touchdown drives, scoring the decisive touchdown on a third-and-goal scramble from the 1-yard line with 2:32 left.

49ers up next

The Eagles spoiled an opportunity to secure the No. 2 seed, and they’re now preparing to host the 49ers. Had the Eagles jumped to the No. 2 seed, they would have hosted the Green Bay Packers, who have lost four in a row. The Eagles did not play the 49ers this season. They last played in the 2023 regular season, when the 49ers’ 42-19 victory avenged their loss in the NFC Championship Game months earlier. If the Eagles beat the 49ers and the Bears beat the Packers, the Eagles would travel to Chicago in the divisional round. With the No. 2 seed, the Eagles would instead have hosted the Bears. The Eagles could still host a divisional-round game with a win and a Bears loss. The Eagles knew the stakes entering the game and favored rest — what they viewed as a manufactured bye — entering the postseason. — Zach Berman, Eagles beat writer

Eagles backups can’t hold

An Eagles defense that fielded mostly backups could not deny the Commanders from scoring touchdowns on two consecutive goal-to-go scenarios to finish the game. When Johnson scrambled for that 1-yard touchdown to set the final score, the only Eagles regulars involved were along the defensive line. Jalyx Hunt, Jordan Davis, Moro Ojomo and Nolan Smith started. Hunt capped a second season in which he substantially improved by jumping a Johnson pass for his third interception of the season. Hunt led the Eagles in both interceptions and sacks (6.5) in 2025.

The performance of the Eagles’ secondary once again revealed its lack of depth. Apart from his interception, Johnson was 14-for-22 passing for 131 yards and a touchdown. The Commanders converted six of 11 third downs, converted their only fourth-down situation and scored three touchdowns on their four red-zone trips. Backup defensive backs Jakorian Bennett, Mac McWilliams and Kelee Ringo were each flagged for pass interference. (Bennett was flagged twice.) The Eagles are far more formidable under Vic Fangio when playing at full strength. The playoffs will reveal how beneficial it was for the starters to receive a rest. — Brooks Kubena, Eagles beat writer

McKee’s uneven day

McKee had an uneven audition for the rest of the NFL and couldn’t deliver the Eagles a victory as he did in the season finale last year. McKee, the Eagles’ third-year backup quarterback, has been a subject of intrigue in Philadelphia throughout his Eagles career. The interception was especially costly, coming at the Commanders’ 20-yard line with a chance to score. He also couldn’t lead the Eagles on a game-tying drive late in the game. The caveat is McKee, in his only start of the year, played with reserves against the Commanders’ starting defense, so his performance might have looked different had he played with the Eagles’ starters. McKee excelled in relief last season and followed it up with a sterling outing in the preseason, prompting curiosity about his future with the team. McKee has one year left on his contract and there could be outside interest from teams seeking a potential starting quarterback. But that case would have been stronger with a win and gaudier statistics. — Berman

Washington will pick seventh

Washington finally got a win, but it came at a cost: The Commanders fell to No. 7 in the draft order after entering the game at No. 6 (courtesy of the Cleveland Browns’ earlier win over the Cincinnati Bengals in addition to other results). — Nicki Jhabvala, Commanders beat writer

Johnson’s moment

Sunday was for Johnson. He threw his first touchdown since 2021 and scored his first rushing touchdown since 2018. — Jhabvala

Washington’s mistakes persist

Washington’s defense needs so much work. The Commanders continue to miss routine tackles, continue to give up easy yards in the middle of the field, continue to struggle with covering tight ends and continue to make backup quarterbacks look like seasoned veterans. Unlike last season, when they seemingly mastered situational ball, the Commanders often appeared sloppy and inattentive this season. And safety Quan Martin’s rough season was capped by losing the start to Jeremy Reaves. Martin was benched twice earlier for mistakes in games. This was the first time he was benched as a starter. Martin entered this game with an average of 18.7 yards allowed per catch, the highest average among safeties with at least 500 coverage snaps. He had allowed a 151.8 passer rating when targeted in coverage. — Jhabvala",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/04194756/GettyImages-2254675397-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-04 22:58:46.977749

Investors seem to be cautiously rewarding these health and tech pushes, with Walmart’s 90 day share price return of 9.8% and 1 year total shareholder return of 25.4% pointing to steady, not euphoric, momentum.

If Walmart’s moves have you thinking about where else growth and execution might line up, it could be worth exploring as a fresh hunting ground for ideas.

With shares up strongly over the past year and trading only modestly below analyst targets, the key question now is whether Walmart is still mispriced or if the market is already accounting for years of health and AI driven growth.

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 5.6% Undervalued

With Walmart closing at $112.76 against a widely followed fair value near $119, the dominant narrative sees modest upside still on the table.

Expansion of high margin business streams Walmart Connect (advertising, up 31 46% globally), marketplace, and Walmart+ memberships (global advertising up 46%, membership income up 15%) is diversifying Walmart's income base beyond retail, gradually transforming the company's profit mix and resulting in structurally higher net margins and earnings over time.

Want to see why a mature retailer is being modeled with the kind of margin and earnings profile usually reserved for premium platforms? The most popular narrative quietly rewrites Walmart’s profit mix, leans on steady top line growth, and bakes in a forward earnings multiple that many investors would not expect for this sector. Curious which assumptions have to hold for that valuation to work?

Result: Fair Value of $119.45 (UNDERVALUED)

However, persistent e commerce losses and rising wage and claims costs could crimp margins and challenge the idea that higher tech driven profitability is locked in.

Another Way to Look at Value

On earnings based valuation, Walmart looks stretched. Its price to earnings ratio of 39.2x sits well above the Consumer Retailing industry at 22.8x, the peer average at 26x, and even its own 38x fair ratio. This implies limited margin for error if growth stumbles.

By Josh Recamara

Jan 04, 2026 Share

AXA UK veteran Dougie Barnett (pictured) is retiring, following a career spanning more than four decades across underwriting, risk management and loss prevention.

Barnett most recently served as the company's director of mid-market and customer risk management. He began his insurance career in 1982 with Sun Alliance's underwriting team in Glasgow. Five years later, he moved to New Zealand Insurance, where he specialised in risk management.

Early challenges

Barnett joined AXA UK in July 2001 as a risk surveyor in Glasgow and was promoted later that year to UK property risk technical manager. One of his earliest and most significant challenges in the role came in the aftermath of the collapse of Independent Insurance, which triggered a severe capacity shortage in the food manufacturing sector. Barnett led AXA UK’s response, developing a structured risk matrix that enabled the insurer to re-enter the market and support brokers placing complex food sector risks at a time of widespread disruption.

Barnett also represented AXA UK on a number of Association of British Insurers (ABI) strategic programmes. Through this work, he engaged with government departments and regulators on issues including the use of composite panels in food risks, as well as the broader economic impact of fire and flood losses and their knock-on effects on mortgage availability and property lending.

Building partnerships

In 2004, Barnett launched AXA UK's first building valuation service in partnership with Cunningham Lindsay, responding to persistent underinsurance issues in larger commercial property portfolios. He was promoted to lead AXA UK's risk management team in 2006, where he oversaw the development of technical standards and broker-facing risk support.

In later years, Barnett established the company's global loss prevention board and helped develop the insurer's approach to emerging risks, including green buildings, sustainability-related property exposures, electric vehicles and sustainable transport. He also became a founder member of the AXA Group Global Risk Management Board, contributing to global strategy, policy development and talent programmes across Europe and Asia.

Barnett also served as a regular media spokesperson for AXA UK, providing industry commentary across trade and national outlets on property risk, loss prevention and emerging risk issues.

That pullback comes after a strong run, with the share price now at $291.5 and a 1 year total shareholder return of 34.31%, signalling that longer term momentum is still firmly intact despite the recent wobble.

If IBM's shift toward hybrid cloud and AI has caught your eye, it is also worth exploring other innovative tech names using our screener for .

With IBM now trading just shy of analyst targets after a powerful multi year run, investors face a key question: is there still upside left in the hybrid cloud and AI story, or is future growth already priced in?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 1% Undervalued

With IBM closing at $291.5 against a narrative fair value near $293.9, the storyline assumes only a slim remaining upside from here.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $281.316 for International Business Machines based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $350.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $198.0.

Curious how modest revenue growth, rising margins and a rich future earnings multiple can still point to upside from today’s price, despite tight projections?

Result: Fair Value of $293.89 (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, that story could fray if macro uncertainty slows consulting demand or if Red Hat’s consumption growth undershoots, which would challenge IBM’s mid single digit revenue ambitions.

Another Angle on Valuation

On earnings, IBM screens pricey, trading on a 34.4x price to earnings ratio versus 21.3x for peers and 28.8x for the broader US IT group. Yet Simply Wall St’s fair ratio of 37.9x hints the market might still edge higher, leaving investors to weigh upside against the risk of de rating.

Porter led the Nets to a 127-115 victory over the Nuggets before a sellout crowd of 17,548 at Barclays Center on Sunday.
“I was excited for that first match really since I’ve been traded, the way that all went down,” said Porter.
But it was Porter who led the way with an efficient game-high-tying 27 points, 11 rebounds and five assists.
I’m sure he’d disagree with me completely, which is OK, but we won a lot of games doing it that way.","Brooklyn’s Michael Porter Jr. returned from illness just in time to face the team that traded him over the summer. And he made that reunion a winning one.

Porter led the Nets to a 127-115 victory over the Nuggets before a sellout crowd of 17,548 at Barclays Center on Sunday.

It snapped a three-game skid, and was especially sweet for Porter, who won the 2023 title with the Nuggets only to be salary dumped last summer by Denver.

“I was excited for that first match really since I’ve been traded, the way that all went down,” said Porter. “I was looking forward to playing against those guys. For sure it’s been circled on my calendar for a minute. I probably got a little bit more nervous for this one than a lot of other games. So it was fun.”

The Nets (11-22) had a season-high six players muster at least 13 points as they shot 50.6 percent and 14-for-33 from deep. But it was Porter who led the way with an efficient game-high-tying 27 points, 11 rebounds and five assists.

“I think it means a lot to him because he’s been there for a long time, and he’s got a lot of people they shared the locker room for a long time,” Jordi Fernández said of Porter, whom he spent four seasons with as a Denver assistant. “I’m very happy for the group. I’m very happy for Michael.”

A starter on the Nuggets team that won the 2023 title, Porter nevertheless took a backseat to the two-man game of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. The Nets dealt Cam Johnson for Porter and Denver’s unprotected 2032 first-round pick, a swap that was initially panned but is looking more and more like a Brooklyn steal.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NBA STANDINGS AND NETS STATS

Entering Sunday, Porter was the only qualified player in the East averaging at least 25 points and seven rebounds, and one of five in the entire league, joining Jokic, Luka Doncic, Lauri Markkanen and Deni Avdija. More to the point, the Nets are winless without him (0-6), but 11-16 with him — winning eight of his last 11.

With Jokic sidelined by a hyperextended left knee, and Johnson out with a bone bruise in his right, Murray poured in 27 points and 16 assists, while Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 26.

The Nets had more than enough to overcome that, Porter’s production backed by forward Noah Clowney (20 points) and Day’Ron Sharpe. The latter filled in admirably for starting center Nic Claxton with 17 points, six rebounds, four assists, three steals and just a single turnover.

“Well, coming in here, I told everybody we locked in,” said Sharpe. “So, we just wanted to rally as a team to help get the Dub for him.”

Brooklyn was clinging to a tenuous 63-56 lead after Murray found Peyton Watson underneath 1:51 into the second half. But they ripped off an extended 21-10 run over the next five minutes, including the final seven unanswered points to seize control of the game. They never gave the lead back.

The Nets hit eight of nine shots in the blitz, including all four from 3-point range. Egor Dëmin had five points and two assists in the game-deciding run, including the final dagger off a Porter feed to make it 84-66 with 5:10 left in the third.

Brooklyn built the lead to 19 and never let it get below double digits, seeing the game out behind Porter.

“He’s got a lot of freedom here. This trade was good for everybody. He won a championship with us. He’s one of the main reasons we did it,” said Nuggets coach David Adelman, who was an assistant alongside Fernández. “Any time you win the whole thing, the role was appropriate. Michael, we know how talented he is.

“Mike has this ability, he always has, but for us, he sacrificed…Our two-man game has been successful, and him in the corner with Aaron Gordon in the dunker spot, was quite a thing. Michael, I thought we used him in the right way. I’m sure he’d disagree with me completely, which is OK, but we won a lot of games doing it that way. It’s cool to see him have some more freedom here under Jordi.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-jzemcesi3-1767570105642.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1767552132&w=1200,N,,2026-01-04 20:58:33.076892

THERE HAS been a lot of attention recently on tax reform. There are few issues that unite Canadians so much as when we complain about how much we pay in taxes.

While reform is important, unfortunately there is not much attention paid to tax enforcement or collection. How will reform help matters if we won’t pursue offenders? Why aren’t we applying the existing laws? Why aren’t Canadian politicians, tax experts and the public insisting that offenders are paying their fair share of taxes?

There are many misconceptions about taxes. Let’s focus our attention on those who offend rather than those who comply.

Some Uncomfortable Truths

An uncomfortable truth is that the Income Tax Act (the Act), at over 3,700 pages, is designed to be confusing. Despite the odd public pronouncement denouncing the complexities of the Act there is little appetite for reform once you realize who benefits from the status quo.

Rules are easy to break when there are so many exceptions. The biggest beneficiaries of today’s confusing Act are multinational corporations and wealthy individuals. Whenever wealthy individuals, from Mr. Bezos to Mr. Balsillie to Mr. Buffet, are challenged about their tax avoidance schemes they roll out the standard defence: “we are in compliance with all of the rules and regulations.” And many lawyers and accountants oppose simplification of the Act. What better way to increase billable hours?

Another Myth

Many pundits argue that lower tax rates encourage businesses to invest. This is debatable as there are many other factors to consider. However, we know that lower tax rates encourage multinational corporations and wealthy individuals to shift assets and income to lower tax jurisdictions, which is not the same as investing in these jurisdictions. Wealth has no loyalty, and limited ties, to its host country.

Do lower tax rates help the economy?

Let’s examine Ireland, which is often lauded by pundits who advocate for lower corporate tax rates in Canada.

A few years ago Microsoft Corporation transferred its licensing rights to Microsoft Ireland. Microsoft Ireland in turn charged Microsoft Canada a royalty so that revenues were eliminated in Canada but recorded in Ireland. An Irish tax rate of 12.5% versus Canada’s tax rate of 26.1% is tax avoidance and does not encourage investment in Ireland or Canada.

And you would think that the Irish State, in the example above, would be pleased with the extra tax revenue. Think again. In 2016 the European Commission (EC) pursued Apple Inc. for offshore profit shifting and tax avoidance. The EC announced in 2024 that Apple owed the Irish State 13 billion euro including penalties and interest. Not surprisingly Apple appealed the initial ruling of the EC.

What was surprising was that the Irish State rejected this significant tax windfall and joined forces with Apple against the EC. If Canada enacted lower corporate taxes would we too fall into the trap of appeasing a large employer such as Apple?

More Avoidance

In 2008 the Internal Revenue Service in the US compared the Forbes 400 annual listing of wealthy individuals to amounts declared by these individuals when they died. Approximately half of the wealth of these individuals was declared, which suggests a significant shield on inheritance taxes. The type of tax that is easy to apply to the population, such as income tax and sales taxes, is not as easy to apply to wealthy people.

Avoidance Closer to Home

Canadians for Tax Fairness reported last year that Canada’s largest corporations and wealthiest families have transferred $682 Billion to tax havens. They note that 75% of companies listed on the S&P/TSX 60 have at least one subsidiary in a tax haven, including all of the big Canadian banks and insurance companies, Shopify and Cenovus. In 2024 these 60 companies avoided $7 Billion in taxes.

Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield) is one of the biggest offenders when it comes to tax avoidance. Brookfield has more subsidiaries in tax havens than any other company on the S&P/TSX60.

Canadians For Tax Fairness, in October 2022, concluded that Brookfield had the largest tax gap, of $6 billion, in Canada between 2017 and 2021. Most of Brookfield’s operating businesses are carried out in Bermuda. Brookfield’s effective tax rate has been below Canada’s statutory tax rate in nine of the last ten years and, in five of those years, below 13% (according to S&P Global Market Intelligence). Brookfield stated in a recent proxy circular: “Brookfield and our perpetual affiliates are in full compliance with all applicable tax laws …”.

Why not align reform with collection?

Wouldn’t effective tax collection ease the strain of federal and provincial budget deficits? Since wealth leaks to the lowest tax jurisdiction, the Group of Twenty (G20) established a Global Minimum Corporate Tax Rate. The goal of this effort is to overhaul the manner in which large multinational corporations are taxed and to align the taxation of the digital economy based on location of sales rather than headquarters.

Tax reform is meaningless unless it is aligned with tax collection. Let’s hope that the moral obligation to pay our fair share of taxes spurs tax reform, and simplification of the Act, in a meaningful direction.",https://cdn.agilitycms.com/canadian-accountant/Tax-Reform-VI-660px.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 21:58:54.516036

The gist: OpenAI is reportedly accelerating its audio AI roadmap to support its upcoming screenless hardware device designed by Jony Ive.

Key details: The company targets a Q1 2026 release for a new full-duplex voice model, with the hardware device following in early 2027.

Why it matters: This aggressive timeline contrasts with major delays at Google and Apple, who have pushed their next-gen assistants to Spring 2026.

Context: Achieving seamless, interruption-tolerant voice interaction is the critical technical hurdle for ambient computing devices to succeed.

OpenAI is reportedly accelerating its audio AI roadmap to support its upcoming screenless hardware. For its upcoming high-fidelity voice model designed to handle complex, real-time interruptions, the company is now targeting a Q1 2026 release.

Laying the necessary groundwork for the AI device being developed with Jony Ive, the former Apple design chief, this software sprint targets an early 2027 hardware launch. Such a fast-paced schedule contrasts with major delays at rivals Google and Apple, who have pushed their own updates to Spring 2026.

The Software Sprint: A New Foundation for Voice

Reports indicate the company has unified its engineering, product, and research teams to focus on a single vertical for audio development. By unifying these departments, OpenAI aims to produce a model capable of full duplex communication by the first quarter of 2026.

Current voice assistants typically require a pause before processing input, creating a turn-taking dynamic that feels unnatural. A reported by The Information, OpenAI targets the ability to speak simultaneously with the user and handle interruptions without latency.

Control: Keep everything private: data stays in your browser, with import/export and version history.

Framing the upcoming device as a fundamental shift in user interaction, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted, “I think we have the opportunity here to kind of completely reimagine what it means to use a computer.”

Moving from active command input to passive, ambient interaction requires near-zero latency. While the gpt-realtime launch in August 2025 reduced costs by 20%, it maintained the standard request-response architecture.

To demonstrate the baseline capabilities that the new model aims to surpass, OpenAI previously released benchmarks for its current technology.

Supporting a device without visual feedback requires the upcoming model to exceed the 82.8% reasoning score on the Big Bench Audio evaluation achieved by the current version.

The Hardware Endgame: Jony Ive’s Ambient Ambition

Serving as the critical dependency for OpenAI’s consumer hardware ambitions, the software roadmap aligns directly with the device timeline. Developed in collaboration with former Apple design chief Jony Ive, the device is now expected to launch in approximately 12 months.

Refining the confirmed device timeline provided by Altman in November 2025, the new estimate narrows the window from a broader “less than two years.”

According to reports, the OpenAI device will reportedly eschew screens entirely, relying on the new audio model as its primary interface. Previous attempts at this form factor, such as the Humane AI Pin, failed largely due to slow response times and connection errors.

To address these specific performance bottlenecks, the company has reportedly adopted a staggered release strategy. The updated audio model will reportedly debut first in the opening quarter of the year, establishing the necessary low-latency infrastructure.

This software foundation will then pave the way for the hardware itself, which is now projected to ship in approximately 12 months, placing the likely release window in early 2027.

Internally, the project has absorbed significant talent, including key designers from Apple. Developers on the hardware team are betting that the new audio model will solve the latency issues that plagued earlier screenless devices.

Google and Apple and the Voice Assistant Race

OpenAI’s primary competitors are also addressing quality control issues. Google has officially confirmed delaying the sunset of Google Assistant in favor of Gemini Live on mobile devices until March 2026.

User feedback indicating that the Gemini-based replacement lacked the reliability of the legacy Google Assistant for basic tasks necessitated the decision. Citing the need for a seamless transition rather than a forced upgrade, executives opted to delay the rollout.

Apple, which is lacking substantially in terms of AI capabilities, has pushed the release of its “Siri V2” overhaul to a Spring 2026 target window following a eadership shakeup.",https://winbuzzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/openai-logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 18:59:35.484620

By the time the consensus catches up, the biggest opportunities — and risks — are usually already in motion.

In today’s Sunday Digest takeover, our technology expert Luke Lango lays out a case for why AI isn’t just transforming technology or markets — it’s reshaping the labor economy itself.

Luke connects history, data, and real-world corporate behavior to show why this moment feels different, and why the traditional relationship between productivity and wages is breaking down. Just as important, he explains what investors and workers can do now to adapt — before this shift becomes impossible to ignore.

And if you want to go deeper into how to position for this transformation, Luke recently broke down the government-backed AI buildout and the specific companies he believes are best positioned to benefit in a special broadcast. You can watch the replay and access the free briefing right here.

I’ll let Luke take it from here.

Have a good weekend,

Jeff Remsburg

In 1811, as England’s Industrial Revolution was gaining momentum, a group of textile workers decided to fight back.

Led by the mythical “General Ludd” of Sherwood Forest, what began as a concentrated movement in central England quickly spread across the nation. Traditional workers took hammers to the stocking frames and power looms – the machines erasing their jobs, their wages, and centuries of hard-won craft.

They weren’t irrational or anti-progress. They were simply watching their livelihoods evaporate in real time, and they understood that no one was coming to help them.

And it took generations of political struggle to rebuild something resembling dignity for working people.

Right now, a similar story is unfolding. This time, AI is the existential threat.

While investors are worrying about if Big Tech is spending too much on AI, the ground beneath our feet – the very foundation of how we earn a living – is turning into quicksand.

The biggest risk we face isn’t a bear market or even a crash in the Nasdaq.

It’s the permanent devaluation of human labor…

The Iceberg Index: The Truth About AI Job Loss in America

The latest research shows just how far this displacement has already advanced beneath the surface.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, partnering with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, recently released what it calls the “Iceberg Index” – and it’s terrifyingly blunt.

The study’s models suggest that roughly 12% of existing U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI right now.

That’s 1 in 9 people whose economic output can be matched by a software subscription that doesn’t need health insurance and doesn’t take bathroom breaks.

We aren’t even talking about what happens when the AI further matures.

When an AI agent can not only write the email but also plan the project and execute the code migration without human intervention, the need for human “managers” in the middle evaporates.

We are already seeing the results…

HP Inc. (HPQ) just announced it is cutting up to 6,000 jobs by 2028 to “fund AI investment.”

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) cut 12,000 corporate roles earlier this year, explicitly stating that automation means those jobs aren’t coming back.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is undergoing its biggest corporate layoff ever.

This isn’t recessionary. This is a capital pivot. Companies are trading variable-cost, high-maintenance human workers for fixed-cost, exponentially improving silicon ones.

AI Is Breaking the Link Between Productivity and Wages

For the last century, as technology improved, productivity went up. As productivity went up, wages did, too. A rising tide lifted all boats, even if some boats were lifted higher than others.

But AI is breaking that link.

When a company deploys an AI system that allows it to double its output without hiring a single new employee, where does that extra value go?

It does not go to the remaining workers. It goes to the company’s bottom line, and then to dividends, buybacks, and a higher share price.

And that doesn’t even take an economic downturn into account.

Right now, we have historically low unemployment (around 4%). The economy is showing cracks but is still fairly stable. And yet, companies are aggressively automating.

Imagine what happens in a recession.

Economists call it the “cleansing effect.” When revenue dips, companies are forced to cut costs and jobs mercilessly.

The recession will be the accelerant. The recovery will be jobless.

Workers Must Shift From Labor to Capital to Survive the AI Era

So, if the value of labor is crashing and the value of capital is skyrocketing, the solution is uncomfortably simple.

You need to stop thinking like a laborer and start thinking like a capitalist.

This brings us to the “stock bubble.” You might be worried that Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is overpriced at its current valuation. Fair enough.

But if you have zero exposure to the companies building the infrastructure of the future, you are betting your entire financial existence on your ability to outwork software that doubles in ability every 18 months.

That is a terrible bet.

The only true hedge against the devaluation of your labor is to own stock in the companies that are benefiting from labor devaluation. You need to be on the receiving end of that wealth transfer.

If the AI boom continues, these companies will generate unprecedented cash flows. If the “AI bubble” pops, the tech doesn’t go away. It just gets cheaper for companies to deploy, accelerating the labor displacement even faster.

In either scenario, capital wins.

How to Protect Yourself From AI Job Loss: A Two-Part Strategy

Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Great advice. I’ll just take this spare $3 million and buy a diversified portfolio of AI infrastructure stocks so I can live off the dividends when my job is automated.”

Indeed, replacing an entire salary with capital returns requires a massive amount of money that most of us simply don’t have.

So, you need a two-part “barbell strategy” for survival.

Immediate Financial Exposure: You cannot afford to sit this market out because it’s “frothy.” You need exposure to the picks and shovels of this gold rush – the chip designers, hyperscale cloud providers, foundational model companies, etc.

Become ‘Human Capital’: Until you have enough capital to retire, your labor is still your primary asset. You have to upgrade it.

The labor market is bifurcating into two categories: commodity labor versus agency labor.

You need to be the latter. Stop writing copy. Start orchestrating the brand voice that AI brings to life.

The people who will thrive in the transition period aren’t just the ones owning Nvidia stock. They are the ones who can walk into a panicked C-suite and say: “I can replace your inefficient 20-person department with myself, three sharp lieutenants, and a fleet of AI agents – and save you 40%.”

Wield AI as a weapon for your own advancement.

The Labor Market Is Approaching a Breaking Point

Exponential curves look flat for a long time … and then, suddenly, they go vertical.

We are right at the knee of that curve. The window to prepare is closing faster than most think.

It’s best to stop agonizing about whether we are in a 2000s-style stock bubble. A stock market crash hurts your portfolio temporarily. A structural shift in the value of human labor hurts your family permanently.

As automation accelerates and data centers explode in size, the U.S. is quietly executing what many insiders are calling a modern “Manhattan Project for AI.”

And Washington isn’t just funding this initiative. It’s partnering directly with select American companies it views as essential to winning the AI race — and those stocks are erupting.

This year alone, several smaller U.S. firms surged 200%… 300%… even 400% in a matter of days after government investment or contract news broke.

These aren’t hype-driven rallies. They’re the early winners of America’s AI buildout — the companies being positioned at the center of a multiyear national transformation.

And while millions of workers brace for AI-driven disruption, investors who understand where Washington is placing its strategic bets could be on the receiving end of one of the last great wealth transfers of our lifetime.

That’s why I’ve been working on something urgent, which you can now see for yourself.

I’ve identified a handful of overlooked American companies that I believe are next in line for government backing — and each has the potential to soar 10X as this new AI buildout accelerates.

I reveal the first one — 100% free — in my new briefing.

Click here to learn how to position yourself before the next government-backed breakout.

Consider it the first plate on your barbell.

Airlines waived change fees and fare differences for passengers whose travel was disrupted, provided they rebooked within the month. More than a dozen regional airports participated in these waiver policies.

The temporary restrictions followed US strikes in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, as noted by US President Donald Trump. “The strikes resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife,” Trump said.

Without timely treatment, patients may face amputation.
With a history of kidney failure, including a kidney transplant, Bridgen returned to the doctors with resurfacing kidney failure symptoms.
Through pre-kidney transplant assessments, doctors discovered a blockage and finally diagnosed Bridgen with PAD, upon which they offered IVL treatment.
Both Dr Portou and Dr West believe that the main barrier affecting patient outcomes is the misdiagnosis of PAD symptoms.","Patients suffering from peripheral artery disease (PAD) are increasingly being offered a treatment by doctors called intravascular lithotripsy (IVL). Developed by Shockwave Medical, part of Johnson & Johnson Medtech, Shockwave IVL was adapted from extracorporeal lithotripsy, a treatment that uses sound waves to break down kidney stones. The goal was to use similar acoustic wave technology to modify calcium in diseased arteries without damaging surrounding tissues.

IVL is used to treat cardiovascular diseases complicated by the buildup of calcium on the artery walls, called calcification. Calcification both restricts blood flow and limits the effectiveness of conventional treatments for PAD, including balloon dilatation (angioplasty) and stenting.

PAD is a condition where cholesterol-rich deposits accumulate in the arteries, forming narrowings. Such deposits may become calcified, restricting blood and oxygen flow to the limbs, over time leading to severe leg pain, limited mobility, and tissue damage and sometimes necessitating amputation. PAD primarily affects older adults and people with diabetes or kidney disease, but it is also tied to other risk factors including smoking and a genetic history of PAD.

IVL cracks calcium through the generation of shock waves, a form of ultrasonic acoustic pressure wave, with a lower pressure peak than extracorporeal lithotripsy. IVL is delivered by emitters placed within a balloon angioplasty catheter and can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatments such as atherectomy, angioplasty or stenting.

""The balloon is inflated at low pressure to avoid vessel damage, and an electrical current is passed to the emitter, creating an acoustic pressure wave,"" says Dr Nick West, chief medical officer at Shockwave Medical. ""That pressure wave is what cracks the calcium. What you're left with is a blood vessel that becomes more compliant – less stiff, if you like – so that you can expand it with conventional tools.""

IVL is enhancing how physicians and surgeons treat patients with calcified lesions, including the most severe form of peripheral artery disease – chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). CLTI is a progressive condition and represents the end stage of PAD, where in some cases extremely calcified arteries severely restrict blood and oxygen flow to the legs, leading to pain, ulcers and gangrene. Without timely treatment, patients may face amputation. However, IVL is a treatment option that could be used to attempt to avoid that outcome.

Treating calcified arteries in CLTI patients can be challenging, as the patient's arteries are more fragile, rigid and at higher risk of complication than in less severe cases of PAD, Dr Mark Portou, a consultant vascular surgeon in London, explains. For eligible patients whose doctors have recommended this treatment, the benefits can be significant.

Despite the known risk factors and prevalence of PAD, public knowledge surrounding the condition is limited. Over 200 million people are living with PAD worldwide, Dr Portou says, yet few know what it is. It remains a condition which is underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Belinda Bridgen suffered for five years before being diagnosed with PAD at the age of 70. Leading up to her diagnosis, she endured constant pain in her hip and leg. She visited doctors with these symptoms, but none ever mentioned the possibility of it being PAD.

Bridgen assumed her symptoms were a result of ageing. She subsequently visited a surgeon, who proposed back surgery. She underwent the procedure in 2022, hoping it would ease her discomfort – however it did not. As a result of the back surgery being ineffective, Bridgen thought that she would have to live with the debilitating pain that made even her short walk to the bus stop difficult.

In early 2025, doctors found a blockage in Bridgen's right iliac artery. With a history of kidney failure, including a kidney transplant, Bridgen returned to the doctors with resurfacing kidney failure symptoms. Through pre-kidney transplant assessments, doctors discovered a blockage and finally diagnosed Bridgen with PAD, upon which they offered IVL treatment.

Individual patient results may vary, but in Bridgen's experience, after a few weeks of tender bruising at the site of insertion of the IVL catheter, Bridgen was soon walking more comfortably. Her destinations now stretch much further than the post box – she can now walk to the pub to meet up with friends too. ""I've got my life back,"" she says, as she talks about her upcoming trip to Croatia and the prospect of finally joining guided walking tours that she used to sit out.

Bridgen stresses the importance of visiting a doctor as early as possible. Many patients delay getting assessed because they are afraid their symptoms may signal the need for a severe medical procedure.

Both Dr Portou and Dr West believe that the main barrier affecting patient outcomes is the misdiagnosis of PAD symptoms. Even among healthcare professionals, symptoms are often written off as signs of ageing, poor mobility, simple musculoskeletal issues or diabetes, they explain.

This lack of understanding can lead to delayed treatment and severe consequences. For example, approximately 20% of patients suffering with CLTI might require limb amputation within a year of diagnosis.

""The mortality for [CLTI] is worse than many cancers, which people don't realise. That needs to change,"" says Dr West. ""The symptoms can seem mild at first and patients often don't report them. That delay in diagnosis is one of the biggest obstacles to improving outcomes.""

As the global population ages and rates of diabetes continue to climb, technologies like IVL could play a vital role in preserving limbs and lives, especially when paired with patient and physician education. While IVL offers a step forward in treatment, it is still only serving as part of a wider scope of surgical and non-surgical options, not a cure. It requires experience and good clinical judgment and individual patient results may vary. ""This isn't a silver bullet. It's one part of a broader treatment paradigm that includes early diagnosis, appropriate screening and lifestyle management,"" says Dr West.

Patients should seek appropriate treatment for PAD, which may include IVL, to reduce the risk of serious complications, including a life-altering limb amputation. ""IVL is not a miracle and sometimes might not be enough,"" says Dr Portou. ""But it gives us a chance. When we save a limb, we're not just saving a foot, we're helping to save independence, mobility and a person's confidence to keep living.""",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1920x1080/p0mhlm9s.jpeg,N,,2026-01-04 16:59:01.060791

While everyone chases the loudest AI ticker, this low-key industrial beast has been stacking real-world power plays and serious stock performance. So… is Parker-Hannifin actually worth your money, or just another background player you can ignore?

Real talk: if you care about steady growth, dividends, and companies that build the hardware behind literally everything that moves, you need to at least know this name.

The Hype is Real: Parker-Hannifin on TikTok and Beyond

Parker-Hannifin is not a meme stock. It’s not trending every second. But that’s exactly why long-term investors are paying attention. Instead of going viral for chaos, it’s quietly winning for execution.

Want to see the receipts? Check the latest reviews here:

Watch viral TikTok reviews of Parker-Hannifin

Watch honest tests on YouTube

On social, the vibe is simple: this is a “grown-up” stock. Think engineers, builders, and finance creators who are over chasing the latest rug-pull and want something that actually throws off cash.

The Business Side: Parker-Hannifin Aktie

Let’s zoom in on the numbers, because that’s where Parker-Hannifin (ISIN: US7010941019) really starts to flex.

Stock data check-in:

According to multiple live feeds from major financial platforms (such as Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), Parker-Hannifin trades on the NYSE under the ticker PH.

As of the latest available market data from these sources, the quote being shown reflects the most recent trading session’s last close, not a live intraday move.

I am not able to access a fully up-to-the-minute live price feed right now, so I will not guess a number. All current pricing, performance charts, and intraday moves should be pulled directly from a live source like:

Yahoo Finance – PH quote

MarketWatch – PH overview

Always double-check the latest price, percent change, and market cap there before you trade.

Here’s why the stock has serious “no-drama, all-business” energy:

Industrial backbone: Parker-Hannifin builds motion and control systems – hydraulics, pneumatics, filtration, aerospace tech. Basically, if it moves, lifts, flies, or operates in a tough environment, there’s a decent chance Parker has a part in it.

Revenue from the real economy: This isn’t pure hype. The company sells into manufacturing, energy, aerospace, transportation, and more. When big infrastructure and industrial projects go up, Parker gets paid.

Dividends + long-term compounding: It’s widely known as a solid dividend payer with a long history of returning cash to shareholders while still investing in growth.

On the clout scale, this is not a “look at my 10x YOLO” stock. It’s more of a “my portfolio aged up, and now it actually makes sense” type of move.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Let’s break Parker-Hannifin down into three big angles: growth, stability, and hype potential.

1. Growth: Quiet but serious

Parker-Hannifin has been using acquisitions and tech upgrades to scale up. It’s pushing deeper into high-margin areas like aerospace and advanced motion control, where customers care about reliability way more than shaving a few bucks off.

This means it’s not just a “metal and pipes” company. It’s moving into smarter, more engineered systems that lock in long-term customers.

2. Stability: Big boomer energy (in a good way)

If you’re tired of watching your feed melt down every time a meme stock pops or drops, Parker-Hannifin is the opposite vibe. It’s been around for a long time, it serves massive industries, and it tends to track with the broader economy more than whatever is trending this week.

That doesn’t mean it can’t drop. Industrial stocks can get hit when growth fears spike. But compared to some flashy tech names, this one has actual assets, real contracts, and physical products people can’t just “unsubscribe” from overnight.

3. Hype potential: Under-the-radar flex

Parker-Hannifin is never going to trend like a meme token. But it has its own kind of clout: institutional respect. Long-only funds, pension money, and serious dividend investors pay attention to names like this.

So no, you’re probably not getting a viral spike out of nowhere. But over time? The stock has a track record that makes analysts treat it like a legit compounder, not a lottery ticket.

Parker-Hannifin vs. The Competition

Every industrial giant has rivals. For Parker-Hannifin, think big diversified players in motion, control, and industrial tech. One of the closest headline rivals is Eaton (ticker: ETN), another major name in power management and industrial systems.

Parker-Hannifin vs Eaton: Who wins the clout war?

Brand vibe: Eaton has slightly more mainstream recognition in some energy and electrical circles, but neither name is exactly a TikTok darling. Parker wins with deeper engineering cred across hydraulics and motion systems.

Diversification: Both are diversified, but Parker-Hannifin’s reach into aerospace and motion control gives it exposure to defense and aviation – sectors that can be very profitable in the right cycle.

Investor perception: Eaton often gets framed as a “power and electrical” play; Parker is seen more as a high-spec industrial and aerospace systems specialist. If you want more pure electrical infrastructure, Eaton has the edge. If you want motion, hydraulics, and aerospace strength, Parker stands out.

Who takes the win? From a social and narrative standpoint, neither is a hype machine. But if you want the under-the-radar pick with serious engineering depth and exposure to high-tech industrial applications, Parker-Hannifin quietly edges ahead.

Is It Worth the Hype?

This isn’t a stock you brag about in the group chat for instant clout. It’s the stock you brag about in five or ten years when everyone else is wondering how your “boring” picks pulled ahead.

Where Parker-Hannifin shines:

Real talk: It’s tied to physical infrastructure, manufacturing, aerospace, and energy – stuff that doesn’t vanish overnight.

Price performance: Historically, it’s been a strong compounder with periods of serious outperformance, especially when industrial and infrastructure spending is hot.

Risk level: Lower drama than hyped growth names, but still cyclical. When the economy slows, orders can cool off and the stock can wobble.

If you’re hunting for a “must-have” meme rocket, this is probably a drop. If you’re trying to build a portfolio that could still make sense years from now, Parker-Hannifin is very much in cop territory for further research.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Here’s the blunt breakdown.

Game-changer? In your portfolio strategy, yes. This is the kind of industrial name that can anchor a more mature, diversified setup. In terms of internet culture? Not really – it’s not a viral celebrity stock.

Price drop bait? When markets panic on growth fears or industrial slowdowns, stocks like Parker-Hannifin can pull back. For long-term investors, those dips can turn into “must-cop” entries if you actually believe in the business.

Is it worth the hype? For serious, patient investors: absolutely worth a closer look. For short-term clout-chasing: probably not your move.

Your move: If you’re building a grown-up portfolio, put Parker-Hannifin on your watchlist, dig into the latest earnings reports and guidance on its investor site at parker.com, and cross-check the latest price and valuation metrics on a live platform before you tap buy.

Market Positioning and Competitive Edges Positioned against a backdrop of evolving consumer behaviors, GE’s fridge taps into the growing demand for connected kitchens.
From a business perspective, this launch aligns with GE Appliances’ strategy under Haier ownership to innovate in the premium segment.
GE Appliances’ press room emphasizes how this reduces the “grocery guesswork,” a sentiment echoed in business analyses predicting a $50 billion market for smart kitchen tech by 2030.
GE’s fridge meets this by blending hardware with software, much like how smartphones evolved from calls to life hubs.","In the bustling world of home appliances, where innovation often promises to simplify daily chores, General Electric has unveiled a refrigerator that could redefine how households manage their groceries. Announced just ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in 2026, the GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator integrates a built-in barcode scanner, a camera system, and seamless connectivity with Instacart, aiming to automate the tedious task of inventory tracking and shopping list creation. This isn’t just another smart fridge with a touchscreen; it’s a device that actively scans items as they’re placed inside, recognizes when supplies are low, and populates a digital shopping cart without user intervention.

The core feature revolves around the patented barcode scanner, embedded in the fridge’s interior. Users simply wave an item’s barcode in front of the scanner upon restocking, and the system logs it into an inventory database. As items are depleted—detected via internal cameras that monitor shelves—the fridge automatically adds them to a grocery list accessible through a companion app or an integrated 8-inch tablet on the door. This integration with Instacart allows for one-tap ordering, potentially turning the refrigerator into a proactive household manager. According to details from Engadget, the technology draws on AI to predict needs based on usage patterns, such as suggesting milk refills if the scanner notes frequent scans of cereal boxes.

Industry observers note that this launch comes at a time when consumers are increasingly seeking ways to reduce mental load in the kitchen. GE’s press release highlights how the Kitchen Assistant feature—essentially the fridge’s AI brain—can even scan perishables for freshness, alerting users to impending expirations via notifications. Priced at around $3,500, the 27.9 cubic foot model positions itself as a premium offering, blending French-door aesthetics with cutting-edge tech that could appeal to busy families and tech-savvy professionals alike.

Unpacking the Technology Behind the Scan

Delving deeper into the mechanics, the barcode scanner isn’t a mere gimmick; it’s powered by advanced optical recognition software that interfaces with a vast database of product UPC codes. This allows the fridge to identify not just the item but also its typical shelf life and nutritional data, which can feed into meal planning suggestions. The internal cameras, meanwhile, use computer vision algorithms to estimate quantities—say, how many eggs are left in a carton—without requiring manual input. GE claims this reduces food waste by up to 20%, a statistic echoed in early reviews from tech sites.

Integration with Instacart is particularly noteworthy, as it leverages the delivery service’s API for real-time pricing and availability checks. Users can customize preferences, like opting for organic alternatives or specific brands, and the system learns from past orders to refine suggestions. As reported by The Verge, this fridge builds on previous smart kitchen experiments but introduces a level of automation that feels genuinely hands-off, distinguishing it from competitors like Samsung’s Family Hub, which relies more on manual list-building.

For industry insiders, the real intrigue lies in the data ecosystem. GE’s appliance connects to the company’s broader smart home platform, potentially sharing insights with other devices like ovens or pantries. This could enable scenarios where the fridge communicates with a smart oven to suggest recipes based on available ingredients, further embedding AI into everyday cooking routines.

Market Positioning and Competitive Edges

Positioned against a backdrop of evolving consumer behaviors, GE’s fridge taps into the growing demand for connected kitchens. Recent posts on X highlight user excitement, with many praising the potential for seamless grocery automation amid rising food costs and time constraints. One viral thread discussed how such tech could alleviate the “mental load” of meal planning, drawing parallels to earlier innovations like Amazon’s Dash buttons.

Comparisons to rivals are inevitable. LG and Samsung have long dominated the smart fridge segment with features like door-in-door access and integrated screens, but GE’s barcode focus addresses a specific pain point: forgetting what’s inside. Mashable notes in its CES coverage that while Samsung’s models offer recipe apps and family calendars, they lack this inventory-scanning precision, which could give GE an edge in efficiency-driven markets.

From a business perspective, this launch aligns with GE Appliances’ strategy under Haier ownership to innovate in the premium segment. Sales data from recent years show smart appliances growing at a 15% annual rate, per industry reports, and GE aims to capture a slice by emphasizing practicality over flashy gimmicks. Insiders speculate that partnerships like Instacart could expand to other services, such as Amazon Fresh or local grocers, broadening appeal.

Challenges in Adoption and Privacy Concerns

Yet, no innovation is without hurdles. Early adopters might face compatibility issues, as the scanner relies on standard barcodes; unpackaged produce or bulk items could require manual entry via the app. Moreover, the always-on cameras raise privacy questions—GE assures users that footage is processed locally and not stored in the cloud, but skeptics point to past data breaches in smart home devices.

Cost remains a barrier; at $3,500, it’s a significant investment compared to basic models under $1,000. Tom’s Guide highlights in its review that while the tech justifies the price for high-income households, broader adoption might hinge on scaled-down versions or subsidies through energy-efficient incentives.

On the regulatory front, as smart devices proliferate, there’s increasing scrutiny over energy consumption and e-waste. GE’s model boasts Energy Star certification, but insiders worry about the environmental impact of embedded electronics that could shorten appliance lifespans.

Broader Implications for Kitchen Innovation

Looking ahead, this fridge exemplifies a shift toward predictive appliances that anticipate needs rather than merely respond. Drawing from X discussions, enthusiasts envision ecosystems where fridges integrate with robotic kitchens, like the CA-1 system in Germany that automates cooking, potentially creating fully autonomous home food management.

GE’s approach could influence supply chains, too. By aggregating user data (anonymized, per the company), manufacturers might gain insights into consumption trends, aiding inventory for retailers. GE Appliances’ press room emphasizes how this reduces the “grocery guesswork,” a sentiment echoed in business analyses predicting a $50 billion market for smart kitchen tech by 2030.

For developers and engineers, the open APIs hinted at in the launch could spur third-party apps, from dietary trackers to sustainability monitors, fostering an innovation ecosystem around the device.

Evolving Consumer Expectations and Future Horizons

Consumers today expect appliances to do more than preserve food—they want them to enhance lifestyles. GE’s fridge meets this by blending hardware with software, much like how smartphones evolved from calls to life hubs. Posts on X from tech influencers underscore this, with some comparing it to Amazon Go’s cashierless stores, where sensors automate transactions seamlessly.

Potential expansions include voice control via integrations with Alexa or Google Assistant, allowing verbal queries about inventory while cooking. BusinessWire details how the Kitchen Assistant evolves with over-the-air updates, ensuring the fridge improves post-purchase.

Ultimately, success will depend on user feedback. Pilot programs in select markets could refine features, addressing any glitches in barcode recognition or app usability.

Industry Ripple Effects and Strategic Insights

The ripple effects extend to competitors, who may accelerate their own scanner integrations. Samsung, for instance, has experimented with AI cameras, but GE’s patent could provide a temporary moat. Analysts predict this could boost GE’s market share in North America, where smart home adoption lags behind Asia.

From an investment standpoint, Haier’s backing positions GE to leverage global manufacturing for cost efficiencies. CNET explores how this tech might “change grocery shopping forever,” by making lists dynamic and context-aware.

In supply chain terms, automated reordering could stabilize demand for staples, benefiting producers and reducing waste across the board.

Pushing Boundaries in Home Automation

As kitchens become smarter, ethical considerations emerge. Who owns the data from your fridge? GE pledges transparency, but industry watchers call for stronger standards. X threads debate this, with some users excited about personalized nutrition advice, others wary of surveillance.

Future iterations might include scent sensors for spoilage detection or AR overlays via the tablet for virtual meal prep. Yahoo Finance reports on the launch’s stock impact, noting a bump in investor confidence.

For insiders, this fridge signals a maturation of IoT in homes, where devices don’t just connect—they collaborate to streamline life.

Refining the Vision for Tomorrow’s Kitchens

Refinement will come from real-world use. Beta testers report high accuracy in scanning, but edge cases like faded barcodes pose challenges. GE’s roadmap includes machine learning updates to handle such variances.

Broader adoption could influence urban planning, with smart fridges in apartments reducing trips to stores and easing traffic. Posts on X from urban dwellers highlight this appeal in dense cities.

In essence, GE’s innovation bridges the gap between convenience and intelligence, setting a new benchmark for what a refrigerator can achieve in the modern home.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-5438-1767550816.jpeg,N,,2026-01-04 14:13:14.936079

‍

History suggests the answer isn’t black and white.

‍

The S&P 500 climbed 16% in 2025, driven largely by AI heavyweights such as Nvidia, Alphabet, Broadcom, and Microsoft. At the same time, unease has been building over the massive sums Big Tech is pouring into AI infrastructure. Capital spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta is projected to jump 34% to about $440 billion combined over the next year, according to data.

‍

Beyond public markets, OpenAI has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure a staggering figure for a privately held company that has yet to turn a profit. Adding to investor concern is the circular nature of many of these arrangements, where funding and spending cycle between OpenAI and a small group of publicly traded tech giants.

‍

According to Brian Levitt, chief global market strategist at Invesco, periods of technological transformation have often been accompanied by excessive investment. He points to past revolutions such as railroads, electricity, and the internet as examples where capital poured in aggressively before demand fully materialized.

‍

“At some point, infrastructure spending can overshoot what the economy needs in the short term,” Levitt said. “But that doesn’t mean the railroads weren’t completed or that the internet didn’t ultimately reshape the world.”

‍

Still, with equity valuations inching higher and the S&P 500 logging its third consecutive year of double-digit gains, investor anxiety is understandable. Many are questioning how much upside remains and how severe the downside could be if AI fails to deliver on its promise. That risk is magnified by the fact that Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Broadcom, and Meta now make up nearly 30% of the S&P 500, meaning any sharp selloff in AI stocks would ripple through the broader market.

‍

“A bubble usually bursts in a bear market,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, who does not believe AI stocks are currently in a bubble. “And we don’t see a bear market on the horizon.”

‍

So how does today’s AI boom compare with past market bubbles?

‍

One way to assess whether the AI-fueled rally has moved too far, too fast is to compare it with historical bull markets. Research from Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett, examining 10 equity bubbles worldwide since 1900, found they lasted just over two and a half years on average and delivered gains of about 244% from trough to peak.

‍

By contrast, the current AI-driven advance is entering its third year. Since the end of 2022, the S&P 500 has risen 79%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has surged 130%.

‍

While the data doesn’t point to a definitive conclusion, Hartnett cautions against abandoning equities solely out of bubble fears. Historically, the final phase of a rally tends to be the strongest, and missing it can be costly. As a hedge, he suggests selectively adding cheaper value exposures, such as UK stocks or energy companies.

‍

Market Concentration

The S&P 500’s 10 largest companies now account for roughly 40% of the index a level of concentration not seen since the 1960s. That has unsettled some investors, including veteran strategist Ed Yardeni, who said in December that he no longer recommends overweighting technology stocks.

‍

Market historians note, however, that today’s concentration is not without precedent. Paul Marsh, a professor at London Business School who has studied 125 years of global market returns, points out that leading stocks held similar weightings in the 1930s and 1960s. In 1900, railroads made up 63% of U.S. market value, compared with about 37% tied to technology at the end of 2024.

‍

Fundamentals

Identifying bubbles in real time is notoriously difficult, largely because debates hinge on fundamentals and those metrics evolve, said Dario Perkins, an economist at TS Lombard.

‍

“It’s easy to argue that ‘this time is different’ and that traditional valuation measures no longer apply,” he said.

‍

Even so, some fundamentals still matter. Unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders generally carry lower debt relative to earnings than companies such as WorldCom did in the late 1990s. Moreover, firms like Nvidia and Meta are already reporting meaningful profit growth tied to AI, something that was largely absent during the speculative boom 25 years ago.

‍

That said, rising credit risk is making some investors uneasy. After Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds on Sept. 24, its stock fell 5.6% the following day and is down 37% since. Looking ahead, Meta, Alphabet, and Oracle are expected to raise a combined $86 billion in 2026, according to estimates from Société Générale.

‍

Valuations

By some measures, the S&P 500 is trading at its highest valuation ever outside of the early 2000s. Its cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio — developed by economist Robert Shiller and based on inflation-adjusted earnings over a decade — sits near historic extremes.

‍

Optimists counter that while valuations are rising, the pace is far more measured than during the dot-com bubble. In 2000, Cisco traded at more than 200 times trailing earnings. Nvidia, by comparison, trades at under 50 times earnings today.

‍

According to Janus Henderson fund manager Richard Clode, bubbles typically form when stock prices detach entirely from earnings growth. “We’re not at that point yet,” he said.

‍

Investor Scrutiny

Talk of an AI bubble simmered throughout the year but intensified in November and December following warnings from investor Michael Burry and the Bank of England. data shows more than 12,000 news stories mentioned “AI bubble” in November alone — roughly matching the total from the prior ten months combined.

‍

A December Bank of America survey found investors view an AI bubble as the market’s biggest “tail risk,” with more than half citing the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street’s most crowded trade.

‍

That environment contrasts with the dot-com era, when enthusiasm for the internet went largely unquestioned, said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays. Today, scrutiny is growing, particularly as companies ramp up borrowing to fund AI investments.

‍

“I wouldn’t dismiss the risks,” Krishna said. “But healthy skepticism is a good thing. That scrutiny may be exactly what prevents the kind of extreme excesses that lead to a crash.”

— Cat and Dog Lover

DEAR CAT AND DOG LOVER: That’s a timely question as the holiday season which began more than six weeks ago finally comes to a close after Jan. 6, the Feast of the Epiphany.

Feasting is the theme in the winter months, and given that many pets, particularly dogs do not get as much exercise when it’s cold out, monitoring your pet’s weight is key.

The rule of thumb for dogs and cats is that they should consume no more than 25 to 30 calories per pound per day. So a cat who weighs 10 pounds should be consuming no more than 300 calories a day.

Veterinarians recommend that treats compose no more than 10 percent of the total number of calories, so a 10-pound cat should have 270 calories of food, and no more than 30 calories a day in treats.

Many cat treats are 1 or 2 calories each and these should be given sparingly — never by the handful.

If your dog is 50 pounds, that’s around 1,400 calories per day with no more than 140 calories composed of treats.

Our dog gets a Pedigree Dentastix at the end of her day, which is 65 to 75 calories per stick. Just one however!

Vets in North America report obesity is one of the leading issues with pets they treat. And obesity can lead to a number of health problems including: osteo-arthritis and joint inflamation, cardiovascular and endocrine malfunction and metabolic abnormalities.

If your pet is heavy, they are more likely to have more health challenges and a shorter life.

Smaller dogs are more likely to be obese, with pugs topping the list.

So, how can you help your pet lose weight?

First, be a responsible pet owner from the day you adopt your pet. Know how much your pet weighs and read labels on food so you are not giving your pet more calories than they need.

Finally, do not substitute food and treats for attention and exercise. They’re not asking for a treat. They’re asking for you to pay attention to them.

Give them vigorous petting and show some love.

We asked our Be PAWSitive community how they handled weight gain in pets. Mary Flibbert of Worcester helped her 18-pound cat reduce to 14 pounds by eliminating treats and dry food.

“All I did was feed him all the canned food that he wanted,” she reports.

TheraPAWS Pet Team member Cap Corduan has Keifer, a Bernese mountain dog, which can be a very large dog.

Last December, Keifer weighed 130 pounds, and Cap knew she “had to get the weight off him for his health as well as to get the weight off his joints.”

By putting Keifer on weight management food and providing veggies as a snack he’s “now at the right weight of 115 pounds.

Two critical developments—a favorable court ruling in China and the U.S. launch of a next-generation product—are providing the foundation for what investors hope will be a sustained turnaround.

The company is taking strategic offensive action with the commercial rollout in the United States. After securing FDA approval late last year, Novo Nordisk has now begun selling an oral tablet version of its Wegovy treatment. This new format presents a significant competitive edge by eliminating the need for daily injections. Clinical trial data indicates it facilitates an average weight loss of 16.6 percent.

This launch grants the Danish firm a lead time estimated at two to three months before competing products, such as Eli Lilly's anticipated Orforglipron, are expected to enter the market. Priced aggressively at $149 per month, the oral Wegovy is positioned to target the broader consumer market.

Valuation Presents a Contrast to Competitive Pressures

The dramatic share price contraction over the past twelve months, which erased approximately 48 percent of the stock's value, has resulted in a fundamentally cheaper valuation. The equity closed the recent week at €44.61.

* The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio now stands near 14.15, well below its historical average of around 22.50.

* This valuation also sits at a discount to the broader healthcare sector average of 18.4.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Novo Nordisk?

Despite this apparent value, the competitive landscape remains intensely challenging. Rival Eli Lilly has recently captured market share at a faster pace with its product Zepbound. While Novo Nordisk reported growth of 12 percent in the third quarter of 2025, Lilly's revenue from Zepbound surged by 185 percent over the same period.

Legal Victory Strengthens Long-Term Position

A major catalyst for the current stabilization originates from Asia. China's Supreme People's Court has upheld the patent validity for the active ingredient semaglutide. This ruling is critical for Novo Nordisk as it fortifies the company's defensive ""moat"" against generic competition. Semaglutide forms the basis for the blockbuster drugs Wegovy and Ozempic; a loss of patent protection would have opened the door widely for copycat versions. Market analysts view this decision as a pivotal step toward securing long-term revenue in the crucial Chinese market.

For a durable reversal of fortune to take hold, the new oral medications must now rapidly generate measurable sales. Investor attention in the coming weeks will be squarely fixed on the execution of the U.S. launch and the first-quarter sales figures. Although the clarified patent situation and depressed valuation provide a base, the ultimate success of the new tablet will determine whether the prolonged downtrend has truly been broken.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2422333_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 11:59:56.716653

A Disney actor turned animator turned game developer has just shared one of her favourite pieces of technical advice for achieving fluid animation, and it's a point she says is often overlooked (you might also want to make sure you're familiar with the Pixar rules of storytelling).

Libby Peterson is a former Disney and Pixar animator who worked on movies such as Lilo & Stitch. Stylised keyframe animation is her specialty. She's now working at Lucasfilm’s Industrial Light & Magic while also developing a K-Pop souls-like indie game in her spare time.

In the video above, she uses a character from her game to demonstrate the importance of extremes in animation. She says many people make the mistake of only focusing on key storytelling poses and breakdown poses, not on extreme poses.

An extreme pose is the furthest point that any part of a character's body touches. In a jump, for example, it would be the highest point the body reaches.

Libby points out that extreme poses naturally incorporate two of the 12 Disney principles of animation: arcs for natural-looking movement, and offset and drag to convey the impression of weight and mass.

""Focusing on your extremes and making sure each axis in both translations and rotation hits its extreme on different frames is what makes animation fluid,"" Libby says ""Also make sure the extremes of different parts of the body hit on different frames as well. Essentially this is how I think and approach animating drag and follow through and create arcs.""

It's vital to focus on individual rotations and forward and left to right movement and making sure they don't hit on the same frame, Libby says, otherwise, you get triangular janky movement.

The focus on extremes applies both to a pose-to-pose or a layered workflow, although Libby says it was when she was animating layered that the importance of extremes really clicked because animating one muscle mass at a time forces you to think about extreme poses and energy.

She recommends studying video reference to see where extremes naturally occur and then exaggerate them as needed for the desired animation style.

That could soon change.

The first drug discovered and designed using AI, Insilico Medicine’s Rentosertib, is likely to enter a Phase 3 clinical trial in the next 18 months, the final stage before seeking FDA approval. And it will reach that milestone in record time.

In the meantime, the coming year is sure to see a stepped-up pace of AI investments, deals, and partnerships by Big Pharma, venture capital firms, and biotech startups. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is investing more than $100 million of his own money in AI-based drug startups.

As a result, Precedence Research estimates that the global drug industry’s investment in AI will reach $2.51 billion in 2026 and $16.49 billion by 2034.

Fading into the background is the skepticism often heard at the start of 2025 about AI’s ability to have a significant impact on drug R&D. “We are really seeing AI being used across the board now,” said Samuel Scarpino, director of AI + life sciences at Northeastern University and an advisor to many biotech startups. “I don’t think we can point to a clear winner yet… but it is definitely producing a lot of value,” he said.

Pharma giant Eli Lilly is one of the industry’s leaders in adopting AI. In October, the company announced a partnership with Nvidia to build a powerful supercomputer to run an ""AI factory,"" powered by more than 1,000 super-powerful chips, which will be used to discover and test millions of potential medicines.

Lilly also just signed a deal with Insilico Medicine, potentially worth $100 million, to use the startup’s AI platform to jointly identify and develop new therapies. Diogo Rau, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer of Lilly. says the company is encouraging every employee to incorporate AI into their work. ""I don't believe any other company in our industry is doing what we do at this scale,” he said.

Rau does acknowledge that “there is still a ton of hype out there,” but predicted that an AI-discovered drug could reach the market by 2030. “AI is doing very, very well at discovering new molecules” that can be turned into drugs, he says.

The end of the decade may seem like a lengthy timeline, except that it typically takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new drug, at a cost of $2 billion and up. Just getting to the point where a drug can be tested in humans can take a minimum of 4 to 5 years, and nine out of 10 drug candidates never make it that far.

That’s why there is so much interest in Insilico’s Rentosertib — it went into human trials in less than two years, a blistering pace for the industry.

Insilico, based in Boston and Hong Kong, was founded in 2014 by Alex Zhavoronkov to take advantage of an AI platform he co-developed to replace animal testing. Rentosertib is its first drug candidate, a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic and deadly lung disease with no known cure that kills about 40,000 people each year in the United States.

In June, the company announced that Rentosertib improved lung function with few side effects in a phase II study of 71 patients, clearing the way to start a larger phase III trial. Though the drug could still fail, “I don’t want to play down this accomplishment,” says Northeastern’s Scarpino. “The typical time frame for drug development has been dramatically shortened. This could be a game changer.”

Venture capital investors are betting on such an outcome. According to a November Pitchbook report, VCs invested a total of $2.7 billion in AI drug development firms through the first three quarters of 2025, even while overall investment in biotech startups slowed. The funding difference illustrates the “frenzied AI investment environment and investor conviction in the ability of AI integration to drive greater R&D efficiency,” PitchBook said in its report.

Although drug researchers have been using early forms of AI for decades, excitement over the technology’s ability to speed R&D came with the introduction in 2020 of AlphaFold2, an artificial intelligence system developed by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs that made it possible to predict the three dimensional structure of some 200 million biological molecules. It’s creators were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024, and the model has been used by more than 2 million people from 190 countries.

Lilly’s Rau cautions that AI is a long way from replacing researchers, although it will shift the roles humans will play. And it has a limited role to play in human trials. “We are still limited on how long it takes the biology to work.” he said. “The clinical trials will still take years and years.”

Nevertheless, a recent survey of people working in biopharma by Endpoints Signal, a division of the Financial Times, found that 48% of respondents describe themselves as heavy AI users. And though only 15% of those surveyed said AI is doing transformative work in research and development today, three-quarters expect AI to transform the drug discovery process by 2030; 12% think the change will come as soon as three years.

One of the biggest proponents of AI in drug R&D is Altman; the OpenAI CEO invested $180 million three years ago to seed Retro Bio, which is partnering with OpenAI to develop drugs that can ""reverse age-related diseases."" Keeping with Silicon Valley's longevity fixation, Retro’s ambitious goal is to add a decade to the lifespan of healthy humans.

Retro is currently in the process of raising a $1 billion round of funding. The company is also about to start the first human trial for an Alzheimer’s drug it developed, in Australia.

OpenAI is also backing Chai Discovery, founded a year ago, that completed a funding round of $130 million in December, doubling its valuation to $1.3 billion. The company said its AI models are already generating drug-like molecules with high success rates, “Looking back over the last five to 10 years, there’s been so much hype on AI for drug discovery,” co-founder and CEO Josh Meier told Bloomberg. “This is the year things started working.”","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2189638602.jpg",N,,2026-01-04 09:03:17.298064

It's been a year since Bristol Live announced that the 'biggest change to Bristol' is coming - the biggest since the aftermath of the Second World War - and most people don’t know too much about it. But is the transformation of Bristol under way already, and what has happened in the past year?

The change involves a huge swathe of the city, from St Pauls, across the M32 to St Jude’s, Lawrence Hill, St Phillips, Temple Meads and around to Bedminster, is on the cusp of being transformed so much, it will be unrecognisable to Bristolians in just five years’ time. That area forms an inner city arc of industry that's clearly visible from space, in between the city centre and the Victorian terraces of the residential city beyond.

And the transformation raises huge questions which are so far going largely unanswered about where people in a city like Bristol work, what kind of jobs they have, where they live and what kind of homes they have? The transformation has its origins in decisions taken ten or more years ago, and is already starting to get underway.

Most of Bristol already know that major change is coming to the city centre - with Broadmead, the Bearpit and the Galleries seeing a huge amount of development heading its way in the next few years. But this is even bigger than that, will affect more people, a larger area and have even more impact.

After the war, those in charge of rebuilding a bombed-out city took the opportunity for a complete change. The tightly-packed terraced streets that ringed the east and south east of the city centre were cleared away, the residents were generally sent to live in new communities of council estates on the outskirts of the city, and a new Bristol was born - a network of dual carriageways and huge roundabouts, industrial estates, warehouses and factories ringed the city centre.

This was city planning on a grand scale. The idea was that people would live in nicer, modern homes with gardens in places like Hillfields or Knowle, and commute in to work in the industry of Bristol’s inner core, in the factories of Bedminster’s Malago Road, the heavy industry of St Philips Marsh or Lawrence Hill and the industrial estates of St Jude’s.

It was a vision that has lasted about 60 years - until now. For now, the post-war inner city industrial estates are being, or about to be, swept away even more quickly than they were created. Every other week during 2024 and 2025 seemed to see a new major planning application trouble the city council’s planning department, or a new consultation launched by a large-scale developer. Where is this happening - the list is a long one. Let's start at the northern tip of this inner city industrial arc.

St Pauls

In St Pauls, an entire area of the city from St Nicholas Road to Portland Square was originally terraced homes, and schools. Victorian maps show long-lost terraced streets with forgotten names - Lake Street, Cabot Street, St Lawrence Street. They were cleared and factories built close to the M32 motorway. Now, that industrial area has gone too, and plans for hundreds of new homes to fill in the gaps have been proposed for a long time.

St Judes

On the other side of the River Frome and the great divide created by the M32, St Jude’s is about to change fast. St Judes has long been a warren of warehouses, factories and storage yards, ever since the post-war planners cleared the terraced slums and replaced them with low-rise industrial buildings.

But there’s now a plan agreed by the council for it to be transformed again, into something called the Frome Gateway. No sooner had the ink dried on the first draft than the developers were in, submitting planning applications for student flats and build-to-rent flats, a new bridge across the River Frome and the creation of a ‘vibrant’ new residential area.

That regeneration is now edging right up to the city centre itself - the owners of Cabot Circus unveiled plans for hundreds of student flats to be built between the shopping centre car park and the Newfoundland Way junction, earlier this year.

Lawrence Hill

Many of Lawrence Hill and Barton Hill’s terraced streets remained after the war, and those that were cleared were replaced by the vast 1960s council tower blocks that dominate the skyline here. Industry in the area was centred up and down the railway line, and dominated by the Bristol Wagon Works at the turn of the 20th century, which became the industrial estates that separate Lawrence Hill from Easton Road.

It’s early days for this, but there are proposals for thousands of new homes to be built on either side of the railway line to create a new part of Lawrence Hill.

St Phillips

Viewed from the air, St Philips is easily recognisable for the huge roofs of its warehouses and industrial units. It was always a tough place to live, with long lost Victorian terraced streets like Edward Street and Chapel Street bumping up against the rail yards, goods sheds and gas works. Between the railway and the Feeder, the people of the Dings have long been used to being surrounded by iron works and heavy industry.

But in the next ten years, St Philips is set to be radically transformed. It’s already happening the closer you get to Temple Meads station. If you want a vision of what this new long inner city arc of Bristol will be like in ten or 15 years’ time, take a stroll down Avon Street, where this transformation is nearing completion - a canyon of blocks of flats and student accommodation either side of a wide-pavemented road.

READ MORE: More than 20,000 extra student beds needed to cope with Bristol's expanding universitiesREAD MORE: Transformation of iconic Bristol canal gets underway with 706 student flats

St Philips is part of the Temple Quarter regeneration scheme, a vast billion-pound project to replace the industrial landscape from Avonmeads to Temple Meads. Along the waterfront, and in pockets near Oxford Street it’s already happening, with student flats and a new university campus being created before the very eyes of the daily commuters into Temple Meads station.

And 2025 saw a major first step forward for this transformation - which is coming in the next ten years. The city council and the Temple Quarter bosses gave a first outline of what the area could look like, and consulted on different ways it will be shaped.

That feedback returned said one of Bristol's most iconic roads - Feeder Road, the long straight road on the south bank of the Feeder Canal - should one day be pedestrianised, as people rather than industry and car dealerships, live along it.

2025 saw some progress too on the north side of the Feeder. A couple of huge new student accommodation complexes neared completion, ready for the grand opening of Bristol University's new campus in September 2026. And work finally got underway to build the new Oasis Academy Temple Quarter secondary school.

East Bedminster

Across the river and further along the railway, there was once an area of Bedminster rich in history. Terraced streets called things like Weare Street, York Street, Nicholas Street and King Street were home for thousands of people, penned in by the railway line and the Totterdown and Victoria Park hill side to the south, the river to the north and surround by tanneries and the big Pylle Hill Goods Depot. It was out of these Victorian two-up-two-downs that Hillary Clinton’s great-grandfather grew up and eventually emigrated.

He started life on a terraced street that was cleared away by the Luftwaffe and the post-war slum clearers which, prophetically, was near Whitehouse Street. And this entire area was transformed in the 1960s into light industrial estates full of bodyshops, garages, automotive firms, printers and food manufacturers.

READ MORE: First plans unveiled for new Bristol suburb between Bedminster and TotterdownREAD MORE: Tallest building in South Bristol's history proposed in front of Victoria Park

Now, it’s set to be transformed again. Two separate ‘development frameworks’ - one for the land to the east of St Luke’s Road and the other for the land to the west over to Bedminster Parade - have been developed, and the first plans for these sites are already being proposed. Nothing has started to be built yet, but it won’t be long.

Bedminster Green

At the southern end of Whitehouse Street is Whitehouse Lane, and another arm of industrial land that runs right into the heart of Bedminster, along the railway line. Either side of Malago Road, build-to-rent flats up to 16 storeys tall, and vast student accommodation complexes housing 819 students have already been built, and work on the second major student accommodation complex has now started. Even further south into Bedminster, empty builders' yards, car dealerships and now an empty printworks have or are proposed to be transformed into more flats or student accommodation.

Is the transformation stalling already?

Many aspects of this transformation of Bristol's 'inner-city industrial arc' are going ahead right on schedule and as planned. Where there is an economic driver in place, things are progressing rapidly. The opening of Bristol University's new Temple Quarter campus is prompting many Purpose Built Student Accommodation developments, both in the immediate area around St Philips and Temple Quarter, but also in the city centre and in Bedminster.

But 2025 saw something of a hiccup for the first time since the Covid pandemic, to the relentless march of Build-to-Rent flats and blocks of shared housing - prompted by a number of challenges facing the building industry.

The first is that new fire safety regulations state that any new residential building over 18m tall has to have two staircases - a legacy of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. That has seen developers go back to the drawing board with their plans for developments with more than seven or eight storeys - which almost all of them are.

READ MORE: Developers behind two tower blocks overlooking River Avon want to reduce affordable homes numberREAD MORE: There's already a row over plan for tallest building in South Bristol's history

And that has, the developers say, hit viability. If you have to include another staircase, that's less space for flats. Staircases don't pay rent but the lost 20 flats would. Then, there's the other regulations brought in as part of the Grenfell Tragedy changes. Many Bristol developments have become mired in bureaucracy and, with the costs of building spiralling, affordability issues.

Bristol's inner-city arc is full of developments that have been given planning permission, but have not seen any work - yet. One of the most high profile is the former Robins & Day Peugeot dealership, on the corner of the Bath Road Bridge roundabout opposite Temple Meads station. Across the river, something remarkable happened in 2025 to further highlight the stalling progress of the Bristol building boom.

A huge industrial estate, which Bristol City Council had drawn up plans to allow 900 flats to be built on, right in front of the famous Totterdown hillside, went up for sale. But developers wanting to get stuck into building those 900 flats to create the new 'Mead Street Framework' plan for flats within walking distance of Temple Meads and the new university, found themselves out-bid at auction by a landowner whose business is owning industrial estates.

Facing increased costs of building 900 flats, the residential developers couldn't commit to spending as much up front as the firm that wanted to keep it - for now, at least - as an industrial estate, with guaranteed rents and leases from the businesses already there. The Mead Street Regeneration part of the inner-city arc is currently on hold.

What kind of new homes are being created?

The Victorian expansion of Bristol that created the inner city from St Pauls to Bedminster ended up being the slums of the early 20th century. These were overcrowded shared terraced housing with outside loos, no bathrooms and often large families on just one floor or, worse, in one room. They were pulled down from the 1930s, bombed in the 1940s and cleared completely in the 1950s, to be replaced by the light industrial estates of the 1960s and 70s of factories and warehouses.

The new vision of housing back in the 1930s was places like Knowle, Sea Mills and Southmead - large, well-built homes with big gardens, bathrooms and central heating, followed by the likes of Hartcliffe, Lockleaze, Hillfields, Withywood, Broomhill and Lawrence Weston in the 1950s and 60s.

The third wave of Bristol’s housing boom will be neither of these, and it will be very different again. Instead of houses the boom of the 2020s and 2030s will be almost entirely flats - in blocks of between six and ten storeys and towers of up to 16, 17, maybe even 20 or 22 storeys high.

Instead of homes to buy with a mortgage, they will be almost entirely ‘build to rent’, providing an all-in-one package where everything from internet connection to water supply is covered by the rent.

The ‘build-to-rent’ phenomenon sees the developers building the blocks of flats also then continue to own them, collecting rent and dealing with maintenance of the shared areas. In the Bristol of the future, tens of thousands of people will live in ‘serviced apartment buildings’, where the level of service depends on the level of rent.

As well as ‘build-to-rent’, the new explosion of building also includes purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) and ‘Co-living’, although so far that’s a mode of housing that has so far been confined to developments in the city centre. Co-living is basically the same as ‘Build-to-Rent ’, but in shared flats that feel more like student accommodation.

The young Bristol resident of the second half of the 2020s and into the 2030s and beyond, will see the dream of buying their own home in the city go further and further away.

The PBSA and BtR combination leaves little scope for what is classed in planning terms as ‘affordable housing’. This could be anything from shared ownership to homes sold at a discount to teachers, nurses, paramedics or police officers, but in almost all cases it has been and will continue to be homes at a discounted rent.

That discount could be around 80 per cent of the rent charged on the open market, so-called ‘affordable rent’, or it could be ‘social rent’, which is normally much lower. In both cases, rented ‘affordable homes’ are taken on by a housing association and let to people on Bristol’s HomeChoice waiting list and bidding system.

How many of the new homes of Bristol’s third wave will be classed as ‘affordable’ has been a contentious issue. One of the first things Marvin Rees did as Mayor of Bristol - alongside scrapping rules which limited the height of buildings that could be built in the city - was to water down the requirements for developers to include affordable housing in their projects.

It was - and still, in theory at least, is - 40 per cent affordable homes in the city centre and 30 per cent outside the city centre. The developers told the Mayor and council chiefs that was a block to building more - the developers weren’t making enough profit to able to write off 30 or 40 per cent of their homes at a discount to a housing association.

A new bit of planning guidance in 2017 dropped that to 20 per cent, if the developers met certain criteria, and the developers have found this more favourable. At the time, the then Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said Bristol couldn't let 'the perfect be the enemy of the good', arguing that 20 per cent of something was better than 30 or 40 per cent of nothing. Now, pretty much most projects to redevelop Bristol’s industrial arc have 20 per cent affordable as standard - apart from student accommodation, where it’s not required at all.

So the new homes of the third Bristol boom will be flats in tower blocks, not houses in gardens; rented from a private development company, not bought with a mortgage and, in most cases, at the top end of rented accommodation in the city.

What will the impact be?

The most immediate and obvious impact is that tens of thousands of new homes will be created. What, if any, effect building thousands of new homes, albeit one and two-bed flats and student accommodation, will have on Bristol’s much lamented housing crisis has been and will increasingly be the subject of strong debate.

Those advocating for the shackles to come off the planning process and the widespread building of new homes - the self-styled YIMBYs - say building thousands of new homes will see rents and house prices fall for everyone else too. They also point to the building of densely-packed new homes on brownfield sites in cities as something which could take the pressure off the edge of town greenfield sites that environmentalists and those labelled NIMBYs are desperate to protect.

There are doubts however. Rents have continued to spiral upwards in Bristol despite the much-celebrated 12,534 new homes built in the period Marvin Rees was in office as Mayor. The price of buying a home, which spiralled in the 2010s, might have stopped spiralling, but is still out of reach of most young people, who struggle to find the rent each month let alone save for a deposit.

As stated, these will be almost entirely privately rented, or ‘Co-Living’ or student accommodation, so the idea that the third great transformation of Bristol will help the other aspect of the housing crisis - the people on the council’s housing waiting list - appears doubtful too.

With just 20 per cent of the build to rent homes - not including the student accommodation - classed as ‘affordable’, that is 2,000 new ‘council homes’ for every 10,000 new homes built in Bristol’s industrial ‘inner arc’. The city would have to built 100,000 to find a home for everyone currently on the waiting list - and that’s not including the people who need new council flats in the coming years as the first generation of 1950s and 60s tower blocks are almost certainly and eventually condemned.

The effects on jobs

The first industrial sites to be earmarked for the great transformation have tended to be empty factories and industrial units, but increasingly, the developers are coming for places where there are perfectly healthy businesses and jobs. These are businesses often on - at most - five year leases, but many have one or two year leases or break clauses. Companies do get notice, and often have contingency plans.

In Fishponds, the huge Graphic Packaging International site is set to be transformed into as many as 2,500 new homes after the firm itself decided to up sticks and move to a new site in Yate. On the banks of the river in Bedminster, the BART Spices factory, which delighted the nostrils of the people of Totterdown or Redcliffe depending on the wind that day, shipped off to Avonmouth, leaving their site for developers.",https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/article9829278.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Inner-industrial-arc.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 11:02:04.750291

Facing an astonishing projected cash hole of $17 billion and a fierce counterattack from Google's Gemini, Altman was forced to activate the ""Code Red."" On one hand, there is an unprecedented financing plan of hundreds of billions of dollars; on the other hand, there is a financial crisis with the inference cost exceeding the revenue. Is this the inevitable path to AGI, or is it the eve of the bursting of the biggest bubble in Silicon Valley?

Under the spotlight of Silicon Valley, Altman is riding a unicycle while juggling more and more balls.

The picture is generated by Nano Banana Pro.

For the helmsman of OpenAI, merely creating an all - knowing chatbot seems to be too conservative.

To keep the investors waving their checks and the audience excited, he has to continuously come up with new concepts: self - developed chips, e - commerce integration, corporate consulting, and even consumer - grade hardware designed by Jony Ive.

However, the admission fee for this show is becoming astonishing.

In 2026, for the fastest - growing unicorn in history, it is destined to be a thrilling ""match point.""

According to leaked financial forecasts, OpenAI is expected to burn through $17 billion in cash in 2026, up from $9 billion in 2025.

What's even more alarming is that this loss trend is expected not to converge but to continue to accumulate in the next three years.

This is like a game of Russian roulette with cash flow.

The Appetite of the Money - Guzzler

Since ChatGPT burst onto the scene at the end of 2022, OpenAI has raised more than $60 billion from investors, setting a record for private companies.

But Altman's appetite is far from satisfied.

According to a core source, OpenAI is planning a new round of financing in 2026, targeting a whopping $100 billion, which could push the company's valuation to an astonishing $830 billion.

In comparison, its valuation was around $500 billion in October 2025.

The list of potential major investors in this round is star - studded and complex: Amazon is in talks to invest $10 billion, even though it is Microsoft's arch - rival in the cloud; Nvidia has also hinted that it may invest $100 billion in batches, of course, on the condition that the money will eventually flow back to Jensen Huang's pocket to buy graphics cards.

Behind this unprecedented financing frenzy is equally unprecedented growth and consumption.

In 2025, OpenAI's revenue was reported to have reached $13 billion, and the annualized rate at the end of the year was heading towards $20 billion.

It took Google and Facebook five and six years respectively to reach this milestone, while OpenAI achieved it in just two years.

But the concern is that there is a tight ""chain reaction"" between OpenAI's revenue growth and computing power costs.

The company's computing power demand has soared from 200 megawatts in 2023 to 1.9 gigawatts (GW) in 2025.

To satisfy its future ambitions, OpenAI has even signed a letter of intent to increase its computing power capacity by 30 gigawatts in the next few years, with a bill as high as $1.4 trillion.

As a venture capital tycoon said, asking about the ""burn rate"" has even become a taboo at the financing negotiation table.

The leaked data depicts a terrifying future: by 2029, OpenAI may have burned through a cumulative $115 billion.

When asked by long - time supporter Brad Gerstner how to fill the funding gap equivalent to 100 times the 2025 revenue, Altman responded with his characteristic toughness: ""If you want to sell your shares, I'll help you find a buyer.""

The Crocodiles in the Moat

The reason Altman must maintain this high - intensity expansion is that the crocodiles outside the moat have come ashore.

Although Altman insists that the marginal cost of model training will decrease as the scale expands, the reality is that competition is forcing costs to spiral upwards.

Benchmark tests by Stanford's HAI Institute show that the performance gap between top - tier models is rapidly narrowing.

The Gemini 3 model released by Google in November has outperformed OpenAI's GPT - 5.1 in multiple indicators.

Although OpenAI quickly countered with GPT - 5.2, this counterattack was far from a decisive blow.

Meanwhile, open - source models are also closing in step by step. Like a pack of wolves, they are tearing at the territory of closed - source models.

This pressure has been transmitted to user data. Sensor Tower's monitoring shows that as of mid - December, ChatGPT had 910 million monthly active users, still far ahead of Gemini's 345 million, but the growth engine seems to be stalling.

A study by Deutsche Bank points out that in major European countries, ChatGPT's consumer subscriptions stagnated in the summer.

Realizing the crisis, Altman launched the ""Code Red"" operation in early December, suspending miscellaneous items and focusing on shoring up ChatGPT's moat.

What worries the management even more is that according to leaked Microsoft data, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI's inference costs (i.e., the cost of running the model to answer user questions) actually exceeded its revenue.

In other words, the more users use it, the faster the company loses money.

Performing or Selling Out

To fill the huge financial hole, OpenAI is becoming more and more like the traditional tech giants it once tried to disrupt.

That once - pure AI laboratory is now bowing to ""advertisers.""

Although the ""Code Red"" temporarily shelved the advertising project, insiders confirmed that advertising will definitely be implanted in ChatGPT in 2026.

Through partnerships with Etsy and Walmart, it is trying to turn the chat box into a cash register.

Meanwhile, OpenAI has started learning ""vertical integration"" from Google.

In addition to collaborating with Broadcom to develop custom chips to reduce dependence on Nvidia, Altman is also trying to replicate Android's channel success by collaborating with Jony Ive to develop consumer - grade hardware, attempting to open up new traffic entrances outside of the iPhone.

On the enterprise side, OpenAI has established a large consulting department and launched tools such as AgentKit, trying to poach more sticky enterprise customers from competitor Anthropic.

Although the consumer business is still the mainstay at present, the proportion of revenue from the B - side is rising.

Bubble or Singularity?

Is OpenAI now the inevitable path to super - intelligence, or is it another WeWork on the verge of bursting due to over - expansion?

A venture capital director who invests in a competitor unceremoniously compared it to a ""steroid - pumped WeWork,"" implying that it could collapse at any time under huge debt and unrealistic growth expectations.

If enterprise - level sales fall short of expectations and ChatGPT fails to find more efficient monetization channels, this multi - billion - dollar empire could quickly disintegrate.

Currently, the capital market has started to vote with its feet, and listed companies deeply tied to OpenAI have been punished in both the stock and bond markets.

But in the primary market, the madness continues.

Altman once said in an interview that one of the reasons he wants to take OpenAI public is to see the short - sellers get crushed. ""I'd love to see them burned.""

This most - watched tightrope walker in 2026 still believes he can reach the other side.

For onlookers, this big show is about to reach its climax in 2026.

In an era where computing power is regarded as a belief, so - called valuation is just the ticket people pay for ""believing in the future.""

And the promise of AGI is like the Golden Fleece hanging on the edge of a cliff, tempting the Iasons to take a desperate leap before being reduced to ashes.

This decline coincided with the implementation of a sweeping price increase across its product portfolio, leaving market participants to question the potential impact on customer loyalty.

Amidst the pricing strategy shift, the company is advancing its hybrid AI platform. Since early December, the Mistral Large 3 language model, featuring 41 billion parameters, has been integrated into the watsonx environment. This allows enterprise clients to utilize external models alongside IBM's own Granite systems, a move designed to offer flexibility.

In a more significant strategic play, IBM has announced plans to acquire Confluent for $11 billion. The deal, targeted for completion in mid-2026, aims to secure dominance in real-time data streaming technology, a foundational element for generative AI applications. This combination of aggressive pricing and strategic M&A underscores a clear corporate focus on high-margin business segments.

Widespread Price Adjustments Take Effect

Effective January 1, IBM instituted an average price increase of six percent for a broad range of software and hardware. Affected products include Passport Advantage licenses, monthly IBM Z subscriptions, and storage systems. Certain cloud services and legacy support for Power hardware saw even steeper hikes of up to ten percent. Furthermore, basic support for cloud offerings, previously included, is now a paid add-on.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Company management frames the increases as a necessary response to inflationary pressures and a measure to stabilize revenue per customer. However, the skeptical market reaction suggests concerns that this aggressive pricing may backfire. With many corporations currently scrutinizing IT budgets, cost-sensitive enterprise clients may be prompted to consider alternative providers.

Insider Transactions Signal Board Confidence

SEC filings disclosed late Friday indicate sustained confidence within IBM's boardroom. Three directors—Michael Miebach, Frederick H. Waddell, and Thomas Buberl—received shares on December 31 as part of their deferred compensation programs. These transactions directly align the board members' financial interests with the company's long-term stock performance.

All Eyes on the Forthcoming Earnings Report

The market awaits crucial answers from IBM's fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for January 28, 2026. This disclosure is expected to provide management's assessment of the revenue implications from the Confluent acquisition and, more immediately, reveal early customer reactions to the new pricing structure. From a technical analysis perspective, the stock is currently testing the psychologically significant $290 support level. A sustained break below this point could place additional downward pressure on its 50-day moving average.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2422414_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:58:27.342302

""They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season,"" Gary Wassner, Hilldun's CEO, told Business Insider.
""Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future,"" a spokesperson for Saks Global told Business Insider.
""Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it.""
As things stand today, that's at risk, Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada, told Business Insider.","From the outside, Saks Fifth Avenue — the century-old department store in Manhattan — is literally glowing, its façade decorated with thousands of glittering lights as part of its annual holiday display.

The shine, however, masks a retailer under pressure. On Friday, Saks named a new CEO, capping a tumultuous 12 months for the heavily leveraged department store owner. After months of restructurings, lawsuits, missed payments, and broken promises, Saks Global is now facing the possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

What happens next could have consequences for customers. Brands — some of which haven't been paid in full for over a year — have paused shipments to Saks' stores, and creditors are awaiting news of its financial future.

In early December, Hilldun Corp., which acts as a sort of guarantor or insurer for brands, said it would no longer back shipments to Saks. The firm represents about 140 brands that sell to Saks — in the past, it's worked with big names like Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, and A.L.C. — and supplies the retailer with at least $500 million worth of product annually.

Hilldun's delay was expected to be short-lived, but shipments were still on hold as 2025 came to a close amid growing reports that Saks Global, which also owns Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, was considering a court-supervised reorganization.

""They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season,"" Gary Wassner, Hilldun's CEO, told Business Insider. ""Every order is on hold until Saks clarifies to the industry what they intend to do.""

Saks itself hasn't negated the bankruptcy talk.

""Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future,"" a spokesperson for Saks Global told Business Insider. ""Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it.""

To succeed, Saks' stores must not only resolve their debt issues, but continue to offer the assortment of luxury clothing, shoes, handbags, and beauty products that have long made its stores shopping paradises.

As things stand today, that's at risk, Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada, told Business Insider. ""They aren't going to have goods on the shelf, certainly not new goods. This is a house of cards — from a financial point of view, from a merchandising point of view, from a customer profile point of view.""

A match made in luxury hell

2025 was supposed to be a great year for Saks.

For more than a decade, the retailer, with its large physical footprint, had struggled to maintain its dominance as shopping patterns shifted, with customers turning to e-commerce or brand-owned outlets. It wasn't alone: Nordstrom was treading water before it was taken private, and Macy's has endured a drawn-out turnaround plan.

Its problems intensified following the pandemic, when inflation and economic uncertainty curbed discretionary spending. By 2023, it began to face challenges in paying vendors.

Then, at the end of 2024, Saks finalized its $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group, forming a luxury behemoth backed by the technology of Salesforce and Amazon, which took stakes in the new company as part of the deal. The move was seen as a solution to the beleaguered retailer's problems.

""It was touch-and-go up until the Neiman Marcus deal occurred,"" Wassner said. ""Everyone thought that would solve the cash flow problems.""

But the execution was messy.

The deal was financed by $2.2 billion worth of junk bonds — debt that carries high interest rates — which S&P Global called ""unsustainable."" It left the company strapped for cash, leading to a round of layoffs to start the year (multiple more would follow).

One of the first red flags for Saks arose on Valentine's Day, when vendors, who Wassner estimates are owed hundreds of millions, received an I-love-you-not from then-Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick.

He told them that they'd have to wait. Saks would pay its overdue bills — in some cases, more than a year past due — in installments stretched over 12 months that wouldn't begin until summer.

Vendors, some of whom were burned by similar communications prior to the 2019 bankruptcy of the iconic department store Barney's, were left between a rock and a hard place.

One vendor, who said he is owed six figures, called the situation ""agony.""

""We thought it was going to be a smoother transition and that this was going to be a global luxury masterpiece in the making,"" the person said. ""That just did not happen.""

Brands could withhold inventory shipments — which would risk ruining relationships with a core customer and put more strain on Saks' balance sheet — or continue business as usual and hope for the best.

Those who chose the latter were further disappointed in July, when the payment schedule wasn't met.

That month, Saks' financial vulnerability was made clear when a nine-figure interest payment prompted a debt restructuring. A majority of bondholders agreed to provide cash in return for being moved up on the retailer's cap table. Basically, meaning that if (or when) Saks files for bankruptcy, those bondholders get first dibs — likely before any vendors.

""I will say the biggest part of it has been the mental cruelty of this situation, waking up, not knowing what's going to happen, trying to keep things going,"" the vendor who spoke to Business Insider said.

A looming spring season

In the fall, things had dissolved to the point that several labels were withholding inventory.

S&P analysts wrote that Saks had a ""less-than-adequate in-stock inventory position."" In October, the company lowered its earnings guidance for the year, blaming inventory challenges.

""You are going to ship to somebody you know you're going to get paid from,"" Tim Hynes, the global head of credit research at Debtwire, told Business Insider. ""You will give Saks what's left, you're not going to give them the best.""

Some brands went even further, taking direct aim at Saks.

Skincare brand Sunday Riley said it threatened to sue if payments were not made, Retail Dive reported in August.

In October, Jovani Fashion, the dressmaker made famous by ""Real Housewives of New York"" star Luann de Lesseps, filed a lawsuit against Saks Global — a rare step in a relationship-driven industry. Jovani said Saks owed $295,651 for merchandise it accepted this year. (Saks has denied wrongdoing.)

By the end of the year, murmurs of a potential bankruptcy filing made headlines. They intensified on the last day of the year, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Saks had missed a nine-figure interest payment, according to people familiar with it.

""It's time to solve the problems one way or another,"" Wassner said.

Bankruptcy isn't the only option. The company has billions of dollars in real estate that it can sell — it recently sold the land beneath its Beverly Hills location — and can close down unproductive stores, as it did with several Saks Off 5th locations and has floated doing with the Neiman Marcus in Dallas. The retailer's store names still hold cultural cache, and deep-pocketed investors could step in to enhance the shopping experience.

Cohen, the former Sears exec, doesn't expect Saks to close Bergdorf's or that famous Fifth Avenue location anytime soon, but there's still a long road ahead.

""They're not getting merchandise freely. They've had enormous upheaval in management. The luxury business, generally speaking, is not robust at the moment, and we're going into a year, 2026, which has all the makings of an honest-to- god recession,"" he said. ""Is there sunshine here? I don't think so.""

Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO of Intel, said in a recent interview that quantum computing will become popular within two years and accelerate the bursting of the AI bubble, and will completely replace GPUs before 2030. In his view, quantum computing, classical computing, and AI computing will together form the ""holy trinity"" of the future computing world.

On December 9th, QuantWare, a quantum hardware startup, officially released a new quantum processor (QPU) expansion architecture, VIO - 40K, and plans to achieve mass production of quantum chips in 2026. At its headquarters in Delft, the Netherlands, the company is actively building Kilofab - the world's largest and first wafer fab dedicated to quantum chip production. It is reported that this will increase its production capacity by 20 times compared to the current level.

At the beginning of 2025, Jensen Huang joked that ""quantum technology is at least 20 years away from practical application."" However, by the end of the year, the roadmaps of various quantum startups and giants were becoming more and more aggressive, and the predictions of the media and institutions also began to turn optimistic.

Undoubtedly, 2026 will be a crucial year for quantum computing to move towards practical application. And now is a good time to sort out the technology and review the market.

Let's first take a look at what happened in the quantum industry in 2025.

01 The Quantum Explosion in 2025

In 2025, the main players on the quantum stage can be summarized as: three tech giants, the ""Quantum Four"", and NVIDIA.

Google: After releasing the Willow superconducting quantum processor with 105 physical qubits at the end of 2024, Google officially announced the achievement of ""verifiable quantum advantage"" in October 2025. By running the ""Quantum Echo"" algorithm, the Willow chip was 13,000 times faster than classical supercomputers in processing out - of - order time correlator tasks. Experimental data further showed that as the scale of physical qubits increased, the logical error rate of the system decreased exponentially, verifying the effectiveness of the error - correction theory at the physical level.

In terms of the ecosystem, Google deepened its cooperation with NVIDIA, using the CUDA - Q platform for large - scale physical simulations to solve the noise design problems of next - generation processors. In addition, Google reached a cooperation with the UK National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC), opening cloud access to the Willow chip for UK research institutions to support algorithm testing in fields such as materials science.

IBM: In 2025, IBM continued to implement its hardware iteration roadmap, focusing on improving processor performance and reducing the cost of the control system. In terms of hardware, IBM released and delivered a 120 - qubit processor codenamed ""Nighthawk"". This chip uses a new - generation tunable coupler, with a computing performance approximately 20% higher than its predecessor, ""Heron"". At the same time, IBM introduced an experimental chip called ""Loon"" to verify the stability of large - scale fault - tolerant components.

In terms of the engineering control architecture, IBM announced the results of its cooperation with AMD in October of the same year. The two sides used AMD's existing commercial FPGA chips to achieve real - time error - correction control of qubits. Tests showed that the processing speed of this solution met the requirements for real - time error correction, and the project progress was completed one year ahead of schedule. This progress demonstrated that general - purpose commercial chips can replace customized hardware for quantum control, which helps reduce the engineering cost of building fault - tolerant quantum computers and supports IBM's plan for fault - tolerant models in 2029.

Microsoft: In February 2025, Microsoft released its first quantum chip, ""Majorana 1"", based on topological superconductor materials. This product marked that Microsoft's long - term investment in the topological quantum computing route had entered the hardware prototype stage from theoretical research. Microsoft stated that the chip uses the characteristics of new materials to achieve immunity to environmental noise at the physical level. Although the current qubit scale is small, the release of this prototype verified the feasibility of the topological protection mechanism at the hardware level, providing an experimental basis for subsequent expansion.

The ""Quantum Four"" (IonQ, Rigetti, D - Wave, QCI): In 2025, listed quantum computing companies represented by IonQ, Rigetti, D - Wave, and Quantum Computing (QCI) underwent market integration and business adjustments. IonQ completed the acquisition of UK startup Oxford Ionics in June, involving an amount of approximately $1.1 billion, aiming to integrate ion - trap technology patents and expand the engineering team. Rigetti Computing continued to advance the modular deployment of superconducting systems and optimized the interconnection performance of the Ankaa - 3 processor. D - Wave focused on demonstrating the hybrid solving ability of quantum annealing technology in logistics scheduling and supply - chain optimization. In addition, Quantum Computing continued to explore in the field of photonics, aiming to lower the environmental threshold for system operation.

NVIDIA: In 2025, NVIDIA underwent a strategic correction in the quantum field. From doubting quantum computing at the beginning of the year, Jensen Huang publicly apologized at the GTC Summit in March and established the strategic position of quantum computing. Subsequently, NVIDIA quickly initiated capital operations.

In September, NVentures, a subsidiary of NVIDIA, continuously made significant investments in three technology routes within a week: participating in the nearly $600 million financing of Quantinuum (ion - trap), supporting QuEra (neutral atoms), and following the $1 billion Series E financing of PsiQuantum (photonic quantum). This combination of moves aimed to cover the mainstream hardware modalities through capital rather than self - developing QPUs.

At the GTC Conference in Washington at the end of the year, NVIDIA launched NVQLink, enabling direct communication between the QPU of quantum computers and GPUs. Jensen Huang pointed out that the QPU of quantum computing has received unprecedented support, and currently, 17 quantum computing companies and 8 US Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories have joined the NVIDIA ecosystem.

02 A Series of Highlights in 2026

Based on the technology roadmaps of major manufacturers and the predictions of industry analysis institutions, 2026 is regarded as a crucial node for quantum computing to move from engineering verification to utility verification. The industry's focus will shift from simply expanding the scale of physical qubits to verifying the quality of logical qubits and the actual deployment of hybrid computing architectures.

In the superconducting route, IBM has set 2026 as a crucial year to demonstrate ""quantum advantage"" in its plan. The company plans to use a ""quantum - centric supercomputing"" architecture to try to prove its cost or accuracy advantage over classical computers in specific scientific tasks. Its processor is expected to support deeper - level quantum gate operations (targeting about 7,500 gates) to run more complex algorithms. Google, on the other hand, faces the engineering challenge of transitioning from verifying error - correction principles to building long - lived logical qubits, focusing on further improving the coherence time and gate fidelity of physical qubits.

In the emerging routes, the neutral - atom manufacturer QuEra Computing has set the goal of releasing a system with 100 logical qubits; the photonic - quantum manufacturer PsiQuantum is accelerating the assembly of its ultra - large - scale systems in Chicago and Brisbane and is expected to enter a crucial system integration stage in 2026; and QuantWare has launched the plan for the Kilofab wafer fab, attempting to promote the industrial mass production of quantum chips. All of the above plans have high engineering uncertainties, and 2026 will be a test period to verify whether these aggressive goals can be achieved.

With the promotion of middleware platforms such as NVIDIA's CUDA - Q, ""Quantum - classical hybrid computing"" may become the standard deployment mode in data centers in 2026. QPUs will be more integrated as accelerators into high - performance computing clusters to handle specific simulation or optimization tasks. The popularization of this architecture will promote the combination of quantum computing and AI workflows, especially in the fields of large - model training optimization and complex molecular simulation. The industry expects to see more application tests based on hybrid computing power.

In the field of cloud services, IBM, AWS, and Microsoft currently provide quantum access services. In 2026, cloud providers may further integrate ""quantum + classical"" hybrid resources. The service model will evolve from providing single experimental hardware access to providing a hybrid computing environment integrated with high - performance computing resources. The threshold for enterprise users to call quantum computing power through the cloud platform to solve practical problems is expected to be lowered, but whether it can generate a positive return on investment in large - scale commercial scenarios remains to be seen.

At the security level, the US government is forcing the anti - quantum upgrade of digital infrastructure. According to the strategic deployment of the National Security Memorandum (NSM - 10), US federal agencies have entered the actual implementation stage of post - quantum cryptography (PQC) migration. The White House requires agencies to accelerate the phasing out of traditional encryption algorithms such as RSA and has set 2025 - 2030 as the critical window period for core systems to complete PQC upgrades. This initiative aims to establish the US's leading position in formulating the next - generation encryption standard and drive the reconstruction of defense systems in key fields such as finance and national defense.

This also reflects the fact that the quantum computing competition in 2026 will not only take place at the enterprise level but also between major countries around the world.

Looking forward to 2026, as major global economies enter a new policy cycle, the development logic of quantum computing is undergoing profound changes. The focus of countries is gradually shifting from the early competition in single scientific research indicators to building a resilient industrial system and mastering the core links of the industrial chain.

The US strategic focus in 2026 has shifted to strengthening its internal industrial foundation. In response to the labor - force gap risk pointed out by the non - profit organization ""QED - C"", the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is expected to accelerate the cultivation of quantum industry clusters in places such as Colorado. Different from mainly funding basic scientific research in the past, the R & D budget orientation for the 2027 fiscal year shows that US policies are more focused on cultivating skilled technical workers and engineers and exploring new support models, including equity - for - capital, aiming to build a complete local industrial closed - loop from R & D to manufacturing to address the talent shortage in the fields of cryogenic electronics and microwave engineering.

2026 is the starting year of China's 15th Five - Year Plan, and quantum technology is positioned as a ""new economic growth point"" in the relevant planning suggestions, which implies that China's quantum industry is accelerating the transition from laboratory verification to industrial cultivation. At the infrastructure level, China's industrial community is exploring the integration of quantum computing into the national - level computing power network, relying on the ""East - West Computing"" project. China Telecom Quantum and Origin Quantum and other enterprises are expected to further pilot the ""integration of four types of computing"", namely quantum + supercomputing + intelligent computing + general computing, trying to use the real needs of public scenarios such as weather forecasting and power grid scheduling to drive technological iteration.

In terms of industrial chain construction, Chinese enterprises are committed to building a full - stack autonomous ecosystem. Manufacturers represented by Liangi Technology are promoting the R & D and verification of key components such as dilution refrigerators and special cables. At the same time, the photonic - quantum route is also being accelerated. Turing Quantum and other complete - machine manufacturers are exploring differentiated applications in the fields of AI and biomedicine, while Tengjing Technology provides solid underlying hardware support for this route through the R & D of precision optical components.

Europe and the UK are also accelerating the implementation of the ""technological sovereignty"" strategy. The UK has promised to continuously invest funds to support the quantum industry, relying on domestic enterprises such as ORCA Computing to build an internationally competitive industrial high - ground. The EU tends to support domestic companies in building quantum chip foundry facilities, trying to gain more say in the chip manufacturing link and build an industrial ""third pole"" with independent innovation capabilities.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260104/v2_d7c0fc1ecbf94f98a970f834b29d1781@5888275@ai_oswg1134118oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:58:38.014030

In the United States, retail CEO exits reached between 41 and 43 by late 2024, a more than 100% increase compared to the previous year. Similarly, in Mexico, at least nine major firms, including Walmart de México, FEMSA, and Grupo Bimbo, replaced their top leadership during the second half of the year.

“This period of CEO turnovers may seem like a coincidence, but each movement follows its own fundamentals. In reality, in Mexico we are accustomed to very long management trajectories, and that amplifies the perception of change. In any case, change is usually healthy,” says independent analyst Marcela Muñoz to El Economista.

Internal Promotion Trends

Boards of directors continue to favor internal candidates to provide cultural alignment and institutional knowledge. About 67% of CEO appointments across the S&P 500 in 2025 came from within the organizations, although this is a decrease from 74% in 2023 and 82% in 2022.

Major US retailers Walmart and Target both selected insiders for their top roles. Walmart appointed John Furner, the company’s number two executive, to succeed Doug McMillon. Furner and McMillon both began their careers at entry levels within individual stores. At Target, Michael Fiddelke was selected to succeed Brian Cornell in 2026. Fiddelke is a company veteran who oversaw logistics and sourcing.

In Mexico, several firms followed a similar path. At FEMSA, José Antonio Fernández Garza-Lagüera was appointed as part of a long-anticipated succession plan, as previously reported by MBN. At La Comer, Héctor de la Barreda took over as CEO, while his predecessor, Santiago García, moved to the Board of Directors. Roberto Solano, Manager of Analysis, Monex, says that these internal moves strengthen the ""core business"" as new leaders bring visions based on experience within the same company.

The leadership changes in Mexico coincide with a period of low economic dynamism. Data from the National Association of Self-Service and Department Stores (ANTAD) shows that accumulated sales grew 3.3% between January and September 2025, down from 4.6% in the same period of 2024.

Several high-profile appointments were confirmed in the final quarter of 2025:

El Palacio de Hierro: Éléonore de Boysson was named general director, becoming the first woman to lead the department store chain.

Grupo Bimbo: Rafael Pamias resigned for health and personal reasons.

Mondelez México: Carlos Veraza was appointed general director in July 2025, replacing Oriol Bonaclocha, who transitioned to CEO of Heineken Mexico.

Alsea: The restaurant operator replaced its general director as part of a long-term succession strategy and to manage a more demanding consumer environment.

Macroeconomic and Regulatory Pressures

The new leadership teams face immediate regulatory and economic challenges. In Mexico, companies are preparing for labor reforms, including the gradual reduction of the work week from 48 to 40 hours by 2030 and significant minimum wage increases. In 2025, the minimum wage rose by 12% to MX$419.88 (US$23.48) daily in the Northern Border Zone and MX$278.80 in the rest of the country.

Retailers also face fiscal and trade pressures. Bottlers like Coca-Cola FEMSA are managing a MX$3.08 increase in the Special Tax on Production and Services (IEPS) for sugary drinks. Furthermore, department stores and supermarkets face proposed import tariffs of between 10% and 50% on products such as textiles, footwear, and electronics from countries without trade agreements with Mexico.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/charlesdeluvio-Lks7vei-eAg-unsplash.jpg?h=78d8cc56&itok=OieC8rKZ,N,,2026-01-04 09:03:32.499382

The question for 2026 is not whether AI agents will be regulated, but whether oversight will arrive before harm becomes normalized.","If 2025 was the year artificial intelligence became unavoidable, 2026 will be the year everyone starts talking seriously about AI agents.

An AI agent is a software system designed to plan and execute tasks autonomously, make decisions and interact with digital tools or environments with minimal human oversight in pursuit of a defined goal. When people fear that AI will take over jobs, they are usually worried about white-collar automation. The more immediate question is not what AI agents might do someday; it is who is pushing them now, and to what end.

Tech companies are aggressively marketing AI agents as autonomous digital workers that can plan tasks, execute goals and manage workflows with minimal human input. Corporate leaders echo these claims, framing agents as productivity multipliers and cost-saving measures.

In many cases, this enthusiasm reflects less a genuine breakthrough in capability than a familiar pattern: vendors racing to define the next category of enterprise software before regulators, workers or consumers have time to assess the risks.

The reality will be far less dramatic.

In 2026, AI agents will be everywhere in corporate decks and keynote speeches, but far less impressive in practice. Despite the hype, these systems remain unreliable and heavily dependent on human supervision.

They are not autonomous employees. They are closer to junior staffers who work quickly, confidently and often incorrectly, requiring constant review and cleanup. The problem is that Big Tech is pushing to deploy these agents at scale, often without adequate training, safeguards or clear human accountability.

That gap between promise and performance is already becoming visible. Studies and industry surveys consistently show that while AI tools are being rapidly deployed across private companies, few organizations are using them well.

Instead of boosting productivity, many firms report new inefficiencies: duplicated work, increased oversight burdens and time spent correcting AI-generated errors. In practice, AI systems often function less as productivity tools and more as justifications for cutting costs, shifting risk and lowering standards.

AI agents intensify this problem. Unlike chatbots that respond to discrete prompts, agents are designed to take initiative. They chain actions together and make decisions without constant human input. That autonomy is precisely what makes them appealing and risky. When agents hallucinate facts, misunderstand goals or act on flawed assumptions, errors cascade. For consumers, this can mean misinformation.

This is why trust remains the central barrier to agent adoption. AI agents cannot be trusted to operate independently in high-stakes environments such as finance, health care, legal services or government. They struggle with judgment and context, and they lack the institutional awareness humans rely on to navigate ambiguity. Yet, companies are increasingly positioning agents as authoritative interfaces, blurring the line between assistance and influence.

The result is a paradox. Companies invest in AI agents to reduce workload, but end up creating new layers of review and oversight. Employees must check outputs line by line. Managers must audit decisions after the fact. Compliance teams must anticipate errors, harder to trace because responsibility is split between humans and machines.

None of this means AI agents are useless. Like junior employees, they can be valuable when used appropriately. They excel at narrow, well-defined tasks. They can draft, summarize, organize and assist at scale. However, they are not ready to be trusted with end-to-end responsibility. Treating them as autonomous workers rather than tools is a category error that 2026 will make increasingly obvious.

By the end of 2026, the conversation around AI agents will begin to mature. The hype will cool. Executives will talk less about autonomy and more about supervision and ""co-piloting."" The most successful organizations will be those that treat AI agents not as replacements, but as trainees, useful only within clear boundaries and strong accountability structures.

AI agents may one day live up to their promise. But in 2026, they will still be learning the job.

Most importantly, if AI agents are deployed at scale, they must be governed as systems that shape rights, access and economic power — not treated as experiments run on the public. Regulators should require meaningful testing, clear lines of accountability and enforceable limits on how agents interact with consumers.

The question for 2026 is not whether AI agents will be regulated, but whether oversight will arrive before harm becomes normalized.

Estée Lauder also clearly pointed out in its financial report that many of its high - end perfume brands even achieved double - digit growth.
However, focusing on the high - end perfume raw material business, Givaudan increased by 18.7% year - on - year.
In December, the LVMH Group invested in BDK Parfums, a French niche fragrance brand.
For example, TSG, a consumer private equity fund, acquired Phlur, a niche high - end fragrance brand.","Amid the general slowdown of the global beauty market and the impact of geopolitics, L'Oréal acquired Creed, a top - tier salon fragrance brand under the Kering Group, for a sky - high price of 4 billion euros (approximately 32.82 billion yuan), revealing the most certain bet direction of the giants for the future.

In addition, in 2025, LVMH took a stake in BDK Parfums, and Estée Lauder made its first investment in a Mexican brand, XINÚ, in Latin America.

Behind the intensive layout actions of leading enterprises, on the one hand, it not only reshapes the competitive landscape of the global perfume market but also highlights the strong growth resilience of this category in the consumer wave.

On the other hand, in the corporate chessboard, perfume has been upgraded from an add - on category to a strategic stronghold for market competition. The competition logic is shifting from a stock game to the exploration of new growth.

Under the slowing growth, is niche high - end perfume the next breakout point?

Currently, although the perfume - related businesses from raw material suppliers to brand owners are still in a growth trend, the growth rate has significantly slowed down. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that ""high - endization"" has become the key engine to resist cyclical fluctuations, contributing the most certain growth in the financial reports of giants.

As shown in the following figure, compared with before, Hermès and Coty, whose perfume businesses used to boost their performance, saw a year - on - year decline of 7.2% and 6% respectively in the third quarter of this year, in sharp contrast to the 9.3% increase in 2024. At the same time, the perfume business growth of L'Oréal, Puig, etc. also did not exceed 3%, indicating a significant weakening of growth momentum.

Even so, many enterprises said that their high - end perfume brands achieved considerable growth, becoming highlights of their performance. Among the strategic brands of the Shiseido Group's Next5, the perfume brands Issey Miyake and Narciso Rodriguez increased by 16% and 13% year - on - year respectively. Estée Lauder also clearly pointed out in its financial report that many of its high - end perfume brands even achieved double - digit growth.

This is verified in the upstream of the industrial chain. Compared with the previous double - digit growth, international fragrance and flavor giants generally showed weakness in the first three quarters of 2025. Except for the slight increase in sales of Givaudan and IFF, DSM - Firmenich and Symrise declined year - on - year.

However, focusing on the high - end perfume raw material business, Givaudan increased by 18.7% year - on - year.

It can be seen that high - end perfume has stronger anti - cyclical ability and market attractiveness, which also provides clear guidance for the strategic layout of international beauty enterprises. In order to restart the growth engine, enterprises have increased their investment in perfume and focused their investment on this niche segment with still room for growth.

Led by L'Oréal, the perfume track remains hot!

Despite facing macro - level pressures, the global perfume market has a promising future. According to relevant data from Mordor Intelligence, the fragrance market was worth 76.71 billion US dollars (approximately 540.5 billion yuan) in 2025 and is expected to reach 112.46 billion US dollars (approximately 792.4 billion yuan) by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 7.95% during the forecast period.

Against this broad prospect, international beauty groups and upstream suppliers have accelerated their layout.

In 2025, there were over 10 investments in perfume and fragrance

In 2025, industrial capital represented by L'Oréal, Estée Lauder, and LVMH was particularly active. According to an incomplete statistics by Jumeili, there were more than ten investments and acquisitions of perfume brands globally. Among them, equity investment became the mainstream method, indicating that capital aims to establish long - term and in - depth strategic partnerships rather than simple financial investments.

Among them, L'Oréal's layout was the most coherent and aggressive. It successively invested in two high - end perfume brands within a month and also obtained the operation rights of the beauty and perfume of a fashion brand, quickly supplementing its high - end portfolio.

Subsequently, in October, through a historic cooperation with the Kering Group, L'Oréal brought Creed, a representative of high - end niche fragrances with a history of over 200 years, under its wing. This deal marked the ultimate layout of L'Oréal in the niche perfume field.

In addition, Estée Lauder and the LVMH Group also followed closely, but with different strategies, investing in perfume brands with strong regional characteristics and focusing on raw material quality respectively.

In November, Estée Lauder made a strategic minority equity investment in XINÚ, a niche luxury brand from Mexico, taking a fancy to its unique Latin American plant fragrance sources and cultural narrative.

In December, the LVMH Group invested in BDK Parfums, a French niche fragrance brand. This brand focuses on returning to the essence, emphasizing high - quality raw materials, adhering to handmade production, and conveying a unique artistic perspective and sensory narrative.

International luxury brands are keen to seize the differential value of the niche high - end fragrance track through equity investment, while upstream raw material giants tend to directly consolidate the supply chain and regional markets through acquisitions.

For example, Givaudan, a fragrance and flavor giant, successively acquired perfume and fragrance companies Vollmens Fragrances and Belle Aire Creations within three months to strengthen its position in the North American and Brazilian markets.

In addition to the above two groups eyeing the ""cake"" of perfume, many private equities and funds are also involved.

However, different from beauty enterprises focusing on single - category perfume brands, funds and investment companies are more optimistic about home fragrance brands close to daily life.

For example, TSG, a consumer private equity fund, acquired Phlur, a niche high - end fragrance brand. In addition to perfume, Phlur's product line also includes body sprays, hand creams, candles, etc.

Source: Phlur official website

Similarly, Homecourt, a high - end home fragrance brand founded by actress Courteney Cox, also received 8 million US dollars (approximately 56.337 million yuan) in Series A financing. Since its establishment in 2022, the brand's product line has expanded from the home field to body care and laundry products.

Behind these intensive investment actions, three core trends can be found:

Firstly, with limited growth in popular mass - market perfumes, capital is flowing more towards niche categories. In essence, against the backdrop of the fading traffic dividend, ""niche"" high - end perfumes with unique brand stories, rare fragrance types, and niche cultures have become the targets for giants to bet on the future and obtain differential value.

Secondly, the investment logic varies according to the nature of capital. Equity investments by beauty groups aim to complete the brand puzzle and acquire strategic growth points; acquisitions by raw material suppliers aim to control the core supply chain; while private equity funds prefer the extension of product lines for more stable returns.

Thirdly, scene - based consumption is expanding the boundaries of the track. Compared with traditional perfumes, home fragrances have a wider audience and product chain. Due to their higher frequency of use and stronger emotional value, they are attracting new capital to enter the market.

Investing up to 1.2 billion yuan in R & D factories

In addition to investing in promising perfume brands, international giants are looking upstream and focusing on building core capabilities at the R & D end.

Specifically, as a consumer goods giant, Unilever has not made new moves in investing in perfume brands, but in May this year, it invested 80 million pounds (approximately 753 million yuan) to build a new fragrance R & D facility in the UK. Two months later, it opened a new fragrance laboratory in the US. This series of actions shows that building independent and cutting - edge olfactory R & D capabilities has become a key part of leading enterprises in the industry.

In addition, from a geographical perspective, France, with its long - standing perfume history, has also become the best location for leading enterprises to build factories.

Chanel invested 150 million euros (approximately 1.241 billion yuan) to build a new perfume production base in France to consolidate its perfume industrial chain.

L'Oréal added an investment of 60 million euros (approximately 496 million yuan) to its Gosselies factory in northern France to provide strong manufacturing support for its perfume brands.

Estée Lauder opened a global perfume workshop in Paris, aiming to bring together top perfumers and creative talents to accelerate the innovation and commercialization of perfume art.

From the above, it can be seen that enterprises are no longer satisfied with acquiring ready - made brand stories but are directly investing in the source of creating stories. Meanwhile, future perfume competition is not only about competing for consumers' perception of a single product but also about upgrading R & D technology. Building higher technical barriers and stable production capacity supply has become the key bargaining chip for leading enterprises to consolidate their industry position and seize future growth opportunities.

The talent war: the key engine driving the ""olfactory economy""

Beyond strategic investment and supply chain layout, the upgrade of the talent structure has become a key move for leading groups to compete in the high - end perfume market.

In 2025, there were more than 10 changes in perfume business executives in the industry, from Hermès, the LVMH Group to Coty.

For example, in April this year, Creed, a brand under the Kering Group, appointed a former Estée Lauder executive as its CEO. It is reported that Nathalie Berger - Duquene has more than 20 years of relevant work experience and has held important positions in many international beauty enterprises such as Estée Lauder and L'Oréal.

Similarly, after emerging from bankruptcy, Revlon also poached a former Estée Lauder executive in October. It announced that Amber Garrison would serve as the President of the Elizabeth Arden brand and global perfume business. It is reported that Amber Garrison has rich experience in skin care, perfume, brand transformation, etc. and once served as the Global Brand President of Origins.

In addition, there were changes in the top management of niche perfume brands. For example, Marc - André Heller replaced the co - founder as the CEO of Memo Paris; Patrice Béliard took over as the CEO of niche fragrance brands Parfums de Marly and Initio Parfums Privés.

All of the above indicate that the current competition among leading enterprises in the ""olfactory"" field has reached a white - hot stage, and the competition in the perfume field has deepened from a game of capital and resources to a core competition of organizational capabilities and strategic thinking.

Although the competition is becoming increasingly fierce, it is certain that perfume will still be a category favored by most enterprises in the future. As Yan Ming, the managing partner of Xiuyuan Capital, also recognized the potential of this market. ""The fragrance field is still full of opportunities, especially fragrance products that contain cultural elements and can convey emotional value. Due to the emphasis on emotional value of such products, their growth process may be relatively slow, but once successful, they will also be more stable, and the two are complementary.""

Although the growth of single - category products purely centered on fragrance has slowed down, the integrated innovation of ""fragrance +"" has become the core model for exploring new growth.

As a sensory element, fragrance is being systematically integrated into categories such as skin care, household cleaning, and health care, creating composite products with both functional attributes and emotional resonance. In the future, the growth potential of the ""olfactory economy"" is expected to be continuously released.

Only one investment: is the Chinese perfume track facing a cold spell?

While international giants have occupied the headlines with their intensive capital actions, the Chinese perfume investment market in 2025 showed a ""calm"" on the data level. Public information shows that only EvoSensation, a new - style fragrance brand from Yunnan, completed its angel - round financing throughout the year, but neither the investment amount nor the investor was disclosed.

Looking back over time, most domestic perfume track investments occurred around 2022. Among them, the more attention - grabbing ones are Documents and Scentooze, which received investments from L'Oréal in 2022 and 2024 respectively, and Melt Season, which received tens of millions of yuan in strategic investment from the Estée Lauder Group in 2023. It is worth noting that the path for these three brands to gain capital recognition is to build an irreplicable high - end brand value centered on a unique oriental cultural narrative.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260104/v2_b86cb38e791c411a8d7cb75b046ea629@1743780481@ai_oswg1166121oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 01:58:04.109869

Following the sale, SSJ Consulting now holds about 19.7 million Gemadept shares, equivalent to a 4.62% stake, down from 6.96%. As a result, the firm is no longer classified as a major shareholder under Vietnamese securities regulations.

Three of the five — Amphenol, Alphabet and Reddit — have ties to artificial intelligence, which is expected to remain a major investment theme in 2026.

All five stocks are holding up despite a weak culmination to trading in 2025. The market generally rose Friday to start the new year, though software weighed on the Nasdaq. At the moment, IBD is recommending 60%-80% exposure, and these stocks to watch could be actionable soon.

Amphenol Among Stocks To Watch

Amphenol is forming a double-bottom base with a 143.48 buy point. Investors trying to get ahead of that entry can use the Dec. 26 high at 138.32. Shares traded just above that level Friday. Although shares have rallied more than 80% from the last breakout in May, the current base is still an early-stage pattern.

The company — Wednesday's IBD Stock of the Day — is riding at least two hot investing themes: data centers and aviation.

Amphenol makes interconnect products, fiber-optic connectors, antennas, sensors and specialty cables. Surging demand for data centers and the connectors for those operations has been a main driver of Amphenol's growth.

The company is a leader in high-performance connectors for military and commercial aircraft. Geopolitical tensions and airline demand for higher-efficiency planes are driving growth in those markets.

In addition, Amphenol has been on an acquisition spree, buying up AI infrastructure, defense electronics and industrial automation companies. Last year, Amphenol acquired CommScope's (COMM) connectivity business for $10.5 billion. In November, it closed the $1 billion deal for Trexon, a maker of high-strength cable assembly products for military equipment.

Amphenol will announce fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 28 after the close. Analysts expect earnings to climb 67% to 92 cents a share. Sales are expected to increase 42% to $6.131 billion, according to FactSet.

Earnings and revenue growth have accelerated for several quarters.

The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible. The stock has a moderate 21-day average true range (ATR) of 2.57%. The average true range, available on IBD MarketSurge, gauges the characteristic breadth of a stock's behavior. Stocks with a high ATR tend to make large price moves that can trigger sell rules. Stocks with lower ATRs tend to make more incremental moves.

Trump: U.S. To 'Run' Venezuela; Three AI Chip Giants Loom

Google Stock On Track For New Base

Alphabet shares are forming a flat base with a 328.83 buy point. It is the first new base to appear on the chart since the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at 197.95 in August. Shares briefly flashed an early entry on Friday, bouncing off the 21-day line, but pared gains. Friday's high of 322.50 can serve as a slightly aggressive buy point now.

The parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo and Gemini is still the No. 1 stock in the internet content industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. It has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Alphabet's earnings grew 36% in 2024 and are expected to have increased 32% in 2025.

The stock rose 65% last year thanks to its investments in artificial intelligence. But as the company continues to pour cash into AI, analysts now expect EPS growth to slow to 6%, to $11.24 billion, in 2026. Revenue is expected to grow about 14% in 2026 to $454.8 billion.

Google overhauled its search results in response to new competition from OpenAI's ChatGPT and others. As Alphabet seeks to remain a dominant player in AI, last month it announced plans to acquire Intersect Power, a data center and clean energy infrastructure company, for $4.75 billion in cash plus debt. Alphabet is also getting into quantum computing.

Analysts polled by FactSet expect fourth-quarter earnings to climb 32% to $2.63 a share. Sales are seen rising 15% to $111 billion.

Google stock has a mild ATR of 2.07%.

Evercore Another Stock To Watch

Evercore shares climbed past the 349.91 buy point of a cup-with-handle base on Dec. 22. But the breakout never got going. After fading at the end of 2025, shares reclaimed the buy point on Friday. Also, another handle entry has appeared at 353.30. Shares are holding above the 21-day exponential moving average, a positive sign while the stock tries to get traction.

New York-based Evercore — the fourth-largest investment banking advisor in the world — beat Q3 estimates thanks to strong M&A activity. Advisory fees jumped 49% to $290.7 million, mainly due to higher revenue from large transactions during 2025, the firm said.

Analysts believe the company is on sound footing for 2026 amid favorable conditions for wealth brokers and independent investment banks.

The firm has made the Middle East a focus of its expansion. In December, it received a license to work in Saudi Arabia. Evercore opened an office in Dubai in 2017 and also has operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia.

Evercore was founded in 1995 by Roger Altman, an investment banker who served as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury under President Bill Clinton. During the Jimmy Carter administration, he held another senior post at the Treasury. Altman remains senior chairman at Evercore.

Analysts' consensus earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $4.10 in earnings per share, an increase of 20.1%. Revenue is expected to climb 14.6% to $1.123 billion, per FactSet. The date of the report hasn't been announced.

Evercore has a 94 Composite Rating and an ATR of 2.88.

Stocks To Watch: Reddit Forms Bullish Pattern

Reddit stock is working on a cup-with-handle base. Shares are 3% away from the 246.15 buy point. The base shows a drop of 39% from peak to trough, which is deeper than usual. Yet, Reddit is no stranger to deep patterns. It formed a cup base from July to October 2024 and still nearly tripled from the buy point.

On Friday, RDDT stock broke a downtrend within the handle as well as a trendline from the top of the base, both offering early entries.

The online discussion platform monetizes its business mainly through advertising on its app and website. Daily active unique users were 116 million in the third quarter, an increase of 19% from a year earlier. Average revenue per unique user rose 41% to $5.04 in the quarter.

San Francisco-based Reddit grew earnings per share 400% in Q3, and analysts expect EPS to rise 159% to 93 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to jump 68% to $655.6 million, according to MarketSurge data.

Analysts Bullish On Reddit

Analysts are bullish on the company's 2026 prospects as posts from Reddit gain ground in AI-powered search results. Needham analyst Laura Martin on Monday said in a note to clients that Reddit is already generating over $100 million a year in fees from OpenAI and Google's Gemini, and the sum could double with Anthropic and Perplexity fees, TheFly.com reported.

Reddit settled litigation against Anthropic and Perplexity over use of Reddit content without a licensing agreement.

""As overall referral traffic shrinks, the platforms that AI answers cite (like Reddit) become increasingly valuable, we believe,"" the analyst said. Studies show Reddit is a ""key beneficiary"" of citations within answers generated through Google's AI overviews and ChatGPT, she added.

Earlier in December, Needham named Reddit its 2026 Top Pick and added the stock to the firm's conviction list. Piper Sandler and Jefferies also have named Reddit a top pick for 2026.

Reddit has a Composite Rating of 94 and ATR of 4.42.

Globus Medical Recovers From Decline

Globus Medical is forming a large cup-with-handle base with a 240.18 buy point, holding the 21-day line on Friday. The stock fell a steep 45% while forming the base, so the current five-week-old handle provides a pause that should help the stock break out successfully. Investors could use resistance around 90 as an early entry.

The stock recouped most of its decline on Nov. 7, when shares gapped up 36% on the company's blowout third-quarter report. Sales and earnings exceeded all analyst estimates, and Globus raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance.

Audubon, Penn.-based Globus makes products and surgical tools for joint reconstruction, spine conditions and other musculoskeletal ailments.

The company said growth in U.S. spine procedures drove much of its Q3 performance, and that momentum carried into Q4. Acquisitions also helped drive results.

Stocks To Watch: Globus Trends

In December, RBC Capital raised the price target on Globus Medical to 100 from 92 and kept an outperform rating. Analysts believe aging demographics, growing global health care access and differentiated innovation are driving momentum in the industry, TheFly.com reported. Globus is poised to deliver a solid year of sales growth.

At the same time, Canaccord raised the price target to 105 from 90 and kept a buy rating, citing bullish views for the medical technology sector in 2026 amid depressed valuations and growing deal activity, TheFly.com said. AI is changing the space, enabling improved patient treatments and surgical accuracy.

Globus Medical has a Composite Rating of 98, one of the highest in the medical products industry group. It has an ATR of 2.05% and is a stock to watch.

Now they’ll host the Nuggets at Barclays Center having dropped three straight and watched their tank get back on track.
That’s what they did with Porter, prying the Nuggets’ coveted unprotected 2032 first-rounder just to take Porter.

With Porter, the Nets have been competitive — and at times, slightly better than that, winning seven of his past 10. But without him, they’re 0-6.

Now they’ll host the Nuggets at Barclays Center having dropped three straight and watched their tank get back on track.

And despite Porter’s recent illness — he’s listed as probable after missing the prior two games — an increasing number of teams now are being connected to possible interest in the red-hot forward.

Porter is averaging a career-high 25.8 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists. He’s the only qualified player in the East mustering at least 25 points and seven boards and one of just five in the whole league, joining Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Lauri Markkanen and Deni Avdija.

At 27 on a rebuilding team, that makes Porter a walking inflection point.

A starter on Denver’s 2023 champs, is Porter more valuable as a foundation piece to build around, despite whatever spots his scoring costs the Nets in the lottery standings? Or is he more valuable as a trade chip before next month’s deadline, bringing back picks — and helping the Nets’ own selection by his departure?

These aren’t the only decisions general manager Sean Marks has to make, but they are among the most important — and the most pressing.

The Post reported in the summer that the Nets expect to have a two-year tank and step up in Year 3. Now, Jake Fischer of The Steinline wrote the Nets’ time frame could hinge on how they fare in the June draft, and that league sources expect them to start being aggressive following the draft, regardless of whether or not they trade Porter.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NBA STANDINGS AND NETS STATS

After being boxed into a corner by James Harden broadsiding them — and probably even before that — Marks values flexibility. He’s created just that, with the Nets leading the league in not only draft picks (32 total, 13 firsts — a dozen unprotected) but cap space ($15.5 million, up to $50 million this offseason).

They can use the latter to get more of the former, taking salary dumps before the trade deadline to land more picks. That’s what they did with Porter, prying the Nuggets’ coveted unprotected 2032 first-rounder just to take Porter.

Being salary-dumped is something Porter used as fuel en route to his career year.

“Yeah, I definitely use everything I can as motivation,” Porter said. “It was just so much noise about me as a player. I just felt like a lot of stuff was discredited because of the fact that it was a rough ending to my time there.

“I knew if I was healthy coming here, I’d be able to change the narrative around me.”

Porter has changed not just the narrative but his value.

After the trade was derided as one of the worst of the decade by Bill Simmons, now Fischer notes that a first-rounder and re-tradable salary may not be enough to get the Nets to flip Porter midseason.

The Clippers and Bucks have been linked with interest in Porter. Fischer reported that Milwaukee is evaluating Porter and adds the Warriors and Bulls, as well.

But the Nets have moved from sixth to fifth in the lottery standings, seeing their odds at one of the three elite prospects — Darryn Peterson, Cam Boozer or AJ Dybantsa — go up from 27.6 percent to 31.6 percent. They’re only 1 ½ games out of fourth, which would see that jump to 36.6 percent.

While moving Porter would aid their tank, the past few games have shown that spotting him rest days can do the same. And he clearly likes Brooklyn.

“Yeah, I love it here,” Porter said when asked by The Post if he sees himself in Brooklyn long term. “So whatever team wants and appreciates what I bring to the table, then that’s where I want to be. And I feel like they do here. … Like I said, if they want me here, I’d love to be here.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-u1hzhvso3-1767483623193.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1767465638&w=1200,N,,2026-01-03 20:59:30.643725

Zu verdanken sind die grünen vor allem zwei Neuigkeiten. An Silvester wurde bekannt, dass in China der Patentschutz für Semaglutid, der Wirkstoff von Wegovy und Ozempic, bestätigt wurde. Generikahersteller, die bereits mit den Hufen scharren, werden sich deshalb noch etwas zurückhalten müssen.

In den USA gab es kurz zuvor eine Zulassung für eine oral zu verabreichende Variante von Wegovy, also eine Abnehmpille. Jene soll noch im Januar auf dem Markt platziert werden und für frische Umsätze sorgen. Von einem großen Turnaround wird an der Börse zwar noch nicht geträumt. Doch die Börsianer gehen etwas leichtfüßiger ins neue Jahr.

Novo Nordisk kämpft mit der Konkurrenz

Dauerhaft leichter wird es für Novo Nordisk nicht unbedingt werden. In China mag man die Generikahersteller noch ein Weilchen länger auf Abstand halten. Ewig können die Dänen sich auf ihren Patenten aber nicht ausruhen. Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der Konkurrenzdruck im Westen kontinuierlich.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Novo Nordisk?

Ungewisse Aussichten

Das Jahr 2026 dürfte im Markt der Abnehmmedikamente noch für einige Überraschungen sorgen, die für Novo Nordisk voraussichtlich nicht immer angenehmer Natur sein werden. Das ist den Anlegern bewusst, weshalb die Reaktion auf die guten Neuigkeiten sich einigermaßen in Grenzen hält. Etwas verbessert hat die Ausgangslage sich für den dänischen Konzern.

This kingmaker capability — Taiwan Semiconductor deciding where the players stand in line — can ultimately decide the AI market’s winners and losers.","The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has expanded rapidly since 2023, powering applications from chatbots to autonomous systems and driving trillions in market value. Tech giants have invested heavily in data centers and specialized hardware to meet surging demand for training and inference tasks. However, constraints are emerging that cap this growth rate.

Supply chain bottlenecks, particularly in advanced manufacturing, limit how quickly new AI capabilities can scale. Power availability and component shortages further hinder expansion. It could be that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the key linchpins determining how far and fast AI expands.

Google’s TPU Cut Reveals Packaging Crunch

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has reportedly reduced its 2026 production target for Tensor Processing Units from around 4 million to 3 million units. According to a report by Korea Economic Daily, this adjustment stems from limited access to Taiwan Semiconductor’s CoWoS advanced packaging capacity, which Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) secured through priority allocations. CoWoS integrates processors with high-bandwidth memory on a silicon interposer, essential for high-performance AI accelerators. Without sufficient capacity, finished chips cannot deploy at scale. Other outlets have reported on production caps previously.

Taiwan Semiconductor dominates CoWoS technology, but explosive AI demand has outpaced its expansions. Nvidia has locked in over half of its available capacity through 2026 and 2027, leaving competitors like Google constrained. This forced Google to cut its production target despite strong internal needs for its custom silicon.

The issue underscores how supply allocation now influences the AI hardware landscape more than design or demand alone.

Battle for the Production Line Shapes AI’s Future

Chipmakers and designers are competing intensely for positions in Taiwan Semiconductor’s production queue. Google’s experience highlights this scramble, where securing advanced packaging determines output volumes. Nvidia’s dominance in allocations gives it an edge in scaling AI accelerators, while others face delays.

This dynamic parallels energy constraints limiting data center buildouts. Power grids struggle to support massive, expanding AI infrastructure, capping expansion opportunities. Yet Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing controls the core components inside those centers, from logic dies to packaged accelerators. Its role as the primary foundry for leading-edge nodes makes it central to AI progress. Without its capacity ramps, even abundant energy would not translate to deployable hardware.

Taiwan Semiconductor is accelerating capacity expansion through 2028, doubling its advanced wafer capabilities. It is also repurposing 200 mm fabs for advanced packaging, which could increase its returns. If fully utilized, it would not be surprising to see revenue double by 2028.

Potential Lift for Intel’s Foundry Ambitions

Yet the CoWoS shortage could end up boosting the competition, which moves in to fill the void created. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), for example, is aiming to rival Taiwan Semiconductor in foundry services. Google has explored alternatives like Intel’s EMIB packaging for future TPUs, such as the v9 accelerator expected around 2027. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also is said to have placed orders with Intel, while Apple could tap Intel’s 18A process for its entry-level M-series chips starting in 2027.

The foundry’s focus on custom ASICs and advanced packaging puts it in step with industry needs for efficient AI compute. Its 18A and 14A nodes, plus EMIB, position it to capture business from hyperscalers seeking alternatives. Intel is scaling its New Mexico facility’s capacity by 30% for EMIB and 150% for Foveros, its own advanced 3D packaging technology.

Yet Nvidia reportedly reviewed and passed on using Intel’s facilities, though both Google and Apple are reportedly also sounding out Samsung‘s two facilities in Texas to meet their needs. Samsung is offering advanced packaging as a “turnkey” solution bundled with DRAM and foundry services to hyperscalers such as Google, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

So, while Taiwan Semiconductor remains dominant, its capacity issues create openings for its competitors to gain traction and, in Intel’s case, validate its turnaround strategy.

Key Takeaway

While Nvidia seems to have the inside track on commanding priority, boosting its long-term dominance in the space, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is increasingly the key to whether other chipmakers and designers thrive. As advanced packaging becomes the new industry bottleneck, its CoWoS capacity can determine who scales compute.

Delta Air Lines has AC power outlets at most seats. But that doesn’t mean all your devices should be powered. A short video shows a woman seated in Comfort+ extra legroom economyusing a curling iron to curl her hair inflight.

Commenters seem to argue that “curling irons are banned” but usually mix up whose rules apply. TSA doesn’t restrict plug-in curling irons. They’re allowed in carry-on and checked bags.

Cordless curling irons may be restricted – such as if they contain lithium batteries or (apparently this is a thing, I had no idea) if they’re gas or butane fueled. Those are going to be limited to carry-on bags (but they’re still allowed through the checkpoint).

None of that means you can use a heating appliance on board. Just because you can bring it on doesn’t mean you’re permitted to use it. Or that it’s a reasonable idea to primp and preen with a hot curling iron, going section by section through your hair throughout the flight.

Delta’s rules do not specifically mention curling irons. They allow hair dryers and straighteners when packed properly but I don’t know that anyone actually envisioned whipping this tool out and using it onboard. Their Contract of Carriage, though, does say they can refuse to transport and remove passengers who fail to obey crewmember instructions or if their behavior is hazardous, creating a risk of harm or unreasonably annoying others. So it’s really crew discretion.

Of course, we’ve seen passengers whip out a full-sized iMac to work in coach, plug in a power strip at their seat to charge multiple devices at once, and my personal favorite, bring out a sewing machine to spend the flight making curtains.

The UK’s manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace in 15 months in December, as the impact of uncertainty about the autumn Budget and the Jaguar Land Rover cyber attack began to fade, a new survey shows.

The S&P Global UK manufacturing PMI survey, watched closely by economists, showed a reading of 50.6 in December, up from 50.2 in November.

Any reading above 50.0 indicates that activity is growing while any score below means it is contracting.

Manufacturing output increased for the third month in a row and the level of new orders for firms rose for the first time since September 2024, according to the survey.

Some businesses benefited from conditions improving at the turn of the year having come under pressure from challenges in parts of the market.

This includes those across the supply chain affected by production shutdowns at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after the British carmaker was impacted by a major cyber attack at the end of August.

The incident was linked to a drop in overall motor manufacturing during September.

Sentiment also showed signs of improving since the autumn Budget at the end of November, which provided some certainty over tax and policy measures impacting the UK’s industrial sectors.

Demand within the UK was the main driver of growth in new orders for manufacturers last month, with intakes of new work from overseas contracting for nearly four years.

However, the rate of decline in new export businesses was mild, with UK firms pointing to signs of recovery in demand from the US, the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions last month.

Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “The domestic market remained a positive spur to growth, while new export business, despite having now fallen for almost four consecutive years, took a sizeable stride towards stabilising.

“UK manufacturers benefited from several reduced headwinds towards the end of the year, as the negative impacts of the uncertainty surrounding the autumn Budget, tariffs and the JLR cyber attack all moderated.

“The start of 2026 will show if growth can be sustained after these temporary boosts subside.”

Mr Dobson said the drivers of growth need to “shift more towards rising demand” and away from firms clearing backlogs of work.

Employment within the sector also fell for the 14th month in a row, but at the slowest rate since the period of job shedding began.

Chris Barlow, head of manufacturing at accountancy and advisory firm MHA, said its clients are expecting hiring to continue to slow in 2026 and are “instead looking to find ways to work more efficiently, often by automating or improving their processes”.

He added: “Government measures, such as the confirmed increase to the minimum wage, alongside the impact of the salary sacrifice cap, are making businesses cautious about hiring new staff.”

He also said improving demand in the UK would be “vital for manufacturing’s prospects in 2026 given the path ahead for global trade is not expected to get any easier”.",http://nation.cymru/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01JK5KC3HQQ63DK4ADPT4Z9H7Y.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 03:58:55.365777

On December 24, the chip giant announced a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq, an AI inference chip company founded by former Google TPU engineers, covering its inference technology. The deal is reportedly valued at $20 billion, with Groq expected to generate $1.4 billion in revenue in 2026.

But the deal involves more than just the tech. As part of the transaction, Groq founder Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and additional team members will join Nvidia to support the advancement and scaling of the licensed tech. Ross, who will serve as Nvidia’s Chief Software Architect, previously helped build and scale Google’s TPU before co-founding Groq with other Google engineers in 2016. Groq will remain an independent company, and its GroqCloud developer platform, which provides API access to Groq’s LPUs, will keep on operating without interruption.

Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter sees the move as potentially transformative. In his view, Nvidia isn’t just adding another tool to its arsenal – it’s opening the door to a different way of thinking about AI computing altogether.

“With the deal,” says the analyst, “NVIDIA is embracing a fundamentally different processing architecture that we believe will eventually be integrated into its roadmap.”

Groq’s architecture differs fundamentally from GPUs. Its LPU (language processing unit) processors use deterministic spatial dataflow, executing operations in a fixed sequence. As a “classic example,” Buchalter compares the two architectures to factories: an LPU is like a high-speed, purpose-built assembly line, while a GPU resembles a busy factory where a manager gives tasks to workers.

An LPU is designed to make AI inference faster, more consistent, and more energy-efficient. To do this, it relies on a smart compiler that carefully plans exactly when and where each calculation happens and how data flows through the chip. In simple terms, the chip itself stays simple, while the software does all the hard work.

Groq’s LPUs are built specifically for AI inference, with Buchalter believing they are not aimed at the training market. The analyst thinks that Nvidia’s adoption of an inference-focused chip – and a new architecture – highlights how “large and mature” low-latency inference has become. Previously, AI infrastructure investments tended to prioritize training, under the logic that training chips would later serve for inference.

“This is unsurprising as the industry has indicated an increasing portion of revenue coming from inference,” Buchalter further said, “but NVIDIA’s licensing deal with Groq likely signals the inference market has scaled to the point where inference-only procurement is an increasingly material portion of the market.”

To this end, Buchalter sticks with a Buy rating on NVDA shares, assigning a $235 price target that implies ~24% upside over the next 12 months. (To watch Buchalter’s track record, click here)

Meanwhile, the broader analyst community is even more optimistic. The Street’s average price target of $262.79 suggests 39% upside, and with 39 Buys against just one Hold and one Sell, Nvidia carries a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See NVDA stock analysis)

Headquartered in Kernersville, North Carolina, Tex-Tech is a leading developer and manufacturer of proprietary, highly-engineered solutions serving aerospace, space & defense, and specialty industrial end markets. Its products are purpose-built to withstand extreme environments and support applications where performance is critical and the cost of failure is high.

(“FMI”), which is comprised of two divisions of Tex-Tech, the recently acquired Fiber Materials, Inc. out of Spirit AeroSystems and the Engineered Composites division out of SGL Carbon, will be spun out and established as an independent Arlington portfolio company. FMI is a leader in reinforced composites, with a focus on Carbon / Carbon, Rayon / Carbon, and related composites for applications in the defense, space, and aerospace end markets. FMI will be led by Scott Burkhart, former CEO of Tex-Tech Industries.

Peter Manos, a Managing Partner at Arlington, said, “During our partnership, Tex-Tech underwent a significant transformation through sizable research and development in next generation materials and coatings, with a focus on high-growth end markets and high-cost-of-failure applications. Michelin’s global footprint makes it an excellent home for Tex-Tech to expand the penetration of its innovative products to Europe and the rest of the world. This transaction exemplifies Arlington’s ability to accelerate growth through deep expertise in regulated industries and to build businesses of strategic value.”

Justin Barnett, President of Tex-Tech Industries, said, “Arlington has been a true strategic partner and together we have positioned the Company for continued success. It has been personally rewarding growing the Company’s top line at a double-digit rate over the last four years by being at the forefront of innovating advanced technical materials like our cutting-edge Thermal Protection Systems for space rocket insulation. Michelin shares our R&D-focused philosophy and will help us further cement our industry leading technical leadership.”

Gordon Auduong, a Managing Director at Arlington, added, “Tex-Tech’s focus on innovation and manufacturing excellence, coupled with an unparalleled commitment to customer success through its differentiated development and manufacturing capabilities, have enabled its transformation into the unique business that exists today. Additionally, Arlington is excited to continue its partnership with Scott and the FMI team as we continue to build FMI and support our nation as we undergo modernization of strategically important defense platforms.”

Scott Burkhart, Chief Executive Officer of FMI, said, “I look forward to building upon Tex-Tech’s success and carrying its momentum forward as we build FMI into the leading provider of innovative composite materials for our demanding defense, space, and aerospace customers.”

Closing of the transaction is expected in 1H 2026 and is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.

William Blair and Harris Williams are serving as financial advisors to Tex-Tech Industries, and Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton LLP and Morrison Foerster LLP are serving as legal advisors to Tex-Tech and Arlington. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP and DLA Piper LLP are serving as legal advisors to Michelin.

Should you buy the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing?","Creating an efficient and versatile smart home setup is a worthwhile endeavor, especially for those who work, workout, stream, game, and play at home. With so many services, gadgets, and smart devices, it can be tricky to make sure everything fits together seamlessly and easily.

I was taken aback when I first set up the LG Smart Monitor Swing, a device that looks to have a lot of functionality and versatility, in part because it's not static. The monitor swing is built on wheels and designed, it seems, for those who do a lot of different things online at home. Someone like me. I tested out this exciting gadget for a few weeks, and here's what I discovered.

Price, availability, and specs

This compelling product comprises a 4K touchscreen monitor and an adjustable rolling stand. The 31.5-inch monitor features UHD resolution, HDR10, and a 60Hz refresh rate. The monitor includes three HDMI ports and two USB ports; one of each cable is included with the unit.

The stand features wheels so that you can roll around the unit, and the arm allows for adjustments to height. You can also tilt and swivel the monitor, and rotate it from landscape to portrait orientation.

Some assembly is required; the pieces are a bit heavy and cumbersome, but a single person can put them together on their own in a relatively short amount of time.

The monitor swing stand is available from LG, Amazon, and Best Buy. It retails for $1,300, but has been found on sale for up to $500 off.

What I like about the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing

Highly versatile for work, play, and everything in between

There's a lot that this clever device does fairly well, and overall it makes for a helpful tool for someone who does a lot of different things with a screen at home. Notably, this monitor features LG's webOS, which grants you easy access to entertainment, gaming, lifestyle, and productivity apps.

Due to its size, it works well as a screen for streaming titles for an audience or one or maybe two, while also making it more than suitable as a large space for work. The HDMI and USB ports are quite handy; I used the monitor as an extension of my laptop, adding efficiency to my work day. While it can do a lot, the creation of a bigger workspace is probably the biggest draw for me as someone who works at home and does a lot of writing and connects remotely with others.

One of the main appeals of the stand is its ability to move and adjust with ease based on your needs. The wheels move fairly easily, jsut make sure you don't have anything blocking the path, because the unit in all is quite heavy. The height can be adjusted within reason, while the monitor can tilt and swivel as well. Perhaps the most fun is that the screen can be rotated from a landscape orientation to a portrait one, which can be useful in a lot of circumstances, including when casting from your phone.

A remote is included, and it resembles current smart TV models; it's durable, small, and laid out with efficiency. It includes buttons to jump to apps as well as different inputs. I found I wasn't using the touchscreen element as much as I initially thought; it's helpful in certain cases when working or sharing media, and I'm certainly happy it exists, I just didn't use it a ton.

The design is fairly clever too; the white aesthetic is neutral and accommodating, while the base features a removable lid that cleverly houses and consoles the power adapter.

What I didn't like about the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing

Screen quality and features don't serve faithful entertainment

While the Smart Monitor Swing can do a lot of different things for you throughout your day quite well, it's not really superb at most of those things. It casts a wide net of uses but is more a generalist than a specialist. Its 60Hz refresh rate and HDR10 compatibility, for example, mean it's not going to give you the action blockbuster or cinematic movie experience you'll get with a high-end TV. The monitor is not a TV screen either; the image is worthy, with quality color, but sharpness, brightness, and contrast are not going to be up to the standards of even a mid-range smart TV.

There is no battery for the monitor swing. You must keep the power adapter plugged in at all times while using, so be mindful when moving and setting up the stand.

You can connect your gaming console or enjoy cloud gaming within webOS. However, it's not ideal for serious online gamers. The refresh rate, along with a 5ms response rate, mean you're not set up with ideal circumstances for competitive online play. Ports offer HDMI 2.0 connections, but not HDMI 2.1, so you won't be getting the most out of either top gen console.

Lastly, glare is common on the screen, so you'll need to be mindful of ambient lighting and what you're watching. The glare was definitely noticeable during the daytime, and can be seen easily in several pictures I took. Lastly, it's worth noting the device has speakers, but they are not worth using, which isn't particularly surprising. With Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and HDMI connection options, there are plenty of alternatives to the built-in speakers.

Should you buy the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing?

There's certainly a lot of value to be had here provided you both appreciate the many possibilities of the monitor swing and accept its limitations. It will likely serve you best as a unique companion for work and creative endeavors, with appeal coming from its size, adjustment ability, and connectivity options. It can also supplement more casual entertainment consumption, playing games and watching titles where fidelity and visual components aren't as important.

I found a lot of uses. I enjoyed a much bigger monitor for my work space, a secondary screen that has sports on in the background, and a sizable space to share photos and videos from my phone. I rolled it into the kitchen to watch holiday movies while baking, and used it as a large personal tablet to do some shopping. After all of that, it's a product I realize I don't want to be without.",https://static0.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/12/lg-smart-4k-monitor-swing-11.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-03 16:58:42.961302

The pharmaceutical giant’s stock is trading at record levels, buoyed at the start of the year by a fresh upgrade from analysts. However, this optimism is not solely based on past performance. Aggressive price reductions in China and promising clinical trial data suggest the firm is aiming to solidify its leadership in the weight-loss medication market.

A key driver of recent news flow is the company's operational strategy. Just before the turn of the year, Eli Lilly confirmed it had cut prices for its blockbuster drug Mounjaro in China. Market observers interpret this as an aggressive play to capture market share in the world's second-largest economy.

The objective appears clear: by prioritizing volume over margin, Eli Lilly aims to pressure rival Novo Nordisk and its product Wegovy. This tactic is designed to deeply embed Lilly’s GLP-1 therapies in the Asian market, even if it temporarily weighs on profitability.

A Vote of Confidence from the Analyst Community

Institutional confidence in the company's sustained growth trajectory was underscored on Saturday, January 3, 2026, when Zacks Research upgraded Eli Lilly shares to a ""Strong-Buy"" rating. The stock had closed the previous Friday at $1,080.36, marking a new 52-week high.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Eli Lilly?

This upgrade comes during a period where Eli Lilly has already demonstrated impressive performance. With a gain of over 42% on a 12-month basis, the company has outpaced many competitors in the healthcare sector. The long-term bullish sentiment is further confirmed by institutional investors like CMH Wealth Management, which recently expanded its holdings.

Pipeline Holds Promise with Oral Candidate

Another critical factor for future prospects lies in the company's clinical pipeline. Recent Phase 3 trial data for the drug candidate Orforglipron, from the ""ATTAIN-MAINTAIN"" study, have shown promising results. This compound represents an oral alternative to the injectable treatments currently standard.

Developing an effective pill is considered a major goal in the weight-loss market, as it would appeal to patients averse to injections. Should Eli Lilly secure regulatory approval for an oral therapy ahead of its competitors, the total addressable market could expand significantly.

Looking Ahead

Investor focus now shifts to the quarterly earnings report expected in early February. A key consideration will be the extent to which international price reductions impact margins and whether the robust revenue growth—approximately 54% in the third quarter of 2025—can be sustained. From a technical perspective, the new ""Strong-Buy"" rating could provide the necessary catalyst for the shares to test the $1,100 level in the coming trading week.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2422033_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 12:13:22.612180

Eli Lilly & Co. is no longer just a blue-chip pharma name buried in retirement portfolios. Over the past few years, ""Eli Lilly & Co."" has effectively become a flagship product in its own right: a tightly integrated platform of obesity, diabetes, neuroscience, and oncology therapies that’s rewriting the rules for what a modern pharmaceutical powerhouse looks like.

The hype around Eli Lilly & Co. is anchored in a very real problem: global metabolic disease. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are ballooning into trillion-dollar public health crises, overwhelming healthcare systems and shortening lives worldwide. The company’s GLP-1–based treatments, led by its blockbuster obesity and diabetes franchise, have moved from niche therapeutics to cultural touchstones cited in earnings calls, political debates, and even celebrity interviews.

That shift has turned Eli Lilly & Co. from a conventional drug maker into a category-defining product ecosystem. Its medicines aren’t just therapies; they are becoming infrastructure for how health systems, insurers, and patients think about weight management, cardiovascular risk, and chronic disease prevention.

Get all details on Eli Lilly & Co. here

Inside the Flagship: Eli Lilly & Co.

When investors, clinicians, and regulators talk about Eli Lilly & Co. today, they’re really talking about a product portfolio anchored in one dominant theme: using metabolic and biologic innovation to rewrite the standard of care. The company’s core offering is no longer a single molecule but an integrated platform spanning obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and chronic disease management.

At the center of this is Lilly’s GLP-1 and incretin-based franchise for obesity and type 2 diabetes, which has rapidly become the company’s spiritual equivalent of a ""flagship device"" in the pharma world. These drugs, which modulate hormones involved in appetite, insulin secretion, and energy balance, have delivered startling levels of weight loss and metabolic improvement in clinical trials and real-world use.

What makes Eli Lilly & Co. so product-centric now is how this flagship franchise connects to a broader pipeline:

Metabolic disease platform: The company is evolving beyond one-off obesity drugs into a recurring, combination-based model. Newer molecules and next-generation incretins are designed to improve efficacy, boost tolerability, and expand treatment to earlier stages of metabolic dysfunction. This resembles a tech roadmap more than a traditional one-and-done pharma launch.

Cardiometabolic outcomes: Lilly is running large outcomes trials to show hard benefits beyond weight loss — including reduced cardiovascular events, improved kidney outcomes, and long-term risk reduction. If these data continue to hit, Lilly’s products don’t just compete with rival drugs; they cannibalize entire procedural categories like bariatric surgery and some interventional cardiology.

Neuroscience and Alzheimer’s disease: In parallel, Eli Lilly & Co. is building a second, high-risk, high-upside product pillar in neuroscience, with a particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease. Disease-modifying treatments targeting amyloid and related pathways could rapidly become some of the world’s most valuable drugs if efficacy and safety profiles hold.

Oncology and immunology: While less in the spotlight than obesity, Lilly’s oncology and immunology assets form a critical diversification layer. These products give the company resilience if any single category faces regulatory pushback, reimbursement tension, or safety controversies.

Strategically, Eli Lilly & Co. behaves increasingly like a platform technology company. It invests heavily in:

Data and real-world evidence: Using outcome data, claims, and long-term follow-up to strengthen its value proposition with payers and governments.

Manufacturing scale as a feature: Capacity has become a product differentiator. Lilly is spending billions to expand injection and drug-substance manufacturing so it can meet surging demand and avoid the shortages plaguing the GLP-1 category.

Patient and provider experience: Through support programs, digital tools, and co-pay assistance, Lilly is making its therapies feel more like an end-to-end product experience than a simple prescription.

In other words, Eli Lilly & Co. is less a static portfolio of molecules and more a constantly iterated suite of health technology products, updated with fresh clinical data and production scaling the same way a cloud platform adds features and regions.

Market Rivals: Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie vs. The Competition

Eli Lilly & Co. doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Its most intense rival in the current cycle is Novo Nordisk, while longtime diversified peers like Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson compete from different strategic angles. A few products define the battlefield.

Novo Nordisk and the GLP-1 showdown

Compared directly to Nova Nordisk’s Wegovy (semaglutide for obesity) and Ozempic (semaglutide for type 2 diabetes), Eli Lilly & Co.’s metabolic platform is the benchmark that investors and clinicians constantly measure against.

Efficacy: Trial data across the GLP-1/incretin class show high levels of weight loss for both Wegovy/Ozempic and Lilly’s obesity/diabetes therapies. However, Lilly’s next-generation incretin combinations have been positioned to offer more robust weight loss and metabolic control in certain patient groups. This has turned clinical comparisons into a quasi-spec war, with each new dataset treated like a product launch event.

Dosing and adherence: Both companies offer injectable formulations, often once-weekly. The race is on to deliver more convenient dosing schedules, better tolerability, and easier patient onboarding. Novo Nordisk has made early moves on oral semaglutide, while Lilly is exploring formats aimed at improving real-world adherence.

Supply chain: Wegovy and Ozempic have faced repeated supply constraints as demand exploded. Eli Lilly & Co. has faced its own bottlenecks but is investing heavily in additional manufacturing capacity. In this market, the company that can simply keep pharmacies stocked often wins prescriptions — and mindshare.

Pfizer: a rival searching for a metabolic foothold

Compared directly to Pfizer’s developmental obesity and diabetes programs, Eli Lilly & Co. looks more like a mature, fully shipped product than a roadmap. Pfizer has pursued oral obesity drug candidates and GLP-1–adjacent mechanisms, but has struggled with setbacks, safety questions, and trial discontinuations.

Time-to-market: Pfizer is years behind the Lilly–Novo duopoly in regulatory approvals and commercial infrastructure for obesity therapeutics. That delay gives Eli Lilly & Co. crucial first-mover advantages with prescribers and payers.

Brand and outcomes data: While Pfizer is a trusted name in vaccines and cardiovascular drugs, it lacks a flagship obesity product in mass clinical use. Eli Lilly & Co. is already building a dense network of real-world data and outcomes evidence that will be difficult to dislodge.

Johnson & Johnson and the diversified defense

Compared directly to Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen portfolio, Eli Lilly & Co. stands out as more concentrated on high-growth metabolic and neuroscience categories. J&J remains a diversified healthcare conglomerate with strength in medical devices and oncology, but it lacks a comparable GLP-1–driven obesity franchise.

Risk vs. resilience: Johnson & Johnson offers stability through diversification, while Eli Lilly & Co. concentrates risk and upside in a few massive therapeutic categories. For patients and payers, Lilly’s focus means sharper innovation; for investors, it means higher volatility and higher potential returns.

Across this rivalry landscape, Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie has become shorthand for owning a leading slice of the obesity and diabetes revolution — analogous to holding a dominant cloud provider in the early days of enterprise SaaS.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

So why does Eli Lilly & Co. currently outmuscle its rivals in perception, prescription, and valuation? Several structural advantages stand out.

1. A category-creating flagship

In tech terms, Lilly’s GLP-1/incretin franchise is its ""iPhone moment"" — a single family of products that redefines the category and then spawns an ecosystem around it. Instead of endlessly following patent cliffs with me-too drugs, Eli Lilly & Co. has created a highly differentiated platform that:

Delivers transformative weight loss for many patients, not just incremental change.

Targets multiple endpoints (weight, glucose, cardiovascular risk) with a single therapeutic strategy.

Anchors an expanding line of follow-on products and life-cycle extensions.

2. Execution at industrial scale

In modern pharma, manufacturing and supply reliability are as much a feature as efficacy. Eli Lilly & Co. is aggressively expanding its production footprint, pouring billions into new facilities and contract manufacturing. That industrial build-out is a competitive moat: it’s hard for latecomers to match both the clinical performance and the physical supply chain.

3. Data as a force multiplier

Lilly’s strategy leans heavily into real-world evidence and long-term outcomes trials. This data-rich approach does two things:

Strengthens the company’s hand in negotiations with insurers and national health systems, which increasingly want proof that weight loss translates into fewer hospitalizations and events.

Builds brand durability with clinicians, who grow more confident prescribing therapies backed by large, longitudinal datasets.

4. Focused but diversified pipeline

While obesity and diabetes dominate headlines, Eli Lilly & Co. has built credible second pillars in neuroscience and oncology. That gives the company:

Hedge potential if pricing pressure or political scrutiny hits obesity drugs.

Optionality to create new flagship products — especially in areas like Alzheimer’s disease, where even modest efficacy can have enormous commercial and societal impact.

5. Strong pricing power and payer appeal

Unlike many older drugs trapped in a race-to-the-bottom generic pricing cycle, Lilly’s newest products sit at the premium end of the spectrum. But because they can reduce downstream costs (fewer complications, fewer procedures), insurers are increasingly willing to pay. That combination of premium pricing and cost-offset justification is a recipe for robust, sustained margins.

In sum, Eli Lilly & Co. wins right now because it behaves less like a slow-moving incumbent and more like a high-growth product company, constantly iterating and scaling around one core thesis: that metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases can be meaningfully re-architected with modern biology.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

The transformation of Eli Lilly & Co. into a product-centric growth engine has been vividly reflected in Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie (ISIN: US5324571083).

According to real-time market data from Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch accessed shortly before publication, Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie was trading at approximately USD 775–785 per share, with a market capitalization well above USD 700 billion. Both sources indicated that the stock has delivered strong double-digit percentage gains over the past 12 months, significantly outperforming major indices like the S&P 500 and most pharmaceutical peers. The pricing and performance data referenced were based on the latest available intraday quotes and, where applicable, the last official closing price.

This valuation is not being driven by legacy products; it is a direct vote of confidence in Eli Lilly & Co. as a high-growth product platform anchored in its obesity and diabetes franchise. Several dynamics are in play:

Revenue growth from GLP-1 and incretin-based products: Sales of Lilly’s metabolic therapies have become the primary growth engine, with analysts attributing a majority of recent top-line expansion to this category. Multi-year demand projections remain aggressive as obesity treatment shifts from niche to mainstream.

Pipeline-fueled optionality: Investors are assigning substantial value to pipeline assets in Alzheimer’s disease, oncology, and next-generation metabolic drugs. Each positive trial readout or regulatory milestone is treated like a major product launch, adding layers of optionality on top of already-strong sales.

Multiple expansion vs. peers: Eli Lilly & Co. trades at a premium earnings multiple compared to more diversified peers such as Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Markets are effectively rating Lilly less like a mature pharma and more like a growth technology company with recurring revenue characteristics driven by chronic therapies.

Risk factors priced in, but not dominant: Concerns about political scrutiny over pricing, reimbursement caps, and long-term safety monitoring for obesity drugs are real. However, the current valuation suggests investors believe the structural demand and health-economic benefits of these therapies will outweigh policy friction.

For now, Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie functions as a pure-play expression of the market’s belief in the future of obesity and diabetes treatment. If the company continues to execute — by scaling supply, securing broad reimbursement, and delivering convincing outcomes data — the stock remains closely tied to the performance of its flagship product ecosystem.

Ultimately, Eli Lilly & Co. has turned a 19th-century drugmaker brand into a 21st-century health technology product story. The company’s therapies are no longer just prescriptions written in a doctor’s office; they’re strategic assets reshaping healthcare budgets, clinical guidelines, and, increasingly, the way global markets think about long-term growth.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404986_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 17:59:57.955058

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-03 14:51:45+00:00,NAI 500,Why Billionaire Investor Peter Thiel Sell Nvidia and Buy This AI Stock Instead? | NAI 500,"Caroline Kong, Author: Caroline Kong",,,,,https://nai500.com/blog/2026/01/why-billionaire-investor-peter-thiel-sell-nvidia-and-tesla-and-buy-this-ai-stock-instead/,"As of September 30, Thiel had completely exited his position in Nvidia and significantly reduced his Tesla holdings from over 272,000 shares to just 65,000 shares.
Data shows that Thiel held over 537,000 shares of Nvidia at the end of Q2, but by the end of Q3, he held none.
Nvidia is the “shovel seller” of AI hardware and computing power, while Microsoft is transforming into the “builder” and “enabler” of the AI ecosystem.
Through platforms like Azure and GitHub, Microsoft connects developers, enterprise customers, and AI model providers, building an increasingly robust AI ecosystem.
In 2026, as AI moves from technological exploration to scaled deployment, Microsoft’s ecosystem advantages are expected to amplify further.","According to the 13F filing submitted by his hedge fund, Thiel Macro, to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Silicon Valley legendary investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel executed a notable portfolio adjustment in the third quarter of 2025. As of September 30, Thiel had completely exited his position in Nvidia and significantly reduced his Tesla holdings from over 272,000 shares to just 65,000 shares.

Known for his forward-looking insights into technology trends as the first outside investor in Facebook, Thiel did not redirect the proceeds from these sales into non-tech sectors like industrials or healthcare. Instead, he made substantial purchases of Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), initiating a position of nearly 50,000 shares in Microsoft and increasing his stake in Apple. This contrarian move reflects his unique perspective on the evolving landscape of the AI industry.

Thiel’s third-quarter adjustments garnered significant attention on Wall Street. His decision to fully exit Nvidia appeared particularly bold against the backdrop of a global AI frenzy, with Nvidia’s stock price continuing to climb as a core provider of computing power. Data shows that Thiel held over 537,000 shares of Nvidia at the end of Q2, but by the end of Q3, he held none. Simultaneously, he reduced his Tesla position by more than 76%. These moves sent a clear signal: Thiel likely believes these high-flying leaders may have already priced in near-term expectations.

It is worth noting that Thiel’s investment in Microsoft has been volatile. He held no Microsoft shares in Q4 2024, built a position of nearly 80,000 shares in Q1 2025, sold all of them in Q2, and then bought nearly 50,000 shares again in Q3. This back-and-forth confirms his ongoing re-evaluation of Microsoft’s value. As of early January 2026, Microsoft’s stock price had declined about 6% since September 30 and was down roughly 2% from June 30. If Thiel remains bullish on Microsoft’s prospects, the current price may represent a more attractive buying opportunity than when he initially purchased.

The core reason Thiel chose Microsoft over continuing to bet on Nvidia lies in their different positions within the AI industry chain. Nvidia is the “shovel seller” of AI hardware and computing power, while Microsoft is transforming into the “builder” and “enabler” of the AI ecosystem. Microsoft’s unique advantage is its “neutral platform” positioning. Unlike companies developing large language models entirely in-house, Microsoft chose to strategically invest, acquiring approximately a 27% stake in OpenAI, and deeply integrated its ChatGPT into the Copilot product, spanning the entire Office suite, Bing search engine, Windows operating system, and other software.

More importantly, in its cloud business, Azure, Microsoft has adopted an open strategy. Enterprise customers can choose from various large models like Anthropic’s Claude, xAI’s Grok, China’s DeepSeek R1, and Meta’s Llama for application development. This “non-aligned” ecosystem strategy allows Microsoft to avoid technology roadmap risks and positions it as a core beneficiary of the AI software trend.

This strategy is already showing early results. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, ended September 30, 2025, Azure revenue grew by a staggering 40% year-over-year, becoming Microsoft’s fastest-growing business segment. The strong performance of the cloud business validates the core value of Microsoft as an AI infrastructure platform.

Looking ahead to 2026, Microsoft’s opportunities in the AI field will revolve around three key dimensions. First is the continued expansion of Azure. As global enterprises accelerate AI deployment, demand for flexible, scalable cloud platforms is surging. Microsoft’s multi-model support strategy allows it to meet the diverse needs of different enterprises regarding cost, performance, and regional compliance, simultaneously enhancing customer stickiness and platform value.

Second is the accelerated monetization of AI products. AI assistants like Copilot are transitioning from value-added features to core productivity tools. As user habits form and features iterate, subscription revenue from AI add-on services will become a new growth engine. Microsoft, with its dominant position in the enterprise software market, possesses the most direct path to commercialization.

Finally, there is the network effect of the ecosystem. Through platforms like Azure and GitHub, Microsoft connects developers, enterprise customers, and AI model providers, building an increasingly robust AI ecosystem. This ecosystem advantage will form a strong competitive moat; even if individual model technologies iterate, Microsoft’s value as a platform player will continue to grow.

Peter Thiel’s portfolio adjustment is, in essence, a forward-looking judgment on the distribution of value within the AI industry. He is not pessimistic about the AI trend but rather believes value is shifting from the hardware layer to the platform and application layers. With its neutral platform positioning, deep enterprise customer base, and complete cloud-to-end product matrix, Microsoft is favorably positioned within this value shift. In 2026, as AI moves from technological exploration to scaled deployment, Microsoft’s ecosystem advantages are expected to amplify further.

For investors, Thiel’s moves offer a key insight: during waves of technological change, the long-term value of infrastructure and platform builders may be more resilient than that of short-term technology leaders. When the market cheers for a particular technology, calmly seeking the next link in the value chain may be the key to achieving excess returns.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AI-chips.png,N,,2026-01-03 09:59:32.784188

Još jučer zvučalo je kao šala: serumi s puževom sluzi postali su obavezan korak u kupaonicama diljem planeta. A onda je TikTok eksplodirao, izazovi su postali viralni, a mali korejski brend CosRX preko noći je postao globalno ime. Danas ga posjeduje Amorepacific, najveći kozmetički div u zemlji. Ovaj ludi uspjeh savršeno pokazuje koliko je K-beauty narastao: od internetske znatiželje do industrije koja guta tržišta i diktira što ćemo mazati na lice.

Brojke koje zvuče nestvarno: K-beauty postaje ekonomska sila

Dok se ostatak svijeta tek prilagođava, u Južnoj Koreji K-beauty je već dugo ozbiljan biznis. Domaće tržište u 2024. procijenjeno je na oko 13 milijardi dolara, a pojedine kategorije rastu dvoznamenkastim stopama. No pravi šok stiže izvana: u prvoj polovici 2025. Južna Koreja je prestigla Francusku i postala drugi najveći svjetski izvoznik beauty proizvoda, odmah iza SAD-a. K-beauty je tako ušao u klub najvećih, i to bez kočenja.

Hallyu efekt: kako su K-pop i K-drame pogurali K-beauty do vrha

Nije slučajno da je K-beauty postao opsesija baš sada: dio je korejskog vala, poznatog kao Hallyu, koji je K-pop i K-drame pretvorio u globalni fenomen. Rezultat? Police svjetskih trgovina imaju cijele odjele posvećene korejskim proizvodima, od Sephore do Walmarta. U isto vrijeme, pretražite “Korean skincare” i dobit ćete lavinu sadržaja: “unboxing”, analize sastojaka, “Get Ready With Me” i naravno “glass skin”. To je K-beauty na steroidima.

Formula uspjeha: inovacija brža od svih i trendovi koji pale internet

Srce priče je brzina. K-beauty lansira nove formule svakih nekoliko mjeseci, često dizajnirane da postanu sljedeća viralna opsesija. Nekad su rutine od deset koraka, “water sleeping mask” ili sastojci poput “salmon sperm” zvučali nišno i odbojno. Danas su normalni. Proizvod iz Seula može istog dana završiti na feedu u SAD-u, UK-u, Indiji i Australiji. No stručnjaci upozoravaju: stalna izloženost sadržaju o njezi kože može povećati tjeskobu i potaknuti pretjeranu potrošnju.

K-beauty ulazi u rat divova: kupnje, preuzimanja i kopiranje sastojaka

Veliki igrači osjećaju miris novca. L’Oréal je krajem 2024. preuzeo korejski konglomerat s brendom Dr.G, ciljajući potražnju za učinkovitim, ali pristupačnim proizvodima. U isto vrijeme, zapadne kompanije ubacuju “korejske” sastojke u svoje linije: centella asiatica, rižina voda i sve što obećava mirniju, mladolikiju kožu. U Koreji dominiraju konglomerati, takozvani chaeboli, a Amorepacific drži oko polovice domaćeg tržišta. K-beauty više nije samo trend, to je bojište.

Tvornice koje rade kao sat: kako K-beauty izbaci hit-proizvod u šest mjeseci

Da bi nahranili potražnju, Koreja ima oko 30.000 beauty brendova i industrijski ekosustav koji izgleda kao znanstvena fantastika. Ključnu ulogu imaju ODM proizvođači koji rade istraživanje, formulaciju i proizvodnju za tisuće etiketa. Cosmax, jedan od najvećih, opskrbljuje oko 4.500 brendova i 2024. je činio više od četvrtine korejskog izvoza kozmetike vrijednog 10 milijardi dolara. Zahvaljujući automatizaciji, put od ideje do prodaje može trajati samo šest mjeseci. To je K-beauty brzina koju Zapad teško prati.

Cijena ludila: tisuće propalih brendova i pritisak na transparentnost

Iza glamura stoji brutalna istina: konkurencija je toliko žestoka da su marže tanke, a propasti česte. Prema državnim podacima, više od 8.800 kozmetičkih brendova ugasilo se posljednjih godina. Influenceri sve više traže dokaz učinkovitosti, porijeklo sastojaka i manje praznih celebrity reklama. Kupci, kažu, više ne gledaju samo ime, nego sastav i rezultate. K-beauty se zato mora stalno dokazivati: ne samo da bude viralan, nego i stvarno djelotvoran.

Undoubtedly, Michael Burry has bearish bets against both AI darlings. But he’s got more exposure to Palantir puts than Nvidia, likely because of the even hotter valuation and the potential for coming quarters to fall well short of expectations.

As for Nvidia, it’s the largest company on the planet, with ample catalysts in the new year. But until GPU sales fall off a cliff and buyers pass on Rubin, shares of Nvidia certainly do seem harder to short, at least in my opinion, especially when you consider that 24.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is nothing close to resembling a bubble. Though if the year ahead’s earnings fall well short of expectations, perhaps the seemingly cheap valuation metrics are more of a mirage than an indicator of real value.

For now, Rubin is projected to be a hit and a major catalyst that could help Nvidia stock continue defying the odds. The hyperscalers are ready to spend, and there’s probably going to be an arms race for the latest and greatest GPUs, especially when you consider the memory shortage and how it could incentivize backing up the truck whenever there’s stock, perhaps in a similar manner as the toilet paper boom during the early days of the COVID pandemic.

Billionaire Chris Rokos buys Nvidia, sells Palantir

Given Rubin Ultra, and Feynman after that, and how much is on the line to stay ahead in the AI race as Chinese rivals pick up the pace, perhaps dropping Palantir for Nvidia could be the smarter move. Undoubtedly, Michael Burry is far more bearish on one name than the other. And with famed billionaire investor Chris Rokos selling Palantir while buying into Nvidia, it seems like a smart move, not just based on relative valuation, but given the likelihood that AI demand will be in a spot to fuel a surge, the likes of which investors may not have seen since 2024.

So, should investors follow Roko’s lead by dumping Palantir for the likes of Nvidia? That’s the big question going into the new year. Personally, the valuation seems too hefty to warrant doubling down on Palantir after its latest slump, especially when you consider the magnitude of Michael Burry’s bearish bets.

Going into the new year, it feels like Burry is as confident as ever in his big bearish bets. He doesn’t think he’s too early, and he’s been keeping investors informed with his new Substack newsletter. Though I personally wouldn’t want to be a new buyer in Palantir or Nvidia, especially as the technical picture gets a bit scarier, I do think Palantir stock could stand to lose more ground if 2026 is a year when the AI bubble lets out a bit more of its air.

Additionally, there seems to be far more visibility into Nvidia than Palantir, especially when it comes to government contracts. In short, Palantir is a tougher business to understand, in my view, with a post-quarter reaction that’s even harder to gauge. As firms continue to move ahead at full speed with AI infrastructure, the case for Nvidia stock being a reasonable value right here, I think, increases.

As for Palantir, it’s tough to tell how things will pan out as AI software companies look to get in on the action. Perhaps the ultimate pick and shovels play is still the way to go. Ultimately, I think Roko’s latest move has the potential to prove well-timed as both companies head into a new year with high expectations set ahead of them.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry1-pEE.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 11:59:42.314550

So when people worry about the market's high P/E ratio, remember that the number itself doesn't tell the whole story.","Editor's note: The market rocketed to one new high after another in 2025... And if you're like many folks, you might be starting to worry. But as Joe Austin from our corporate affiliate Chaikin Analytics explains, the measure of value most folks are looking at can be misleading.

In today's Weekend Edition, we're taking a break from our usual fare to share a recent piece from the free Chaikin PowerFeed e-letter. In it, Joe explains why this metric isn't enough on its own – and reveals a better way to think about the full picture in investing.

When the market is up, people start to worry about valuations...

And one of the most popular valuation metrics is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

The calculation is simple. Divide the price of a stock by its earnings per share.

Right now, the S&P 500 Index trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of more than 30 times. Historically, that's high. But as we'll explain, this one metric doesn't tell the full story...

Here's what the P/E ratio for U.S. stocks looks like on a longer-term basis...

""Bears"" often cite high P/E ratios as a reason for caution...

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently got on this bandwagon. Back in September, he sent the market tumbling by noting in a speech that ""equity prices are fairly highly valued.""

But it's not so cut-and-dried on how important the P/E ratio is...

I talked with my colleague and Chaikin Analytics founder Marc Chaikin for his take on the importance of the P/E ratio – particularly its role in determining Power Gauge ratings.

At Chaikin Analytics, we use the Power Gauge to analyze the markets. This key tool gathers investment fundamentals and technicals into a simple rating of ""bullish,"" ""neutral,"" or ""bearish.""

Marc said that in the 1980s and 1990s, P/E ratios were highly relevant in identifying attractive stocks. Price-to-sales (P/S) ratios later took priority... then yielded to earnings growth and momentum.

Today, the Power Gauge uses the projected P/E ratio within the Earnings category, which is just one of the categories it looks at to determine a stock's rating. And it ranks that ratio on a relative basis versus other stocks.

If the projected P/E ratio drifts upward, that isn't automatically a bad sign. What matters is how the ratio ranks versus other stocks – not the absolute number.

Of course, people love to talk about P/E ratios. And they usually infer that a high P/E ratio is bad... and that a low P/E ratio is good.

But that doesn't always hold true in practice. Let's look at a couple of examples...

Two Vastly Different Moves Following 'Low' and 'High' P/E Ratios

First is athletic apparel company Lululemon Athletica (LULU)...

As a brand, Lululemon is a massive success.

The company's clothes are everywhere. And folks love them...

When asked whether they considered themselves loyal customers, 83% of Lululemon's customers said ""yes.""

And 8 out of every 10 Lululemon customers join the company's membership program. As of 2024, that program had 22 million members.

To an investor, that looks like a formidable competitive moat.

And going into 2024, Lululemon's stock looked attractive based on its historical P/E range...

As you can see, its P/E ratio had dropped from almost 90 times to around 64 times. Investors might have thought they were getting a bargain.

But consider how Lululemon's stock ended up performing...

It fell by about 25% in 2024. And it ended 2025 down roughly 46%.

As it turns out, Lululemon's products had become stale and predictable – particularly in its core U.S. market, where sales were declining.

And buying the stock just because its P/E ratio looked cheap would've lost you a lot of money.

A different example is Big Pharma firm Eli Lilly (LLY)...

Lilly's drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro generated $10.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. This made tirzepatide – which is behind both Zepbound and Mounjaro – the world's bestselling drug. Lilly now controls about 58% of the obesity drug market.

But Lilly looked expensive in January 2024. Its P/E ratio had more than tripled – from less than 30 times to more than 100 times. A skeptic would've said you were paying way too much for the stock.

Take a look at this chart...

Since then, Lilly has soared. The stock jumped by about 32% in 2024. And it closed out 2025 up roughly 40%.

These examples reveal something important...

There's More to a Good Investment Than the P/E Ratio

A low P/E ratio doesn't guarantee a good investment. And a high P/E ratio doesn't mean you should automatically avoid a stock.

Business quality and growth potential matter more than one simple valuation metric.

Plus, some stocks are cyclical – think automakers, homebuilders, and industrial companies.

Cyclical stocks flip that ""low P/E ratio"" versus ""high P/E ratio"" logic on its head...

They'll often look cheapest (with a low P/E ratio) at the worst possible time to buy. That's usually right before earnings collapse.

And the opposite is also true...

Cyclical stocks often look most expensive (with a high P/E ratio) at the best time to buy. That's when earnings have hit bottom and are about to rebound.

True, the S&P 500's valuation of more than 30 times trailing 12-month earnings is high. But again, P/E ratios alone don't determine investment success.

A stock with a low P/E ratio can still be a terrible investment if the business is deteriorating. Meanwhile, a high P/E ratio can be a powerful signal of a company's growth prospects.

So when people worry about the market's high P/E ratio, remember that the number itself doesn't tell the whole story.

In investing, what really matters is finding quality businesses with strong fundamentals and growth potential.

Good investing,

ChatGPT is morphing into an operating system, and OpenAI is designing devices with Jony Ive to replace the iPhone. The vision: users complete tasks through chatbots instead of smartphone apps, threatening Apple’s walled garden.

The reality: Journal tests show occasional wow moments surrounded by dysfunction. Traditional apps remain too capable to replace quickly.

Instacart Works Seamlessly—By Exception

ChatGPT created a vegetarian weekly menu and filled a Costco cart with ingredients, linking directly to checkout. The success required three months of joint development, shared offices, and a former Instacart CEO (now OpenAI executive) breaking a development logjam.

This level of integration isn’t scalable across the app ecosystem.

Most Apps Add Friction Rather Than Remove It

Uber inside ChatGPT estimates costs but cannot book rides—users must retype addresses on a separate webpage. OpenTable gave error messages on reservation requests. Tripadvisor showed maps for 30 seconds before failing. “Tripadvisor is being a little useless,” ChatGPT admitted.

Users Must Know Magic Incantations

Connecting to apps requires “@uber” syntax and precise phrasing. “How do I get an Uber?” fails; users must know the exact commands. This defeats the purpose of natural language interfaces.

Developers Are There for the Audience

All 12 developers interviewed said they built ChatGPT apps because their users are there—800 million of them. But apps are designed to steer users back to more capable smartphone apps or websites.

The Tollbooth Economics Are Real

Instacart pays OpenAI a transaction fee based on basket value at checkout. Whoever provides the gateway to online services owns valuable real estate—today that is Apple with its App Store fees at 30% versus OpenAI’s emerging 10-15%.

British giant WPP saw its shares plummet around 60% over the year, driven by client losses, multiple profit warnings, and fears of AI disruption eroding margins. Rivals like Omnicom, Publicis Groupe, and Interpublic Group (IPG) also faced pressure, though less severe, amid a broader narrative of agencies losing ground to automated solutions from Big Tech.

Yet, this downturn may prove temporary. Analysts argue that AI's efficiencies could spark an ""arms race"" in creative spending, while agencies' expertise in complex strategy and budget allocation remains irreplaceable. As the initial hype fades, human insight - paired with AI tools - could drive a recovery.

The AI-Driven Sell-Off: Facts from 2025

WPP's struggles epitomize the sector's pain. The company issued profit warnings in July and October, forecasting revenue declines of 3-6% and citing client caution, economic uncertainty, and a sharp drop in new business pitches (down to one-third of prior levels). Shares hit multi-decade lows, with the stock relegated from the FTSE 100 in December after a 62% yearly drop. CEO transitions and restructuring followed, including heavy AI investments to counter the threat.

Peers weren't immune: Omnicom and IPG stocks dipped amid similar concerns, though Omnicom's $13 billion acquisition of IPG (closed November 2025) created the world's largest agency group, aiming for $750 million in synergies. Publicis fared better, leveraging its CoreAI platform for growth. Overall, agency valuations hit lows not seen since 2020, with Barclays downgrading several in mid-2025 over immediate AI risks.

Client behavior fueled the fire. Brands increasingly build internal AI teams, bypassing agencies for routine tasks. Coca-Cola's 2025 holiday campaign - fully AI-generated for the second year - exemplified this: Produced with far fewer staff (20 vs. 50 traditionally), it prioritized cost savings despite backlash over ""uncanny"" visuals and perceived lack of soul. Executives defended it as forward-thinking, but consumers criticized the ""slop,"" highlighting tensions in AI adoption.

Google's Tools: Automation Without Full Replacement

Google amplified the disruption with updates to Performance Max and the new AI Max for Search suite (launched May 2025). These AI-powered features automate bidding, creatives, targeting, and even ad copy, promising 14-27% more conversions. While empowering in-house teams, they haven't solved core challenges like optimal budget allocation across fragmented channels—a human forte rooted in experience and intuition.

As one report noted, AI excels at execution but struggles with strategic nuance in a multi-platform world. Agencies like WPP are responding by developing proprietary AI (e.g., WPP Open), positioning themselves as integrators rather than casualties.

Why the Pain May Be Short-Lived

Lower AI production costs could boost overall ad spend, per JPMorgan analysts, igniting competition for standout campaigns. Agencies' vast data troves and cross-channel expertise remain hard to replicate. Morningstar's Mark Giarelli emphasized: ""The industry is being disrupted, but it’s not being disintermediated.""

Consumer shifts add complexity: Younger audiences favor ""quiet luxury,"" minimalism, influencer collabs, and resale over logo-heavy ads. Navigating this - plus ethical AI use and regulatory hurdles - demands professional guidance. As neuro-hype cools, agencies blending human creativity with AI could thrive.

In 2025, AI dented agency stocks profoundly, but the sector's resilience suggests a pivot ahead. For marketers, the future isn't obsolescence - it's evolution. Hold tight; the rebound might just be loading.

Leading wire-to-wire, the Wolverines (13-0, 3-0) faced little consternation after an initial flurry, the only exception being when standout forward Yaxel Lendeborg left for the locker room late in the first half.

Any concerns of serious injury were quickly assuaged, however, when Lendeborg rejoined the lineup to start the second half. He finished with a muted offensive stat line, scoring all eight of his points early and shooting just 3 of 10 from the floor, but it did little to hinder Michigan.

USC (12-2, 1-2) went scoreless for the game’s first 6:41, digging itself an 11-0 hole before Ezra Ausar finally got the Trojans on the board converting a successful and-one.

USC recovered briefly to cut the deficit to five points with 12 minutes left in the half but that was as close as the Trojans came. Their first-half struggles compounded seconds before intermission when, after he committed a turnover on the offensive end, Chad Baker-Mazara fouled Nimari Burnett on the ensuing Michigan fast break to garner his fourth personal.

The sequence sent Michigan into halftime ahead by 18 points and contributed to Baker-Mazara scoring just 12 points, almost 10 fewer than his season average coming into Friday’s contest.

Michigan shot just 6 of 30 from 3-point range on the night, but USC was unable to capitalize against a stingy Michigan defense. The Wolverines held the Trojans to just 20 of 58 shooting from the floor while forcing USC into 21 turnovers.

Michigan’s defensive dominance included three blocked shots from Lendeborg, three steals from Aday Mara, and two steals each from Elliot Cadeau and Johnson.

Cadeau also helped fuel the balanced Wolverines offense that featured five players scoring in double figures, dishing a game-high seven assists and grabbing six rebounds to match Johnson and Mara for the team lead.

Jaden Brownell came off the bench to lead USC with 16 points and six rebounds before fouling out. Ausar scored 15 points and grabbed six rebounds.",https://v4.dailysportspage.com/cumulus/image/856443/600/400/,N,,2026-01-03 06:57:57.810824

It is the third banking hub to open in the county, with similar services already in Calne and Royal Wootton Bassett.
""But the irony is not lost on the whole of Westbury that the banking hub is going into a building which was a bank.
The [return of a] banking hub and a post office are two things we've worked doggedly on.""
The official opening of the banking hub will take place on 9 January at 11:00 GMT, with campaigner Val Jarvis - who launched a petition to reinstate banking services to Westbury - set to cut the ribbon.","A permanent banking hub has opened in a town after years of campaign work.

The facility on the High Street in Westbury, Wiltshire, is operating in a former Barclays bank building which shut in 2019.

It is the third banking hub to open in the county, with similar services already in Calne and Royal Wootton Bassett.

""It's brilliant news,"" said Westbury's mayor, Jane Russ. ""But the irony is not lost on the whole of Westbury that the banking hub is going into a building which was a bank. The [return of a] banking hub and a post office are two things we've worked doggedly on.""

Banking hubs offer a counter service operated by the Post Office, where customers can carry out cash transactions, ask questions and receive advice.

Westbury's new banking hub was recommended by LINK, the UK's ATM network, after a community request and campaign work by residents, Westbury Town Council and former mayor Sheila Kimmins.

Gareth Oakley, CEO at Cash Access UK, which runs the facility, said it would ensure ""crucial access to cash and face-to-face banking services for residents and businesses across the community"".

While the new hub was being refurbished, a temporary one was set up at the Laverton building in Westbury.

It is hoped the permanent location will complement Westbury's rotunda project, which will see a space near the town's library used to host more events.

Ms Russ said: ""The temporary banking hub was a little out of town and up a hill which meant it wasn't useful for everyone. I'm delighted this new permanent hub has been sorted out.

""By the time we've got the rotunda sorted, this will all suddenly alter the whole feel of the high street in Westbury. If a town looks loved, it will be.""

The official opening of the banking hub will take place on 9 January at 11:00 GMT, with campaigner Val Jarvis - who launched a petition to reinstate banking services to Westbury - set to cut the ribbon.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/360e/live/9db3b300-e7b2-11f0-a5c4-2f5ecdd63f6f.png,N,,2026-01-03 02:58:47.652389

Rising originations effect on MI Mortgage originations are expected to increase this year, and this will benefit the mortgage insurers' new insurance written volume, Fitch said.
""NIW credit quality has not deteriorated despite home-affordability challenges,"" the Fitch report added.
How commercial real estate sales affect title companies in 2026 Expectations that commercial real estate transaction volume will grow this year are another positive for the title business in the Fitch report.
KBW takes a similar position on the impact of commercial real estate transactions for title insurers this year.","The nation's private mortgage insurers are adequately capitalized to deal with the housing market's challenges during 2026, so on balance they have a neutral outlook for next year, Fitch Ratings said.

Processing Content

""We expect strong borrower credit profiles, relatively stable employment levels, and persistent home price appreciation to help mitigate pressures from ongoing housing-affordability challenges,"" Fitch analysts Christopher Grimes, Tana Marcom and Laura Kaster wrote.

Fitch's outlook incorporates the impact of the potential stress of a slowing U.S. economy in 2026 on mortgage insurers, the report issued on Dec. 30 said.

""New business pricing has been stable, with conservative underwriting across the industry amid economic uncertainty,"" Fitch said.

All of the active firms are adopting black-box pricing, which has also led to market share shifts.

Meanwhile, Fitch expressed a small level of concern regarding default activity in 2026; mortgage insurers only pay out claims after the loan goes into foreclosure.

""Headline unemployment figures have not meaningfully risen, but the pace of recent hiring activity has been slowing, which could pressure some borrowers if hiring slows further in 2026,"" the report said. ""However, strong borrower credit characteristics and favorable home equity appreciation for most homeowners should moderate the frequency and severity of ultimate MI claims.""

Rising originations effect on MI

Mortgage originations are expected to increase this year, and this will benefit the mortgage insurers' new insurance written volume, Fitch said. Fannie Mae projects $2.37 trillion for 2026, up from $1.92 trillion; the Mortgage Bankers Association's forecast is for $2.2 trillion, compared with $2.05 trillion during 2025.

But unlike title insurance, MI production is not correlated with total loan volume. Private MI is used in the conforming market only for originations with loan-to-value ratio over 80%. It is not needed for many non-qualified mortgages. Government-guarantee programs cover other loans.

""NIW credit quality has not deteriorated despite home-affordability challenges,"" the Fitch report added. ""MI competitors in aggregate reported relatively stable delinquency levels in the third quarter, with the overall industry delinquency rate increasing to 2.15% from 1.98% year-over-year.""

The increase is likely a result of normal portfolio seasoning and typical calendar-based seasonal loss activity, the analysts continued.

Just under half of the current insurance-in-force as of the end of the third quarter was produced between 2020 and 2022.

Persistency, a measure of how much business remains on the books from 12 months' prior, is likely to come under pressure if rates decline further, resulting in higher portfolio turnover. Through Sept. 30, 2025, persistency averaged 84% over the prior 12 months.

""Fitch believes a disciplined approach to capital management, characterized by strong private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (PMIERS) ratios, strategic capital allocation, and a focus on liquidity will continue to bolster ratings in the MI sector in 2026,"" the report noted.

The rating agency will continue to monitor merger and acquisition trends to expand beyond the core business, such as Radian's decision to buy a specialty insurer while selling its title, conduit and real estate services businesses.

""Additionally, the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could mean greater opportunities for private MIs, but also invite more regulatory and market uncertainty, requiring careful capital and risk management,"" Grimes, Marcom and Kaster wrote.

How the large title insurers will do in 2026

Earlier in December, Fitch also put out a title insurance outlook, which also is neutral, ""reflecting expectations for stable profitability and ratings.

""Strong capital positions, modestly higher origination volumes, and continued expense management will support the sector's margins and ratings in the coming year,"" Fitch said.

Title loss ratios should remain at favorable levels, as the underwriters benefit from premium growth and a continued focus on expense management.

""Risks to sector performance include a substantial increase in mortgage rates, tighter credit conditions or economic deterioration, which could pressure volumes and margins,"" a press release said. ""However, Fitch's baseline scenario anticipates manageable headwinds and continued stability in ratings for the sector in 2026.""

The Federal Housing Finance Agency's Title Acceptance Pilot — introduced by the Biden Administration and expanded by current director Bill Pulte — will not affect the sector's ratings because of its limited scope.

On Dec. 3, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods held its annual title day, with the four major underwriters.

The tone regarding the industry's regulation from the four companies — Fidelity National Financial, First American, Stewart and Old Republic — was ""fairly positive,"" KBW said, with no incremental updates from the FHFA and Bill Pulte, its director. The title pilot ends in May.

One regulatory cloud on the title business is a 6.2% reduction in rates in Texas, which state regulators will put into effect on March 1 (the rollback was finalized on Dec. 12, 2025).

Regulators have previously pushed for a 10% reduction, which was put on hold by a court injunction.

""FNF had disclosed earlier that the impact of even a 10% premium reduction in Texas would be negligible,"" the KBW report said.

How commercial real estate sales affect title companies in 2026

Expectations that commercial real estate transaction volume will grow this year are another positive for the title business in the Fitch report. Rated national title underwriters' ability to maintain favorable margins because of their higher premiums versus residential transactions is contingent on this trend.

In the first nine months of last year, the commercial business was a significant 20% share of premiums.

KBW takes a similar position on the impact of commercial real estate transactions for title insurers this year.

""While the timing of any recovery in the residential purchase market remains uncertain, the title insurance sector should continue to benefit from the strong level of activity in the commercial real estate market, which is expected to continue into 2026 and should provide a bridge to an eventual recovery in the purchase market,"" the report on the event from Bose George and Frankie Labetti said.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89992d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1020x536+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F22%2F6b6236db493d8417508e1c0c9e65%2Fnmn010226-fitch-16x9.png,N,,2026-01-03 10:59:54.158515

Light strips and other lights with a gradient function now offer another mode in addition to Linear, Mirrored, and Diffuse. In this blog post, you’ll learn what “Segmented” is all about.

Where exactly can you find the new mode and the different styles? It’s very simple: First, select the desired gradient light in the Hue app and then activate a color in the colorful color wheel. A small button will appear at the bottom right of the brightness control. Tap on it to open a menu showing the available modes.

Linear: Creates a linear color gradient where you can freely set three light points. The colors in between are generated automatically.

Mirrored: A linear color gradient in which the effect is mirrored in the middle of the light strip.

Scattered: Up to five colors of your choice are mixed and distributed across the various lights (such as the Hue Festavia string of lights) or the zones of the light strip.

Segmented: You can select up to five different colors. Unlike in linear mode, no color gradients are generated between the colors.

If the new mode is not yet visible to you, a software update may be necessary. It is best to activate the automatic update and leave the light strip or light connected to the power supply.

This is what the new Hue effect looks like

I have already tried out the new segmented mode with a Philips Hue Flux light strip, which I installed behind a Kallax shelf. Here you can clearly see the four different colors I selected in the Hue app. The individual segments are clearly separated and, unlike before, no color gradients are generated.

Unfortunately, there are still some things that don’t work: you can’t combine true white tones with colorful colors.

Frontier Airlines sends threatening note to flight attendants In the run-up to New Year’s Eve 2025, flight attendants at Frontier Airlines received the following email addressing a spike in sickness amongst crew members: ""Let me make it clear: this trend is unacceptable and unsustainable.
The vast majority of our flight attendants consistently uphold their responsibilities with professionalism and dependability, and this policy reinforces that standard.""
As Frontier provided prior warning, it can legitimately ask all flight attendants to provide a doctor’s note for sick calls.
In a memo to its members, however, the AFA urged flight attendants to prioritize their health.","With cases of flu and other respiratory illnesses surging across the United States, it’s probably not surprising that sick calls are spiking in workplaces around the country. Not least, in customer-facing jobs where employees are surrounded by sick and infectious people.

But just before the New Year, flight attendants at Frontier Airlines received an unusually blunt email from the Denver-based budget carrier. The tone was painfully clear: the airline believes that crew members are abusing their sick leave, and Frontier was going to take action to stamp it out.

Frontier Airlines sends threatening note to flight attendants

In the run-up to New Year’s Eve 2025, flight attendants at Frontier Airlines received the following email addressing a spike in sickness amongst crew members:

""Let me make it clear: this trend is unacceptable and unsustainable. While illness and legitimate emergencies do happen, the frequency and timing of sick calls have reached a point where we can confidently say this protection is no longer being used as intended and where drastic action is now necessary.

Reliability is a fundamental expectation of this role that each of us committed to when choosing this career. When absenteeism increases, aircraft don't takeoff, schedules collapse, and trust, both internally and externally is eroded.""

So, how does Frontier plan to slash sickness rates? Since December 30, 2025, flight attendants are expected to provide a doctor’s note for any sickness.

Frontier says the policy is being enforced “without exception” and that failure to provide an official sick note will go down as an unexcused absence, which could then lead to disciplinary proceedings.

The email from Frontier added:

""This action is necessary to safeguard operational integrity and ensure fairness to those who act responsibly every day. The vast majority of our flight attendants consistently uphold their responsibilities with professionalism and dependability, and this policy reinforces that standard.""

Union says airline is within its rights

When you’re stuck in a metal tube for up to 12 hours or longer a day, surrounded by members of the public, battling tiredness from early starts and late finishes, and staying in different hotels every night, it’s probably no surprise that sickness rates amongst flight attendants are higher than the average office worker.

It appears, however, that Frontier doesn’t believe the spike in sick calls is completely down to legitimate sickness. But while the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA), which represents crew members at Frontier, says it doesn’t agree with the policy or the tone or the email from the airline, it says Frontier is well within its rights.

Under the current flight attendant contract, Frontier is allowed to impose periods where all flight attendants must present a doctor’s note for sickness, so long as prior warning is given.

As Frontier provided prior warning, it can legitimately ask all flight attendants to provide a doctor’s note for sick calls. And while the contract provides examples like the Christmas Holidays or Super Bowl weekend when fake sick calls might spike, it appears as if Frontier is allowed to designate periods whenever it thinks it is required.

In a memo to its members, however, the AFA urged flight attendants to prioritize their health. “While attendance expectations exist, no one should feel pressured to fly while sick,” the memo read. “Taking care of yourself protects you, your crew, and your passengers.”

CDC estimates 7.5 million flu cases so far this season

After a particularly rough flu season during flu season in Australia and New Zealand, health experts have been anticipating a similar trend in Europe and North America. Unfortunately, those predictions are proving to be correct.

As of December 20, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there have been 7.5 million flu illnesses so far this season, resulting in 81,000 hospitalizations, and 3,100 deaths.

In its weekly influenza report, the CDC warned that flu activity is “elevated and continues to increase across the country.”

United Airlines won a legal battle to demand a doctor’s note

In July 2024, United Airlines also introduced a mandatory doctor’s note policy for all sick calls from flight attendants after witnessing a spike in callouts from crew members that allegedly coincided with weekends.

Giving flight attendants just 24 hours’ notice of the policy, United said it would require an absence certificate obtained at the crew members’ expense if they reported sick for any trip that departed on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.

The United branch of AFA-CWA called the policy ‘reprehensible’ and launched a legal challenge, arguing that their contract prohibited United from demanding absence certificates with the exception of the Fourth of July and Christmas holiday period.

Nearly a year later, an independent arbitrator said the flight attendant contract did, in fact, give United the unilateral power to demand an absence certificate when there was evidence of “abuse or misuse of sick leave.”

United had provided evidence to the arbitrator that showed a “dramatic and sustained surge in weekend sick calls,” with sickness rates at the weekend surging to 22% in the months before the policy was implemented.

Ultimately, United suspended the weekend sickness policy just weeks after it was implemented, claiming that it had achieved the desired effect of reducing sick calls back to acceptable levels.",https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1445228615-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 06:57:53.949237

Für Anleger stellt sich die Frage, welche konkreten Vorteile diese Kooperation für UPM-Kymmene bringen könnte. Die Genehmigungsphase ist abgeschlossen, doch die eigentliche Bewährungsprobe steht noch bevor.

Partnerschaft im Holzsektor nimmt Gestalt an

Die strategische Allianz zwischen UPM-Kymmene und Versowood zielt darauf ab, die Position beider Unternehmen im Bereich der Holzverarbeitung zu stärken. Während UPM-Kymmene als diversifizierter Forstkonzern mit Aktivitäten von Papier bis Bioenergie bekannt ist, bringt Versowood spezialisierte Kompetenzen in der Holzindustrie ein.

Der Zeitpunkt der Genehmigung zum Jahresende lässt vermuten, dass beide Partner zügig mit der operativen Umsetzung beginnen wollen. Dennoch bleibt abzuwarten, wie schnell sich mögliche Synergieeffekte tatsächlich realisieren lassen.

Shortly after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States, he signed an executive order creating the MAHA Commission.
“The American food system is safe but could be healthier,” the commission said.
“We must act boldly to eliminate the root causes of chronic illness and improve the health of our food supply,” Kennedy Jr. said.
During the Institute of Food Technologists’ IFT FIRST conference in July, Martin Hahn, partner at Hogan Lovells US, recommended manufacturers adopt a short-term strategy of aligning product development with the goals of MAHA.","KANSAS CITY — Make America healthy again (MAHA) has transitioned from political slogan to a federal initiative spearheaded by the US Department of Health and Human Services and intended to drive change throughout the food and beverage supply chain. As a result, manufacturers of products perceived as ultra processed or containing shunned ingredients like additives, artificial colors or synthetic colors are under pressure to reformulate. The challenge facing companies is many MAHA initiatives are founded in perception and not supported by science.

Shortly after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States, he signed an executive order creating the MAHA Commission. In May, the commission published a report it said was intended to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases in children by reducing their exposure to ultra-processed foods (UPFs), chemicals like pesticides and ensuring they are not over medicated.

“The American food system is safe but could be healthier,” the commission said. “Most children’s diets are dominated by ultra-processed foods high in sugars, chemical additives and saturated fats while lacking sufficient intakes of fruits and vegetables.”

The commission noted that nearly 70% of an American child’s calories today come from UPFs. The report provided a broad definition of UPFs as “packaged or ready-consume products that are formulated for shelf life and/or palatability but are typically high in added sugars, refined grains, unhealthy fats, sodium and low in fiber and essential nutrients.”

Statistically, the report claimed roughly 70% of the over 300,000 branded food products available in grocery stores today are ultra processed.

Three problematic ingredients identified in the report were ultra-processed grains, sugars and fats.

“These engineered components, virtually nonexistent a century ago, now account for over two-thirds of all calories consumed by American children,” the report said.

Other ingredients identified as contributing to the poor health of American children included emulsifiers, binders, sweeteners, colorings and preservatives, specifically, titanium dioxide, propylparaben, butylated hydroxytoluene and artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose and saccharin.

“Additives in processed foods are consumed in complex combinations, where cumulative and synergistic effects may amplify harm beyond individual components,” according to the report. “Yet, testing often ignores these interactions, particularly in children. With dozens of additives consumed daily, these overlooked risks could be significantly impacting children’s health.”

The report drew swift responses from industry groups, with the main critiques being a lack of inclusiveness in its development and the evidence used to support its recommendations.

In a letter to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the HHS, more than 250 food and agriculture groups requested an opportunity to participate in future decisions by the committee.

“As organizations representing millions of farmers, ranchers, food producers and ingredient manufacturers, we write to urge you to ensure food and agriculture have a seat at the table during the development of policy recommendations related to the recent Make America Healthy Again Commission report, as well as any future commission activities,” the letter said. “The process by which the commission’s most recent report was created lacked transparency and any opportunity for public engagement. As a result, the report contained numerous errors and distortions that have created unfounded fears about the safety of our food supply.”

Additionally, the letter included references to an article published by the news service Notus that said while the MAHA Commission report cited over 500 studies, the citations contained errors ranging from broken website links to misstated conclusions. Seven of the cited sources did not appear to exist at all, according to the Notus article.

The industry response may have resonated, because when a second MAHA Commission report was published in September, its recommendations focused on removing foods perceived as unhealthy from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and revising the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Going forward, the second report recommended research be conducted on the health effects of products such as UPFs.

“NIH (the National Institutes of Health) will partner with FDA (the Food and Drug Administration), USDA, and the administration for a Healthy America to conduct high quality nutrition research and ingredient assessments,” the second report said. “As part of this effort, NIH will expand research on dietary patterns that support metabolic health. NIH and HHS will take steps to fully utilize the newly created FDA and NIH Joint Nutrition Regulatory Science Program. USDA will prioritize precision nutrition research.”

The FDA also has begun the process of defining UPFs, seeking information from interested parties about what constitutes such products.

“We must act boldly to eliminate the root causes of chronic illness and improve the health of our food supply,” Kennedy Jr. said. “Defining ultra-processed foods with a clear, uniform standard will empower us even more to make America healthy again.”

While MAHA’s primary focus has been on UPFs, its most significant impact has been on the use of synthetic colors in formulations. In April, the FDA said it intended to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes.

While the FDA’s current initiatives are voluntary, many food and beverage companies have said they plan to stop using the ingredients.The main reason is states like California, Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia have passed laws banning the ingredients, and, even though federal law is supposed to supersede state law, the FDA has shown no intention of asserting its authority to regulate food ingredients.

That has left food manufacturers with few options other than to begin phasing out synthetic dyes.

During the Institute of Food Technologists’ IFT FIRST conference in July, Martin Hahn, partner at Hogan Lovells US, recommended manufacturers adopt a short-term strategy of aligning product development with the goals of MAHA.

“MAHA has been very effective at getting states to pass ingredient bans, so when you are formulating products today, you need to be aware of those states that have banned ingredients, such as certified colors being banned in West Virginia,” he said. “We need to be formulating products today that will be compliant with future regulations.”",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2025/05/27/MAHA-lead----WINDCOLORS.jpg?height=635&t=1748354435&width=1200,N,,2026-01-03 07:57:52.587700

The change is aimed at addressing long-standing consumer complaints about partial reimbursements and limited customer service options.
Delivery platforms will now be required to provide customers with an itemized breakdown of each transaction and offer access to a human customer service representative.
The measure builds on California’s Fair Food Delivery Act of 2020, which imposed a series of restrictions on third-party delivery platforms following allegations of unfair business practices.
That earlier law capped delivery fees and required greater transparency between restaurants, delivery companies and customers.","Food delivery apps will soon have to change how they handle refunds in California.

Starting Thursday, Jan. 1, a new state law will require platforms like DoorDash, Uber Eats and others to issue full cash refunds rather than in-app credits when customers experience missing or incorrect orders. The change is aimed at addressing long-standing consumer complaints about partial reimbursements and limited customer service options.

Under Assembly Bill 578, authored by Democratic Assemblywoman Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who has said her own experience with food delivery problems helped inspire the legislation, food delivery companies must refund the full amount of an order, including taxes and tips, to the customer’s original payment method when a delivery is not completed as promised. In cases where only part of an order is missing or incorrect, companies are still permitted to issue partial refunds.

The law also introduces new transparency and customer service requirements. Delivery platforms will now be required to provide customers with an itemized breakdown of each transaction and offer access to a human customer service representative. Human contact is mandatory when a customer’s issue cannot be resolved through automated systems, according to the filing.

In addition, AB 578 includes safeguards designed to address potential fraud, allowing companies to investigate suspicious refund requests while still complying with the law’s consumer protection standards.

The measure builds on California’s Fair Food Delivery Act of 2020, which imposed a series of restrictions on third-party delivery platforms following allegations of unfair business practices. That earlier law capped delivery fees and required greater transparency between restaurants, delivery companies and customers.

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB 578 into law in October. The California governor framed the bill as part of a broader push to strengthen consumer protections in the state.

“California is hard at work to help make your life more affordable,” Newsom said in a statement at the time. “These new laws reflect who we are: a state that protects workers, respects students, puts people before politics, and isn't afraid to hold powerful interests accountable.”

Consumer advocates have long criticized food delivery platforms for relying on app credits instead of cash refunds, arguing that credits can expire, limit customer choice and pressure users to continue using the same service after a negative experience. Supporters of AB 578 say the new requirements ensure customers are properly compensated when a delivery fails, without strings attached.",https://people.com/thmb/9OsgjM3336fkIyZQHBkhctR_908=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(639x0:641x2)/food-delivery-app-wars-grubhub-vs-uber-eats-5080528-1-22f63d30687d4b8bbb113b9e9e9c6915.png,N,,2026-01-02 23:58:24.930723

The S&P Global Vietnam Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index ended the year at 53.0, down slightly from 53.8 in November but still comfortably above the 50.0 no change mark and signalling a solid monthly improvement in the overall health of the sector, the company stated.

Andrew Harker, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote in the release: ""The Vietnamese manufacturing sector ended a turbulent year on a positive note, with output and new orders rising solidly again and business confidence hitting a 21-month high.""

""Overall, the sector goes into 2026 in a positive position, with manufacturers optimistic of securing new business and being able to expand their production capacity. S &P Global Market Intelligence forecasts industrial production growth of 6.7% in 2026,"" he added.

The final month of 2025 saw the Vietnamese manufacturing sector remain ""firmly inside growth territory"".

Firms expanded output solidly again amid rising new orders, with better weather conditions helping to boost capacity. Employment increased, aiding efforts to reduce backlogs of work.

Vietnamese manufacturers again registered growth of production in December, extending the current sequence of expansion to eight months.

Although weather conditions were more stable in December, the severe typhoons and flooding seen in previous months continued to impact the manufacturing sector at the end of the year, principally due to the effect of damage to raw materials on their delivery and supplier delays caused by flooding.

Suppliers' delivery times lengthened markedly again, within stances of delays only slightly less pronounced than the three-and-a-half year record posted in November.

Meanwhile, input costs increased at the fastest pace since June 2022 amid material scarcity and unfavourable exchange rate movements. In turn, output prices increased solidly, with the pace of inflation little-changed from November. The latest rise was much faster than the average for 2025 as a whole.

Although input costs increased rapidly, manufacturers still raised their purchasing activity sharply amid higher new orders and greater output requirements. Moreover, the pace of growth quickened to a 16-month high. Stocks of inputs also rose, the third month running in which this has been the case.

Stocks of finished goods, on the other hand, fell solidly as completed items were dispatched promptly to customers.

The National Assembly, Vietnam's legislature, on November 12 approved a resolution setting an economic expansion target of at least 10% for 2026, per capita GDP at $5,400-5,500, and inflation controlled at around 4.5%.

The government aimed to enlarge the national economy by 8.3-8.5% for 2025. GDP grew 7.85% in the first nine months. The figure was the second-highest levels in 11 years, except for 2023 which saw a strong surge post the pandemic.

Vietnam's economic outcomes in 2025 are yet to be released by the General Statistics Office.

Standard Chartered in late October raised its Vietnam GDP growth forecast to 7.5% for 2025 from the previous 6.1%, and to 7.2% for 2026 from 6.2%, following HSBC's revising up its prediction to 7.9% (from 6.6%) and 6.7% (from 5.8%), respectively.",https://t.ex-cdn.com/theinvestor.vn/560w/files/news/2026/01/03/screenshot-2026-01-03-102557-105820.png,N,,2026-01-03 11:14:19.472129

Coach Jordi Fernández gave rookie Nolan Traore some tough love coming off the court after some ill-advised 3-point heaves made that clear.

“It’s been throughout the games, and obviously me playing him more minutes and making sure that he can continue to play.","The Nets trailed for the final 28 minutes of Thursday night’s loss to the Rockets.

But that doesn’t mean those minutes were meaningless.

Coach Jordi Fernández gave rookie Nolan Traore some tough love coming off the court after some ill-advised 3-point heaves made that clear.

The French teen is a good penetrator and downhill player but had just two assists to two turnovers, and shot just 1-for-8 overall, 1-for-5 from deep on shots he was mostly lured into.

“I need him to use his superpowers and touch the paint. And it felt like he got caught shooting the unders. And a lot of times it didn’t go … because that’s what they want you to do,” Fernández said. “And if you keep shooting and missing, then sometimes, if you keep doing the same thing and seeing the same results, that’s the definition of insanity. And I know how good he is.

“He can play pick-and-roll; he can touch the paint; he can reject pick-and-rolls; he can play with a pass. Two assists and two turnovers is just not good enough. That’s why I needed him to understand: that I need more. I’m OK with a pull-up 3; I don’t love it because he hasn’t shown that he can make it consistently. He can shoot as many catch-and-shoot 3s as he wants, but I didn’t think he played the game the way I wanted to play the game. If he gets 1 percent better [Friday] that’s what I want to see.”

The Nets were missing three-fifths of their starting lineup.

Michael Porter Jr. was out with an illness, Terance Mann was out with a right hip contusion, and lottery pick Egor Dëmin had lower back soreness.

“It’s been throughout the games, and obviously me playing him more minutes and making sure that he can continue to play. So, that’s something that popped up, but we believe he’ll be fine soon,” Fernández said. “He’ll be supporting his teammates and ready for the next one.”

Industry optimism and investment sentiment have strengthened, although cautiously, according to a new report by GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Biotech Index, reflected the renewed levels of optimism, showcasing its strongest performance since 2014.
Looking ahead at 2026, these sentiments are reiterated, according to GlobalData’s latest report, “The State of the Biopharmaceutical Industry 2026”.
As the industry looks ahead to 2026, the upcoming JP Morgan Healthcare conference will be a pivotal indicator on the direction for the biopharma sector for 2026.","Against the backdrop of a turbulent year marked by both breakthrough and setbacks, the biopharmaceutical industry is entering 2026 with renewed confidence. Industry optimism and investment sentiment have strengthened, although cautiously, according to a new report by GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.

In 2025, the biopharmaceutical industry began the year with strong scientific and commercial momentum with a high level of optimism with large deals seen around the JP Morgan Healthcare conference, including Johnson & Johnson’s $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies for its neuroscience portfolio, as well as GSK’s $1 billion deal with IDRx, and Eli Lilly acquiring an oncology drug candidate from Scorpion Therapeutics for $2.5 billion.

Hannah Hans, Head of Pharma Strategic Intelligence at GlobalData, comments: “However, industry sentiment quickly turned cautious. Q2 2025 saw the biopharma industry adopt a more guarded stance. Announcements of US drug pricing reforms under the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) policy, tariffs, and trade uncertainties, combined with the looming patent cliffs, and rising costs collectively drove a more cautious outlook.”

Companies recalibrated in response to these pressures, and by Q3, they had adjusted cost structures and clarified development priorities. In addition, several large pharma companies engaged with the Trump administration to reach deals on drug pricing. The sector saw major deals with Pfizer outbidding Novo Nordisk to re-enter the obesity market with Metsera’s clinical-stage GLP-1 receptor agonist and amylin analogs, and Novartis acquiring Avidity to strengthen its neuromuscular disease portfolio. Out-licensing activity continued, highlighted by GSK’s $12.5 billion licensing deal with Jiangsu Hengrui reinforcing the growing strength and global relevance of innovation from China.

In November, the Jefferies Healthcare 2025 conference provided a valuable temperature check on the industry’s appetite for deals. Executives projected confidence about the opportunities and market outlook for 2026, while acknowledging the larger acquisitions Merck and Pfizer completed earlier in the year. They highlighted strong interest in breakthrough, innovative early science and the need for differentiating later-stage companies with promising results. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Biotech Index, reflected the renewed levels of optimism, showcasing its strongest performance since 2014.

Looking ahead at 2026, these sentiments are reiterated, according to GlobalData’s latest report, “The State of the Biopharmaceutical Industry 2026”. As per the report’s survey, 52% of pharmaceutical professionals felt optimistic or very optimistic about the industry’s growth in 2026, which is up by 10% compared to data gathered six months ago.

Additionally, 39% of the surveyed pharmaceutical industry professionals reported being optimistic or very optimistic on the recovery of biotech funding in the next 12 months, an increase by 15% from results seen in May 2025. This reflects a slightly more positive outlook compared to earlier in the year, which could be due to clarity on external factors such as MFN, tariffs, as well an increase in deal activity.

As the industry looks ahead to 2026, the upcoming JP Morgan Healthcare conference will be a pivotal indicator on the direction for the biopharma sector for 2026. The event will set the tone for dealmaking, capital flow and R&D priorities in the year ahead, as executives look to reaffirm investor confidence, aligning on the next wave of scientific and commercial breakthroughs to strengthen pipelines.

Hans concludes: “As we look to 2026, strong drug pipelines and breakthrough clinical catalysts will drive the sector, as pricing pressures are addressed, innovation and differentiation will take centre stage, and strategic deals accelerate growth and portfolio transformation.”

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The lesser performance of some Basket Components will mitigate, and may completely offset, the greater performance of other Basket Components.
In addition, high correlation of movements in the values of Basket Components could adversely affect your return during periods of decline for the Basket Components.","Unlike ordinary debt securities, the Notes do not pay interest and do not guarantee the return of the full principal amount at maturity. Instead, as described below, the Notes offer leveraged exposure to potential appreciation of the Basket from the Initial Basket Value to the Final Basket Value, subject to the Maximum Return. Investors should be willing to forgo dividend payments and, if the Final Basket Value is less than the Initial Basket Value, be willing to lose some or all of their investment at maturity.

consent to u.k. bail-in power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes results from several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement.

PS- 5

Selected Purchase Considerations

The Notes are not appropriate for all investors. The Notes may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

·You do not seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

·You understand and accept that you may not participate in the full appreciation of the Basket, which may be significant, and that your potential return on the Notes is limited to the Maximum Return.

·You can tolerate a loss of some or all of your principal amount, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Basket.

·You anticipate that the Final Basket Value will be greater than the Initial Basket Value.

·You understand and accept the risks that (a) the performance of lesser performing Basket Components will mitigate the performance of better performing Basket Components and (b) you may lose a significant portion of your investment even if one or more Basket Components performs positively.

·You understand and accept the risk that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Basket Value is less than the Initial Basket Value.

·You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Basket Components.

·You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of the Basket Components, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to the Basket Components.

·You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Basket.

·You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity.

·You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

·You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

·You seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

·You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of the Basket rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Maximum Return.

·You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of your Notes in the event that the Final Basket Value falls below the Initial Basket Value.

·You do not anticipate that the Final Basket Value will be greater than the Initial Basket Value.

·You are unwilling or unable to accept the risks that the performance of lesser performing Basket Components will mitigate the performance of better performing Basket Components and that you may lose a significant portion of your investment even if one or more Basket Components performs positively.

·You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Basket Components, and/or that is based on a weighted allocation of the Basket Components as set forth herein.

·You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to, the Basket Components.

·You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Basket.

·You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity.

·You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings.

·You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

·You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the appropriateness of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement, the prospectus and the prospectus supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the Notes for investment.

Hypothetical EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE at Maturity

The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption:

§Hypothetical Initial Component Value of each Basket Component: $100.00*

*The hypothetical Initial Component Value of $100.00 for each Basket Component has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual Initial Component Values for the Basket Components. The actual Initial Component Value for each Basket Component is set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement.

For information regarding recent values of the Basket Components, please see “Information Regarding the Basket Components” in this pricing supplement.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated:

Example 1: The Basket Return is 90.00%.

Basket Component Initial Component Value Final Component Value Basket Component Return KO Basket Component $100.00 $200.00 100.00% PG Basket Component $100.00 $180.00 80.00% VZ Basket Component $100.00 $190.00 90.00%

Step 1: Calculate the Final Basket Value.

The Final Basket Value is calculated as follows:

100 × [1 + (1/3 × 100.00%) + (1/3 × 80.00%) + (1/3 × 90.00%)] = 190.00

Therefore, the Final Basket Value is 190.00, resulting in a Basket Return of 90.00%.

PS- 7

Step 2: Calculate the payment at maturity.

Because the Final Basket Value is greater than the Initial Basket Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,266.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × lesser of (a) Basket Return × Upside Leverage Factor and (b) Maximum Return)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × lesser of (a) 90.00% × 3.00 and (b) 26.60%)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 26.60%) = $1,266.00

Example 1 demonstrates that you may not participate in the full appreciation of the Basket. Even though the Basket appreciated significantly, the payment at maturity is limited to $1,266.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, which is the maximum payment on the Notes.

Example 2: The Basket Return is 5.00%.

Basket Component Initial Component Value Final Component Value Basket Component Return KO Basket Component $100.00 $109.00 9.00% PG Basket Component $100.00 $104.00 4.00% VZ Basket Component $100.00 $102.00 2.00%

Step 1: Calculate the Final Basket Value.

The Final Basket Value is calculated as follows:

100 × [1 + (1/3 × 9.00%) + (1/3 × 4.00%) + (1/3 × 2.00%)] = 105.00

Therefore, the Final Basket Value is 105.00, resulting in a Basket Return of 5.00%.

Step 2: Calculate the payment at maturity.

Because the Final Basket Value is greater than the Initial Basket Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,150.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × lesser of (a) Basket Return × Upside Leverage Factor and (b) Maximum Return)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × lesser of (a) 5.00% × 3.00 and (b) 26.60%)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 15.00%) = $1,150.00

Example 3: The Basket Return is -50.00%.

Basket Component Initial Component Value Final Component Value Basket Component Return KO Basket Component $100.00 $80.00 -20.00% PG Basket Component $100.00 $50.00 -50.00% VZ Basket Component $100.00 $20.00 -80.00%

Step 1: Calculate the Final Basket Value.

The Final Basket Value is calculated as follows:

100 × [1 + (1/3 × -20.00%) + (1/3 × -50.00%) + (1/3 × -80.00%)] = 50.00

Therefore, the Final Basket Value is 50.00, resulting in a Basket Return of -50.00%.

Step 2: Calculate the payment at maturity.

Because the Final Basket Value is less than the Initial Basket Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $500.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Basket Return)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × -50.00%) = $500.00

Example 3 demonstrates that, if the Final Basket Value is less than the Initial Basket Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Basket from the Initial Basket Value.

You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC.

Selected Risk Considerations

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Basket Components. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

·Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss—The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Final Basket Value is less than the Initial Basket Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Basket from the Initial Basket Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

·Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited to the Maximum Return—Any positive return on your Notes will not exceed a predetermined percentage of the principal amount, regardless of any appreciation in the value of the Basket, which may be significant. We refer to this percentage as the Maximum Return, which is equal to 26.60%. Your return on the Notes will be less than the percentage change from the Initial Basket Value to the Final Basket Value if such percentage is greater than the Maximum Return.

·No Interest Payments—As a holder of the Notes, you will not receive interest payments.

·The Performance of the Basket Components May Offset Each Other; Correlation (or Lack of Correlation) Among the Basket Components May Adversely Affect the Return on the Notes—The Basket Return will be calculated based on the weighted average performance of the Basket Components, as described on the cover of this pricing supplement. The lesser performance of some Basket Components will mitigate, and may completely offset, the greater performance of other Basket Components. You may lose a significant portion of your investment even if one or more Basket Components performs positively.

Correlation is a measure of the degree to which the returns of a pair of assets are similar to each other over a given period in terms of timing and direction. Movements in the values of the Basket Components may not correlate with each other. At a time when the value of a Basket Component increases in value, the value of other Basket Components may not increase as much or may even decline in value. In addition, high correlation of movements in the values of Basket Components could adversely affect your return during periods of decline for the Basket Components. Changes in the values of the Basket Components and/or the correlation among them may adversely affect the market value of, and any payments on, your Notes.

·Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Basket Components on the Dates Specified—Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Basket Components on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Basket Components determined at any other time.

·Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Basket Components—The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the Basket Components. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the Basket Components would have.

·The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain—There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the Notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described below under “Tax Considerations.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the Notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

·Credit of Issuer—The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

·You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the

PS- 9

holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Basket Components

·There Are Risks Associated with Single Equities—The price of each Basket Component can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to that Basket Component and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuer of each Basket Component.

·Anti-dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-dilution Adjustments—The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of a Basket Component. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect a Basket Component. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect the market price of, and any amounts payable on, the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·Reorganization or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated—Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of a Basket Component, the Calculation Agent may replace that Basket Component with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of that Basket Component upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent or may make other changes to the terms of the Notes to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the Calculation Agent to replace a Basket Component, to accelerate the Notes or to otherwise adjust the terms of the Notes could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the Notes than if the Calculation Agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs—Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or a Basket Component, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

·Historical Performance of the Basket Components Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Basket Components Over the Term of the Notes—The value of each Basket Component has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Basket Component is not an indication of the future performance of that Basket Component over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation between the Basket Components is not an indication of the future correlation between them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Basket Components over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any of the Basket Components.

PS- 10

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

·We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Basket Components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Basket Components and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Basket Components” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

·Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

·Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe market prices of, dividend rates on and expected volatility of the Basket Components;

ocorrelation (or lack of correlation) of the Basket Components;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

PS- 11

·The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

·The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes—The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

·The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes—Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

Tax Considerations

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the Basket Components. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes. This gain or loss on your Notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your Notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of Notes at the original issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that these regulations should not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.

PS- 16

SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

We have agreed to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “agent”), and the agent has agreed to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The agent commits to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.

VALIDITY OF THE NOTES

In the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special United States products counsel to Barclays Bank PLC, when the Notes offered by this pricing supplement have been issued by Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the indenture, the trustee has made, in accordance with instructions from Barclays Bank PLC, appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master global note that represents such Notes (the “master note”), and such Notes have been delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such Notes will be valid and binding obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith) and possible judicial or regulatory actions or application giving effect to governmental actions or foreign laws affecting creditors’ rights, provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to (i) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above or (ii) the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of the stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Notes to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York. Insofar as this opinion involves matters governed by English law, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP has relied, with Barclays Bank PLC’s permission, on the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP, dated as of May 15, 2025, filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form F-3ASR by Barclays Bank PLC on May 15, 2025, and this opinion is subject to the same assumptions, qualifications and limitations as set forth in such opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee’s authorization, execution and delivery of the indenture and its authentication of the master note and the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the indenture with respect to the trustee, all as stated in the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, dated May 15, 2025, which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement referred to above.

Today's Featured Research Reports

Amazon.com’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+4.5% vs. +2.4%). The company’s international expansion and diversification across e-commerce, AWS cloud services, advertising, and streaming create multiple revenue streams while reducing concentration risk.

Management's Q4 2025 guidance projects net sales of $206-$213 billion with operating income between $21-$26 billion, reflecting operational efficiency gains. AI integration across operations enhances personalization, logistics and AWS offerings, strengthening competitive positioning. The Zacks analyst expect 2025 net sales to grow 10.6% from 2024.

However, substantial capital expenditure requirements for AI infrastructure and data centers strain financial resources and compress margins. The company's expanding debt burden reduces financial flexibility amid rising interest rates. Intensifying competition from Walmart, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud is an overhang.

(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)

Shares of Palantir have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past six months (+32.3% vs. -6.5%). The company’s AI strategy, driven by Foundry, Gotham, and AIP platforms, targets government and commercial sectors, enabling real-time insights and operational efficiency. Notable defense projects, like Open DAGIR and AIP boot camps for commercial clients, boost customer acquisition.

With $5.4 billion in cash, no debt, and S&P 500 inclusion, Palantir enjoys strong liquidity, growing revenues, and increased investor visibility. Meanwhile, PLTR's reluctance to pay dividends is a green flag for dividend-seeking investors.

Intense competition from tech giants and rising costs amidst a rapidly evolving AI landscape and an elevated valuation challenge its appeal. Palantir shares have gained 122.5% in a year, and we have a neutral rating on it in anticipation of a correction.

(You can read the full research report on Palantir here >>>)

TotalEnergies’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past six months (+5.9% vs. +1.7%). The company is gaining from contributions coming from startups, acquired assets, well-spread LNG assets and upstream assets located in the new hydrocarbon-producing regions. Contributions from multi-energy assets spread across the globe boost its earnings.

TotalEnergies’ free cash flow allows it to increase shareholders’ value. Cost reduction initiatives will boost margins and the company aims to generate 15-20% of sales from low-carbon business by 2040. TotalEnergies is investing in clean power generation and lowering emissions.

Yet TotalEnergies operates multiple assets globally, and in some regions, production might be impacted due to security concerns. It remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production.

(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here >>>)

Shares of MIND Technology have gained +11.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Technology Services industry’s gain of +15.4%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $79.44 million shows improving near-term visibility, with a $9.5 million seismic contract secured in December 2025, highlighting product demand. Recent expansion of its Huntsville facility supports higher-margin throughput and positions the firm for complex project growth.

New capital flexibility via a $25 million ATM offering and $4 million repurchase program enhances strategic agility. MIND benefits from exposure to a resilient global marine seismic market and operates a globally diversified footprint, aiding responsiveness and contract wins.

However, declining revenue and backlog highlight demand volatility, and a growing reliance on aftermarket sales may limit long-term upside. Profitability is pressured by modestly rising operating expenses. Despite this, shares are up 13.7% in the past year, and valuation remains attractive at 1.1X EV/Sales and 7.87X EV/EBITDA, well below peers.

Is the recent softness in Michelin stock just normal profit taking after a strong run, or an early warning that the market is losing faith in the recovery story of the French tire giant?

Latest insights, strategy and corporate profile of Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin in English

Market Pulse: Price, Trend and Volatility Check

According to live quotes from Yahoo Finance and Google Finance, which align on the figures, Michelin stock (ISIN FR001400AJ45, traded in Paris under the ticker ML or ML.PA) last closed at approximately 30.6 euros per share. This last close reflects trading in the Paris session and represents the most recent official price, not an intraday guess. Over the last five trading days, the stock has edged modestly lower, fluctuating in a relatively tight band around the low 30 euro level.

The five day picture shows small daily moves rather than dramatic swings. After starting the period close to 31 euros, the share slipped fractionally in the following sessions, with mild intraday recoveries unable to push it decisively higher. The net result is a low single digit percentage decline over those five days, a pattern that points more to consolidation than capitulation. Volumes have been around or slightly below recent averages, again suggesting a market catching its breath rather than rushing for the exits.

Step back to a 90 day horizon and the tone shifts from slightly cautious to quietly optimistic. From early autumn levels in the mid to high 20s, Michelin stock has climbed a respectable mid to high teens percentage, outpacing many traditional auto related names. That rally has been punctuated by short pauses and shallow pullbacks, which is exactly what technicians like to see in a healthy uptrend. The current dip therefore looks, for now, like another pause inside a broader positive channel.

In the context of the last year, the stock is also trading comfortably above its 52 week low and below but not dramatically far from its 52 week high. Public data from finance portals shows a 52 week range that roughly spans the low 20 euro area at the bottom up to the low or mid 30s at the top. With the last close around 30.6 euros, Michelin is sitting in the upper half of that range, a level that usually reflects cautious optimism rather than outright euphoria.

One-Year Investment Performance

Imagine an investor who decided exactly one year ago to back Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin, placing a calculated bet that the tire maker could navigate slowing global auto demand, raw material cost swings and the messy transition to electric vehicles. Based on historical price data from Yahoo Finance and corroborated by Google Finance, the stock traded near roughly 27.5 euros around that time. Comparing that reference level with the latest close around 30.6 euros implies a gain in the region of 11 percent over twelve months, before dividends.

For a blue chip industrial stock, an approximate 11 percent capital gain in a year is far from spectacular, yet it is anything but trivial. In practical terms, a hypothetical 10,000 euro investment would now be worth about 11,100 euros, excluding any dividend income Michelin distributed along the way. The psychological impact of that performance depends very much on the investor’s expectations. For someone who feared a deeper downturn in the auto and tire cycle, this outcome feels like a quiet victory. For a more aggressive investor who hoped for a roaring post pandemic upswing, the trajectory might look frustratingly measured.

The key emotional takeaway is that Michelin stock has rewarded patience without forcing investors to stomach violent volatility. The ride has involved bouts of nervousness when concerns flared about European growth or Chinese demand, but the overall direction has been gently upward. That combination of moderate gain and limited drama is precisely why conservative portfolios often give industrial champions like Michelin a permanent seat at the table.

Recent Catalysts and News

Newsflow around Michelin in the very short term has been relatively muted, with no blockbuster mergers or shock profit warnings hitting the tape in the past several sessions. Instead, the story has revolved around incremental updates that underscore the group’s steady, methodical repositioning. Company communications and financial coverage have continued to emphasize Michelin’s focus on higher value tires, services and solutions, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. In the most recent management commentary, leadership reiterated guidance that prioritizes margin resilience over sheer volume growth, a stance that resonates with investors wary of a late cycle environment.

Earlier this week, regional business press and financial portals highlighted ongoing progress in Michelin’s strategy to expand beyond traditional tires into mobility services, specialty materials and digital platforms for fleet management. Although none of these strands is individually transformational yet, together they form a narrative that Michelin is trying to decouple its earnings profile from the most cyclical parts of the auto industry. This matters because markets currently reward companies that can prove they are not just passengers in the economic cycle but active drivers of value through pricing power and product mix.

Within the last several days, analysts and commentators have also revisited Michelin’s cost base and supply chain positioning in light of stabilizing raw material prices. Lower volatility in input costs such as natural rubber and energy has been cited as a supporting factor for margins, reducing one of the key external risks that haunted the sector in previous years. At the same time, investors are closely watching bookings and commentary from automakers, since replacement tire demand and original equipment volumes remain closely linked to the broader health of global vehicle sales.

Because there have been no dramatic new headlines over roughly the past week, the chart itself is telling the story. The current trading pattern looks like a classic consolidation phase with low to moderate volatility. After a respectable multi month advance, short term traders are locking in gains while longer term holders seem content to sit tight, awaiting the next decisive catalyst such as quarterly earnings or a fresh update on capital return plans. In that sense, the silence in the news flow is less a red flag and more an indication that the market is pausing to reassess fair value.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Fresh research notes over the past month from major houses underscore a broadly constructive but not euphoric stance toward Michelin stock. Refinitiv and financial press summaries cite firms such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, UBS and others as generally rating the shares in the Buy or Overweight camp, with a minority of Hold or Neutral recommendations and very few outright Sell calls. Recent target prices reported in the financial media cluster in a corridor around the mid 30 euro zone, implying mid to high single digit upside from the latest close, with some more optimistic houses seeing room for a move closer to the high 30s if execution remains on track.

Goldman Sachs, according to recent coverage, has maintained a positive stance based on Michelin’s pricing discipline and exposure to premium segments, arguing that these attributes support above cycle margins even if unit volumes remain under pressure. J.P. Morgan, in more cautious language, has pointed to macro uncertainties and the risk of softer demand in Europe but has still refrained from a bearish call, instead preferring a neutral to mildly supportive posture. Deutsche Bank and UBS commentary picked up by European financial outlets tends to highlight the attractive free cash flow yield and the potential for continued shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks.

Rolling these viewpoints together, the de facto Wall Street verdict could be summarized as a soft Buy: analysts, on average, believe the shares are modestly undervalued relative to their medium term earnings power, but no one is promising a rapid rerating. Price targets suggest that the easy gains of the early recovery phase are likely behind the stock, and that the next leg up, if it comes, will depend on Michelin’s ability to sustain margins while navigating a choppy macro environment. For investors, this means expectations are neither extremely low nor dangerously high, which reduces the risk of violent repricing on incremental news.

Future Prospects and Strategy

At its core, Compagnie Générale des Établissements Michelin remains a global leader in tires, with strong positions in passenger cars, trucks, specialty applications such as mining and aviation, and a growing suite of services that includes fleet management, digital mobility tools and high performance materials. The strategy is clear: lean into segments where technology, safety and durability command a premium, and gradually reduce exposure to commoditized, low margin products. This is a playbook designed to carve out pricing power in an industry that has often been treated by markets as a low growth, highly cyclical commodity business.

Looking ahead to the coming months, several factors will likely determine how the stock trades. First, global auto and truck production trends remain a critical swing variable. Any renewed weakness in Europe or a sharper slowdown in China could weigh on sentiment, even if Michelin’s premium focus softens the blow. Second, cost discipline and supply chain resilience will continue to be scrutinized; investors have little patience for negative surprises on margins after years of raw material volatility. Third, the pace at which the company scales its non tire businesses, from connected fleet services to advanced materials, will influence how the market values Michelin’s long term growth profile.

There is also a structural storyline around sustainability and regulation. Stricter environmental standards push customers toward higher performance, longer lasting tires, which plays to Michelin’s strengths but also demands ongoing investment in research and development. Investors will be watching closely to see if those investments translate into visible pricing power and above peer returns on capital. If management continues to deliver incremental margin expansion and reliable cash flows, the market could gradually reward the stock with a higher valuation multiple. If, on the other hand, growth in key end markets stalls and non tire ventures fail to move the needle, the shares could remain locked in a range, acting more as a dependable income play than a growth story.

For now, the balance of evidence points to a measured, moderately bullish outlook. The recent five day softness in Michelin stock looks less like the beginning of a breakdown and more like a breather after a solid 90 day advance. Analysts are still leaning positive, the one year investment outcome has been quietly rewarding, and the company’s strategic pivot toward premium, service rich offerings is intact. The real question for investors is not whether Michelin can survive the next cycle, but whether it can convince the market that its earnings profile deserves a premium valuation. The answer to that will unfold one cautious quarter at a time.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405008_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 17:01:04.199536

OpenAI bought Ive’s design startup, io Products, for $6.5 billion in May 2025, with the explicit goal of creating a new generation of AI-powered devices. In the months since, rumors have circulated that the devices would eschew screens in favor of an audio-based operating system, in the form of a pair of smart glasses or an Amazon Echo-like speaker.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman further added to those rumors during a December 2025 interview with journalist Alex Kantrowitz, in which he said that using a screen would limit OpenAI’s device to “the same way we’ve had graphical user interfaces working for many decades.”

During a presentation in summer 2025, according to the Information, researchers working on the devices told OpenAI staff that the company’s initial device will process information about its surroundings through audio and video, and “act like a companion that works alongside its user, proactively giving suggestions to help the user achieve their goals, rather than as a simple conduit to apps and other software.”

In practice, the device sounds remarkably similar to the one featured in the 2015 film Her. In that film, humans wear devices that allow their AI companions to see and hear the world, while providing commentary through an earpiece.

Put a Bow on It

The star upgrade of 2025 was the arrival of NVIDIA Blackwell RTX in the cloud, bringing GeForce RTX 5080 power to the GeForce NOW Ultimate membership tier along with all the NVIDIA technologies that 50 Series GPU owners have access to, including DLSS 4 and 5K 120 frames-per-second (FPS) streaming. ""The amazing announcement of the RTX 5080 being added to GeForce NOW with features like DLSS 4 and 5K 120 FPS streaming was a true game-changer for cloud gaming,"" said Nads from Cloud&Console. Luna, a GeForce NOW Discord community modder, called out how the Ultimate tier let her go topside in ARC Raiders and explore Castor Woods in Dying Light: The Beast ""in areas where my local machine struggles - and now, the RTX 5080-powered cloud can push them even further."" GeForce NOW had major day-and-date launches of blockbuster titles including ARC Raiders and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - and the community packed in some unforgettable sessions to celebrate. Nads summed up the smoothness: ""Vaulting into Borderlands 4, surviving Grounded with friends and diving into Battlefield 6 chaos - all of it was seamless on GeForce NOW this year.""

For Warwick, cloud gaming turned into a superpower: ""I've always struggled to play Fortnite with my friends while streaming, but with GeForce NOW, I've been able to jump straight in with ease and get those victory royales,"" the gamer said. One highlight of their year was seeing ""all the incredible things coming to GeForce NOW at Gamescom, including Fortnite with Discord - game changer!"" 2025 belonged to members who play literally anywhere. The native GeForce NOW app elevated gaming on Steam Deck, making it easier than ever to play the cloud gaming platform's 2,000+ supported games from Steam, Epic Games Store, Game Pass and more - all at GeForce RTX quality on the handheld device.

Anytime Anywhere Gaming gave a shoutout to ""the release of ARC Raiders and continued Steam Deck support,"" calling it ""nothing short of amazing"" to take on raiders and play beloved titles on Steam Deck ""at max fidelity.""

The Install-to-Play feature brought even more titles to members. ""Install-to-Play has brought in so many games,"" said creator Cloudy With Games. ""Take a gamble on Slots and Daggers, it's worth it.""

Who Are Edwards Lifesciences’ Top Shareholders?

Edwards Lifesciences’ shareholder base is led by major passive institutions. These firms tend to hold through market cycles, which can help keep long term ownership stable. Active managers adjusted in both directions, pointing to a mix of conviction and valuation discipline.

The Vanguard Group: 70.09M shares (12.08%), ~$6.0B value. Added 359,015 shares (+0.51%).

BlackRock Institutional Trust Company: 30.52M shares (5.26%), ~$2.6B value. Cut 370,162 shares (1.20%).

State Street Investment Management: 25.62M shares (4.41%), ~$2.2B value. Cut 14,746 shares (0.06%).

Wellington Management Company: 20.80M shares (3.59%), ~$1.8B value. Added 977,933 shares (+4.93%).

J.P. Morgan Asset Management: 17.92M shares (3.09%), ~$1.5B value. Cut 2.17M shares (10.80%).

Jennison Associates: 13.96M shares (2.41%), ~$1.2B value. Added 2.29M shares (+19.60%).

Fidelity Management & Research: 13.03M shares (2.25%), ~$1.1B value. Added 10.73M shares (+466.56%).

Geode Capital Management: 12.84M shares (2.21%), ~$1.1B value. Added 114,729 shares (+0.90%).

Walter Scott & Partners: 9.96M shares (1.72%), ~$849M value. Added 1.05M shares (+11.73%).

Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH: 8.60M shares (1.48%), ~$734M value. Added 19,169 shares (+0.22%).

The presence of large passive holders provides a stable ownership base, while selective buying and trimming among active managers suggests investors are closely weighing valuation and execution. For investors, this ownership mix signals continued institutional engagement without a clear consensus shift.

Hedge Fund Highlights

Squarepoint Ops LLC, founded by Guilherme Schmid, increased its Edwards Lifesciences position by about 228%, bringing its stake to roughly $17.7M value. The move may reflect growing optimism around structural heart procedure volumes.

Jane Street Group, co-founded by Rob Granieri, boosted its holdings by around 183% and now owns approximately $121M value of Edwards Lifesciences stock, making it one of the larger active hedge fund positions.

Kingdon Capital Management, led by founder Mark Kingdon, lifted its stake by about 175% to roughly $19.6M value, a notable increase following recent share price volatility.

Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, founded by Steven Schonfeld, raised its position by around 77% to approximately $16.8M value. For investors, hedge fund activity appears selectively constructive, though positioning remains diversified rather than concentrated.

Over the past couple of months, it’s reorganized key teams across research, product, and engineering to focus on building smarter, more conversational voice technology. While the focus is on making ChatGPT sound better, it’s also on laying the groundwork for a new kind of device that could arrive in 2026, which won’t have a screen at all.

Across the tech industry, there’s growing momentum behind voice as the next big way we interact with machines.

From smart glasses that help you hear better in noisy rooms to cars with built-in conversational assistants, the idea that talking might soon replace tapping and swiping is becoming more and more prevalent. And for companies building products or platforms, it’s a shift that could change everything from how software is designed to how users expect to get things done.

Why It Matters: We’re entering an era where voice is becoming the interface. As AI gets better at understanding us and responding in natural conversation, there’s a huge opportunity to rethink how people interact with technology. That shift could unlock new use cases in work, mobility, and everyday life, especially in places where screens get in the way.

OpenAI Is Restructuring Around Voice: The company is investing heavily in audio, aiming to build models that sound more natural and feel more like talking to a person than a bot. The next version of its voice model will reportedly handle things like interruptions and talking over each other, things that make real conversation feel real. That’s a big leap from today’s rigid, turn-by-turn voice assistants.

A New Kind of Device Is on the Way: OpenAI is working on a screenless personal device that would let people interact entirely through speech. It might take the form of smart glasses or a small, always-on speaker, the kind of thing that lives in the background, ready to help without demanding attention. Think less like a tool you use and more like a presence that’s just there when you need it.

The Big Tech Players Are Thinking the Same Way: OpenAI isn’t alone. Meta’s smart glasses now use a five-microphone setup to help users hear better in loud environments. Google is turning search results into spoken summaries. Tesla is integrating a voice assistant into its cars so drivers can control everything from directions to temperature just by talking.

Startups Are Betting on Voice-First Wearables: Smaller companies are racing to build screenless AI devices, from pins that clip to your shirt to rings you can talk to. Some, like the Humane AI Pin, have already run into trouble. But others, including one backed by Pebble’s founder, are gearing up to launch in 2026. These products are trying to build a new category of always-there, voice-first tech.

Design That Fades Into the Background: A big part of this shift is about reducing how much attention technology demands. Jony Ive, Apple’s former design chief, is helping shape OpenAI’s hardware strategy. His vision is to create tools that are less addictive, more ambient, and better integrated into everyday life. It’s a rethink of how tech should behave, not shouting for attention, just quietly helping when needed.",https://nationalcioreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AdobeStock_578383535-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-02 14:00:21.808615

This also means BMW has now taken full control of the Alpina name, and some excerpts from its press release give a hint as to what it plans to do with it: Key elements of the BMW ALPINA brand are its unique balance of maximum performance and superior ride comfort, combined with hallmark driving characteristics.
BMW ALPINA vehicles are manufactured according to rigorous standards for materials selection and craftsmanship.
These ensure that every BMW ALPINA has its own, unmistakeable character.
The next X7/iX7 and refreshed 7 Series are most likely the first candidates to get this BMW Alpina treatment.","In 2022, BMW announced that it had come to an agreement to fully acquire Alpina, the German tuning house long associated with producing exquisitely modified BMWs focused on grand touring comfort and power. At the time, BMW and Alpina had an agreement to continue collaborating as they had in the past until the end of 2025, with full rights to the name transferring at the end of that year.

Well, it’s now 2026, and that means that Alpina is fully part of BMW. What does that mean, you ask? Well, a few things. The Bovensiepen family—the ones behind Alpina—and the team in Buchloe are still active, but are now working under the family name to create bespoke, modified BMWs. The first one was shown at Villa d’Este, and it’s the Bovensiepen Zagato (pictured below), an M4 convertible-based pillarless coupe with more power and a body from legendary Italian designer Zagato.

This also means BMW has now taken full control of the Alpina name, and some excerpts from its press release give a hint as to what it plans to do with it:

Key elements of the BMW ALPINA brand are its unique balance of maximum performance and superior ride comfort, combined with hallmark driving characteristics. This is complemented by an exclusive portfolio of bespoke options and custom materials along with unmistakeable details.

The new wordmark provides a first indication. It radiates clarity, calm and confidence. Positioned at the centre of the rear, it underlines the standalone character of the new exclusive brand and its independent personality within the BMW Group.

BMW ALPINA vehicles are manufactured according to rigorous standards for materials selection and craftsmanship. They fulfill the most demanding expectations in terms of visuals, acoustics and feel. Moreover, buyers can choose from a remarkable portfolio of bespoke options. These ensure that every BMW ALPINA has its own, unmistakeable character. Each vehicle will be an exclusive object for connoisseurs in pursuit of the extraordinary, without compromises on performance, comfort and individuality.

It’s no longer a trim level, but a brand within the group, one that will seemingly continue to provide the balance of luxury and power Alpina has been known for. However, BMW will also integrate Alpina more deeply into the development process, there is an in-house designer, and it’s likely that models that receive the Alpina treatment will feature deeper changes to powertrain, options, interior, and even styling, than before. The goal appears to be to create a luxury brand above BMW but below Rolls-Royce, sort of like how Mercedes now uses the Maybach brand.

The next X7/iX7 and refreshed 7 Series are most likely the first candidates to get this BMW Alpina treatment. Let’s see what they come up with.",https://bimmerlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2023_BMW_ALPINA_XB7-12-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 05:58:00.485354

While Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jørgensen defended the prices by pointing to the complex web of rebates demanded by Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), the public outcry set the stage for a dramatic policy shift.
Investors should watch for a potential ""race to the bottom"" in pricing as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly attempt to lock in long-term contracts with private insurers before newer competitors like Amgen’s MariTide reach the market in 2028.
In January 2026, Novo Nordisk launched its high-dose oral Wegovy pill, priced aggressively at $149 for the introductory month.
By embracing lower-cost vials, direct-to-consumer platforms, and government negotiations, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have traded high per-unit margins for a dominant, long-term share of a much larger market.","As the calendar turns to 2026, the landscape for weight-loss and diabetes medication has been fundamentally transformed. What began two years ago as a ""wild west"" of $1,000-a-month list prices and chronic shortages has evolved into a highly competitive, government-influenced market where affordability and accessibility have finally taken center stage. For the millions of Americans utilizing GLP-1 therapies, the start of 2026 marks the first full year where these life-altering drugs are no longer a luxury exclusive to the wealthy or the well-insured.

The strategic pivot by pharmaceutical titans Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) represents one of the most significant shifts in drug pricing dynamics in modern history. Driven by a combination of intense legislative pressure from the U.S. Senate, the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and a surge in competition from next-generation therapies, these companies have moved away from high-margin scarcity toward a high-volume, mass-market model. This transition is not merely a corporate rebranding; it is a structural overhaul of the American pharmaceutical economy.

The Road to Affordability: A Two-Year Siege on High Prices

The journey to the current pricing environment was catalyzed by a series of high-stakes confrontations throughout 2024 and 2025. In late 2024, Senator Bernie Sanders and the Senate HELP Committee placed Novo Nordisk in the crosshairs, citing studies that suggested blockbuster drugs like Ozempic could be manufactured for less than $5 per month. While Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Jørgensen defended the prices by pointing to the complex web of rebates demanded by Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), the public outcry set the stage for a dramatic policy shift.

The real turning point arrived in late 2025, when the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized the first round of price negotiations for semaglutide under the IRA. In November 2025, the government announced a negotiated ""Maximum Fair Price"" of $274 for a 30-day supply of Novo’s semaglutide products—a staggering 71% discount from previous list prices. Although these prices are not slated to take effect for Medicare beneficiaries until January 1, 2027, the announcement created an immediate ""price floor"" that forced commercial insurers and Eli Lilly to respond in kind to remain competitive.

Simultaneously, Eli Lilly upended the market by aggressively expanding its direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect. By December 2025, Lilly had slashed the price of its single-dose Zepbound vials to as low as $299 per month for self-paying patients, effectively bypassing the traditional PBM-led distribution model. This ""vial strategy"" served a dual purpose: it bypassed the manufacturing bottlenecks associated with complex autoinjector pens and directly undercut the burgeoning market for compounded versions of the drug.

Winners and Losers in the New GLP-1 Economy

The clear winners in this new era are patients and large-scale employers who have struggled to fund weight-loss coverage. With the average cash price for branded GLP-1s now hovering between $299 and $350—down from over $1,000 in early 2024—insurance coverage has expanded rapidly. Major insurers like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) and Cigna Group (NYSE: CI) have begun reintroducing these drugs into standard formularies, betting that the long-term savings from reduced cardiovascular and diabetic complications will outweigh the current cost of the medication.

Conversely, the ""Golden Age"" of GLP-1 compounding has come to an abrupt halt. Companies like Hims & Hers Health, Inc. (NYSE: HIMS) saw their stock prices under pressure throughout 2025 as the FDA officially removed semaglutide and tirzepatide from the shortage list. With the branded versions now readily available and priced competitively, the legal ""safe harbor"" for compounding pharmacies has narrowed significantly. Furthermore, the introduction of the SAFE Drugs Act in late 2025 has imposed stricter regulations on mass-produced compounded GLP-1s, forcing these companies to pivot toward older, off-patent molecules like Liraglutide.

Traditional PBMs, including CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), are also facing a strategic crisis. The shift toward transparent, direct-to-consumer pricing models like LillyDirect and the government-backed TrumpRx platform threatens the ""rebate-heavy"" model that has long sustained PBM profits. As pharmaceutical companies find ways to sell directly to the public at lower prices, the role of the middleman is being scrutinized more than ever by both regulators and corporate clients.

A Global Paradigm Shift in Drug Policy

The pricing shifts of 2025 represent more than just a market correction; they signify a broader trend toward global pricing parity. For years, the U.S. market subsidized drug development for the rest of the world by paying significantly higher prices. However, the 2025 ""Most Favored Nation"" agreements—where the U.S. government leveraged its massive purchasing power to demand prices closer to those seen in Europe—have effectively ended this era of American exceptionalism in drug costs.

This event also highlights the success of the Inflation Reduction Act's negotiation provisions. The $274 negotiated price for Ozempic has become a benchmark that other nations are now using in their own negotiations, creating a global ripple effect. Competitors like Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) are now being forced to design their Phase 3 trials and commercial strategies around this lower price point, rather than the inflated list prices of the past. The ""innovation premium"" is now being tied more strictly to clinical outcomes—such as monthly dosing or superior weight loss—rather than mere market entry.

Historically, this shift is reminiscent of the ""Generic Revolution"" of the early 2000s, but with a twist. Instead of waiting for patents to expire, the combined weight of government intervention and ""vial-based"" competition has created a ""pseudo-generic"" environment for branded drugs that are still years away from their patent cliffs. This is a new precedent in the pharmaceutical industry: the aggressive commoditization of a blockbuster drug class while it is still under patent.

The Road Ahead: Orals, Combinations, and the 2027 Cliff

Looking toward the remainder of 2026 and into 2027, the market is bracing for the ""Medicare Cliff."" When the $274 negotiated price officially hits the Medicare Part D books in January 2027, the pressure on the commercial market to match that price will be immense. Investors should watch for a potential ""race to the bottom"" in pricing as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly attempt to lock in long-term contracts with private insurers before newer competitors like Amgen’s MariTide reach the market in 2028.

Another major strategic pivot is the shift toward oral GLP-1s. In January 2026, Novo Nordisk launched its high-dose oral Wegovy pill, priced aggressively at $149 for the introductory month. This move is designed to capture the ""needle-phobic"" segment of the market and defend against Viking Therapeutics' promising oral candidate, which is currently in late-stage trials. The battle for the medicine cabinet is moving from the refrigerator (for injectables) to the pill bottle, which significantly reduces shipping and storage costs for the manufacturers.

Strategic adaptations will also be required in the manufacturing sector. As prices drop, volume must increase to maintain revenue growth. Both Lilly and Novo have committed tens of billions of dollars to new manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and Ireland, which are expected to reach full capacity by late 2026. The challenge will be maintaining these massive operations if pricing continues to erode faster than volume can expand—a delicate balancing act that will define their stock performance over the next 24 months.

Summary of the New Market Reality

The strategic shifts of 2024 and 2025 have fundamentally broken the old pricing model for GLP-1 drugs. By embracing lower-cost vials, direct-to-consumer platforms, and government negotiations, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have traded high per-unit margins for a dominant, long-term share of a much larger market. The ""Net Cash Price"" of approximately $350 has become the new standard, effectively ending the era of the $1,000 weight-loss shot for the vast majority of Americans.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by ""Volume over Value."" While the astronomical growth rates seen in 2023 might slow as pricing stabilizes, the total addressable market is expanding as the drugs become affordable for the middle class. Investors should keep a close eye on the quarterly volume growth of Wegovy and Zepbound, as well as the clinical progress of oral competitors.

The lasting impact of this event is a blueprint for future drug launches. The days of launching a blockbuster drug with an unchecked price tag in the U.S. appear to be over. In its place is a more disciplined, politically sensitive, and transparent market—one where the price of health is no longer determined solely by what the market will bear, but by what the public and the government will permit.

Precious Metals ETFs","Investing in unique collectible metals can be a fascinating and potentially rewarding venture, but it comes with its own set of considerations and risks. Here's a guide based on the experiences and opinions shared by Redditors:

Precious Metal Coins

Investing in precious metal coins is a popular choice due to their dual value as both metal content and collectibles.

Pros:

Easy to Store, Buy, and Sell: ""Coins. Easy to store, easy to buy, easy to sell.""

Retain Value: They hold value based on their metal content and their rarity as collectibles. ""They retain value as collectibles and by their metal content.""

Graded Coins: Authenticity and quality can be verified through grading, reducing guesswork. ""Graded coins take the guesswork out of authenticity and quality.""

Historical Connection: Some investors appreciate the tangible connection to history. ""I’m optimistic on coins because of their tangible connection to history and a bull market in precious metals.""

Cons:

Aging Demographics: The market for some collectible coins may be affected by an aging collector base. ""Risks include an aging demographic (much like the fate of stamp collectors) and buyers premiums.""

Buyer's Premiums: You might pay a premium over the metal's spot price.

Rare Earth Metals

Investing in rare earth metals can be a strategic move given their importance in modern technology and geopolitics.

Pros:

High Demand: Essential for electronics, renewable energy, and defense systems. ""American sourced rare earth miners ought to have a great tailwind in this administration.""

Geopolitical Significance: Governments are investing in domestic supply chains, which could boost value. ""Governments globally are investing heavily into increasing REE supply independent of Chinese processing for strategic/geopolitical reasons rather than expectation of profits.""

Cons:

Market Volatility: Prices can be heavily influenced by political decisions and international relations. ""Depends on the XI / Trump meeting - Rare Earths could rocket or tank depending on the Tweet that comes out of that meeting.""

Supply and Demand Imbalance: Increased supply without matching demand can lead to price crashes. ""Any commodity that sees a dramatic increase in supply without a matching increase in demand has its price crash, margins vanish, and once-exciting projects sputter and die.""

Physical Gold and Silver

Holding physical gold and silver is often seen as a hedge against economic instability.

Pros:

Insurance Against Financial Instability: Acts as a safe haven during economic downturns. ""the rationale behind holding physical gold is that it serves as a form of insurance -- you have direct custody of your wealth, independent of third parties.""

Historical Value: Has been used as money for thousands of years, suggesting long-term value preservation. ""Historically, gold and silver have been used as money for thousands of years.""

Counterparty Risk Reduction: Direct ownership eliminates the risk associated with third-party intermediaries. ""The physical is a hedge against capital controls, risk of your broker becoming insolvent, among other things.""

Cons:

Storage and Security: Requires secure storage, which can be costly or risky.

Less Liquid: Selling physical metals can be more cumbersome and may involve high margins from dealers. ""The shops near me that buy and sell precious metals are buying silver at a 65% margin!""

In August, Hormel Foods, Austin, Minn., said an unexpected rise in the costs of pork, beef and nuts undermined the company’s performance during its third quarter.
Approximately 80% of consumers report prioritizing protein intake during one meal a day, with the majority prioritizing protein during the dinner occasion.
In examining the most common perceived benefits associated with protein most consumers link protein with muscle health and strength.
In September, the US Department of Agriculture lowered second-half 2025 pork production by 180 million lbs due to lower-than-expected availability of slaughter-ready hogs.","KANSAS CITY — The rising cost of meat proteins rippled through the supply chain in 2025. Companies like Conagra Brands, Inc., and Hormel Foods Corp., manufacturers of prepared products that feature meat proteins, were stung by the higher costs. Driving the market dynamics have been increased consumer demand for protein and a difficult supply situation for some animal proteins.

In July, Conagra Brands, Chicago, forecast inflation on its cost of goods sold in fiscal 2026 would remain elevated, perhaps reaching as high as 7%. The guidance anticipated core inflation of approximately 4% while tariffs on imported tin plate steel, imports from China and on imports from other countries would contribute another three percentage points.

“Managing this inflation will be a critical focus this year,” said David S. Marberger, chief financial officer, in comments released July 10 when the company reported earnings for fiscal 2025. “We expect core productivity to accelerate in fiscal ‘26 to approximately 4% of cost of goods sold, largely offsetting core inflation. Additionally, we have established a cross-functional task force to mitigate our tariff exposure through various cost reduction levers.”

Commodities seen principally responsible for the core inflation included beef, chicken, pork, turkey and eggs, which the company said rose double digits during the 2025 fiscal year.

In August, Hormel Foods, Austin, Minn., said an unexpected rise in the costs of pork, beef and nuts undermined the company’s performance during its third quarter. While Hormel experienced positive momentum in sales and organic volumes, the costs of such key inputs pummeled the company’s bottom line.

“… We anticipated upward pressure on input costs driven by (the) pork, beef and nut markets,” said Jacinth Smiley, CFO, during an Aug. 28 conference call to discuss third-quarter results. “However, during the third quarter, markets worsened significantly beyond our projections.”

Specific costs highlighted by Smiley included pork bellies, which were up 30% year over year, the pork cutout, which was up 10%, and beef prices, which had reached near all-time highs during year.

“Collectively, we experienced approximately 400 basis points of raw material cost inflation in the third quarter alone, representing a notable increase relative to last year,” Smiley said.

Hunger for protein

Demand for protein has remained a driving factor for the rising costs. Protein remains the most sought after nutrient in American consumers’ diets, according to surveys from the International Food Information Council (IFIC).

The data come from the 2025 Food & Health Survey, an annual survey of 3,000 consumers ages 18 to 80, and a July spotlight survey on consumer attitudes, beliefs and knowledge surrounding protein.

“For many years of the Food & Health Survey, we have asked consumers to tell us what food attributes they try to consume or avoid,” said Monica Amburn, senior director of food and nutrition at IFIC, in a July webinar. “We added protein to the list of options in 2021, and since then, for the fifth straight year in a row, protein is the top nutrient that most Americans say they are trying to consume … this is definitely significant, and people are highly aware of protein.”

In 2025, more than one in three consumers said they have upped their protein intake in the last year, and high-protein diets have remained the most cited eating pattern among Americans for the third year in a row. The Council also found that, for the first time, consumers are using “good source of protein claims” as the primary measure to define what constitutes a healthy food.

Approximately 80% of consumers report prioritizing protein intake during one meal a day, with the majority prioritizing protein during the dinner occasion. Preferred sources of protein include meat and poultry (65%), eggs (62%), fish and seafood (48%), dairy (41%), and beans, peas and lentils (40%). Taste is the primary factor for consumers when choosing a protein source, according to the report, followed by price, healthfulness and convenience.

In examining the most common perceived benefits associated with protein most consumers link protein with muscle health and strength. Other common associated benefits range from energy and lessened fatigue to improved overall well-being, healthy aging and bone health.

“This protein boom is being driven by media attention and increased consumer interest in topics such as GLP-1 medications and weight management, fitness, energy and healthy aging,” IFIC said.

Market outlook

Ongoing consumer demand for protein was reflected in the annual Power of Meat report, which was published in March and showed retail meat sales in the United States reached a record high of $104.6 billion in 2024, up 5% over 2023. Retail meat volume also rose 2.3% last year to 22.8 billion lbs when compared with 2023. It remains to be seen if the strong demand for meat at retail in 2024 carries over to 2025.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said its meat price index reached an all-time high in July, averaging 127.3 points, up 1.2% from June and up 6% from July 2024, due primarily to global beef prices, which also were at record highs.

Factors driving the high price of beef included the rebuilding of the US cattle herd, which has been at the bottom of the cycle for the past few years; tariffs on Brazil, a key exporter of lean beef to the United States; and a ban on live cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns about the spread of the animal disease New World screwworm.

The pork market also experienced supply challenges. In September, the US Department of Agriculture lowered second-half 2025 pork production by 180 million lbs due to lower-than-expected availability of slaughter-ready hogs. High feed costs were identified as a supply challenge and high beef prices, which have lifted wholesale pork prices, were identified as impacting the market.

The USDA said large feed grain crops would lead to lower feed costs in 2026 and contribute to an improvement in the supply of market-ready hogs.

The USDA increased projected broiler production for 2025 and 2026 on strong hatchery data and lower projected feed costs. The Department also adjusted wholesale broiler price projections down in 2025 and 2026 on recent price trends and increased production expectations. The agency, however, identified highly pathogenic avian influenza as an uncertainty that could affect the supply situation.",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2022/01/13/case-ready-meats.jpg?height=635&t=1716302092&width=1200,N,,2026-01-02 13:01:07.054406

(NYSE:COTY) is one of the Best High Volume Penny Stocks to Buy. On December 23, S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed a BB+ issuer credit rating on Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY). This comes as the company, on December 19, announced selling the remaining 25.8% stake in Wella to KKR-managed capital accounts and investment affiliates.

According to the company’s press release, the company will receive an upfront cash payment of $750 million, along with 45% from any proceeds from further sale or an IPO of the business. Management believes that Wella’s strong recent and expected performance, along with its market valuation, will result in substantial cash proceeds for the company.

S&P Global Ratings noted that the sale is expected to bring the company’s leverage to the high-3x area by the end of 2025. The firm believes that the company will use the cash received from the sale of its stake to address debt maturities. Moreover, the firm also likes the additional 45% share that Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) is expected to receive in the event of further sale or IPO. S&P Global believes that this will allow the company to further address its debt in the future.

The sale of the Wella stake was part of the company’s strategic initiative started in 2020 to simplify its business. S&P Global noted that the company is also planning to explore opportunities for the sale of its Brazilian operations. However, the firm believes that selling these assets would not be easy, considering the highly competitive mass beauty international market.

Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY), together with its subsidiaries, manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells branded beauty products worldwide. It operates through two segments: the Prestige and Consumer Beauty.

Baxter reported revenues of $2.84 billion, up 5% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 1.4%.","Quarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company’s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at CooperCompanies COO and the best and worst performers in the medical devices & supplies - diversified industry.

The medical devices industry operates a business model that balances steady demand with significant investments in innovation and regulatory compliance. The industry benefits from recurring revenue streams tied to consumables, maintenance services, and incremental upgrades to the latest technologies. However, the capital-intensive nature of product development, coupled with lengthy regulatory pathways and the need for clinical validation, can weigh on profitability and timelines. In addition, there are constant pricing pressures from healthcare systems and insurers maximizing cost efficiency. Over the next several years, one tailwind is demographic–aging populations means rising chronic disease rates that drive greater demand for medical interventions and monitoring solutions. Advances in digital health, such as remote patient monitoring and smart devices, are also expected to unlock new demand by shortening upgrade cycles. On the other hand, the industry faces headwinds from pricing and reimbursement pressures as healthcare providers increasingly adopt value-based care models. Additionally, the integration of cybersecurity for connected devices adds further risk and complexity for device manufacturers.

The 6 medical devices & supplies - diversified stocks we track reported a mixed Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.6% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.

In light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.

CooperCompanies COO

With a history dating back to 1958 and a portfolio spanning two distinct healthcare segments, Cooper Companies COO develops and manufactures medical devices focused on vision care through contact lenses and women's health including fertility products and services.

CooperCompanies reported revenues of $1.07 billion, up 4.6% year on year. This print was in line with analysts’ expectations, and overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ full-year EPS guidance estimates and an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS guidance for next quarter estimates.

""We closed fiscal 2025 ahead of consensus revenue, earnings, and free cash flow expectations, and we enter 2026 with clear priorities to drive long-term shareholder value: accelerating top-line growth, improving profitability, accelerating cash generation, and continuing share repurchases,"" said Al White, CooperCompanies' President and CEO.

CooperCompanies delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. Interestingly, the stock is up 6.4% since reporting and currently trades at $81.96.

Best Q3: Neogen NEOG

Founded in 1981 and operating at the intersection of food safety and animal health, Neogen NEOG develops and manufactures diagnostic tests and related products to detect dangerous substances in food and pharmaceuticals for animal health.

Neogen reported revenues of $209.2 million, down 3.6% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 2.6%. The business had a very strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ revenue estimates and full-year revenue guidance slightly topping analysts’ expectations.

Neogen achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 19.8% since reporting. It currently trades at $6.90.

Weakest Q3: Baxter BAX

With a history dating back to 1931 and products used in over 100 countries, Baxter International BAX provides essential healthcare products including dialysis therapies, IV solutions, infusion systems, surgical products, and patient monitoring technologies to hospitals and clinics worldwide.

Baxter reported revenues of $2.84 billion, up 5% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 1.4%. It was a softer quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts’ full-year EPS guidance estimates and revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts’ expectations significantly.

Baxter delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 14.8% since the results and currently trades at $19.11.

Boston Scientific BSX

Founded in 1979 with a mission to advance less-invasive medicine, Boston Scientific BSX develops and manufactures medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures across cardiovascular, urological, neurological, and gastrointestinal specialties.

Boston Scientific reported revenues of $5.07 billion, up 20.3% year on year. This print topped analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. It was a very strong quarter as it also recorded an impressive beat of analysts’ organic revenue estimates and revenue guidance for next quarter topping analysts’ expectations.

Boston Scientific delivered the fastest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is down 4.3% since reporting and currently trades at $95.60.

Aviation analytics firm Cirium has published its annual On-Time Performance Review, the industry benchmark for measuring airline and airport schedule reliability.

Cirium’s On-Time Performance Review combines flight data from over 600 real-time and historical sources, reflecting operational performance across airlines and markets. The methodology counts arrivals within 14 minutes and 59 seconds of schedule as on time, following industry standards.

Reliable on-time performance is critical for passenger satisfaction. It also impacts airlines’ connections, aircraft utilisation, and crew scheduling. When flights fail to arrive as scheduled, delays can cascade across the network, disrupting operations. Keeping flights on time is challenging in increasingly congested skies, where technical failures and weather can significantly disturb the day’s schedule.

As Jeremy Bowen, Cirium CEO, said of this past year’s review: “Maintaining consistent on-time performance requires sophisticated network planning, operational coordination, and the ability to recover quickly when irregularities occur. These results reflect the operational discipline that defines aviation’s top performers.”

Cirium’s global on-time airline winners for 2025

After analysing hundreds of thousands of flights worldwide, Aeromexico emerged as the global leader with a 90.02% on-time performance (OTP), narrowly outpacing Saudia and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), which ranked second and third, respectively. It is the Mexican flag carrier’s second consecutive year atop the global rankings.

Top Global Airline Performers (2025):

1 — Aeromexico: 90.02% OTP

2 — Saudia: 86.53% OTP

3 — SAS (Scandinavian Airlines): 86.09% OTP

Note: OTP Percentages reflect flights arriving within 14 minutes 59 seconds of the scheduled time.

2025 most on-time regional airline winners

Cirium’s report also highlights regional leaders — carriers that excel within their operational networks:

North America: Delta Air Lines secured its fifth straight win with 80.90% OTP.

Europe: Iberia Express continued its regional dominance with an 88.94% OTP for the third consecutive year.

Asia-Pacific: Philippine Airlines claimed the regional title for the first time, achieving an 83.12% OTP.

Latin America: Copa Airlines stood out with an exceptional 90.75% OTP, its 11th win in this category—the most wins by any Latin American carrier since Cirium launched the OTP rankings in 2009.

Middle East & Africa: Safair led with a stellar 91.06% OTP.

Cirium Platinum Award winner and most improved airline

In addition to the rankings, Cirium presented two special awards to airlines, recognising their operational excellence.

Qatar Airways was honoured with a Platinum Award for its operational consistency, achieving an OTP of 84.42% on over 198,303 flights across six continents.

Virgin Atlantic earned Cirium’s inaugural “Most Improved” award after lifting its OTP from 74.02% in 2024 to 83.45% in 2025, a 9.44-point improvement year-over-year.

Most on-time airports of 2025

Cirium also recognised airports that delivered the most punctual operations across different categories:

Large Airport Category: Santiago Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport (SCL) — 87.04% of departures on time

Medium Airport Category: Tocumen International Airport (PTY) — 93.34% of departures on time

Small Airport Category: José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport (GYE) — 91.47% of departures on time

Cirium also awarded Istanbul Airport (IST) a Platinum Award in recognition of its “operational complexity, passenger impact during disruptions, and growth trajectory.”

What Cirium’s OTP rankings tell us about commercial aviation operations in 2026

Cirium’s rankings also reveal key operational trends driving the commercial aviation sector last year, which will also impact airline and airport on-time performance this year.

The narrow margins between the top international performers show that airlines are tightening their operations. This means that on-time flights are becoming more likely, barring situations outside of the airlines’ control. However, regional OTP can vary widely, with on-time arrival rates higher in some regions than in others, and achieving it at scale becomes more challenging.

For example, there is a significant 10.16 point difference between North America’s top carrier, Delta Air Lines, and the overall most on-time regional winner, Safair, and an 8.04 percentage point difference between Delta and Iberia Express in Europe. That Delta has won for the fifth consecutive the world’s year reflects strong operational consistency. Still, it must contend with a large and complex network, a central hub at the world’s busiest airport, and crowded national airspace, while providing both domestic and international services.

Cirium’s 2025 OTP Review demonstrates how airline network recovery, disruption management, and strategic hub performance can yield a competitive advantage, and hopefully, the average OTP percentage will rise industry-wide in 2026.

The Cleveland, Ohio-based Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH) is expected to announce its fiscal second-quarter earnings for 2026 in the near term, according to a recent financial report. Analysts expect the company to report a profit of $7.11 per share on a diluted basis, which would be an increase of 8.9% from the $6.53 per share reported in the same quarter last year.

Parker-Hannifin, a manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems valued at $110.9 billion by market cap, has consistently surpassed Wall Street's earnings per share estimates in its last four quarterly reports. For the full 2026 fiscal year, analysts expect the company to report EPS of $30.39, up 11.2% from $27.33 in fiscal 2025. Its EPS is forecast to rise further to $32.96 in fiscal 2027.

The company's stock has outperformed the broader market, with shares up 38% over the past 52 weeks. This compares to a 16.4% gain for the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) and a 17.6% gain for the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) over the same period.

The reported outperformance is attributed to strong organic growth, driven by aerospace and defense strength and a return to positive territory in North America industrial operations. The aerospace segment has delivered 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Other key factors include commercial and aftermarket aerospace growth, improved productivity, cost controls, and the successful integration of Curtis Instruments.

On Nov. 6, Parker-Hannifin's shares closed up 7.8% following its first-quarter report. The company reported adjusted EPS of $7.22, exceeding expectations of $6.67. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, also above the $4.9 billion forecast.

J&J had been evaluating JNJ-95475939, an inhibitor of IL-4 and IL-31, against the IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor Dupixent in a phase 2b study in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Despite only launching the study in February 2025, according to the federal trials database, the pharma decided it had seen enough.

“The results of a planned interim analysis met prespecified criteria for early termination of the study, as they did not meet the high-bar efficacy we established for advancing our clinical development programs for atopic dermatitis,” J&J explained in a Dec. 26 statement.

The subcutaneously administered therapy was well tolerated in the study, said the company, which stressed that the pharma remains “deeply committed to progressing our rich pipeline of clinical-stage and pre-clinical drug candidates for atopic dermatitis.”

The drug was a relatively new addition to J&J’s pipeline, after the company purchased it from Swiss biotech Numab Therapeutics for $1.25 billion in cash in mid-2024. At the time, Numab investor Novo Holdings pointed to “exciting early data in patients” as being behind J&J’s decision to acquire the drug.

While the end of JNJ-95475939 means that 10-figure price tag now looks like a bad call, J&J still has a number of other inflammation assets in development, including icotrokinra. The pharma is currently awaiting regulatory decisions on the Protagonist Therapeutics-partnered once-daily oral peptide after the drug bested Bristol Myers Squibb’s Sotyktu across a pair of phase 3 studies for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Meanwhile, acasunlimab, the PD-L1x4-1BB bispecific antibody Genmab junked over the holidays, is no stranger to rejection. At one point, the Danish biopharma had been collaborating on acasunlimab with BioNTech, evaluating the candidate in three clinical trials, including a phase 2 study as both a monotherapy and in combination with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

But, back in August 2024, BioNTech announced that despite acasunilimab’s “encouraging” clinical profile, it had decided not to go any further with the development of the candidate “for reasons relating to portfolio strategy.”

Genmab took acasunilimab into phase 3 trials by itself, but it sounds like the biopharma has now come to a similar conclusion as its former partner. In a Dec. 29 statement, Genmab said it was halting work on the therapy.

“This decision was made as part of Genmab’s strategic focus on the most value‑creating opportunities in its late‑stage portfolio and following a thorough assessment of the evolving competitive landscape,” the company said.

“Although the data have been encouraging, the compelling opportunities we see in our late‑stage pipeline led us to focus our investments where we believe we can deliver the greatest benefit for patients and shareholders,” Genmab CEO Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., explained in a statement.

The company’s strategy is now to “concentrate resources on programs with the highest potential impact.” They include the AbbVie-partnered blood cancer med Epkinly as well as petosemtamab, a phase 3-stage EGFR×LGR5 bispecific at the center of last year’s $8 billion buyout of Merus. There’s also Rina-S, a potential competitor to AbbVie’s Elahere that arrived from the acquisition of ProfoundBio.

Earlier in 2025, Genmab pruned its pipeline of two antibody-drug conjugates onboarded from the same ProfoundBio buyout.

William Blair analysts said acasunlimab had “rightfully hit the chopping block,” pointing to updated phase 2 data in November that showed median overall survival across the study was closer to 12.3 months than the 17.5 months suggested by initial results.

“We believe [dropping acasunilimab] is the right decision, given recent deterioration of the overall survival curve from the phase 2 trial with longer follow-up, and it does not detract from what we view as one of the best opportunities in large-cap biotech going into 2026, with key pivotal readouts for Epkinly, Rina-S and petosemtamab,” the analysts wrote in a Dec. 29 note.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-1281723896.jpg?VersionId=AYiDXXI1prssk5jEWVXUpOWE5hmemQPM,N,,2026-01-02 11:03:35.100396

In other broader indexes, the Dow added 13.7 percent in 2025, while the Nasdaq gained 21.3 percent.
By comparison, of 82 stocks in the active lifestyle space tracked by SGB Media, only 20 – or 27 percent – outperformed the S&P 500’s 17.3 percent gain, while 48, or 59 percent, declined.
Active lifestyle stocks strongly outperformed broader indexes in 2020 and 2021, as the industry benefited from the early stages of the pandemic and heightened interest in outdoor and fitness activities.
Among stocks taking major hits were Deckers Brands, down 49 percent in 2025 amid concerns over decelerating growth at Hoka.","The wide majority of stocks trading in the active lifestyle space in 2025 sharply underperformed broader market gains for the fourth straight year. The lackluster performance was in large part due to disruptions from tariffs, as well as stalled turnaround efforts in several major stocks, including Nike, VF Corp. and Lululemon.

The S&P 500 leapt 17.3 percent in 2025, boosted by robust corporate earnings, enthusiasm for AI and optimism about the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. The gains capped off an unprecedented three consecutive years of double-digit gains for the Index and came despite concerns about tariffs, geopolitical turmoil, nerves surrounding an AI bubble, and the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

In other broader indexes, the Dow added 13.7 percent in 2025, while the Nasdaq gained 21.3 percent.

By comparison, of 82 stocks in the active lifestyle space tracked by SGB Media, only 20 – or 27 percent – outperformed the S&P 500’s 17.3 percent gain, while 48, or 59 percent, declined.

Active lifestyle stocks strongly outperformed broader indexes in 2020 and 2021, as the industry benefited from the early stages of the pandemic and heightened interest in outdoor and fitness activities. Sales slowed in the ensuing years as participation largely reverted to pre-pandemic levels, especially at the core level.

Spending on discretionary categories has also been affected in recent years by inflationary pressures, and this continued in 2025, with lower-income consumers particularly affected. Tariffs this year led to supply chain disruptions and higher operating expenses, also contributing to many vendors and retailers missing earnings and sales targets set at the start of the year.

Among stocks taking major hits were Deckers Brands, down 49 percent in 2025 amid concerns over decelerating growth at Hoka.

Nike’s shares fell 15.8 percent to $63.71 as turnaround efforts orchestrated by CEO Elliot Hill developed more slowly than investors hoped. Nike’s shares are down 64.4 percent from its all-time high of $179.10 reached in November 2021.

V.F. Corp., which continued to struggle to reawaken growth at Vans, also gave back another 15.8 percent in share value in 2025 and has collapsed 78 percent since reaching its all-time high in January 2020.

Shares of Newell Brands, parent of Coleman and Marmot, tumbled 62.7 percent, while Helen of Troy, parent of Hydro Flask and Osprey, lost 64.4 percent last year. Each recently slashed guidance due to tariff hits and slower spending. Shares of Columbia Sportswear, Crocs, and Under Armour all fell by more than 30 percent due to weak guidance.

Among the winners, shares of Amer Sports jumped 33.6 percent to $37.35 in 2025, as quarterly results steadily beat targets amid strong momentum at Arc’teryx and Salomon. Shares have nearly tripled since going at $13 a share in February 2024.

Topgolf Callaway jumped 48.5 percent after it recently reached an agreement to sell a 60 percent stake in its struggling Topgolf business to private equity firm Leonard Green, although it is still down about half its value over the past five years. Shares of Yeti, Canada Goose, Rocky Brands and Johnson Outdoors all showed some recovery.

Among retailers, Lululemon shares tumbled 44.9 percent in 2025. In mid-December, its CEO, Calvin McDonald, would depart at the close of the current fiscal year as the company reported its third straight quarter of declines in the Americas region.

Shares of Dick’s Sporting Goods declined 13.5 percent last year amid concerns over its acquisition of Foot Locker. Academy Sports, which fell about the same amount, saw top-line growth pressured by a pullback in spending by lower-income consumers.

Shares of Journey’s parent Genesco, Famous Footwear’s parent Caleres and Shoe Carnival were down over 40 percent amid sales shortfalls.

On the plus side, Walmart, TJX Cos. and Ross Stores were rewarded with higher valuations as shoppers favored retailers that emphasized low prices. Several department stores, including Macy’s, Dillard’s and Kohl’s, saw shares climb over 30 percent on improving results, while Urban Outfitters and Zumiez saw notable gains among specialty chains.

The active lifestyle industry saw no initial public offerings in 2025. Among firms exiting public trading through an acquisition were Big 5 Sporting Goods, Foot Locker, Hanesbrands, Nordstrom, Revelyst (formerly Vista Outdoor), and Skechers.

Fed officials were divided over the path for monetary policy at the most recent meeting in December.
At the same time, investors are also wary that an overly weak report could signal more severe economic concern than markets currently anticipate.","NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The first full trading week of the new year could shake the U.S. stock market out of its winter holiday slumber as the monthly jobs data headlines a busy start to 2026 for investors.

Stocks slid in the final session of 2025, with the benchmark S&P 500 falling into a monthly loss for December. But the index still climbed more than 16% in 2025, its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains, while the Cboe Volatility index was last just above its lows for the year.

Trading volumes were thin at the end of 2025, but the new year could get off to an eventful start. Aside from economic data, investors await a U.S. Supreme Court decision on President Donald Trump's tariffs along with his choice of a new Federal Reserve chair, and U.S. corporate earnings season is around the corner.

While the S&P 500 is near record highs, it is also around the same level it was in late October, noted Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak.

""The market is looking for direction,"" Maley said. ""We break out of these ranges and that's going to give either people a lot of confidence or a lot of concern depending on which way it breaks.""

JOBS DATA COULD SEND RATE SIGNALS

The employment data due on January 9 could provide a jolt either way. Concerns over weakness in the labor market prompted the Fed to lower interest rates at each of its last three meetings of 2025, as the U.S. central bank juggles its goals of full employment and contained inflation.

Lower rates have supported equities, but the extent of further cuts in 2026 is unclear. Fed officials were divided over the path for monetary policy at the most recent meeting in December. Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target.

With the benchmark rate at 3.5%-3.75%, Fed funds futures suggest little chance of a cut at the next meeting in late January, but nearly a 50% chance of a quarter-point reduction in March.

""The fact that there has been softening in the labor market has really given the Fed good cover to change their outlook about reducing rates,"" said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management in Chicago.

At the same time, investors are also wary that an overly weak report could signal more severe economic concern than markets currently anticipate.

Employment for December is expected to have climbed by 55,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll. Payrolls rose by 64,000 in November, but the unemployment rate was 4.6%, a more than four-year high.

""If (employment) starts turning down in any kind of meaningful way, that's going to signal that the recession is a lot closer than people think,"" Maley said.

INFLATION, Q4 EARNINGS ALSO LOOM

Other data next week includes manufacturing and services sector activity, along with job openings and other labor market data. Economic releases are returning to more normal schedules following the 43-day government shutdown that delayed or canceled many key reports.

A closely watched report on inflation trends, the monthly U.S. consumer price index, is due out on January 13.

""Anything that has to do with underlying economic activity and inflation is really going to catch the market's attention,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, adding that a backdrop of modest economic growth and moderating inflation is ""a good environment for stocks and for risk assets in general.""

Investors will be gearing up for fourth-quarter earnings season, with results from JPMorgan on January 13, along with other major bank reports that week.

With stocks trading at historically lofty valuations, investors are banking on strong earnings growth. Overall S&P 500 company earnings are expected to have climbed 13% in 2025, with another 15.5% rise in 2026, according to LSEG IBES data.

""To make an investment case for the S&P 500 at current levels, one must believe in some combination of good/very good earnings growth and continued investor confidence in economic conditions and macro policy,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a research note.

Quick Summary – TLDR:

Morgan Stanley projects over 200,000 banking jobs will disappear in Europe by 2030 due to AI and automation.

The cuts target back-office and compliance roles as banks adopt AI for risk checks, customer service, and reporting.

Major banks like ABN AMRO and Société Générale are already implementing large-scale workforce reductions.

The shift also affects global peers, with firms like Goldman Sachs and UBS launching AI-driven restructuring.

What Happened?

A new analysis by Morgan Stanley, cited by the Financial Times, has revealed that Europe’s banks are poised to cut about 10% of their workforce over the next few years. The reduction translates to more than 200,000 jobs across 35 major banks, driven largely by AI adoption, digital transformation, and continued branch closures.

The job cuts are expected to hit back-office functions the hardest, including areas like risk management, compliance, transaction processing, and customer support, where AI can streamline operations at scale.

AI’s Growing Role in Reshaping Banking

For years, European banks have struggled with high cost-to-income ratios, often exceeding 60%, despite ongoing cost-cutting efforts. As digital-first competitors and instant payments reshape customer expectations, traditional banks are now accelerating the shift to AI-driven automation to improve efficiency.

Morgan Stanley’s report suggests banks could achieve 20% to 30% efficiency gains in departments with structured, repetitive, and data-heavy tasks. These include:

Know-your-customer (KYC) verification.

Loan processing.

Trade matching.

Anti-money laundering (AML) checks.

Internal reporting and reconciliations.

With AI models now mature enough to handle document summarization, code generation, and even credit decisioning, banks are deploying them in contact centers and compliance departments to speed up operations and reduce costs.

Early Movers: Who’s Cutting Jobs Already

Some banks are already executing major workforce cuts:

ABN AMRO has announced plans to reduce its workforce by 20% by 2028, attributing the decision to digitalization and simplification.

Société Générale CEO Slavomir Kucera said “no area is off-limits” in its restructuring strategy.

UBS has created an AI avatar of analysts to deliver personalized video insights to clients, signaling a shift in how banks use talent and technology.

In the U.S., Goldman Sachs launched the “OneGS 3.0” initiative to combine hiring freezes with automation of client onboarding and regulatory work.

These actions reflect the broader trend of AI reducing the need for traditional human labor in banking operations.

The Human Cost and Regulatory Concerns

While AI promises faster decisions and better customer experiences, the human impact is significant. Entire departments, particularly central services and middle-office roles, face downsizing. Although front-line roles in complex corporate lending and wealth management may be safer for now, even these are being reevaluated as technology evolves.

There are also concerns about regulatory oversight. The EU’s AI Act classifies many banking applications as high-risk, requiring rigorous human oversight. The European Banking Authority and ECB are pressing institutions to monitor model risk, fairness, and data quality, increasing the cost and complexity of implementation.

To avoid reputational damage from AI errors such as mispriced loans or hallucinated chat responses, banks are establishing “human-in-the-loop” safeguards, while ramping up model validation and governance efforts.

Gradual Rollout Due to Labor Dynamics

The projected job cuts will not happen overnight. Labor laws, unions, and national regulations in Europe typically require lengthy consultations and severance agreements. For instance, banks in Spain and Italy have historically leaned on early retirement and voluntary exits during restructuring.

Therefore, the estimated 200,000 job reduction is expected to occur in phases through 2030 rather than in one sweep.

Platts first proposed these changes in a subscriber note published on Oct. 14, available here (opens in a new tab).

Following market feedback, Platts notified its decision to implement the proposed changes in a subscriber note on Nov. 14 available here (opens in a new tab).

Platts had clarified in the same subscriber note that its existing Atlantic iron ore blast furnace pellet premium assessment (IOBFP00) will reflect a premium over 61% Fe iron ore fines from January 2026, reflecting updated specifications for Platts IODEX CFR China benchmark.

New 65% basis Atlantic BF pellet premium assessment

Platts has launched a new Atlantic iron ore blast furnace pellet premium to reflect the premium over the Platts iron ore fines 65% Fe CFR China assessment.

This follows market feedback indicating higher liquidity and usage of Atlantic pellet premium contract settlements over 65% Fe fines.

The new assessment has the following specifications:

The assessment will reflect a 4:30 pm London timestamp on the first business day of the month and follow the London holiday calendar. The assessment will be published in SBB Steel Markets Daily, and on fixed pages STL1160, PMA1160.

The assessment will consider market information reported to Platts and published throughout the preceding month, including firm bids and offers, transactions and indications, as well as any other data deemed relevant to the assessment process.

Existing Atlantic BF pellet premium to continue reflecting differential over IODEX

As previously communicated, Platts will continue to assess its existing Atlantic Iron Ore Blast Furnace Pellet Contract Price Premium over the quality-adjusted medium grade iron ore fines benchmark (IOBFP00), which will be published in parallel to the new 65% basis Atlantic BF pellet premium assessment, effective Jan. 2, 2026.

In addition, Platts clarified the basis of this assessment (IOBFP00) will continue to reflect the additional charge over the quality-adjusted iron ore fines on a 62% Fe basis, until contractual premiums are observed to have migrated to settling against the updated IODEX reflecting 61% Fe iron ore fines.

Celltrion shares rallied Friday after the South Korean biosimilar maker secured a new U.S. contract and forecast a quarterly earnings beat.

The stock jumped as much as 13% to 204,500 won in afternoon trading in Seoul, on track for its steepest gain in two years and outperformed the Kospi, which rose about 2%.

Earlier in the day, Celltrion said it had secured a $473 million contract manufacturing organization deal from Eli Lilly. The four-year CMO contract came as the South Korean company completed its acquisition of a U.S. facility from the American pharmaceutical firm.

Celltrion said in September that it purchased an Eli Lilly biologics facility in Branchburg, N.J., for 460 billion won, equivalent to $318.8 million, as part of a roughly $1 billion investment plan to acquire and expand the site to reduce U.S. tariff risks.

In a preliminary earnings forecast issued earlier this week, Celltrion said it expects operating profit to more than double from a year earlier to a quarterly record of 472 billion won for the October-December period. That estimate would exceed the FactSet-compiled consensus forecast of 408 billion won.

The company also said it expects revenue to rise 21% from a year earlier to a record 1.284 trillion won in the fourth quarter, lifting annual revenue above 4 trillion won.

Nomura analyst Cindy Park said Friday that Celltrion's 2026 revenue target of 5.3 trillion won supports a positive outlook, citing the company's plan to scale up its contract development and manufacturing organization business using the U.S. plant acquired from Eli Lilly.

In 2025, Celltrion launched five new biosimilars that Nomura estimates will begin contributing to revenue from 2026. The company currently has 11 biosimilars in its portfolio and is actively expanding product formulations, Park noted.

Analysts H.J. Wi and Dayong Lee of Korea Investment & Securities said Friday that they expect Celltrion's revenue and operating profit to grow 27% and 44%, respectively, in 2026, with the U.S. CMO business likely to accelerate revenue growth and improve operating margins. They raised their target price to 240,000 won from 220,000 won and maintained a buy rating.

According to the lawsuit, the family of four flew from Virginia to Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport on March 21 before boarding a KLM flight to Amsterdam.
Afterward, they learned that KLM flight attendants had filed a complaint internally about the infestation.
A spokesperson for Delta Air Lines shared a comment with CBS News Atlanta.
“As this pending litigation eventually states, the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines,” the statement reads.","A Virginia family has filed a lawsuit against Delta Air Lines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, claiming they were bitten by bed bugs during a flight.

The complaint, filed on December 18 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, alleges that the Albuquerque family’s vacation from Roanoke to Belgrade, Serbia, was ruined when the infestation forced them to discard their clothes and personal belongings.

According to the lawsuit, the family of four flew from Virginia to Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport on March 21 before boarding a KLM flight to Amsterdam.

Although KLM operated the flight, the tickets were purchased through Delta’s SkyMiles program.

While seated in business class, just behind first class, Lisandra Garcia reportedly began feeling bugs crawling on her and noticed bites, reports say

When the couple alerted flight attendants, the lawsuit claims they were told to “keep their voices down to avoid a ‘panic’ on the airplane.”

The complaint adds that, before landing in Amsterdam, flight attendants again urged Dr. Albuquerque and Garcia not to report the infestation, warning that doing so could cause them to miss their connecting flight to Serbia.

Upon disembarking, the family was allegedly handed plastic bags for their personal items.

Reports say the lawsuit includes several photos showing bugs on Garcia’s sweater and what appears to be insects on a napkin branded with the airline’s name.

The family says they began experiencing bites during the flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam. Afterward, they learned that KLM flight attendants had filed a complaint internally about the infestation.

Once they reached their final destination, the lawsuit claims, all four family members suffered welts, rashes, and lesions.

The Albuquerques are seeking $200,000 (USD) in damages, along with any other relief the court deems appropriate, to cover their injuries, medical expenses, and related losses.

A spokesperson for Delta Air Lines shared a comment with CBS News Atlanta.

“As this pending litigation eventually states, the allegations at issue relate to flights not operated by Delta Air Lines,” the statement reads. “Delta will review the complaint and respond accordingly in due course.”

KLM has yet to comment publicly on the lawsuit.",https://www.paxnews.com/storage/app/uploads/public/695/7ba/303/6957ba303569e337327695.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 10:02:07.708947

The court in Beijing backed the validity of Novo Nordisk's compound patent for semaglutide, which is the main ingredient in the company's obesity therapy Wegovy and diabetes treatments Ozempic and Rybelsus, used by tens of millions of people worldwide.
""This outcome is very positive for semaglutide and demonstrates firm government support for protecting medical innovation,"" said Doustdar.
Meanwhile, ex-US sales of semaglutide products could become increasingly important as the prices of GLP-1 drugs come under pressure in the US.
Novo Nordisk has previously said that the compound patent expiry of the semaglutide molecule in certain countries is expected to have an estimated negative low-single-digit impact on global sales growth in 2026, and it suggested that the Chinese ruling does not alter that prediction.","Novo Nordisk has been handed a crucial legal win by China's Supreme Court, which has upheld the company's patent protection on GLP-1 agonist semaglutide used for diabetes and weight loss.

The court in Beijing backed the validity of Novo Nordisk's compound patent for semaglutide, which is the main ingredient in the company's obesity therapy Wegovy and diabetes treatments Ozempic and Rybelsus, used by tens of millions of people worldwide.

The importance of the ruling can't be overstated, given that China is the second-largest pharma market worldwide, after the US, and semaglutide products collectively contributed almost three-quarters of the Danish group's sales in the first nine months of 2025.

It's a fillip for new Novo Nordisk chief executive Mike Doustdar, who took the helm last year with a clear remit to defend the GLP-1-based weight loss and diabetes business from rivals like Eli Lilly, as well as knock-off versions of semaglutide that sidestep the company's intellectual property (IP).

""This outcome is very positive for semaglutide and demonstrates firm government support for protecting medical innovation,"" said Doustdar.

""This decision also strengthens confidence for foreign companies' sustainable development in China and will motivate further development and introduction of innovative medicines for the benefit of patients,"" he added.

The ruling is particularly important this year, as Novo Nordisk starts extending its semaglutide franchise with the imminent launch of anew oral formulation, the Wegovy pill, that is expected to drive even further usage of GLP-1 drugs among people who – in most cases – pay for the drug out of their own pockets.

Oral Wegovy was approved in the US at the end of 2025 and is also filed in Europe, with a decision there due in the latter half of this year. It is a key product for Doustdar as he tries to turn around a business that was briefly the biggest company in Europe in 2024, fuelled by rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs, before a rapid fall in its value over the course of 2025.

Meanwhile, ex-US sales of semaglutide products could become increasingly important as the prices of GLP-1 drugs come under pressure in the US.

The year opened with the largest deal that would come: Johnson & Johnson’s $14.6 billion play for Intra-Cellular Therapeutics, putting the pharma in a commanding position in the neuroscience space. This deal also icked off a trend we would see throughout the year. In an industry with an underrepresented by women, many of the big ticket transactions this year invilved companies with a woman CEO.

Besides Intra-Cellular, there was plenty of other exciting activity, especially later in the year, which witnessed two big-ticket bidding wars.

One, between Novo Nordisk and Pfizer over obesity star Metsera, landed itself in this list by driving Pfizer to double its initial offer. The ordeal was also among the most dramatic public spats between two pharma powerhouses. The other bidding war was between Alkermes and Lundbeck over Avadel.

While it got messy and hectic times, the dealmaking activity last year suggests that Big Pharmas have the money to fund hefty purchases—and are willing to spend it. Indeed, as of October 2025, the industry had hit an aggregate takeover value of $70 billion, according to a report from Oppenheimer at the time. This sum already eclipsed the total M&A spend in 2024, 2022 and 2021.

Here, BioSpace looks back at the biggest acquisition deals of 2025.

J&J Strikes Year’s Largest Deal in January

Target: Intra-Cellular Therapies

Acquisition date: January 13

Final bid: $14.6 billion

2025 got off to an explosive start when J&J announced in January the acquisition of neurology specialist Intra-Cellular Therapies for an eye-watering $14.6 billion.

The deal, which formally closed in April, gave the healthcare giant Caplyta, a daily antipsychotic pill approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and depressive episodes in patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. In November, the FDA approved an expansion for Caplyta as an adjunctive therapy with antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Aside from Caplyta, J&J also got Intra-Cellular’s clinical pipeline, including the mid-stage ITI-1284, a deuterated form of Caplyta being tested for generalized anxiety disorder, as well as Alzheimer’s disease agitation and psychosis.

These assets will complement J&J’s own neuro portfolio, led by the antidepressant nasal spray Spravato and the antipsychotic franchise Invega. Reacting to J&J’s takeover of Intra-Cellular, Stifel analysts wrote in a Jan. 15 note that the pharma’s $14.6-billion vote of confidence “is a much-needed win for the neuroscience space,” breathing life into a field that has notoriously been difficult to succeed in.

The deal also set the tone for women-led biotechs securing exits in the double-digit billions, with CEO Sharon Mates, who co-founded Intra-Cellular back in 2002 and served as its chair, president and CEO.

Months of Negotiations Land RNA Pipeline for Novartis

Target: Avidity Biosciences

Acquisition date: October 25

Final bid: $12 billion

Joining J&J in giving neuro a nudge is Novartis, which in October put $12 billion on the line to swallow Avidity Biosciences and its portfolio of investigational RNA therapies, landing the second spot on this list.

Novartis’ proposal wasn’t always that hefty, however. Regulatory documents released a month later showed that the pharma’s initial offer was $7.4 billion—way too low for the biotech’s CEO Sarah Boyce. Months of negotiation followed, with Novartis upping its bid to $8.5 billion then $10 billion and, lastly, to the final price of $12 billion.

Avidity’s pipeline is led by three antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates (AOCs), all of which are in registrational development. These include del-zota for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), del-desiran for myotonic dystrophy type 1 and del-brax for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. AOCs consist of a monoclonal antibody to target a specific disease-related protein attached to a short string of nucleotides that produces therapeutic effects.

Leveraging this mechanism, del-zota elicited a 25% increase in dystrophin expression in DMD patients, according to a Phase I/II readout in August last year. A week before being acquired by Novartis, Avidity announced that it expects to submit a biologics license application (BLA) for del-zota in the first quarter of 2026.

Similarly, del-desiran and del-brax are moving steadily toward registration. The former is in Phase III development with first enrollment in July, while the company opened an accelerated pathway for the latter in June.

Aside from del-zota, del-desiran and del-brax, Novartis also picked up other preclinical DMD and rare neuromuscular programs from the acquisition. Avidity also has two early precision cardiology programs that will spin out into a new public company.

Merck Nabs Approved COPD Drug With $5B Potential

Target: Verona Pharma

Acquisition date: July 9

Final bid: $10 billion

Also breaking the 11-figure mark this year is Verona Pharma, which in July commanded a $10 billion buyout offer from Merck.

The centerpiece of the acquisition was Ohtuvayre, which won the FDA’s approval in June 2024 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), opening up a new mechanism of action for the indication for the first time in more than two decades. In the first quarter of this year, before Merck’s takeover, Verona reported around 25,000 prescriptions for Ohtuvayre, bringing in $71.3 million in sales. Jefferies has previously forecasted peak annual sales for Ohtuvayre between $3 billion and $5 billion.

Regulatory documents released in August 2025 revealed that Merck was the sole bidder for Verona—despite the biotech starting its search for suitors in 2023. Still, during the duration of its courtship with Merck, which began in February, a handful of other unidentified companies approached Verona to explore the possibility of Ohtuvayre-centered agreements, though none of these worked out.

The Merck transaction officially closed in October 2025.

At the time the acquisition was announced, analysts at BMO Capital Markets said that Merck’s $10-billion bet is part of its effort to “to replace commercial revenues now,” before mega-blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda loses patent protections in 2028. Indeed, the pharma in recent years has gone on a shopping spree, buying Prometheus Biosciences for $10.8 billion in April 2023.

Pfizer Battles Novo for the Hottest Obesity Biotech

Target: Metsera

Acquisition date: November 7

Final bid: $10 billion

In November, Pfizer acquired one of the brightest rising stars in the weight-loss game with a $10 billion play for Metsera. The takeover represented Pfizer’s comeback in the obesity arena after scrapping a string of disappointing assets over the years, and the pharma had to work extra hard for its prize.

Pfizer’s first bid for Metsera was a relatively modest $4.9 billion, which the biotech accepted in September. A month later, however, Novo Nordisk filed an unsolicited rival bid of $8.5 billion to snatch Metsera out from under Pfizer. Metsera dubbed the proposal “superior” to Pfizer’s offer and set off a clock for negotiations.

Pfizer bristled at these developments and called Novo’s rival proposal “reckless and unprecedented.” Later, the pharma also claimed that Metsera’s controlling stockholders—including the investors ARCH Venture Fund and Validae Health—“conspired” with Metsera and Novo to promote “anti-competitive activities.”

Pfizer sued both Novo and Metsera to stop what it called the “tortious interference” from Novo “to suppress competition.” At one point, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, joined the fray and wrote to both Novo and Metsera, warning them that the proposed deal structure may be in violation of U.S. merger guidelines.

All the while, Novo stood by its decision to try to steal Metsera away—no matter how unpopular it was—upping the bid to $10 billion. Novo’s new CEO, Maziar Mike Doustdar, even goaded Pfizer from the White House. “Our message to Pfizer is that if they would like to buy the company, then put your hand in the pocket and bid higher,” Doustdar said during an event for a drug pricing deal with the government for its GLP-1 drugs.

Ultimately, that’s what Pfizer did. The pharma eventually matched Novo’s offer, finally convincing its rival to back down and Metsera to accept the proposal.

Sanofi Takes Over Rising Cancer Star

Target: Blueprint Medicines

Acquisition date: June 2

Final bid: $9.5 billion

Closing out this list is the mid-year merger between Sanofi and rare disease specialist Blueprint Medicines, led by CEO Kate Haviland, the third female leader on this list.

The companies in June agreed to a $9.5 billion acquisition deal, giving Sanofi the FDA-approved systemic mastocytosis drug Ayvakit and a pipeline of investigational immunology and cancer therapies. In 2024, Ayvakit made $479 million. Because of the Sanofi takeover, Blueprint hasn’t reported sales figures for Ayvakit for the latter half of the year, but the pharma in its Q3 business report credited the drug as being partly responsible for a 57.1% increase in sales.

Speaking to analysts in a call after the acquisition, Sanofi’s head of specialty care Brian Foard said that Ayvakit’s launch was “just getting started” and that the pharma sees a lot of long-term potential for the drug. Beyond Ayvakit, Sanofi also got elenestinib, a KIT blocker for systemic mastocytosis.

Blueprint’s pipeline also includes BLU-808, in early-stage development for chronic urticaria, allergic rhinoconjunctivities, allergic asthma and mast cell activation syndrome. Blueprint is also bringing to the Sanofi fold several discovery-phase assets for various cancers, including breast cancer and other solid tumors.

All told, Leerink analysts in a June 2 note estimated that Blueprint’s revenues could hit $2.1 billion by 2030—though to hit this bar, Sanofi “will need to deliver on its plans to find and treat more patients.” And, for the acquisition to pay off, “it is critical, in our view, that BPMC’s pipeline delivers blockbuster revenue over the long term,” Leerink added.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/0022ca7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1241x698+0+74/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9e%2Fb5%2F980e9fe04faca1b93c48aec58031%2Fistock-1430602277.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 07:59:29.887598

Manufacturing output increased for a third consecutive month, supported in part by stock building and efforts to clear backlogs of work.

The UK manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers at around 650 manufacturers, with data collected between December 4 and 18.","(Alliance News) - UK manufacturing showed further signs of stabilisation at the end of 2025, with output and new orders edging higher and the sector recording its strongest reading in more than a year, according to survey data published by S&P Global on Thursday.

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 50.6 points in December from 50.2 in November, marking a 15-month high and remaining above the 50.0-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction.

The final reading was, however, below the earlier flash estimate of 51.2 points published in mid-December.

Manufacturing output increased for a third consecutive month, supported in part by stock building and efforts to clear backlogs of work. New orders rose for the first time since September 2024, with domestic demand cited as the main driver, while the decline in export orders eased to one of the weakest rates seen in nearly four years.

Growth was uneven across the sector. Output rose across consumer, intermediate and investment goods producers, the first time this has occurred since August 2024, but the expansion was concentrated among large manufacturers. Small and medium-sized firms continued to report declines in both output and new orders.

Employment remained in contraction territory, with job losses recorded for a 14th straight month, although the pace of decline eased to its weakest level during that period.

Price pressures picked up in December. Input cost inflation accelerated as manufacturers reported higher prices for a range of materials, including energy, metals, and electronics, and as suppliers passed on higher payroll-related costs. Output prices also rose after falling in November.

Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""Further signs of growth emanated from the UK manufacturing sector before the turn of the year. Output rose for the third successive month and new order intakes improved, albeit slightly, for the first time since September 2024.""

He added: ""UK manufacturers benefited from several reduced headwinds towards the end of the year, as the negative impacts of the uncertainty surrounding the autumn budget, tariffs and the JLR cyber-attack all moderated.

""The start of 2026 will show if growth can be sustained after these temporary boosts subside.""

The UK manufacturing PMI is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers at around 650 manufacturers, with data collected between December 4 and 18.

The UK's services and composite PMIs will be published on Tuesday.

Eine Analyse der US-Bank Morgan Stanley prognostiziert, dass europäische Geldhäuser in den kommenden fünf Jahren mehr als 210.000 Stellen streichen werden. Die Untersuchung umfasst 35 Banken mit insgesamt 2,12 Millionen Beschäftigten. Neben AI-Integration treibt auch die fortschreitende Digitalisierung des Bankgeschäfts und die Schließung von Filialen den Abbau voran. Die Institute erhoffen sich dadurch Effizienzsteigerungen von bis zu 30 Prozent.

Am stärksten trifft es zentrale Dienstleistungsbereiche: Back-Office und Middle-Office-Funktionen stehen ebenso auf der Abschussliste wie Positionen im Risikomanagement und in der Compliance. Morgan Stanley sieht vor allem in Ländern mit ungünstigem Kosten-Ertrags-Verhältnis massive Einschnitte – Deutschland und Frankreich führen diese Liste an. Allerdings sind die versprochenen Effizienzgewinne bislang nicht sichtbar geworden. Die Banken stehen unter erheblichem Druck von Investoren, ihre Kostenstrukturen zu verbessern und ihre Eigenkapitalrenditen zu steigern, die dauerhaft hinter jenen amerikanischer Wettbewerber zurückbleiben.

Konkrete Beispiele: Von ABN Amro bis Société Générale

Mehrere Institute haben bereits konkrete Schritte angekündigt: Die niederländische ABN Amro plant, bis 2028 rund ein Fünftel ihrer Vollzeitstellen abzubauen. Bei Société Générale ließ CEO Slawomir Krupa im März verlauten, dass in seinem Feldzug gegen die hartnäckig hohe Kostenbasis nichts unantastbar sei. UBS treibt die AI-Integration besonders aggressiv voran und setzt die Technologie bereits ein, um Analysten in Avatare zu verwandeln – simulierte Banker, die als Videos an Kunden verschickt werden. Das Institut hat kürzlich 250 Top-Manager zu einem AI-Leadership-Summit nach Oxford geschickt.

Die Transformation läuft auf Hochtouren, weil frühere Kostensenkungsrunden ausgereizt sind und AI neue Möglichkeiten eröffnet. Besonders konsumentenorientierte Banken und Institute in Hochkostenländern müssen handeln. Die Verlagerung des Geschäfts ins Internet beschleunigt zusätzlich den Abbau klassischer Filialstrukturen und macht traditionelle Vertriebsmodelle obsolet.

Warnung vor übereiltem Tempo

Trotz des Enthusiasmus mehren sich kritische Stimmen: Führende Banker in Europa warnen davor, AI überstürzt zu integrieren. Conor Hillery, Co-Chef von JPMorgan Chase für Europa, Naher Osten und Afrika, betont die Gefahr, dass Mitarbeiter im Eifer das Verständnis für grundlegende Bankprozesse verlieren könnten. JPMorgan versuche, eine Balance zu finden zwischen AI-gestützter Beschleunigung von Basisfunktionen und der ordentlichen Ausbildung von Junior-Mitarbeitern in Kernkompetenzen wie der Erstellung von Cashflow-Modellen. Andernfalls drohe ein massives Problem für die Zukunft, so die einhellige Warnung aus der Branche.

Jason Napier, Chef der europäischen Bankenforschung bei UBS, sieht bereits heute Branchenveränderungen in Audit, Recht und Consulting – die Banken selbst würden aber noch keine verbesserte Effizienz liefern. Die mächtigen neuen Tools seien noch nicht vollständig implementiert. Wer noch Überzeugungsarbeit brauche, dass AI den Finanzsektor grundlegend verändern werde, solle mehr Zeit mit den bereits verfügbaren Werkzeugen verbringen. Gleichzeitig gibt es auch optimistische Stimmen: Der Bitkom sieht Potenzial für neue Jobprofile, die durch vermehrten AI-Einsatz entstehen könnten. Die Prognosen zum AI-bedingten Jobabbau sind zuletzt insgesamt moderater ausgefallen als in den dramatischsten frühen Szenarien – mittlerweile zeichnet sich klarer ab, wo AI tatsächlich menschliche Arbeit ersetzen kann und wo nicht.",https://www.trendingtopics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/floriane-vita-FyD3OWBuXnY-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 05:58:57.990900

“Here’s this woman who’s supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice,” French Gates said.","Melinda French Gates is one of the wealthiest women in America but her path to a $17.4 billion fortune began with an unusual advice from hiring manager at IBM. A hiring manager at the US-based multinational technology company told her to turn down the job, and instead join Microsoft that was relatively new at that time. French Gates interned at IBM for two summers, and was on the verge of accepting a full-time position with the company.

The ‘Dumbfounding’ advice for Melinda French Gates

During the conversation, she told the hiring manager that she had interviewed with a tiny company in Seattle, according to Fortune. “My hiring manager at IBM, a female, said to me, ‘Okay, are you ready to accept the job offer?’ And I said, ‘Well, I have one more company to go interview—this little company, Microsoft. It was tiny,” French Gates said during an interview. “And she said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it.’ And it dumbfounded me,” she added. The manager’s reason was clear: She reportedly said that a young recruit would have the better chance to move up quickly at Microsoft as it was growing rapidly. French Gates took the leap and moved to the West Coast in Seattle. “I didn’t know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing. I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she said. French Gates spent nine years at Microsoft and became the General Manager of Information Products. She was a critical architect of the company’s expansion, which is now a $3.6 trillion software titan.

Melinda French Gates credits her career to IBM hiring manager

Reflecting on her journey, French Gates now uses her story to encourage other women. “I remind them all the time you can pivot careers. You can change. It’s not like one or two paths that carry you forward, even though you had plans before this,” she said. “Here’s this woman who’s supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice,” French Gates said.

Heylen made his return to the WeatherTech Championship in October at Petit Le Mans when he drove for Magnus Racing; in addition to taking the Michelin Pilot Challenge title alongside co-driver Luca Mars, he also drove for RS1 in GT World Challenge America, finishing third in the Pro class championship alongside GT3 debutant Alex Sedgwick.

The company faces lawsuits over alleged harm caused by ChatGPT, while its safety teams have been disbanded. This new role aims to balance rapid AI advancement with crucial safeguards, a challenging task given the technology's unprecedented capabilities and potential dangers.

The man who unleashed ChatGPT on the world is now sounding the alarm about his own creation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is hunting for a Head of Preparedness to tackle what he calls ""real challenges"" emerging from AI systems that have grown so sophisticated they're finding critical security vulnerabilities and impacting users' mental health. The $555,000 role comes as the company that revolutionised generative AI in late 2022 grapples with lawsuits, safety team departures, and the uncomfortable reality that its technology may be causing genuine harm. ""Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges,"" Altman wrote on X. He didn't sugarcoat the position's demands, warning applicants: ""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The new hire will lead OpenAI's preparedness framework, evaluating frontier AI capabilities and coordinating safeguards across cybersecurity, biosecurity, and the prospect of AI systems that can improve themselves—challenges that Altman admits have ""little precedent."" The company specifically needs help figuring out ""how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm. ""

Safety teams keep vanishing as products multiply

The job opening arrives amid a disturbing pattern at OpenAI: safety teams appear, then disappear. The company's Superalignment team, launched in 2023 with the mission of preventing AI systems ""much smarter than us"" from going rogue, lasted less than a year before being disbanded in May 2024. Co-leader Jan Leike quit with a blistering exit statement, declaring that ""safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products. "" The AGI Readiness team met a similar fate in October 2024, dissolved after advising on the company's preparedness for artificial general intelligence. Meanwhile, Aleksander Madry, OpenAI's previous Head of Preparedness, was reassigned in July 2024 to work on AI reasoning instead—leaving the crucial safety position vacant for months even as the technology advanced.

Lawsuits paint darker picture of AI's mental health toll

The urgency behind the new position becomes clearer when examining the lawsuits piling up against OpenAI. Multiple families allege ChatGPT reinforced delusions, deepened isolation, and even encouraged suicide. One case involves a 16-year-old California boy; another centers on a 56-year-old Connecticut man who allegedly murdered his mother and killed himself after interactions with the chatbot that fueled his paranoid delusions. OpenAI says it's working to improve ChatGPT's ability to ""recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress,"" but the company hasn't slowed its product velocity. Despite Altman's 2023 signing of a letter warning that AI extinction risks deserve priority alongside ""pandemics and nuclear war,"" OpenAI keeps accelerating. The company, now valued at $157 billion after October's $6.6 billion funding round, is reportedly negotiating with Amazon for another investment exceeding $10 billion. That contradiction—tech leaders prophesying catastrophe while racing to build the very technology they fear—hasn't gone unnoticed. ""If they honestly believe this could bring about human extinction, then why not just stop?"" asked one critic after Altman's Congressional testimony. The new Head of Preparedness will inherit that impossible balancing act: making AI safer while the company that employs them pushes relentlessly forward.

The New Jersey plant includes manufacturing facilities, a logistics warehouse, a technical support center and an operations center, spanning about 148,760 square meters.
It has current production capacity of about 66,000 liters of drug substance.
The firm also plans to enter contract manufacturing arrangements valued at about 678.7 billion won, under which it will supply biopharmaceuticals to Eli Lilly through 2029.

The New Jersey plant includes manufacturing facilities, a logistics warehouse, a technical support center and an operations center, spanning about 148,760 square meters. It has current production capacity of about 66,000 liters of drug substance.

The Korean biosimilar giant said it planned to begin expansion work immediately and invest an additional 700 billion won ($485 million) to double capacity to 132,000 liters.

The firm also plans to enter contract manufacturing arrangements valued at about 678.7 billion won, under which it will supply biopharmaceuticals to Eli Lilly through 2029. The contract period has been set at four years to allow for contingencies, Celltrion said.

The revenue from the contract manufacturing business alone is expected to allow for an early recovery of the investment costs related with acquiring the facility, excluding operating expenses, the company added.

“With the Eli Lilly agreement, our US plant is expected to post record sales this year,” a Celltrion official said. “We have begun the expansion process to strengthen production capacity, as we seek to make a leap forward as a global firm.”

For the Korean firm, buying an existing facility that meets current Good Manufacturing Practice standards allowed it to secure an overseas production base more quickly than building a new plant.

The acquisition is expected to reduce exposure to US tariff risks and ease geopolitical uncertainty by diversifying Celltrion’s global manufacturing base, the firm said.

The firm said the New Jersey plant will help improve profitability, efficiency and supply-chain stability by enabling direct manufacturing, lowering logistics costs through local sales and strengthening its presence in the world’s largest pharmaceutical market.

Financial institutions are increasingly moving operations online, trying to reduce costs and increase productivity.

Such risks are reported by the Financial Times, citing analytical assessments by Morgan Stanley. According to the investment bank, by 2030 the European banking industry could reduce about 10% of its staff, recording savings from the use of AI and large-scale digitalization of business processes.

The greatest reduction is expected to affect the so-called “central services” - back and middle offices, as well as risk management and compliance departments. The findings are based on an analysis of data from 35 large banks, which together employ about 2.12 million people.

Thus, a 10% reduction in staff would mean the loss of about 212 thousand jobs. Morgan Stanley notes that many banks are already declaring a potential efficiency increase of up to 30% through the use of artificial intelligence and the further development of digital service channels.

European credit institutions are at the same time under increasing pressure from investors who demand new tools to reduce costs and increase return on capital. For many years, these indicators in European banks have been inferior to the results of their American competitors, which reinforces the need for more radical changes.

Some banks have already openly called AI a key catalyst for restructuring. In particular, in November, the Dutch ABN Amro announced plans to reduce about a fifth of its staff by 2028. And Société Générale CEO Sławomir Krupa warned back in March that “nothing is sacred” in the cost-cutting program.

Morgan Stanley analysts believe that it is artificial intelligence that gives banks a chance to significantly improve their cost-to-income ratio, a key performance indicator closely watched by investors. Previous waves of cost optimization have almost exhausted their potential, and without a technological breakthrough, further cost reductions are becoming increasingly difficult.

The forecast also emphasizes that the deepening of digitalization and the introduction of AI can significantly change the banking landscape of Europe in the coming years. The most tangible transformations are expected in retail banking and in countries such as France and Germany, where the cost-to-income ratio still remains relatively high.

The rapid development of artificial intelligence in general is increasing fears of mass layoffs in various sectors of the economy, as technology gradually approaches the level at which it can replace a significant part of human labor. The potential of AI to transform the banking sector is also recognized by UBS, which is already using this technology to create “virtual bankers” — analyst avatars that send personalized video messages to clients.

COMPAGNIE GÉNÉRALE DES ÉTABLISSEMENTS MICHELIN

Michelin annonce deux projets d’acquisition,

visant à renforcer son activité Polymer Composite Solutions

Michelin accélère sa croissance avec l’acquisition de Cooley Group et de Tex Tech Industries, deux leaders des marchés de tissus enduits et textiles techniques.

Hausse d’environ 20 % du chiffre d’affaires de l’activité Polymer Composite Solutions, qui deviendra prochainement un segment de reporting spécifique dans la communication financière du Groupe.

Opérations intégralement financées par la trésorerie disponible, solidité financière préservée; clôtures des transactions attendues au premier semestre 2026.

Dans le cadre de sa stratégie « Michelin in Motion 2030 », le Groupe capitalise sur son savoir-faire et son expertise pour se développer sur de nouveaux marchés à forte valeur ajoutée. Au cours des deux derniers mois, Michelin a conclu des accords en vue d’acquérir Cooley Group, spécialiste des tissus enduits industriels, et Tex Tech Industries, concepteur et fabricant de premier plan de textiles et tissus spécialisés. Ces deux entreprises présentent une forte complémentarité stratégique avec le Groupe, partageant un même engagement en faveur de l’innovation et de la qualité des produits, tout en opérant sur des géographies complémentaires.

Célébrant son 100e anniversaire en 2026 et ayant son siège à Rhode Island (États-Unis), Cooley est mondialement reconnue pour son expertise dans les tissus enduits polymères haute performance. L’entreprise est intégrée verticalement, avec des capacités en tissage, tricotage et extrusion de polymères. Cooley Group conçoit et fabrique des solutions polymères innovantes et durables pour un large panel d’applications, notamment les dispositifs médicaux, l’étanchéité, la rétention d’eau et de produits chimiques, ainsi que d’autres solutions critiques environnementales.

Fondée en 1904 dans le Maine (États-Unis), Tex Tech Industries est l'un des principaux concepteurs et fabricants de textiles, tissus et revêtements spécialisés destinés à un large éventail d'industries et d'applications de niche. La société a créé des solutions pour certaines des applications les plus exigeantes, notamment des systèmes de protection thermique pour les véhicules spatiaux, des matériaux résistant au feu pour le fuselage des avions, des textiles ignifuges pour les sièges d'avion et des tissus sur mesure pour les applications composites.

Michelin est déjà leader européen dans le domaine des tissus enduits avec des marques telles que Orca. Ces deux acquisitions accéléreraient fortement son expansion sur de nouveaux marchés et dans de nouvelles régions, et augmenteraient d'environ 20 % (~ 280 millions de dollars) le chiffre d'affaires de l’activité Polymer Composite Solutions de Michelin.

Les deux transactions devraient être finalisées au cours du premier semestre 2026, sous réserve des ajustements habituels et des autorisations de contrôle des fusions dans les juridictions concernées. Elles seraient entièrement financées par la trésorerie disponible, pour des montants non divulgués à ce stade.

Comme l’activité Polymer Composite Solutions atteint une taille significative au sein de Michelin, le Groupe prévoit de créer un segment de reporting dédié à partir de 2026.

In 2024, DrDoctor launched Smart Centre, an AI tool that predicts which patients are most likely to miss appointments and adjusts capacity accordingly.
DrDoctor had access to four billion rows of data, including records of 55 million patients and 160 million appointments.
Alongside the predictor is an AI voice agent that handles routine queries, manages appointments and provides pre and post-appointment support.
The company manages more than 140 million appointments for 36 million patients through 70 NHS organisations, covering almost two thirds of the country.","Until recently, DrDoctor tried to tackle the epidemic of missed appointments through fixes such as reminder texts. But Whicher, 41, said the company reached a point where it “hit a barrier as to what we can achieve”. With AI, he said, it has now built tools that five years ago would have been “unimaginable”.

In 2024, DrDoctor launched Smart Centre, an AI tool that predicts which patients are most likely to miss appointments and adjusts capacity accordingly. Early results show that non-attendance rates have fallen by about 30 per cent at hospitals using Smart Centre, which would equate to a savings opportunity of £300 million every year for the NHS. One site treated 9,000 additional patients in three months, while another eliminated out-of-hours clinics.

The platform uses machine learning to score the likelihood of a patient attending their appointment, based on demographics, age, deprivation indices, past attendance records and the time and day of the appointment.

DrDoctor had access to four billion rows of data, including records of 55 million patients and 160 million appointments. A team of ten software engineers spent months cleaning and anonymising the data before training their model with it.

Development took roughly two years, funded largely by a £1 million award from the Department of Health and Social Care. DrDoctor pays back the investment via revenue sharing and offers the NHS a discount.

Once the system was live, the harder task of persuading hospitals to change how they operate began. As well as overhauling old systems, the company had to retrain staff and ensure patients were on board. Engineers were deployed to hospitals to work with admin teams to build out and test the model. Educating workers and patients “is more important than almost anything else”, Whicher said.

Alongside the predictor is an AI voice agent that handles routine queries, manages appointments and provides pre and post-appointment support. An early attempt at voice AI was shelved because it sounded, in Whicher’s words, “like a robot”. When the team revisited it six months ago, the technology had moved on so much that the second build took a quarter of the time and now features regionally accented voices.

“Patients get very frustrated by not being able to get through on the phone, and equally hospital administrators spend a lot of time on relatively routine tasks that actually can be done amazingly well by AI,” Whicher said.

By automating routine calls, staff are freed to support patients with more complicated needs, such as those facing language barriers.

DrDoctor now plans to expand the voice agent’s remit to include medical queries and recovery support, potentially reducing the need for follow-up hospital visits.

The company manages more than 140 million appointments for 36 million patients through 70 NHS organisations, covering almost two thirds of the country.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F33e6e4d3-d875-4408-b391-6b416b3dcb2e.jpg?crop=1653%2C930%2C165%2C125&resize=1200,N,,2026-01-02 06:59:09.364561

According to a Morgan Stanley analysis cited by the Financial Times, more than 200,000 jobs could be eliminated across European banks by 2030 as lenders increasingly rely on AI and continue to close physical branches.
The figure represents close to 10% of the combined workforce at 35 of the region’s largest banks, underlining the scale of the transformation now underway.
Morgan Stanley estimates that banks could unlock efficiency improvements of around 30% by deploying AI more aggressively across these functions, making workforce reductions a tempting lever for improving profitability.

According to a Morgan Stanley analysis cited by the Financial Times, more than 200,000 jobs could be eliminated across European banks by 2030 as lenders increasingly rely on AI and continue to close physical branches. The figure represents close to 10% of the combined workforce at 35 of the region’s largest banks, underlining the scale of the transformation now underway.

The impact is expected to be most severe in back-office functions, risk management, and compliance—areas that form the operational backbone of banking but are now prime targets for automation. These roles involve data-heavy, repetitive processes where algorithms can process information faster and with fewer errors than human teams. Morgan Stanley estimates that banks could unlock efficiency improvements of around 30% by deploying AI more aggressively across these functions, making workforce reductions a tempting lever for improving profitability.

While the report focuses on Europe, similar dynamics are playing out globally. In the United States, Goldman Sachs warned employees as early as October about upcoming job cuts and a hiring freeze extending through the end of 2025. These measures are part of the firm’s AI-driven transformation initiative, “OneGS 3.0,” which aims to automate and streamline operations ranging from client onboarding to regulatory reporting.

Several European lenders have already begun acting on these strategies. Dutch bank ABN Amro has announced plans to reduce its workforce by around 20% by 2028, signaling a deep structural shift rather than short-term belt-tightening. At France’s Société Générale, the tone has been equally stark, with the bank’s chief executive declaring that “nothing is sacred” when it comes to efficiency and restructuring.

However, not all industry leaders are convinced that aggressive cuts are risk-free. Some senior executives have cautioned that over-reliance on automation could erode critical skills over time. A JPMorgan Chase executive told the Financial Times that if junior bankers are no longer trained in core fundamentals, the industry may pay the price later in reduced expertise and resilience.

Out of the 540 players in the NBA, Demin is the eleventh-youngest.","Progress isn’t always linear, especially when the athlete in question isn’t old enough to buy a drink.

At BYU, Egor Demin was a 6’9” walking mismatch who overwhelmed opponents with his unusual combination of size and coordination as a ball-handler. After all, he was the tallest guard measured at the NBA Combine since the league began publishing measurements in 2000!

The NBA, of course, does not care about your college dominance. There’s a physical specimen around every corner now, and the 19-year-old is still ways away from imposing his will on anyone at this level.

The rookie has been hesitant to attack the basket, taking the lowest percentage of two-point attempts on the team.

In Monday’s loss to the Golden State Warriors, Dëmin didn’t attempt a single shot in the paint and committed two costly turnovers in the fourth quarter.

“He has high expectations for himself and I’m gonna say the same,” said Jordi Fernandez. “I want more paint touches. I want more assists. I want more physicality in both ends. He’s gonna try to do his best. That’s a good thing about our young guys.”

Here’s the strange part. The 19-year-old has struggled in areas where he was expected to thrive while excelling in a spot where the concern was loudest.

All of a sudden, he can shoot. Like, really shoot.

He has made 62 three-pointers up to this point of the season, the second-most among NBA rookies. Demin knocked down seven threes against Golden State, setting a single-game franchise rookie record in the process.

At this pace, he’s on track to make 170 threes this season, which would break the Nets’ rookie record set by Kerry Kittles in 1996–97.

This newfound comfort from beyond the arc has come as a surprise, especially for a player who shot nearly 10 percent lower from three in college. At BYU, he shot 27.1 percent while attempting 4.7 threes per game, compared to 36.5% on 6.1 attempts per game this season.

A plantar fascia injury kept him from doing much of anything this summer, so all he could do was shoot from a chair while working on rhythm, mechanics, and muscle memory. Eventually, that limitation turned into a much-needed reset.

“It comes from the summer work for sure. That was one of my biggest focuses,” Demin said. “People were questioning my 3-point shot a lot, questioning if I would even shoot them. I’m lucky to have a really good coaching staff around me here that wants me to shoot any time I can.”

Now, it’s just a matter of putting it all together.

The rookie point guard has shown a willingness to improve, already packing on over 10 pounds since getting drafted in hopes of smoothing the transition to the physicality of the league.

He’s also exhibited impressive patience and self-awareness along the way, a sign he’s ready to put in the work to fully reach his potential.

“I’m much more comfortable, for sure,” Demin said. “Mentally I’m understanding the game better. And just adjusting to the game, growing the right way. Being able to spend as much time on the court as Jordi’s giving me, it’s an honor.”

After flashing his undeniable potential - and making some typical rookie mistakes - Nets veteran center Nic Claxton offered some words of encouragement to the former No. 8 overall pick after Monday’s game.

“It was a big confidence builder for him,” Nic Claxton said. “He hit some really big shots for us. Obviously, there’s still a lot of errors where he can learn from. But the sky’s the limit for him and he’ll keep getting better.”

There’s no need to rush his development. Out of the 540 players in the NBA, Demin is the eleventh-youngest.

It might take a few off-seasons and some growing pains, but the pieces are there, and the person in charge seems determined to put the puzzle together.",https://platform.netsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/113/2026/01/gettyimages-2253405989.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.738243033746%2C100%2C78.523513932507&w=1200,N,,2026-01-02 02:58:35.437765

Despite the market gains, Barclays said investor flows into UK equities remained negative.
UK equity funds recorded net outflows of $33.7 billion in 2025, making the UK the only major region to see sustained redemptions over the year.
Sector composition was a key factor supporting UK equities, Barclays said.
The brokerage also showed that value stocks outperformed in Europe, while U.S. market gains remained concentrated in growth and technology shares.","Investing.com -- The UK emerged as an unexpected equity market winner in 2025 as global investors rotated out of U.S. assets and increased exposure to international markets, according to ’ European Equity Strategy annual review.

Barclays said global equities delivered strong gains for a third straight year, with the rising 21%. Market leadership shifted away from the United States, with about 70% of MSCI country indices outperforming the U.S.

This shift reflected what Barclays described as growing cracks in U.S. exceptionalism and a renewed focus on international diversification.

The rotation accelerated early in the year after a sharp de-rating of U.S. mega-cap technology stocks linked to artificial intelligence, which triggered declines in U.S. equities and the dollar.

Barclays said concerns around monetisation, capital spending and competition in AI-heavy stocks prompted investors to reallocate toward markets outside the U.S., lifting equities across Europe, the UK, China and Japan.

European equities outperformed the U.S. by 16% in dollar terms over the year, the largest margin since 2006, Barclays said.

That outperformance was driven by strong gains in European bank stocks and the sharp fall in the dollar. In local currency terms, performance was more mixed, but dollar weakness amplified returns for non-U.S. markets, including the UK.

Within Europe, Barclays said the UK stood out given its starting position. The brokerage described the UK equity market as “deeply unloved” heading into 2025, yet UK equities recorded mid-teen percentage gains in local currency terms.

That placed the UK broadly in line with Germany, which also posted mid-teen gains, and ahead of France, which lagged with single-digit returns amid political instability.

Currency movements played a central role in relative performance, according to the brokerage. Barclays said Europe’s outperformance versus the U.S. was significantly stronger in dollar terms than in local currency terms because the U.S. dollar fell sharply during the year, boosting returns from UK and European assets for global investors.

Despite the market gains, Barclays said investor flows into UK equities remained negative. UK equity funds recorded net outflows of $33.7 billion in 2025, making the UK the only major region to see sustained redemptions over the year.

By contrast, Europe excluding the UK attracted $88.8 billion of inflows, while emerging market equity funds drew $118 billion. Barclays said this divergence showed that the UK’s equity performance occurred even as investors continued to reduce exposure.

Sector composition was a key factor supporting UK equities, Barclays said. Financial stocks, particularly banks, were among the strongest performers across Europe in 2025, benefiting UK indices with significant exposure to the sector.

The brokerage also showed that value stocks outperformed in Europe, while U.S. market gains remained concentrated in growth and technology shares.

Barclays said the UK’s performance unfolded during a year marked by tariff shocks, geopolitical tensions and shifts in monetary policy.

U.S. equities, bonds and the dollar all declined sharply at points during the year, accelerating the reallocation toward international markets, including Europe and the UK.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXNPEL3A10R_L.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 02:58:41.384805

“And when those cash-rich giants are not standing behind a deal, investors are now behaving pretty rationally.
The tech industry went into 2025 with a ton of political power in everything from AI to crypto to antitrust regulation.
These are all shaping up to be issues in the midterm elections.” “Maybe 2026 will start and end just like 2025 did.
Probably not.” Lots to ponder indeed going into the new year in this AI Tech Wave.","Let me add my ‘Happy New Year’s Day’ Wishes to the flood in front of us all this Friday before a holiday weekend. As I outlined yesterday, this AI Tech Wave is lined up for a similar but larger 2026 for all things AI relative to 2025. Have gone through our 2025 look-back and 2026 look forward. And it feels like it’s going to be more of the same, just more. Like the Volume turned up to 11.

The big question all year of course has been the ‘AI Bubble’ one. And all things considered, pros and cons, we’re likely not quite there. Despite anecdotal data points around and beyond AI. But timing on these things is always hard.

Especially given the macro, geopolitical headwinds that vex this tech wave differently than most ones past.

The Information rings up the pros and cons of the AI sentiments ahead well in “Get Ready for a New Year and Brace for a Very Different One”:

“For an eventful year, 2025 is ending the same way it started. A year ago, Nvidia, OpenAI and others made it clear they would do everything necessary to win the race for artificial intelligence.”

“The year ended with the same companies doing the same thing. Nvidia capped off a year of dealmaking—mostly to cement its lead in AI chips by agreeing to pay $20 billion to license technology from Groq, one of its best-funded challengers. OpenAI is ending the year with a bang too, aiming to raise $100 billion in capital and in talks with Amazon for a $10 billion investment.”

“A lot did change in the last 12 months, and some of those changes could become challenges in 2026. The biggest shift is that AI went from interesting but hypothetical for most people into a reality of everyday life.”

And of course there’ve been the ‘flashing green lights’ from the markets going brighter:

“In U.S. financial markets, AI became a powerful force. It also fed inflation by pushing up electricity prices. On the ground, it generated more grumpiness than goodwill, with communities and local officials complaining about data centers and people blaming AI for the economy’s weak job growth. Warranted or not, the companies building AI will have to deal with the fallout in 2026.”

And the deals got more fantastic and frenetic well into the last days of 2025.

“Another thing that changed: The deals got more head-scratchier, as we’ve reported. OpenAI’s quest for $100 billion raises an obvious question: Where do you get $100 billion? Nvidia’s deal for Groq raises another one: Why pay $20 billion for a company that was valued at $6.9 billion just a few months ago, and not get the whole company?”

“As I’ve written, I don’t think we’re in an AI bubble right now. That’s largely because the main funders of the buildout are the richest, most valuable companies in the world. If the Groq deal amounts to nothing, it will be little more than a scratch on Nvidia’s finances and reputation.”

Partly it’s because the $22 trillion in big tech Mag 7 market caps behind the GDP goosing hundreds of billions in AI investments last year. Growing further again this new year, with OpenAI leading the way.

“And when those cash-rich giants are not standing behind a deal, investors are now behaving pretty rationally. CoreWeave, the cloud provider that is a leveraged bet on AI, had a spectacular IPO. But investors sobered up when it struggled with data center construction delays and when doubts grew about the scale of its borrowing. The stock is down 60% from its peak.”

“In retrospect, the peak of AI euphoria may have occurred on Sept. 10 when Oracle added nearly $250 billion in market capitalization after reporting a huge increase in future contract revenue, largely tied to AI. Since then, Oracle is down 40% and that $250 billion is long gone.”

“Now, the market is quick to deliver its harsh judgment. Fermi America, the young data center developer cofounded by former Texas Governor Rick Perry, had a successful IPO a few weeks after Oracle’s big day, when AI euphoria was still in the air. But Fermi said in mid-December it lost a data center tenant. Its shares fell 40%. Something pretty amazing will need to happen for investors to fall in love with CoreWeave, Oracle or Fermi again.”

Those AI Infrastructure plays have had their ups and downs last year.

“The worst investor behavior may be over, but you can bet that market strategists and financial advisers are still talking about an AI bubble with their clients. The advice is the same: diversify. The seven giant tech stocks account for 36% of the S&P 500’s value and 26% of its earnings, according to Goldman Sachs. What about the other 493 stocks, or the rest of the world for that matter?”

“If investors do diversify, it will mean selling tech stocks and buying everything else, including foreign stocks, which collectively trounced the tech giants in 2025.”

“Another headwind could be interest rates. Everyone in Silicon Valley remembers the wreckage wrought by the Federal Reserve when it raised interest rates in 2022. Now, the Fed is cutting short-term interest rates. But recently, long-term rates haven’t followed them down.”

Especially given the margin and balance sheet math concerns around these AI investments that continue and accelerate this year.

“If President Donald Trump’s new appointee to lead the Fed loses credibility with investors, they could start to worry about inflation and push up long-term rates. That could squeeze any remaining speculation out of the AI buildout.”

“The last potential shift is politics. The tech industry went into 2025 with a ton of political power in everything from AI to crypto to antitrust regulation. Now the industry faces fears of AI-driven job losses, higher electricity prices, and a boom and bust in speculative crypto that has cost investors—not the crypto industry—dearly. These are all shaping up to be issues in the midterm elections.”

“Maybe 2026 will start and end just like 2025 did. Probably not.”

Lots to ponder indeed going into the new year in this AI Tech Wave. Eyes wide open for us all starting monday.

LONDON, GREATER LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, January 2, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ -- ""The Professional Services market is dominated by a mix of global consulting leaders and fast-growing regional service providers. Companies are focusing on expanding digital capabilities, enhancing domain-specific expertise, and delivering integrated service models to strengthen market presence and maximize client value. Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial for stakeholders seeking growth opportunities and long-term strategic partnerships.

Which Market Player Is Leading the Professional Services Market?

According to our research, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited led global sales in 2023 with a 1% market share. The company is completely involved in the professional services market, provides digital transformation, regulatory compliance, and workforce management solutions. Deloitte integrates technology with business strategies, delivering services in areas like finance, operations, cybersecurity, and sustainability to enhance performance and efficiency for professional services firms.

How Concentrated Is the Professional Services Market?

The market is fragmented, with the top 10 players accounting for 6% of total market revenue in 2023. This level of fragmentation reflects the industry’s broad service offerings, diverse client requirements, and relatively lower entry barriers compared with highly specialized enterprise segments. Leading vendors such as Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Ernst & Young (EY), KPMG, Accenture, IBM, AECOM, WPP, Publicis Groupe, and McKinsey & Company maintain their positions through extensive global networks, multidisciplinary expertise, and established client relationships, while numerous smaller firms serve niche consulting, design, and research needs. As demand for integrated, digital, and strategy-driven professional services accelerates, consolidation, partnerships, and capability expansion are expected to gradually strengthen the influence of major players within the broader professional services market.

ID39,S&P Global,2026-01-02 04:13:19+00:00,The Detroit News,Ford had a record-breaking recall year. Here's how it plans to fix quality - The Detroit News,Breana Noble,,,,,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2026/01/01/ford-recalls-record-year-2025/87706806007/,"Ford Motor Co. ended a record-breaking recall year with 152 notices to consumers in 2025 concerning safety issues or product defects requiring repair.
The recall totals are a sign of the Blue Oval's prioritization of quality, safety and warranty cost reductions, Ford executives said.
Initial quality for products rolling off the line in 2025 is among Ford's best ever, according to internal data, said Josh Halliburton, Ford's executive director of quality.
Ford has increased its monitoring for quality problems, Galhotra said.
Shoring up manufacturing operations, adding camera systems and implementing plant-specific targets for process improvements are also ways in which Ford is seeking to improve quality.","Ford Motor Co. ended a record-breaking recall year with 152 notices to consumers in 2025 concerning safety issues or product defects requiring repair. But executives say quality costs are improving.

The Dearborn automaker nearly doubled the record previously set by General Motors Co. of 77 recalls in 2014, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's recall tracker. From faulty parking modules that create the potential for rollaways to risks of parts detaching from SUVs to notices that an electrical short may create conditions for a fire to spark, issues have run the gamut. And those cost the automaker time, money and reputation among consumers.

""I would like the consumers to know that we stand behind our products,"" Kumar Galhotra, Ford's chief operating officer, said in an interview with The Detroit News. ""Our initial quality has improved substantially this year, and if something does go wrong with their vehicle, I want them to know that we will act promptly to take care of it.""

Stellantis NV reported 53 recalls in 2025. GM was fourth in recalls with 27, according to NHTSA, behind RV manufacturer Forest River.

The recall totals are a sign of the Blue Oval's prioritization of quality, safety and warranty cost reductions, Ford executives said. Over the past two years, the company doubled its safety team to find and fix problems, and now it is testing critical systems to failure. Initial quality for products rolling off the line in 2025 is among Ford's best ever, according to internal data, said Josh Halliburton, Ford's executive director of quality.

But for customers, recalls can come with frustrations. John MacLellan, 37, an attorney in Jacksonville, Florida, faced challenges with buying a Mustang Mach-E this summer after the automaker ordered dealers not to deliver the electric vehicles due to a lockout issue.

""They text me that they'll get the keys ready, and then I hear nothing, and I hear nothing,"" MacLellan said about reaching out to a dealer to buy the SUV. ""I see the news on Reddit. It makes you a little leery that it could theoretically trap a kid inside.""

Ford last month also cited cost improvements in its announcement to raise its 2025 adjusted operating earning guidance to about $7 billion. That was up from $6 billion to $6.5 billion it stated in November, though still would represent a more than 30% decrease from 2024 following the advent of President Donald Trump's tariffs, supply chain disruptions, the expiration of the federal plug-in vehicle tax credit and consumer sentiment deterioration. Ford will report annual financial results on Feb. 10.

Galhotra declined to provide financial specifics, citing the company's blackout period ahead of reporting earnings, but said costs have improved for multiple quarters now and part of that is quality and warranty.

""Our warranty costs are going down,"" he said, ""and that's obviously directly related to improving initial quality of the vehicles that we're selling, and improving the cost of repairs, and lowering the repairs for vehicles already in customers' hands.""

Last year's recalls included about 40 reissued related to software. An audit found the company didn't have a robust way of ensuring the software was in the right place. The effort was to ensure the software had been installed correctly.

Increasingly, recalls are able to be fixed with over-the-air updates. Nonetheless, dealers like Jim Seavitt, owner of Village Ford in Dearborn, said their service departments regularly have full-day schedules of addressing recalls. Meanwhile, dozens of new vehicles sit on the lot, unable to be delivered because they need a fix.

""They’ve taken a lot of what could be customer-paid work, and they don’t pay that well,"" Seavitt said of the impact of the recall repairs on his business. ""It used to be: 'Quality is job one.' Somewhere, they lost that.""

Consumers weigh dozens of matters in a decision to buy a vehicle, including recalls and repairs, said Stephanie Brinley, S&P Global Mobility's AutoIntelligence principal automotive analyst. They can forgive a mistake, but how an automaker addresses the problem is what really makes a difference.

""Some people get a bunch of recall notices and don’t think it's important and don’t do anything about it,"" she said. ""Having a ton of recalls looks bad, but on the other hand, it's how well it’s handled from the consumers’ perspective — how quickly, how well or how efficiently.""

Recalls also aren't the only way to assess quality. Automakers regularly release fixes, especially over-the-air updates, that aren't safety-related. Issuing those repairs, however, shows how a company is standing behind its product, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions LLC.

""The screens and hybrids and all the different technology that has gone into every vehicle today ... there are going to be stumbles along the way,"" he said. ""Ford might be showing all of its issues, whereas other manufacturers probably haven’t displayed problems that they’re likely having. Ford, being family-owned, they’re not going to let the lawyers take care of everything.""

According to an analysis by DeMayo Law Offices LLP, however, Ford was the top brand to be involved in class action lawsuits between 2020 and 2025. A study from automotive search iSeeCars.com looking at more than 30 years of recalls between 1985 and 2016 found Ford in that timeframe was the least proactive in issuing recalls.

Ford has increased its monitoring for quality problems, Galhotra said. But ultimately, it doesn't matter from where an initial indicator of a problem comes, but that the automaker is in a position to address the issue, he said.

Galhotra illustrated the complexity of addressing software bugs: A driver simply opening the vehicle door, sitting down, turning on the vehicle and putting their seatbelt on creates all sorts of scenarios.

""Someone might get in the vehicle after opening the door in 100 milliseconds. Somebody might do that in 500 milliseconds,"" he said. ""Somebody might turn on the radio first. Someone might put on the seatbelt first.

""You have to develop software validation tools,"" he continued, ""that can simulate that sequence millions and millions of times to make sure that there isn't a bug where in one particular case, at one particular sequence, it's going to cause an issue.""

Third-party product testing has validated Ford's claims of improved quality. Ford scaled Consumer Reports' brand reliability ranking, finishing at No. 11 in the top half of all brands included, up from No. 22 the year prior. It was its best placement in the past 15 years. Lincoln was No. 20.

In an overall ranking that includes owner satisfaction, road-test rating ranking and safety, Lincoln was the top-ranked Detroit Three brand at No. 7. Ford was No. 18. Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports' director of testing, described the recent innovations on new Fords as ""really, really impressive.""

Likewise, in J.D. Power's 2025 Initial Quality Study that looks at consumers' first 90 days of ownership, the Ford brand had more top finishers in their respective segments than any other, though General Motors Co. as a company had the most top-ranked vehicles.

Still, the IQS scores for Ford and luxury brand Lincoln overall fell below the industry average. J.D. Power's dependability study looks at owners' experience after three years. Ford and Lincoln were also below average there, but they were the most improved brands.

The company has also updated its software validation processes. It's leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect issues sooner, as well. Shoring up manufacturing operations, adding camera systems and implementing plant-specific targets for process improvements are also ways in which Ford is seeking to improve quality.

When the process of making changes to address Ford's quality problems began, the sources were spread about fairly evenly between issues in design, manufacturing procedures and supplier processes, Galhotra said. The breakdown has moved over that time as Ford has split its teams between hardware and software, conducted audits and increased the use of data to identify problems.

""Those are the three big areas,"" Galhotra said, ""we've been really, really deep into, multiple strategies that include processes, tools, people, to make sure that the designs are robust, make sure the suppliers are supplying high quality products and making sure our manufacturing facilities are not adding any air states into the vehicles that we ship to our customers.""

Meanwhile, gaming GPU prices could get even more expensive.

What happened: If it’s a day ending in y, chances are major AI companies are making deals. This week alone, there are reports that:

Google and Meta are teaming up to make Google’s in-house AI chips play nicer with the leading AI development framework, which was originally developed at Meta.

Meta is in talks to spend billions on Google’s chips, generally much cheaper than Nvidia’s, starting in 2027.

Amazon may inject up to $10 billion into OpenAI, an investment that would see the ChatGPT-maker use more of Amazon’s AI chips.

These new partnerships show just how much key AI players want alternatives to Nvidia, even as they continue to strike deals with the GPU giant.

Why it matters: Right now, Nvidia is the go-to chip provider in AI computing, partly because it’s easiest to use. Its programming layer and developer tools platform, which makes AI code run efficiently on Nvidia GPUs, is the industry standard. It doesn’t mean the software is irreplaceable, but first-mover advantage has a hell of a gravitational pull: One widely cited estimate put Nvidia at having 85% of the global AI chip market as of mid-2025. That market dominance has given Nvidia a lot of control over pricing and the terms of the deals it strikes. If one company can set the going rate for the most in-demand hardware, everyone else ends up paying a premium until real substitutes exist at scale.

What does this mean for you?: For consumers, Nvidia’s primacy in the AI fervor doesn’t bode well for gaming GPU prices, which have already been sky-high for years now. New reports suggest Nvidia could be cutting up to 40% of gaming GPU production in 2026.

Is dethroning Nvidia realistic?: No one is snatching the crown from a $4 trillion-dollar company tomorrow. More realistically, what we might see in the next few years is a slow erosion of Nvidia’s power. If alternative chips become easy to use with mainstream AI tools, Nvidia’s share could slide from “total domination” to just “enormous.” —WK","https://morningbrew.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,quality=70,format=auto/https://storage.morningbrew.com/image/2025-12-18/image-936b334032f05a206a97bc9748955b42ebac09de-2304x1292-jpg/GoogleMeta.jpg",N,,2026-01-01 23:13:49.283964

As announced at the Budget by the Chancellor, private hire vehicle operators in London will no longer be able to use the Tour Operators Margin Scheme - a niche tax scheme designed for tour operators and holiday coach trips – to significantly reduce the VAT they pay on fares.

This means that black cabs will no longer have to compete with online mini cab firms who are misusing this scheme to pay less VAT.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

We’re putting the brakes on the illegitimate use of a niche tax scheme to protect everyday cabbies. We’ll use the £700m a year this raises to deliver the country’s priorities - cutting the cost of living, cutting waiting lists and cutting debt and borrowing.

Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, said:

The government’s decision to apply VAT to all private hire journeys is a landmark step for fairness and integrity in our industry. For too long, drivers and small operators paying the full 20% VAT have had to compete with online mini cab firms benefiting from a niche tax scheme.

We welcome this move and commend the government for taking decisive action.

The Tour Operator’s Margin Scheme is a specialist VAT rule designed for genuine travel and holiday businesses, allowing them to pay VAT only on the profit they make on package trips, not the full fare, typically reducing the effective VAT rate to 4%.

First announced by the Chancellor at Budget 2025, today’s measure will prevent the small number of big companies accessing the Tour Operator’s Margin Scheme, as they have been doing.

By supporting fairer competition, the government is protecting around £700 million in revenue, helping deliver the public’s priorities - cutting waiting lists, cutting debt and borrowing, and cutting the cost of living.

Over the course of 2025, North of 60 Mining News published more than 560 articles that provided in-depth coverage of the projects, policies, and people shaping the mining industry across Alaska and northern Canada. As global demand for minerals intensified and supply chain pressures mounted, readers consistently sought reporting that connected broader market and policy developments to the projects and people shaping the mining industry across Alaska and northern Canada.

Readers closely followed progress on critical mineral projects, shifts in permitting and mining policy, major corporate moves, and the market forces influencing exploration and mine development. Just as closely watched were stories highlighting the human side of mining.

From securing sites for antimony refineries and tracking gold price outlooks to revisiting legal battles and responding to underground emergencies, here is a countdown of the 10 most-read North of 60 Mining News articles of 2025.

No. 10 – Greenland caught in resource power struggle

The tenth most popular North of 60 Mining News article of 2025 examined the competing interests shaping mineral development in Greenland and the broader implications for Arctic resource governance.

As global demand for rare earths and other critical minerals accelerates, Greenland has emerged as a focal point for governments and companies seeking secure, non-Chinese supply sources. The article examined how these pressures intersect with local debates over environmental protection, Indigenous rights, and political autonomy, highlighting the complexity of resource development in the Arctic.

For readers who have long followed North of 60 Mining News' coverage of Alaska and northern Canada, the Greenland story offered a case study in how northern jurisdictions are grappling with challenges and opportunities of supplying the minerals needed for modern economies while retaining local control over resource decisions – an increasingly familiar challenge across the North.

No. 9 – USGS director champions domestic mining

Landing at No. 9 on the North of 60 Mining New 2025 Top Ten, this article provided insights into the newly confirmed U.S. Geological Survey Director Ned Mamula's call for renewed investment in domestic mining to strengthen supply chains and economic resilience.

The story highlighted the importance of geological mapping, resource assessments, and science-based decision-making in promoting responsible mining. Alaska featured prominently as a jurisdiction where strong mineral potential, paired with robust geoscience data, could help reduce reliance on foreign supplies.

North of 60 Mining News readers responded to the article's practical focus on how better information and clearer policy signals can translate into real project advancement –particularly in America's Last Frontier state, where geology and logistics play an outsized role in development decisions.

No. 8 – Anglo, Teck to merge into $53B copper giant

The No. 8 most-read article of 2025 covered the pending merger of Anglo American and Teck Resources, a deal set to create a $53 billion critical minerals-focused mining company.

The story examined how this consolidation among major producers reflects long-term demand expectations for copper tied to electrification, infrastructure, and energy transition technologies. It also considered what the merger could mean for project prioritization and investment strategies in northern mining jurisdictions.

For mining companies, investors, policymakers, and stakeholders across the North, the Anglo Teck article connected a major mining merger to potential downstream impacts on exploration funding, development timelines, and competition for capital allocations for projects across Alaska and northern Canada.

No. 7 – Skibinski presses for mining policies in DC

The seventh most-read article provided insights into Alaska Miners Association Executive Director Deantha Skibinski's Washington, D.C., advocacy for policies supporting responsible domestic mining.

The story detailed discussions around permitting reform, infrastructure investment, and regulatory clarity – issues that directly affect whether mining projects in Alaska deliver the minerals critical to America's economy and national security, or stall. It provided readers with a clear look at how industry voices are engaging federal policymakers to address long-standing development barriers at a time when Alaska is increasingly viewed as a strategic resource to the U.S.

The article serves as a reminder that decisions made thousands of miles away can have immediate and long-term consequences for mining projects and economies across the North.

No. 6 – Alaska mining is achieving critical mass

The sixth most-read North of 60 Mining News article of 2025 explored how Alaska's mining sector is approaching a pivotal moment when soaring metals prices, favorable federal policies, and the potential development of world-class mining projects have converged.

While Alaska's mining industry has been building toward critical mass for decades, the 2024 election started a chain reaction that could sustain sector growth over the coming decade.

The significance of Alaska's mineral wealth and strategic Arctic location is now a headlining topic of national conversation – from the Pentagon to the White House and Capitol Hill.

""Strategically, Alaska is one of the most important states for our nation, with its location, minerals, land, and natural resource assets,"" Congressman Pete Stauber (R-Minn.) said during an August tour of Alaska.

The article captured a growing sense that Alaska's mining future is increasingly defined not only by its world-renowned geology, but also by an increasing recognition of the Far North State's enormous capacity to deliver a domestic supply of minerals and metals critical to America's economic well-being and national security.

No. 5 – S&P Global forecasts strong gold prices

Landing at No. 5, this article reported on S&P Global's forecast for continued strength in gold prices and what that could mean for mineral exploration and mining across the North.

Gold remains a cornerstone of mining in Alaska and northern Canada, and the outlook reinforced the precious metal's role in supporting exploration, mine expansions, and new development.

At the time this article was published, gold mining companies and their investors were celebrating the potential that the precious metal would break through the $3,000/oz barrier. Over the following 10 months, the price of gold has continued to climb more than 50% to fresh new highs above $4,500/oz.

The record gold prices heading into 2026 exceed S&P Global's most bullish predictions at the beginning of 2025. While the global financial analyst foresees a pullback in prices, even the steepest retreat is expected to land higher than record highs set just 18 months ago.

The S&P Global gold forecast story provided mining companies with gold mines and projects across Alaska and Canada's North with a reason to celebrate going into 2025. The steep and steady climb throughout the year, however, far exceeded what was viewed as a bullish forecast when the article was published.

No. 4 – Red Chris mine workers trapped underground

The fourth most-read article of 2025 covered a pair of underground mine collapses that trapped three workers at the Red Chris copper-gold mine in British Columbia's Golden Triangle.

The story provided a first glimpse into the underground mine emergency as the events were unfolding, and set the stage for articles that provided readers with updates as Newmont, the provincial government, and the wider mining sector deployed the latest technologies to quickly rescue the three trapped miners, without putting other workers in harm's way.

The story underscored the importance of preparedness, communication, and emergency response systems.

Its high readership reflected the mining community's deep concern for the safety of the underground miners at Red Chris, and a solidarity across operations, jurisdictions, and companies when incidents occur.

No. 3 – Alaska revives U.S. antimony supply chain

Coming in at No. 3 on North of 60 Mining News' 2025 Top Ten is an article that detailed Alaska's growing role in reviving a domestic antimony supply chain after decades of U.S. dependence on foreign sources.

The article highlighted how the emerging deposits of high-grade antimony at Alaska mine projects could help restore a secure, domestic supply of this metalloid critical to defense, manufacturing, and energy applications.

Readers were drawn to a potential link between high-grade antimony mineralization on the outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska, U.S. Antimony's smelter in Montana, and a $245 U.S. Defense Logistics Agency contract to deliver antimony bars into the nation's strategic stockpile.

The article reinforced Alaska's importance in addressing U.S. critical mineral supply vulnerabilities while creating new economic opportunities in the state.

No. 2 – Pebble back in court over EPA veto

The second-most-read article of 2025 reported on renewed legal challenges surrounding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's veto of the proposed Pebble mine.

The long-running dispute over the development of a mine at the world-class Pebble copper-gold-silver-molybdenum-rhenium deposit in Southwest Alaska remains one of the U.S.'s most closely watched mining cases, and readers closely followed its return to the courtroom. The article examined what the latest legal developments surrounding the Pebble case could mean for permitting certainty and federal authority over large mining projects in Alaska and across the nation.

Its strong readership reflected Pebble's world-class critical minerals potential and the enduring influence the project has on perceptions of regulatory risk, investment climate, and the future of large-scale mining in Alaska.

No. 1 – Alaska antimony refinery site secured

Coming in at No. 1 on North of 60 Mining News' Top Ten articles of 2025 is a story that provided readers with unprecedented insights into Nova Minerals' securing of a site for an antimony refinery at Port MacKenzie near Anchorage, Alaska.

The milestone marked a concrete step toward adding downstream critical mineral processing capacity in America's Last Frontier state, moving beyond extraction and closer to a fully integrated supply chain. Readers responded to the project's implications for job creation, economic diversification, and Alaska's growing position as a key supplier of domestic critical minerals.

Its top ranking reflected strong interest in developments that translate Alaska's resources into operating facilities with lasting implications for the state's economy and the nation's mineral security.",https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/1/9/9419/s_top,N,,2026-01-01 19:59:23.880793

However, the pharmaceutical giant reached these levels because it has faced significant headwinds, resulting in a poor stock market performance over the past three years.

Yet, what is the outlook for the struggling giant from here? Is Pfizer worth investing in at current levels?

Slowly engineering a comeback

Pfizer's revenue and earnings have been inconsistent over the past few years. To make matters worse, the drugmaker will encounter important patent cliffs within a few years, including that of Eliquis, an anticoagulant and one of its best-selling drugs. Even so, the company has been gradually earning new approvals, some of which should have a meaningful impact on its financial results as label expansions are secured.

Further, Pfizer has doubled down on acquisitions, which has helped it improve its pipeline. The company now has a comprehensive list of candidates across multiple therapeutic areas, with a particular focus on cancer. It also boasts a promising candidate for weight loss. Pfizer should launch several new products that will bolster its lineup through the end of the decade.

Purchasing shares of top companies when they are down is a great way to earn excellent returns over the long run. Pfizer is a top pick to consider, given that it has been making the right moves to overcome slow (or non-existent) revenue growth and patent cliffs. And there are even more reasons to consider the stock. Here are three.

First, Pfizer penned a deal with the Trump administration that will allow it to avoid tariffs for three years. Second, the company is a solid dividend payer.

El caso, reportado por The Financial Times, destapó una verdad incómoda: mientras el 89% de las empresas usan inteligencia artificial (IA) en gestión del talento, solo el 34% audita sus algoritmos para evitar discriminación, según Deloitte (2025). La paradoja es clara: la IA promete eficiencia, pero sin ética, se convierte en un riesgo reputacional y legal.

El reclutamiento es el campo minado. Herramientas como HireVue o Pymetrics analizan tonos de voz, palabras clave en CVs o respuestas en juegos cognitivos. Pero en 2024, un estudio de MIT reveló que el 42% de estos sistemas penalizaban a candidatos con discapacidades auditivas al evaluar “capacidad de comunicación”. La solución llegó con estándares como el IEEE CertifAIEd, que desde 2025 certifica algoritmos libres de sesgos. Empresas como L’Oréal y Nestlé ya exigen este sello a sus proveedores de tecnología de RRHH.

La transparencia es otro desafío. Según Gartner (2025), el 68% de los empleados desconfía de cómo se usan sus datos en decisiones de promoción o despidos. Plataformas como Workday responden con “explicabilidad algorítmica”: al finalizar una evaluación, el sistema muestra qué factores (desempeño, habilidades blandas, etc.) influyeron en el resultado. “Antes, los trabajadores se sentían juzgados por una caja negra. Ahora, la IA es un espejo con instrucciones”, explica Clara Ríos, directora de Recursos Humanos en BBVA México.

La privacidad también está en juego. En 2025, la UE amplió el GDPR para incluir “datos emocionales” (estrés, engagement) recolectados por herramientas como Microsoft Viva o Peakon. Las multas por mal uso pueden alcanzar el 4% de la facturación global. Por eso, gigantes como SAP han creado comités internos donde empleados revisan qué datos se recopilan y cómo se procesan.

Pero no todo es regulación. Algunas empresas convierten la ética en ventaja competitiva. Salesforce, por ejemplo, lanzó en 2024 su Ethical AI Toolkit, que permite a los equipos de RRHH simular escenarios de contratación para detectar sesgos. Y en IBM, los algoritmos de desarrollo de talento se entrenan con datos anónimos de 50 países para garantizar diversidad cultural. Los resultados son tangibles: según Forbes (2025), estas compañías tienen un 40% más de candidatos diversos en procesos de selección.

El futuro del trabajo exige un equilibrio delicado. Mientras el 76% de los CEO presionan por más automatización en RRHH (IDC, 2025), el 61% de los empleados exigen controles humanos en decisiones críticas (Gallup, 2025).

Guillaume Mirabaud, chief executive of AXA Insurance Thailand, said there are several challenges for 2026, with the top concern the economic context.
""This is a strong reminder that Thai society needs to prepare for more extreme events, as climate change is not theoretical,"" said Mr Mirabaud.
""Individuals and small business owners should be aware they will need better coverage,"" said Mr Mirabaud.
On health insurance, the key challenge will be to keep medical costs under control, so that more people can access private insurance and be better protected.","Unfavourable economic conditions, political instability, soaring medical costs and natural disaster risks are the top challenges facing insurance companies in Thailand, while the country's ageing society could support continued health insurance expansion.

Guillaume Mirabaud, chief executive of AXA Insurance Thailand, said there are several challenges for 2026, with the top concern the economic context.

""Global macro uncertainty is unfavourable for business development. Further stabilisation may help a return to a more favourable trend,"" he said.

""Political instability in the country is another negative factor, as investors and companies lack predictability.""

In terms of insurance, he said the key risk is natural catastrophes following the earthquake in March and several floods, including the recent inundation in the southern provinces.

""This is a strong reminder that Thai society needs to prepare for more extreme events, as climate change is not theoretical,"" said Mr Mirabaud.

Insurance companies should revise their underwriting as prices will ""inevitably increase"", he said.

""Individuals and small business owners should be aware they will need better coverage,"" said Mr Mirabaud.

On the regulatory front, he said insurers are expected to be improved, with Thai risk monitoring and good insurance practices catching up with more mature markets.

""This includes setting up ground rules for electric vehicles, which have resulted in heavy losses to date, as well as eventually enforcing a named driver for each motor policy,"" said Mr Mirabaud.

On health insurance, the key challenge will be to keep medical costs under control, so that more people can access private insurance and be better protected. ""This requires a strong political will to contain medical expenses and a deal between medical providers and insurance sectors under the monitoring of regulator and government,"" Mr Mirabaud stressed.

Besides macroeconomic and political instability, the low-interest rate environment is another major headwind that insurers are encountering, says the Thai unit of German insurer Allianz.

The Bank of Thailand's Monetary Policy Committee, at its final meeting of 2025, lowered the policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25% to help an economy beset by multiple challenges including political uncertainty, a strengthening baht, and US tariffs.

The central bank also said it would continue to ease monetary policy to support economic growth

Thomas Wilson, country manager, president and chief executive of Allianz Ayudhya Assurance, said low interest rates do not help attract investments to unit-linked products, a type of life insurance policy that combines life insurance protection with investment opportunities through unit-linked funds.

""I think consumer confidence and their willingness to commit to long-term savings and long-term health premiums is decreasing,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Thailand is approaching a demographic milestone, with 21.3% of the population over 60 in 2025. The figure is projected to rise to 25% in 2030 and nearly 30% by 2040.

""Thailand has one of the oldest demographics in the world, with the trend likely to accelerate,"" said Mr Wilson.

Coupled with demographics, the increase of emerging diseases is among the factors driving health insurance premiums, which are expected to expand by nearly 10% in both 2025 and this year, according to Piyapadh Vana-Ukrit, chairman of the accident and health insurance committee at the Thai General Insurance Association.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20260102/c1_3167470_260102053254_700.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 18:59:27.796104

How to choose and write blog content...

Q. How did you first write on your blog.

A. I started writing on my blog in earnest because I needed to organize my thoughts. I think if your thoughts stay in your head, you will have more gaps. In the process of organizing thoughts in writing, I started a blog with a light heart to fill in the gaps.

Q. Could you briefly introduce your career.

A. After joining Samsung through open recruitment, he has worked at six financial companies including GE. Financial companies have accumulated expertise in the field of financial product development. Financial product development is called the flower of financial companies. This is because proper financial product development is possible only when the entire area such as sales, marketing, risk management, and profitability is understood to the bottom.

Recently, he is in charge of reviewing and approving large loan investments. Wide knowledge and trained judgment skills are required because various investments must be handled, not just loans. The process of writing is the process of making acquired data and information mine. It is a great help to broaden your knowledge and improve your judgment skills.

Q. If there are any criteria for selecting a blog post.

A. I start working out at 6 a.m. They walk on the treadmill for about an hour and allocate the priorities of what to do that day. After that, blog posts are also selected while learning. The criteria for selecting a topic is 'what I'm curious about as of today'. When you find out what you are curious about and organize it, the writing is born.

Q. The scope of the writing is wide but the depth is considerable, but how do you collect information.

A. I think it's a combination of books, searches, and internal reports. I visit the library near my house on weekends. I borrow 14 books from the library on average a month. I get the most information from the book, but there are also disadvantages to the information I get from the book. Since time spent writing, editing, and publishing books is included, recent information is often missing. This part is supplemented with a search.

Mer's investment secret

Q. If you have your own investment philosophy.

A. Aim to produce a robust profit with a good balance of risk and return. This is why they prefer to organize and operate their portfolios rather than individual stocks.

Q. What is the way to balance risk and profit.

A. In practice, the '+5% & -2%' rule is used a lot. It's a personal theory, not an academic theory.

When dealing with a lot of investments, I learned from my experience that removing the risk of about 2% will balance the return and risk even if I allow a close 5% more.

If risk and additional revenue are presented as a kind of set product, they have a lot of experience that negotiations have proceeded smoothly while balancing risk and return.

Q. What was your most successful investment experience.

A. I would like to point out my experience of overcoming the 2008 financial crisis through insurance hedging.

In 2006, two years before the financial crisis, I visited a subprime mortgage company and heard the product description, and I was convinced that there was a problem with the market. So, I pushed for insurance products to hedge risks. There were also loud voices of opposition within the company because it had to pay 10 billion won a year only in insurance premiums. After signing up for an insurance product, housing prices rose, leading to criticism of my decision to sign up for the product.

At that time, the product was heard through Berkshire Hathaway, owned by Warren Buffett. When the financial crisis came, the insurance products that were subscribed were powerful, and eventually, they were able to receive insurance payments up to 7.4 times the premiums paid at the time. About 200 billion won was received from Berkshire Hathaway.

Q. What investment did you lose the most.

A. There is no big loss of investment. This is because losses are only allowed up to 0.2% on investments. In other words, if the investment of 1 trillion won is approved, the amount of damage allowed is 2 billion won. There is no experience of failure to invest in individual approval cases, but if the unapproved case goes well, it will be regrettable.

Asset Market Outlook for 2026

Q. Last year, artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks rose significantly. Will this trend continue this year.

A. I think next year's AI will be a winner-take-all trend. Only one or two leading companies survive, and I think we will see the process of losing companies losing huge investments and being kicked out of the market within two to three years.

Those who made money in the gold rush to find gold mines in the western United States were not gold seekers. Levi Strauss, who made jeans for miners' work clothes, or Bamuel Brannon, who became California's first millionaire by selling food and tools to miners, made money. James Marshall, who discovered gold in Coloma, was poor in his later years, and John Southerner found gold in his land, but lost his property due to manpower outflows and looting.

Q. Are there any new industries that will emerge in terms of investment.

A. Companies that supply parts and services to AI companies seem to be more accessible than AI companies. Personally, I am also interested in space data centers.

Q. If you are looking at the domestic real estate market.

A. The big trend is polarization. Seoul, the metropolitan area, and key provincial areas with jobs will continue to maintain their values, but the rest of the region is not easy.

In terms of regulation, it will be difficult to maintain the land transaction permit system (toilet system) for all areas of Seoul and parts of the metropolitan area until the end of this year. I think we will have no choice but to lift the local tax system and touch the holding tax in key areas where prices are not set.

Jeonse will be quickly replaced by monthly rent, and rising housing costs are likely to be an inevitable trend.

Mer's principle of asset allocation is

Q. If you have your own asset allocation principle.

A. The shares are intended to be distributed within 50%. Looking at the portfolio, it consists of 50% of stocks, 10% of gold and silver, and 40% of cash equivalents (including short-term government bonds).

There were about 20% of U.S. government bonds, but the proportion of cash equivalents increased by organizing them.

Q. Looking at the portfolio we disclosed, it doesn't seem to have a U.S. stock weight.

A. It has been investing long-term in the Korean shipbuilding industry with a Japanese general trading company since 2023. This alone makes it impossible to invest in U.S. stocks because nearly half of the portfolio is full.

Q. Why do you invest in shipbuilding.

A. They prefer industry analysis to individual companies. Although it is currently in a recession, I thought to find an industry that has an opportunity to grow, and the industry that I found was the shipbuilding industry.

Eco-friendly power generation was the trend, but this alone seemed to have limitations in securing the necessary energy. As the proportion of LNG use is expected to increase for a while, Korea naturally drew attention as an LNG ship with strengths.

Q. How did you decide the timing of your investment.

A. The shipbuilding industry thought the timing of the deficit turning into a surplus was the timing of investment. It put about 5% of its weight into shipbuilding-related ETFs in 2023, and expanded its share of investment in 2025 when it is certain to turn into a surplus. It is an ETF investment, but the rate of return is more than three times.

Q. What is your portfolio plan for this year.

A. Do not plan a portfolio on an annual basis. They check that the stocks they are currently investing in stop rising completely and replace them.

I don't have much dissatisfaction with the current portfolio, so I'm going to watch the environment change by dragging it until this year.

Q. Which investors do you respect or want to resemble.

A. It's Warren Buffett. It is a wonder that it is not a frequent sale, but a long-term possession and sufficient profit.

Q. If you have a goal in your life.

A. I don't want to do anything I don't want to do, but I want to live by focusing on what I want to do.

Q. If you have any goals for the new year.

A. I'm planning to write my next book, The Power of Reading 1%.

Q. If you could advise a new person in society who is new to social life regarding his or her work life.

A. There is a famous adage in Yeouido that says, ""The number of office workers is their personality."" When a number usually called performance comes out, words gain strength and people who mess with it disappear. I think concentrating on my job and producing results is the most important attitude toward working life.

Mer's book, ""The Power to Read 1%.""

The ""power to read 1%"" deals with the ""technology of insight"" that reads the nature and flow of issues in vast amounts of data and complex news. Author Mer emphasizes the importance of 'connection intelligence' that connects fragmented information into one complete context.

In particular, it deals with key global economic issues such as semiconductors, energy, currency, and real estate in various ways and presents practical analysis methods. In other words, it is a book that gives you a glimpse of Mer's secret to looking behind the phenomenon.

Readers of this book will practice asking why it happened and what will come next, not what happened. In other words, it is a book that expands critical thinking and helps investors move preemptively through information acquisition. If there are readers who want to interpret the world from their own perspective and preempt future opportunities, I recommend reading the ""power to read 1%.""

For the moment, suffice to say that the old 1 percent difference statistic is the latest icon of evolution to fall.","Editor’s note: Welcome to a Science and Culture Today tradition: a countdown of our Top 10 favorite stories of the past year, concluding now on New Year’s Day. This article was originally published on May 20, 2025. Our staff are enjoying the holidays, as we hope that you are, too! Help keep the daily voice of intelligent design going strong. Please give whatever you can to support the Center for Science and Culture now!

How many times have you heard it said that the human and chimpanzee genomes are so similar that they are only “1 percent different” at the level of their DNA? This shows, we were told, not only that humans and chimps share common ancestry, but that humans aren’t all that special, which is a common talking point in science journalism and other public discussions. After all, we’re just slightly modified chimps! This “fact” has been discussed so much that it has become what the late biologist Jonathan Wells famously called an “icon of evolution.”

But now, new data reported in a recently published Nature paper by Yoo et al. has overturned this previous claim. The new findings reveal that human DNA is far more different from chimp DNA than previously thought.

That should be major news in the science world, yet those involved don’t seem interested in highlighting their discovery. More on that later.

Many times over the years, I’ve discussed how this 1 percent claim about humans and chimps is likely wrong. It is also misleading. No matter how similar humans might be to chimps at the genetic level, anyone who has been to the zoo knows already that chimps and humans are vastly different. After all, we’re the ones writing scientific papers about them—not the other way around. So common sense alone dictates that there is something misleading about that number and how it is used. But the new data show that the previous statistic isn’t just misleading. It’s flat-out false.

As I will elaborate in a subsequent article, this team of researchers has published “complete” sequences of ape genomes that were created ‘from scratch’ rather than using the human genome as a template. As a result, for the first time we can attempt a much more accurate assessment of the true degree of difference between the human and chimp genomes.

The results are groundbreaking:

At least 12.5 percent and possibly up to 13.3 percent of the chimp and human genomes represent a “gap difference” between the two genomes. That means there’s a “gap” in one genome compared to the other, often where they are so different, they cannot even be aligned.

There are also significant alignable sections of the two genomes that show “short nucleotide variations” which differ by only about 1.5 percent. We can add this difference to the “gap difference,” and calculate a 14 percent to 14.9 percent total difference between human and chimp genomes. This means that the actual difference between human and chimp DNA is 14 times greater than the often-quoted 1 percent statistic.

It’s true that large portions of the human genome are still only about 1.5 percent genetically different from the chimp genome. We’ll explore what that means in a subsequent post. But the new data reveal just how little this one fact tells us about the overall picture. We now know that major portions of the two genomes — 12.5 percent to 13.3 percent of the human genome, in fact — are so different that arguably the sections are unalignable and/or not directly present in one genome or the other.

Burying the Lede

One very peculiar thing about the research just published is that nowhere in the technical paper is this bombshell discovery clearly reported, and nowhere is it stated clearly that human and chimp DNA is some ~14 percent different. Even an explainer article in Nature — which usually do a great job of translating technical findings for the average scientist — does not mention this huge finding. You have to dig deep into the Supplementary Data to find it, and even there it is opaquely stated in technical jargon.

This data has huge implications for the long-quoted statistic that we are only 1 percent genetically different from chimps, and many people are interested in this question for its implications regarding evolution, origins, and the exceptional status of human beings. Yet the papers almost seemed like they want to obscure the numbers, making them hard to find for the reader, whether a scientist or layman.

How hard would it have been for the original Nature paper or — even better — the explainer article to say that this new data shows that the human and chimp genomes are more like 14 percent to 15 percent different rather than 1 percent?

And yet for some very strange reason they did not do that. In journalism, this is called “burying the lede” — putting the main point of your reporting, the most notable fact, under a heap of less important verbiage. Sometimes this happens due to incompetence. Other times, it is deliberate.

Remembering the Icon

As Jonathan Wells taught us, “icons of evolution” are arguments for evolution that get recycled over and over again — yet are not true. How do we know the 1 percent statistic is such an icon? Science popularizer Bill Nye, “The Science Guy,” provided a great example when he wrote in his 2014 book Undeniable:

As our understanding of DNA has increased, we have come to understand that we share around 98.8 percent of our gene sequence with chimpanzees. This is striking evidence for chimps and chumps to have a common ancestor. P. 248

The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History’s website likewise states:

DNA is thus especially important in the study of evolution. The amount of difference in DNA is a test of the difference between one species and another — and thus how closely or distantly related they are.

While the genetic difference between individual humans today is minuscule – about 0.1%, on average – study of the same aspects of the chimpanzee genome indicates a difference of about 1.2%.

Similar statements are found in the Smithsonian itself — the nation’s museum! — visited by nearly 4 million people yearly. I took this photo in 2023 when I visited:

A caption below declares that: “DNA evidence … confirms … that modern humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor…”

David Klinghoffer provides a nice rundown of other sources that have cited this statistic:

“We share more than 98 percent of our DNA and almost all of our genes with our closest living relative, the chimpanzee.” (Nature)

“[A]bout 99 percent of our DNA is identical to that of chimpanzees.” (Kevin Williamson, National Review)

“Most studies indicate that when genomic regions are compared between chimpanzees and humans, they share about 98.5 percent sequence identity.” (Scientific American)

“Humans and chimps share a surprising 98.8 percent of their DNA.” (American Museum of Natural History)

“[H]umans share about 99 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees, making them our closest living relatives.” (Science)

“Chimps, Humans 96 Percent the Same, Gene Study Finds.” (National Geographic News)

This “1 percent human-chimp genetic difference” statistic has been widely promoted and is widely believed. It’s undeniably an icon of evolution. But Dr. Wells also noted that these icons are like “zombies” — they don’t die easily. Instead, they keep being repeated, long after they’ve been refuted.

If that’s true, then don’t expect the 1 percent statistic to go away anytime soon. In fact, as I mentioned, the new Nature paper makes it very difficult to dig up the figures I’ve quoted here, so I suspect we’ll continue to see zombie numbers quoted, despite what the newly published data shows. I’ll explain all of that in more detail in a subsequent article. For the moment, suffice to say that the old 1 percent difference statistic is the latest icon of evolution to fall.

TNC clusters support a hybrid cloud model allowing customers to deploy on premises, on bare metal servers, or in cloud. This document captures the details for deploying the TNC Management cluster in the Amazon Web Service (AWS) , as shown in the figure below:

The TNC Management cluster can be deployed on AWS by using the Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), which is a fully managed service that provides Red Hat OpenShift clusters on AWS. It is jointly supported by Red Hat and AWS, with Red Hat operating the platform. Using ROSA to deploy the management cluster in the public cloud means that the same OpenShift platform is being used on-prem as well as in the public cloud, making it easier to have streamlined operations across the hybrid cloud. This also gives operators the flexibility to deploy the primary instance of the management cluster in the cloud, or deploy it on-premises and use the public cloud in case of disaster recovery scenarios.

TNC Management Cluster

The TNC Management (MGMT) cluster provides MANagement & Orchestration (MANO) capabilities to deploy the workload clusters (where 4G and 5G core or RAN components are deployed), to monitor them as well as to manage the life cycle of those clusters. The MGMT cluster is deployed on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform based cluster (either on-prem or in the public cloud) that will host the Red Hat provided tools to manage the remote workload clusters. 3rd party management tools can also be installed on the management cluster to augment the automation capabilities provided by the Red Hat tools or to manage the workloads being deployed across the network.

The figure below shows the different applications / tools that make up the MGMT cluster as its deployed on ROSA:

The goal is to start with a ROSA cluster and install the different applications / tools on that ROSA cluster such that it can deploy, monitor and manage / operate workload clusters across the hybrid estate. As shown in the figure above, the following products / components make up the MGMT cluster:

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM)

Provides the ability to deploy apps and control policies across multiple OpenShift clusters, permitting manageability of multiple environments at scale

RHACM, along with OpenShift GitOps and Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM) operators, is being used to provide GitOps based Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) of the on-prem workload clusters

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)

Ansible Automation Platform helps to manage complex deployments by adding control, knowledge, and delegation to Ansible-powered environments. It will provide an entry point via an API for 3rd parties to interact with the environment

AAP on the MGMT cluster can be used to automate tasks for configuring the on-prem clusters

Red Hat Quay

Red Hat Quay is a private container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images

Quay on the MGMT cluster is being used to provide the private container image repository for deploying the on-prem clusters in an air-gapped / disconnected environment

ACM Observability

RHACM can be used to aggregate the metrics / events from all the on-prem workload clusters and provide a single pane of glass for operators to monitor those clusters

Vault Secrets Operator (VSO)

VSO can be used to retrieve credentials from a vault server and provide those credentials for consumption by the different workloads running in OpenShift clusters. As GIT is being used to hold the cluster definitions and configurations for the GitOps based ZTP process, we do not want to publish credentials in the GIT repository. The VSO facilitates the GitOps process without requiring to store credentials in GIT

Vault Server

Optionally, the vault server can also be deployed on the TNC MGMT cluster. Regardless of whether the vault server is installed locally or installed external to the ROSA cluster, VSO can retrieve credentials from that vault server and create secrets in the local ROSA cluster

Storage

The different applications deployed on the MGMT cluster need persistent storage. The ROSA cluster uses AWS EBS to provide block storage to the cluster workloads. AWS S3 service is being used to provide object storage.

ROSA Cluster Design / Configuration

The sections below explain the ROSA design to host a TNC Management cluster for deploying, managing and monitoring on-premises, disconnected / air-gapped OpenShift clusters via GitOps based Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).

Hosted Control Plane Vs. Classic Architecture

The ROSA service can be setup in one of the following two architectures:

ROSA with Hosted control plane (HCP)

The control plane is hosted within a service account and managed by Red Hat with the worker nodes deployed in the customer’s AWS account.

ROSA Classic Architecture

The control plane and worker nodes are deployed in the customer’s AWS account and has support for the baremetal (metal3) operator

While the preference is for using ROSA with HCP for deploying the TNC MGMT cluster, ROSA on HCP currently does not support the baremetal (metal3) operator for OpenShift. The baremetal operator is required for the RHACM ZTP procedure and hence ROSA with HCP cannot be used for hosting the TNC MGMT cluster.

NOTE: Support for the baremetal operator on ROSA with HCP is expected to be available in the first half of 2026.

Public Vs. Private ROSA Cluster

A ROSA cluster can be deployed as a public cluster as shown in the figure below:

In this configuration the ROSA nodes can reach the internet via the NAT and internet gateways. Ingress traffic from the internet can also reach the ROSA cluster by using the external load balancers provided by ROSA for the API endpoint and application ingress routers.

While the public ROSA cluster provides protection against attacks by using security groups to filter ingress traffic, a private ROSA cluster breaks all ingress connectivity from the internet by dropping the external load balancers and replacing them with internal / private load balancers, as shown in the figure below:

With a private ROSA cluster, the ROSA nodes can still reach destinations on the internet via the NAT gateway, however ingress access to the OpenShift API and ingress routers is only available via the internal load balancers. The internal load balancers can be reached from within the VPC or by establishing VPC peering relationships or by adding VPN connections to the VPC.

Since the TNC workload (on-premises) clusters are designed as disconnected / air-gapped clusters, the ROSA cluster for hosting the TNC MGMT cluster is also being designed to use a private ROSA cluster. The figure below shows the TNC hybrid cloud design where an AWS site-to-site VPN is being used to connect the private ROSA cluster to on-premises OpenShift clusters:

This design adds a private S3 endpoint to the ROSA cluster and relies on DNS configuration to be added on both sides of the site-to-site VPN as explained below.

ROSA to On-Prem Connectivity

Several options are available to connect the ROSA cluster to the on-premises clusters. The AWS site-to-site VPN is selected in this design to achieve this connectivity. Both ends of the site-to-site VPN need to advertise appropriate routes to provide bidirectional connectivity:

Advertise on-prem subnets into the VPC route tables, with the AWS VPN gateway as next hop

Advertise the AWS VPC private subnets into the on-prem network with the on-prem customer gateway router as the next hop

This VPN will be used to carry the following traffic:

From ROSA to on-prem

Access to on-prem BMC IPs

Access to on-prem DNS server IP

Access to on-prem machineNet subnet(s)

From On-prem to ROSA

Access to ROSA machineNet

Access to ROSA private subnets

Custom Security Group

ROSA installation creates different security groups to allow OpenShift control plane and data plane traffic flow. However, These security groups that are created by default during ROSA installation do not include the ports that are used by RHACM to perform zero touch provisioning of on-prem OpenShift clusters. In order for RHACM ZTP to work, the following ports need to be opened up in the security groups that are being applied to the different ROSA nodes:

TCP 6385 – metal3-ironic-api

TCP 6183 – Mount virtual ISO

TCP 9999 – ironic-python-agent

As ROSA is a managed cluster, updates to the default security groups (that are created by the ROSA installer) are not allowed. Hence, a custom security group needs to be created prior to ROSA cluster installation, and provided as input to the ROSA installation command, so that it can be used to open the ZTP ports listed above.

The following sample shows the selection of the customer security group while passing the parameters to the interactive ROSA installation command:

? Additional ‘Compute’ Security Group IDs (optional): sg-0e5b0d0981d4adf80 (‘custom-sg-node’)

? Additional ‘Infra’ Security Group IDs (optional): sg-0e5b0d0981d4adf80 (‘custom-sg-node’)

? Additional ‘Control Plane’ Security Group IDs (optional): sg-0e5b0d0981d4adf80 (‘custom-sg-node’)

NOTE: The custom security group needs to be applied to the nodes during ROSA installation. Security groups cannot be applied to the nodes, post cluster installation.

Storage

The applications running on the ROSA cluster need access to persistent storage. Access to block storage is being provided by using the Amazon Elastic Block Service (EBS). During ROSA cluster installation appropriate CSI drivers are configured and storage classes created to provide access to EBS for creating Permanent Virtual Claims (PVCs) for persistent block storage.

There are two applications running in the TNC MGMT cluster that require access to object storage:

Red Hat Quay

Uses object storage to store the container images for the private registry

RHACM Observability

Aggregates metrics and events from the on-prem OpenShift clusters. Uses object storage to store the observability data

This design uses the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) to provide object storage for the above mentioned applications. The following configuration needs to be added on top of the standard ROSA configuration to provide access to the S3 bucket for object storage:

Create an internal endpoint for S3 service, using private subnets

By default, the ROSA installer creates a gateway endpoint for S3. However, that gateway end point does not provide a DNS enabled endpoint.

Hence, we will create an interface endpoint for the S3 service and select the option to enable DNS record for that endpoint. The on-prem clusters can use this endpoint to reach the AWS S3 bucket

NOTE: The on-prem clusters access Quay in the TNC MGMT cluster to retrieve container images. By default Quay redirects the clients towards its storage backend, hence requiring the clients to directly communicate with the AWS S3 bucket

Create an S3 bucket

Create an IAM user with appropriate permissions to read / write S3 data

Create an access token for this user account

Use that access token to create secrets for OpenShift services / applications needing S3 access

DNS Configuration

Bidirectional communication between the MGMT (hub) cluster and the workload (spoke) clusters requires appropriate DNS resolution of the FQDNs associated with the ROSA cluster as well as with the on-prem workload clusters. This requires DNS configuration on both sides of the site-to-site VPN tunnel.

ROSA Side DNS Configuration

The services / applications in the ROSA cluster need to be able to resolve FQDN’s associated with on-prem clusters, for example, RHACM in the MGMT cluster needs to reach the API endpoint of the different on-prem workload clusters.

We will configure the CoreDNS services running in the ROSA cluster to use the on-prem DNS server as forwarder / upstream DNS server so that it can use the on-prem DNS server to resolve the FQDNs associated with the on-prem clusters. The following custom resource can be used to configure CoreDNS service on the ROSA cluster:

On-Prem Side DNS Configuration

The on-prem OpenShift clusters need to reach different services / endpoints in the ROSA cluster. The following DNS entries need to be created on the on-prem DNS server so that the FQDNs associated with the ROSA services can be resolved.

(NYSE: PFE) finds itself in a position that would have been unthinkable during the height of the pandemic. Once the darling of the pharmaceutical world, the company’s stock ended 2025 at approximately $24.90, marking another year of trading well below the psychological $30 threshold. Despite a massive dividend yield approaching 7% and a series of aggressive multibillion-dollar acquisitions, the market remains skeptical of Pfizer’s ability to replace its dwindling COVID-19 revenue and navigate a looming ""patent cliff.""

The immediate implications for investors are stark: Pfizer has become a classic ""battleground"" stock. Value hunters point to a rock-bottom forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.6x and a sustainable dividend as signs of a generational buying opportunity. Conversely, skeptics argue that the company is a value trap, burdened by high debt from its $43 billion acquisition of Seagen and a pipeline that has seen as many high-profile failures as it has successes over the last 24 months.

A Year of ""Resets"" and Strategic Pivots

The road to Pfizer’s current sub-$30 valuation was paved with significant volatility throughout 2025. Following a disastrous 2024, management spent much of the past year attempting to ""reset"" investor expectations. In December 2025, Pfizer issued 2026 revenue guidance of $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion, a range that reflects a $1.5 billion headwind from patent expirations and the continued erosion of Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales. While the non-COVID portfolio grew by a respectable 4% operationally in late 2025, it has not yet been enough to offset the vacuum left by the pandemic products.

A key subplot of the past year was the intervention of activist investor Starboard Value LP. The hedge fund took a $1 billion stake in late 2024, pressuring CEO Albert Bourla to accelerate cost-cutting measures and improve R&D productivity. While Starboard failed to secure board seats and eventually exited its position in November 2025, its influence was felt. Pfizer successfully implemented a massive cost-realization program, targeting $7.2 billion in net savings by 2027. This austerity, combined with a narrowed earnings guidance of $3.00 to $3.15 per share for the end of 2025, has helped stabilize the bottom line even as the stock price remains depressed.

The most dramatic shift occurred in Pfizer’s obesity strategy. After the high-profile failure of its once-daily oral drug danuglipron in April 2025 due to safety concerns, Pfizer pivoted aggressively. In November 2025, the company spent approximately $7 billion to acquire Metsera, a move that brought a new suite of GLP-1 candidates into the fold. This acquisition was seen as a ""Hail Mary"" to remain relevant in a weight-loss market currently dominated by rivals.

The Winners and Losers of the New Pharma Landscape

In the current market environment, the clear winners have been Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO). These two titans have effectively cornered the obesity and diabetes market with their respective blockbusters, Zepbound and Wegovy. Pfizer’s struggle to break into this space has resulted in a massive valuation gap; while Lilly trades at premium multiples, Pfizer has been relegated to the bargain bin. However, if Pfizer’s new Metsera-derived candidates, such as the injectable MET-097i, show strong Phase 3 data in 2026, Pfizer could emerge as a ""comeback kid"" winner, offering a cheaper entry point into the obesity gold rush.

On the losing side of this transition are the legacy COVID-19 manufacturers, including Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRNA), which has faced similar struggles in diversifying its revenue stream beyond mRNA vaccines. Within Pfizer’s own portfolio, the ""losers"" are the shareholders who bought in at the 2021 highs. The stock’s technical setup at the start of 2026 is decidedly bearish, with shares trading below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Technical analysts point to a ""floor"" at $23.88, but warn that without a breakout above $27.00, the stock remains in a persistent downtrend.

Shifting Focus: Oncology and the Patent Cliff

Pfizer’s current predicament fits into a broader industry trend known as the ""Patent Cliff."" Like its peers Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), Pfizer is facing the loss of exclusivity for several multi-billion dollar drugs, including Eliquis and Ibrance, over the next few years. To combat this, Pfizer has staked its future on oncology. The integration of Seagen has been a bright spot, with the bladder cancer drug Padcev exceeding sales expectations in 2025. Pfizer expects its oncology division to contribute $10 billion in incremental revenue by 2030, a goal that is essential for the company to return to growth.

Historically, pharmaceutical giants have used ""M&A binges"" to bridge the gap between patent expirations. Pfizer’s recent $43 billion spend on Seagen and $7 billion on Metsera follows this precedent, but it has left the company with a significant debt load. This has forced management to pause share buybacks to prioritize debt reduction and dividend payments. The market is currently punishing Pfizer for this leverage, comparing it unfavorably to more ""capital-light"" biotech firms that are seeing higher R&D efficiency.

What Lies Ahead: The 2026 Outlook

Looking forward, the short-term trajectory for Pfizer will be dictated by its February 2026 earnings report and the initial clinical readouts from the Metsera pipeline. If the company can prove that its new obesity candidates are competitive in terms of efficacy and side-effect profiles, it could trigger a massive short-covering rally. Conversely, any further delays in the oncology pipeline or a dividend cut—though management insists the payout is safe—would likely send the stock tumbling toward the $20 mark.

The long-term scenario depends on Pfizer’s ability to transform from a ""vaccine company"" back into a diversified ""specialty medicine"" powerhouse. Investors should watch for potential strategic pivots, such as the divestiture of non-core consumer health assets or a further narrowing of the R&D focus. The company needs to demonstrate that it can grow its non-COVID revenue at a double-digit clip to regain the market's trust.

Final Assessment: Value or Trap?

As of January 2026, Pfizer is the ultimate test of a value investor's patience. The 7% dividend yield provides a significant ""margin of safety"" for those willing to wait for a turnaround, and the current payout ratio of 56-58% of adjusted earnings suggests the dividend is more sustainable than the headline GAAP numbers imply. However, the lack of immediate growth catalysts and the technical weakness of the stock suggest that the ""trap"" remains set for those expecting a quick recovery.

Moving forward, the market will be laser-focused on three things: the debt-to-equity ratio as Pfizer pays down its M&A loans, the Phase 3 progress of the Metsera obesity assets, and the continued commercial success of the Seagen oncology portfolio. For now, Pfizer remains a high-yield utility-like play in a high-growth sector—a paradox that will only be resolved when the company proves it can innovate its way out of the COVID shadow.

MARKET DYNAMICS

MARKET DRIVERS

Growing Burden of Complex Surgeries and Shift to Minimally Invasive Care Boost Market Growth

The global surgical imaging market growth is primarily driven by the rising volume of surgical procedures such as orthopedic, spine, neuro, and cardiovascular. Moreover, rising shift toward minimally invasive techniques that require precise intraoperative guidance is also projected to accelerate market growth. Surgeons increasingly rely on real-time fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT to confirm implant placement, reduce revisions and shorten hospital stays.

For instance, according to data published by the NCBI in August 2024, the proportion of colorectal minimally invasive surgeries in Germany increased from 26.2% in 2019 to 43.7% in 2023.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Cautious Adoption of Implant-Based POP Repair Techniques May Deter Market Growth

A key restraint for the surgical imaging market is the high upfront cost of advanced C-arms, hybrid OR imaging systems, and associated infrastructure. Many mid-size hospitals and outpatient centers continue to extend the life of legacy image-intensifier C-arms or purchase refurbished mini-C-arms rather than invest in premium flat-panel or robotic systems. In addition, companies such as Mini C Arm LLC, which refurbishes systems from leading brands and offers them to clinics and surgery centers, illustrate how cost pressure fuels a sizeable secondary market. This dynamic can delay replacement cycles and slow penetration of cutting-edge 3D and motorized systems, particularly in cost-sensitive regions.

People might skip a new phone. They do not skip salt, pepper, hot sauce, and taco seasoning. McCormick sells products that survive recessions, layoffs, and vibes-only budgets. That makes it a defensive stock: not flashy, but more stable than a lot of hype names.

If you want a core holding that doesn’t implode every time the Fed sneezes, this kind of business can be a quiet backbone in your portfolio.

2. Dividend drip, not lottery ticket

McCormick has a long history of paying dividends. That means it sends cash back to shareholders regularly. For long-term investors, that’s a built-in “thank you” just for holding.

Is it a “get rich this month” move? No. But if you’re stacking for the long run, a dividend payer that touches almost every grocery cart in the country can be a solid “set it and chill” play.

3. Pricing power and brand obsession

McCormick can raise prices on spices and seasonings more easily than a lot of other food products. Why? Because when a home cook or a restaurant trusts a flavor profile, they don’t want to risk a downgrade to a generic brand that tastes off.

That pricing power is huge. It helps offset inflation and supply chain costs, so margins do not get completely wrecked when everything else gets more expensive.

So, is it a game-changer or a total flop for you? If you want crazy-fast gains, this will feel slow. If you want long-term resilience, it looks a lot closer to a must-have.

McCormick & Company vs. The Competition

Who’s really fighting McCormick for space in your pantry and your portfolio?

Main rivals:

General Mills (GIS) – Big food player with cereals, snacks, and meal kits.

Kraft Heinz (KHC) – Sauces, condiments, and packaged foods powerhouse.

Store brands – Grocery chains’ private label spices and seasonings.

Clout war: who wins?

Social presence: McCormick quietly wins here. General Mills and Kraft Heinz have recognizable brands, but McCormick owns the subtle “I just cooked something amazing” moments creators love to share. The label shows up constantly in recipe content without screaming.

Focus: McCormick is locked into flavor – spices, blends, sauces. Rivals are more scattered across cereals, frozen foods, and processed snacks. That focus gives McCormick a stronger identity in the “cook at home” trend.

Everyday relevance: You might not eat cereal every day. You use salt, seasoning, and sauce in almost anything that hits a pan. That frequency matters over time.

If this were purely a clout contest, McCormick isn’t the loudest brand, but it’s the one that shows up in the most actual meals. Quiet dominance usually ages better than loud novelty.

Is It Worth the Hype? Real Talk on Price-Performance

Here’s how to decide if MKC is a no-brainer or a hard pass when you see the live price:

If the stock is trading near the low end of its 52-week range and the business is still pumping out steady sales and dividends, that’s “price drop = potential opportunity” territory.

If it’s near record highs after a big rally, you might be paying full hype pricing. Still fine long term, but don’t expect instant fireworks.

If earnings are stable or slowly growing while the price has been dragging, that disconnect can be your chance to sneak in before the next wave of boring-but-profitable buyers.

Use your finance app or broker to check live performance. Compare McCormick’s chart with another food name like General Mills or Kraft Heinz over the last few years. If MKC looks smoother and more resilient, that’s your signal: less drama, more durability.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, is McCormick & Company a viral must-have for your portfolio or just comfort food for boomers?

If you want a meme rocket: This is probably a drop. McCormick is not trying to 10x in a week. It is not a “watch this flip overnight” stock.

If you want a core, stable, grown-up play: This is much closer to a cop. Defensive food exposure, global brand recognition, solid dividend history, and real-world demand that does not rely on hype cycles to survive.

Call it what it is: a long-term, low-drama, real-world business that most of your friends are already funding every time they buy taco seasoning, buffalo sauce, or steak rub.

This year, states are enacting a slew of laws focused on wages, social media rules, restrictions on gender-affirming care, AI regulation and much more.

Here is a sampling of some of those changes, as reported by public media journalists across the country.

California rideshare drivers can unionize

Under a new law, California's 800,000 rideshare drivers have the right to unionize starting on Jan. 1. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom brokered the deal between organized labor and major rideshare companies, including Uber and Lyft.

The rideshare giants supported the expansion of collective bargaining rights to their drivers in exchange for lawmakers agreeing to slash the companies' insurance costs for underinsured drivers.

After Massachusetts voters decided to do so in 2024, California became the second state to extend collective bargaining rights to rideshare drivers.

More paid time off in Colorado for parents of babies in the NICU

Colorado families whose babies spend time in the NICU will be able to take more paid leave this year. Colorado's paid family leave program already allows workers to take up to 12 weeks off from work to care for a new baby, or for a serious family health or personal issue, and receive most of their pay during that time.

Now, families whose babies require time in neonatal intensive care can apply for an additional 12 weeks of paid leave. Backers say this acknowledges the extra strain families are under when caring for preemies and other newborns with significant health problems.

Democratic State Sen. Jeff Bridges was one of the main sponsors and says he was inspired by his own personal experience. His newborn was in intensive care, which he says was ""terrifying and consuming.""

Democrats passed the bill, mostly along party lines. Opponents say they worry about increased costs to businesses and workers who pay into the program.

Illinois also has a new NICU law going into effect in June, but unlike Colorado, the time off is not required to be paid.

Social media time limits in Virginia

A new law in Virginia, which faces a legal challenge, is designed to limit social media use by those under 16 to one hour a day, unless a parent agrees to a longer period. NetChoice, a group representing social media services, claims the law violates the First Amendment. The law's author, Democratic State Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, argues it's a ""reasonable attempt to balance free speech with the safety and privacy of our children.""

In legal filings, attorneys for NetChoice call the law the ""latest attempt in a long line of government efforts to restrict new forms of constitutionally protected expression based on concerns about their potential effects on minors."" A preliminary injunction hearing is set for mid-January.

Eighteen states restrict SNAP money for candy, sodas

With permission from the Trump administration, 18 states will ban the purchase of candy, sodas, energy drinks or other items using federal dollars intended for low-income households.

The states, which include South Carolina, Florida, Hawaii, and Texas, received waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2025 that will allow them to restrict Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollars for items the states deem non-nutritious.

Citing adult and child obesity statistics, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said in December that the waiver will help create healthier outcomes and said the goal aligns with President Trump's push to restore SNAP to its ""true purpose – nutrition.""

South Carolina will ban the purchase of candy, energy drinks, soft drinks, and other sweetened beverages using SNAP dollars.

Other states have narrower limits. Texas will prohibit SNAP funds for sweetened drinks and candy, and Virginia plans to bar SNAP dollars for certain ""sweetened beverages."" All 18 states have a target implementation date of sometime this year.

Among other things, critics of the waivers say they are skeptical the bans will improve people's health.

Paid leave up to 20 weeks in Minnesota

Beginning this week, most Minnesota workers will have access to paid family and medical leave benefits. The state is launching a program that allows 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a sick loved one or bond with a baby, as well as 12 weeks of medical leave to recover from illness or injury.

There's a cap of 20 weeks in a year if someone taps both. Those who take paid leave will receive partial pay and will have a guarantee that their position at work will be there when they return. Employers are also barred from retaliating against workers who take the paid time off.

The program is funded through a payroll tax split between employers and employees.

Some business groups tried to block the legislation, saying that if employees take significant time off, it could put more work on others.

Roughly three-quarters of Minnesota workers are expected to receive more paid leave benefits under the program than they had previously. Minnesota will be among 13 states to offer paid family and medical leave benefits.

Illinois regulates AI, despite Trump's executive order

Starting this year, employers in Illinois are prohibited from using artificial intelligence in employment decisions – from making new hires to promoting or disciplining current employees – if the technology factors in demographic information, such as the person's race or ZIP code.

It's an amendment to the state's Human Rights Act and was passed by the legislature's Democratic supermajority. Democratic State Sen. Javier Cervantes sponsored the measure. As an artist, Cervantes says he has real concerns about how rapidly AI has progressed over the past few years.

""This is an unchecked technology,"" Cervantes says. ""We just have to get in front of it and do the best we can.""

The new law comes on the heels of President Trump's executive order directing the U.S. Department of Justice to challenge states' AI laws deemed ""cumbersome."" Cervantes says he's pretty certain the DOJ will take the state to court – as it has done in more than thirty suits so far – over the new law.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4960x2790+0+517/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2F4a%2Ff959415b4517b795bee2d8ba597e%2Fgettyimages-2237992797.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 12:00:50.225522

The revelation comes as Nvidia is now in advanced talks to acquire AI21.
Google and Nvidia first invested in AI21 during the 2023 round, which was later expanded during the war in Israel.

The round was cited as evidence that the company, one of the country’s few builders of a large-scale language model, had secured its place among the industry’s serious contenders.

It now turns out that the round was never completed. In fact, AI21’s last actual fundraising took place in November 2023, when the company extended its Series C to a total of $208 million at a valuation of $1.4 billion. The much-discussed Series D was never closed, never formally announced, and never reflected in the company’s capital structure.

The revelation comes as Nvidia is now in advanced talks to acquire AI21. Estimates suggest a potential deal value of $2-3 billion, above the company’s last known valuation but far below the sums commanded by the sector’s global leaders. If completed, the transaction would appear to be driven less by technology than by people.

AI21 currently employs around 200 people, down from the 260 it reported in 2023. A plan to recruit an additional 100 employees in 2024 never materialized. Nvidia’s interest is widely understood to center on the company’s workforce, highly trained AI researchers, many with advanced academic credentials, rather than on a breakout commercial product.

Such an outcome would mark a quiet retreat from AI21’s original ambition. Founded in 2017 by Professor Amnon Shashua, Professor Yoav Shoham, and Ori Goshen, the company was conceived as a flagship Israeli effort to compete at the frontier of artificial intelligence, years before the generative AI boom that reshaped the industry after 2022. Shoham and Goshen serve as co-CEOs, with Shashua as chairman.

Google and Nvidia first invested in AI21 during the 2023 round, which was later expanded during the war in Israel. Over the past two years, however, the company has struggled to keep pace with the accelerating advances of rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic. In April, AI21 halted development of Wordtune, its long-running consumer-facing product, narrowing its focus to enterprise customers where accuracy and reliability matter more than scale or experimentation.

Today, AI21’s business centers on specialized language models for corporate use. Its flagship product, Maestro, is designed to improve model accuracy by up to 50%, and the company has recently introduced a new reasoning model that it says is faster and more memory-efficient than competing systems. Even so, estimates suggest annual revenue of roughly $50 million, a figure that has not meaningfully changed since 2023.",https://pic1.calcalist.co.il/picserver3/crop_images/2023/04/23/SJ11iJ2MQ3/SJ11iJ2MQ3_0_252_2000_1126_0_large.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 11:00:38.019545

On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia purchased Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) shares worth $5 billion. The share price went up by around 2% after the announcement. According to the report, this move is based on Nvidia’s previous announcement in September, where the company announced that it would buy Intel’s share at $23.28 per share to support its finances to enhance production capacity.

On December 29, Nvidia bought 214.7 million shares of Intel at the price that was established in the September agreement. As per Reuters, the antitrust agency of the United States approved this investment.

That said, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has gained more than 61% over the past 6 months. However, Wall Street remains cautious with analysts’ 12-month price target reflecting around 7% upside from the current levels. Recently, on December 19, William Stein from Truist Financial reiterated a Hold rating on the stock, with a $39 price target. Earlier on December 16, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities raised the firm’s price target from $34 to $40, while maintaining a Sell rating.

Analyst Arya of BofA noted that he improved the price target based on the growing opportunity for the company’s foundry. BofA expects Intel to secure external wins in advanced packaging and wafer design. However, the analyst cautioned that the uncertainties in the manufacturing sector continue to distort the outlook, hence the firm maintained a Sell rating.

A New, Urgent Production Push

According to an exclusive Reuters report, Nvidia has approached its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), to dramatically increase the output of the H200 AI chips in response to surging demand from Chinese technology companies. Sources say that these firms have placed orders exceeding 2 million H200 units for delivery in 2026, but with Nvidia’s current inventory standing at approximately 700,000 chips, it created a significant shortfall that prompted the outreach to Taiwan Semiconductor.

The H200 is based on Nvidia’s Hopper architecture and produced using Taiwan Semiconductor’s 4-nanometer process. As the second most powerful chip in its portfolio, one that is vastly superior for training complex models than the dumbed down versions Nvidia made to comply with U.S. export restrictions, it also indicates Chinese companies view it as a better option than other regional or locally produced chips.

Nvidia has requested that Taiwan Semiconductor begin fabricating additional chips, with production slated to commence in the second quarter of 2026. While the precise volume of the new order remains undisclosed, this step aims to address the gap between Nvidia’s existing inventory and the incoming orders, giving the chipmaker time to ramp up to meet the demand.

With the initial shipments fulfilled from its current stock, the first deliveries could potentially arrive before the Lunar New Year in mid-February 2026. This timeline builds on earlier reports the Trump administration authorized the shipment of H200 sales to China again.

Pricing for the China-specific H200 variants has been set at around $27,000 per chip, according to the sources, positioning them as a viable option for Chinese buyers seeking high-performance AI hardware amid limited alternatives.

Balancing Global Supply Amid Strategic Shifts

This production ramp-up occurs as Nvidia shifts its attention toward its newer Blackwell series and the forthcoming Rubin chips, which are expected to drive future growth. The emphasis on H200 expansion, however, highlights China’s continued role as a major market, even as trade barriers have previously reduced Nvidia’s presence there.

A Nvidia spokesperson stated that the company manages its supply chain on an ongoing basis. They added, “Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States.” Yet the shipments could strain global AI chip availability, as Nvidia must allocate resources across regions while meeting heightened Chinese demand. Taiwan Semiconductor declined to comment on the matter, and China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to Reuters inquiries.

Key Takeaway

Virale Mascaras, Skin-Tints, Haarpflege – und dahinter ein Milliarden-Unternehmen mit eigener Aktie. Zeit für einen Reality-Check: Hype wert oder nur Marketing-Zauber?

Besonders spannend: Während du auf TikTok neue L'Oréal-Produkte speicherst, schauen Investorinnen und Anleger auf die Loreal Aktie. Beauty im Bad, Börse im Hintergrund – und beides kann für dich richtig interessant werden.

Das Netz dreht durch: L'Oréal S.A. auf TikTok & Co.

Scroll mal durch deine For-You-Page: Gefühlt jede Woche ist irgendein L'Oréal-Produkt ein neuer viraler Hit. Foundation, die wie ein Filter aussieht. Mascara, die angeblich falsche Wimpern ersetzt. Haarpflege, die ""alles rettet"".

Die Stimmung im Netz: Eine Mischung aus Hype, ""Muss ich testen!"" und natürlich auch Skepsis. Unter den Videos häufen sich Kommentare wie ""Okay, aber lohnt sich das wirklich?"" und ""Brauche echte Erfahrungen, nicht nur Werbung"". Gleichzeitig gehen Before/After-Clips mit Millionen Views durch die Decke.

Auf Reddit, Insta und TikTok sieht man drei Trends:

Hype & FOMO: User posten ihre Erfahrung mit viralen L'Oréal-Produkten – viele feiern das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis im Vergleich zu Luxusmarken.

Angst vor Fail: Einige warnen: ""Achtung, auf meiner Haut hat das gar nicht funktioniert"" – vor allem bei sensibler Haut oder falschem Farbton.

Memes: Clips à la ""Ich: Kauf nix mehr. Auch ich nach 3 TikToks: *L'Oréal-Haul*"" – der Effekt: Impulskäufe ohne Ende.

Willst du sehen, was die Leute sagen? Hier geht's zu den echten Meinungen:

??Die viralsten TikToks zu L'Oréal S.A. ansehen

??Ausführliche Tests auf YouTube checken

Top oder Flop? Das kann das neue Modell

Klar, L'Oréal ist keine einzelne Mascara oder ein einzelnes Serum – aber jedes Jahr kommen neue Must-have-Produkte hinzu, die online komplett eskalieren. Drei Dinge stechen immer wieder raus:

1. Preis-Hammer im Drogerie-Regal

L'Oréal positioniert viele Hits im mittleren Preissegment: teurer als absolute Billigmarken, aber deutlich günstiger als Luxuslabels. Für viele ist das die perfekte Zone: ""Fühlt sich High-End an, aber zerstört mein Konto nicht"". Genau hier entsteht der Preis-Hammer-Effekt – vor allem, wenn Creator L'Oréal als ""Dupe"" zu teuren Marken hypen.

2. Performance, die TikTok-tauglich ist

Produkte, die sichtbar etwas machen – mehr Glow, mehr Volumen, stärkere Deckkraft – performen online natürlich besser. Viele L'Oréal-Produkte liefern sofortige Before/After-Effekte, die man in einem 10-Sekunden-Clip sieht. Das pusht den Hype, weil User direkt sagen: ""Okay, das will ich testen"".

3. Riesige Auswahl – von Basic bis Pro-Look

Make-up, Hautpflege, Haarfarbe, Styling: L'Oréal bedient alles. Das heißt für dich: Du findest für fast jeden Look ein passendes Produkt – vom Alltags-Make-up bis zum Insta-Ready-Full-Face. Nachteil: Die Auswahl kann auch überfordern, und ohne guten Test oder ehrliche Review greifst du schnell daneben.

Achtung: Nur weil etwas viral ist, passt es nicht automatisch zu deinem Hauttyp oder Haar. Die besten Erfahrungen machen User, die vorher auf Inhaltsstoffe und Hautbedürfnisse achten – und nicht nur auf den Trend.

L'Oréal S.A. vs. Die Konkurrenz

Wer ist der größte Gegner im Beauty-Game? Ganz klar: Estée Lauder mit Marken wie MAC, Clinique oder The Ordinary. Beide Konzerne sind globale Riesen – aber sie spielen das Game unterschiedlich.

L'Oréal S.A.: Stark in der Breite, überall präsent – Drogerie, Online, Parfümerie. Viele Untermarken (z. B. Maybelline, NYX, Garnier), extrem aggressiv auf Social Media, viel Kooperation mit Creatorinnen und Influencern.

Estée Lauder: Mehr Fokus auf Premium- und Luxussegment, starke Präsenz in Parfümerien und High-End-Stores, oft teurer, dafür mit Luxus-Image.

Für die TikTok-Generation hat aktuell L'Oréal klar die Nase vorn. Warum? Weil die Brand es besser schafft, massentaugliche Produkte in virale Momente zu verwandeln. Wenn es um pure Reichweite, Verfügbarkeit und Social-Media-Hype geht, ist L'Oréal im Moment der Gewinner.

Wenn du allerdings auf superminimalistische Formulierungen, Nischenbrands oder cleane Indie-Marken stehst, wirken beide Beauty-Giganten für dich vielleicht eher wie die ""Boomer"" der Kosmetik-Welt.

Fazit: Kaufen oder sein lassen?

Also: Lohnt sich das? Aus User-Sicht sind L'Oréal-Produkte oft ein guter Mix aus Preis und Performance. Viele berichten von soliden Ergebnissen, besonders bei Make-up und Haarpflege. Für den Alltag okay bis richtig gut – mit ein paar echten Banger-Produkten dazwischen.

Aber: Blind alles kaufen, was viral ist, ist keine gute Idee. Gerade bei Hautpflege lohnt sich ein Blick in Inhaltsstoffe und echte Erfahrungsberichte. ""Eine Creatorin hat's empfohlen"" ist kein Hautarzt.

Wenn du:

ein günstigeres Dupe zu teurer High-End-Kosmetik suchst,

auf Social Media Produktempfehlungen stehst, aber bereit bist, sie kritisch zu hinterfragen,

und einfach Bock auf neue Looks hast, ohne Luxuspreise zu zahlen,

dann kann sich L'Oréal für dich definitiv lohnen. Tipp: Schau dir vor dem Kauf mindestens ein bis zwei unabhängige Tests auf YouTube an und check die Kommentare – da siehst du schnell, ob der Hype echt ist oder ein Fail droht.

Hinter den Kulissen: Loreal Aktie

Spannend für alle, die nicht nur Beauty im Bad, sondern auch Geld an der Börse haben wollen: Hinter den viralen Produkten steckt ein Börsenriese. Die Loreal Aktie mit der ISIN FR0000120321 wird an der Euronext Paris gehandelt und zählt zu den großen europäischen Konsumwerten.

Wichtiger Hinweis zum Kurs: Die folgenden Angaben basieren auf öffentlichen Finanzportalen. Aktuelle Kurse können sich jederzeit ändern, du solltest vor einer Entscheidung immer selbst nachschauen.

Zum zuletzt verfügbaren Handelsstand lag die Loreal Aktie bei rund Last Close: ca. 440–450 Euro je Aktie (Angabe gerundet, basierend auf gängigen Finanzseiten, bezogen auf den letzten offiziellen Handelsschluss). Der Kurs hat sich in den vergangenen Monaten insgesamt stabil bis leicht positiv entwickelt, mit typischen Schwankungen, wie sie bei großen Konsum- und Luxuswerten normal sind.

Warum ist das spannend? Weil der Markt L'Oréal als relativ robusten Konzern sieht: starke Marken, weltweite Präsenz, ständig neue Trends – und eben diese viralen Hits, die du auf TikTok siehst, können langfristig auch den Umsatz pushen. Heißt aber nicht automatisch, dass die Aktie ""nur steigen"" kann. Auch hier gilt: Achtung, keine Kaufempfehlung – informier dich immer selbst, check aktuelle Kurse und im Zweifel professionelle Beratung.

If AI platforms shape market visibility without transparency, they exercise economic power outside traditional regulatory oversight.
The court will examine whether AI platforms must explain exclusions that affect market access, or whether automated systems can continue to operate without clear accountability.","India’s largest B2B marketplace, IndiaMART InterMESH Limited, has taken OpenAI to the Calcutta High Court, alleging that ChatGPT selectively excluded the platform from AI-generated responses while mentioning rival marketplaces. What began as a dispute over search visibility has grown into a wider legal examination of how artificial intelligence shapes commercial outcomes, market access, and reputational standing in the digital economy.

The matter came up before Justice Ravi Krishna Kapur, who refused to grant immediate relief but made a sharp prima facie observation that IndiaMART appeared to be excluded “without any logic”. The court recognised that such exclusion can cause loss of goodwill, reputation, and commercial injury. The case now moves toward a detailed hearing scheduled for January 13, 2026.

Why This Case Matters Beyond IndiaMART

This dispute does not turn on whether ChatGPT should promote one marketplace over another. It raises a deeper question. Can an AI system, acting as a discovery layer for commercial information, decide which businesses users see without explaining how those decisions are made?

The Calcutta High Court’s early observation matters because it treats omission by an AI interface as a real market action. The court did not see AI outputs as neutral technical artefacts. Instead, it acknowledged that silence in AI-generated responses can shape perception, divert business, and distort competition.

What IndiaMART Told the Court

IndiaMART alleged that ChatGPT “specifically and consciously” chose to exclude the platform from responses where comparable B2B marketplaces were referenced. According to the petition, this was not a random error. The company claimed that OpenAI relied mechanically on reports issued by the United States Trade Representative (USTR), without any independent evaluation or opportunity of hearing.

The USTR is a US government agency that develops and enforces American trade policy. Its annual reports assess global trade and intellectual property practices from a US perspective. These reports influence policy debates but do not carry legal force outside the United States.

IndiaMART approached the court seeking a declaration that USTR findings were not binding on ChatGPT and could not form the basis for excluding its website and listings from AI-generated responses.

The High Court’s Initial View

While declining ad-interim relief, the court recorded a clear prima facie concern about selective discrimination.

“It prima facie appears that the petitioner is being selectively discriminated against and justifiably excluded without any logic. Inevitably, there is a loss of goodwill, reputation, and commercial injury, which is being caused to the petitioner,”

The High Court reasoned that granting immediate directions to alter ChatGPT outputs would amount to final relief without hearing OpenAI and other respondents. At the same time, it acknowledged that suppressed visibility on AI interfaces could cause continuing commercial harm.

What IndiaMART Is Asking For

At the interim stage, IndiaMART asked the court to restrain OpenAI from blacklisting or excluding its website, mobile application, and live product listings from ChatGPT-generated outputs. It also sought directions preventing OpenAI from relying on USTR reviews as a basis for excluding Indian businesses.

The petition further asked the court to direct removal of any internal filters or safeguards that suppress IndiaMART’s listings, along with ancillary reliefs, including costs.

IndiaMART framed its case around the idea that omission by an AI system can mislead users when that system functions as a primary source of commercial discovery. According to the petition, excluding IndiaMART while surfacing rival platforms presents a distorted picture of the B2B marketplace.

The company argued that this amounts to passing off through adverse commercial association. It also alleged trade libel and injurious falsehood, contending that silence by omission can operate as implied disparagement when users rely on AI-generated responses to make commercial decisions.

IndiaMART further claimed unfair competition. Distorted AI-driven visibility, it argued, can redirect users and enquiries toward competitors without any transparent or objective basis. Such harm, the company said, cannot be cured through monetary compensation alone.

The USTR Issue at the Core of the Dispute

A central factual issue concerns OpenAI’s alleged reliance on USTR reviews. IndiaMART argued that these reviews do not constitute binding legal determinations and carry no enforceable authority in India.

According to the petition, OpenAI relied on these reports mechanically, without independent assessment or notice to IndiaMART. The company also alleged selective application. Other platforms named in USTR reports for counterfeiting or piracy continue to appear in ChatGPT responses.

IndiaMART pointed out that it does not feature on the European Union’s Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List. It also relied on an Indian Government press release stating that India is under no obligation to act on USTR findings. On this basis, the company argued that OpenAI imported foreign policy judgments into Indian commercial space through code.

IndiaMART operates a B2B marketplace that connects buyers and sellers, with a strong focus on small and medium enterprises. Through its website and mobile application, suppliers list products and services, while buyers search, compare, and engage.

In its petition, IndiaMART compared its role to that of advertising media. Visibility, it argued, determines whether suppliers receive enquiries and whether buyers discover competing offerings.

To show scale and impact, IndiaMART stated that as of September 30, 2025, it had around 42 million registered buyers, over 124 million listed products, and more than 8.3 million registered suppliers. During the 2024–25 financial year, the platform generated about 458 million business enquiries.

Against this backdrop, exclusion from AI-generated responses was framed as a direct hit to market access.

Brand Dilution and Trademark Protection

IndiaMART also relied on the legal status of its brand. Its mark has been declared a well-known trademark under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. This status attracts enhanced protection against dilution and unfair commercial association.

According to the petition, exclusion from AI outputs dilutes goodwill attached to the mark and amounts to implied disparagement by omission. When an AI system highlights competing platforms while remaining silent about a well-known marketplace, it sends a misleading signal about relevance and credibility.

The dispute aligns with concerns raised by the Competition Commission of India, which has warned that AI systems can distort competition through automated decision-making, even without human intent. If AI platforms shape market visibility without transparency, they exercise economic power outside traditional regulatory oversight.

What Happens Next

The court directed IndiaMART to notify OpenAI and other respondents through multiple modes, including email and courier. The matter will come up for further hearing on January 13, 2026.

How the case proceeds could shape the future obligations of AI intermediaries in India. The court will examine whether AI platforms must explain exclusions that affect market access, or whether automated systems can continue to operate without clear accountability.

Proponents view this as a relatively attractive valuation for a company delivering double-digit revenue growth.
The strategic imperative is to leverage generative AI as a growth catalyst rather than a threat.","As Adobe enters the new year, investors are weighing a complex set of market signals. On one hand, robust financial performance and bullish analyst commentary provide a foundation for optimism. On the other, recent technical weakness in the share price and institutional selling activity have introduced a note of caution. The central investment thesis now hinges on the company's ability to successfully monetize its artificial intelligence offerings.

Contrasting with positive analyst views, data on institutional investors reveals a more cautious stance. On December 31, Marietta Wealth Management LLC reported a significant reduction in its Adobe holdings, selling over 4,000 shares for a decrease of approximately 18.2% in its position.

This transaction fits a pattern of typical portfolio rebalancing at year-end. Many asset managers adjust their weightings within the technology sector, locking in gains or reducing overall risk exposure. While Marietta's move is part of this broader sector-wide rebalancing and not necessarily a direct vote against Adobe, it underscores that some major investors opted for a more defensive posture as the calendar turned.

Mixed Technical Picture to Close the Year

The final trading session of 2025 on the Nasdaq failed to provide clear directional momentum for Adobe shares. The stock closed at $349.99, just below a psychologically significant level, after being unable to sustain several intraday attempts to move higher. The price action suggested a fading of momentum rather than a dynamic year-end finish.

This displayed weakness aligns with a mixed broader chart pattern. While the equity gained roughly 26% over the past month, it remains down by a significant 18% over a twelve-month horizon. Currently trading more than 20% below its 52-week high of $445.25, the stock cannot yet be said to be in a sustained recovery rally.

Bullish Analysts Highlight Valuation Gap

Fundamental analysis presents a more constructive picture than recent price action suggests. A fresh analysis published on Seeking Alpha on December 31 posits that Adobe may be undervalued at current levels, setting a price target of $595—substantially above the present trading price.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

The rationale centers on valuation. Despite widespread concerns that generative AI could disrupt its business model, Adobe posted record financial results for fiscal 2025. Based on these figures, the analysis calculates a forward price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 15. Proponents view this as a relatively attractive valuation for a company delivering double-digit revenue growth.

The core argument is that the market may be over-discounting the risks posed by AI competition beyond what the current financials justify. This, from the analysts' perspective, creates a gap between market perception and operational reality—representing potential upside if Adobe continues to execute on its growth narrative.

The 2026 Outlook: Monetizing AI is Key

Looking ahead to 2026, execution on corporate objectives takes center stage. Management aims to grow annual recurring revenue (ARR) by more than 10% in the new fiscal year. The success of this forecast is inextricably linked to the effective monetization of AI features, including those powered by Firefly and other tools integrated across the product suite.

The strategic imperative is to leverage generative AI as a growth catalyst rather than a threat. By embedding AI capabilities directly into its subscription models and generating additional revenue from these value-added features, Adobe intends to fortify and expand its market position.

The tension for the initial trading days of 2026 thus stems from the interplay between valuation and expectation: a share price significantly below its yearly peak meets double-digit growth targets and high hopes for AI-driven revenue. Whether the optimistic analyst view prevails or the caution exhibited by some institutional investors sets the tone will likely become clearer with subsequent updates on ARR progress and the adoption rates of AI products in the coming quarters.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2420331_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 12:00:29.044749

Right now, there are three major banks offering cash incentives to lure customers to chop and change their bank.

Bank customers are notoriously stubborn, with many sticking with their bank for decades out of pure inertia despite not necessarily having access to the best rates or bonuses. But right now, First Direct, Nationwide and Santander are offering hard cash to get customers to switch their current bank, with many also offering high-interest linked savings accounts and cashback on top too.

Santander is offering £200 cash up front to switch, the best offer on the market right now. It also pays 1% cashback on household bills, up to a maximum of £10 a month, and access to a linked 6% interest rate savings account. Its Santander Edge account charges a £3 per month fee, but is more than made up for by the cashback.

Santander is also open to anyone to switch from any other big-name bank. Whether you're a customer of NatWest, Nationwide, Lloyds, Halifax, HSBC, Barclays or any other big name, you will be eligible to switch. The only catch is, you can't have held a Santander current account on January 1 2025, and you can't have previously received a Santander switch payment.

There’s a £500 per month minimum pay-in and you must have two active direct debits on your account. You also need to be a UK resident and be over 18.

Santander will then pay the money within 60 to 90 days of the switch being completed.

It says: ""Open a Santander Edge current account. Request a switch before we remove our offer. Make sure the details you give us are correct and match those at your old bank. Complete the switch within 60 days of your request, have at least 2 active selected household Direct Debits and pay in £1,500.""

There’s no set date for the offer to expire, but money expert Martin Lewis says that bank switch deals could be withdrawn at any time, so it’s best to get a move on and lock down a switch deal now.

Why should I care?

For markets: AI is still funded but semis are the scoreboard.

SoftBank’s move says capital is still flowing to AI models and software, even when megacap tech has a weak day. But semiconductors often set the tone because supply constraints and orders show up there first. The split between AI-linked manufacturers like TSMC and more cycle-sensitive names like GlobalFoundries suggests investors may keep rewarding leading-edge AI supply chains while treating the rest of the sector more cautiously.

The bigger picture: Tech is running two cycles at once.

AI compute demand is accelerating, yet parts of the chip industry are still in a slowdown – and that mismatch can redirect spending toward advanced manufacturing and data-center infrastructure.

The United States Postal Service has announced that it will provide entry to its last-mile delivery network.

“Shippers large and small will be able to access the more than 18,000 USPS delivery destination units (DDUs) nationwide via a solicitation process that will begin accepting bids in late January or early February 2026,” the Postal Service said in a Dec. 17 press release.

Prior to launching a dedicated bid solicitation platform, the USPS will meet with shippers to determine their level of interest and hone the bidding process based on shippers’ feedback. More details will be provided in the months ahead, the Postal Service said.

“We want to allow customers to custom-build their last mile solution,” Postmaster General David Steiner said. “We want to make the service as convenient, cost-effective and efficient as possible.”

“The Postal Service’s valuable last-mile network can now be our customer’s advantage,” Steiner said. “Our last mile can become our customer’s last mile.”

Recent substantial investments in modernization have significantly boosted the Postal Service’s package processing and delivery capacity. This will allow the USPS to satisfy a much bigger percentage of the country’s shipping needs than it provides now.

The USPS plans to formalize accepted bids using a negotiated service agreement (NSA).

“The [Postal Service] expects to notify winning bidders in the second calendar quarter [of 2026], and service under those NSAs would begin in the third calendar quarter of 2026,” the Postal Service said.

“By changing the way last-mile service is offered, the Postal Service is expanding the reach of retailers and others who value same-day or next-day delivery,” the Postal Service said. “USPS wants to provide a reach that is unparalleled in the history of the United States.”

Strategic Considerations for Diversified Expansion This potential deal highlights Eli Lilly’s strategic mindset of not relying solely on a single growth engine.
These risks include intensified future market competition, challenges after patent expirations, and potential setbacks in the R&D pipeline.","Eli Lilly (LLY) has significantly enhanced its market position and stock price in recent years, driven by its strong performance in the GLP-1 drug sector, making its future prospects highly anticipated. However, outstanding companies never settle for a single track; they consistently strive to seek diversified growth pathways. Recent market rumors suggest that Eli Lilly may be undertaking a significant strategic move—acquiring the French biotechnology company Abivax. This move could inject new momentum into its future outlook.

A Potential Major Acquisition

Large pharmaceutical companies often enrich their product pipelines through acquisitions or licensing agreements, an efficient way to supplement R&D assets. Over the past two years, Eli Lilly has expanded its pipeline through acquisitions in various fields, including oncology. According to media reports, the company is in acquisition talks with Abivax. Abivax’s core asset is the Phase III clinical-stage drug obefazimod, which is intended for treating ulcerative colitis (UC) and has the potential to expand into other immune-related diseases.

Although the UC market already has various therapies, including Eli Lilly’s own product Omvoh, obefazimod has demonstrated significant efficacy in clinical trials for moderate-to-severe patients, particularly those who have not responded well to previous treatments, thanks to its unique mechanism of action. If approved, it could become a “blockbuster” drug. Therefore, this acquisition holds strong strategic appeal for Eli Lilly, though the cost may also be substantial—market rumors have already driven Abivax’s market value significantly higher.

Strategic Considerations for Diversified Expansion

This potential deal highlights Eli Lilly’s strategic mindset of not relying solely on a single growth engine. While its GLP-1 product line remains the core growth driver for the foreseeable future, the company’s management is clearly planning ahead to mitigate potential risks. These risks include intensified future market competition, challenges after patent expirations, and potential setbacks in the R&D pipeline.

Eli Lilly is building long-term competitiveness through a multi-pronged approach: in addition to exploring acquisitions like Abivax to strengthen its immunology portfolio, the company is actively expanding into new therapeutic areas such as oncology and investing in AI supercomputers to enhance the efficiency and success rate of drug development. This forward-looking strategy aims to create a sustainable growth foundation for the company.

Evaluation from an Investor’s Perspective

Eli Lilly’s current financial performance is robust, and its growth momentum is expected to continue. Whether the acquisition of Abivax ultimately materializes, the company’s solid foundation based on its existing core business, combined with its diversified strategic layout for long-term development, makes its stock persistently attractive. For investors, Eli Lilly demonstrates not only the ability to deliver short-term performance but also a clear blueprint for navigating future uncertainties and consolidating its industry leadership through continuous strategic investments.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/After-a-1323-Stock-Rally-Whats-Next-for-Nvidia.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 03:58:26.390655

That's what happened with a federal judge in Alaska who allegedly created a sexualized environment with his clerks.","MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

A nonprofit group that advocates for law clerks is alleging a judge, Sarah Merriam, bullies and mistreats clerks. Now, this is a rare step to file a misconduct complaint against a federal appeals court judge. It is also the latest flashpoint in a debate about whether the federal courts can police themselves. NPR's Carrie Johnson has been reporting on that issue, so we've asked her to come tell us more. Hi, Carrie.

CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi there.

KELLY: OK. Tell us more. What do we know about this judge?

JOHNSON: Judge Sarah Merriam's an appeals court judge on the 2nd Circuit. That's a very prestigious job with life tenure. She was actually nominated by President Joe Biden and previously served as a district court judge and a magistrate in Connecticut. Earlier in her career, she worked as a federal public defender. But I've also learned about some concerns about her behavior in chambers toward her law clerks. A group called The Legal Accountability Project filed a formal complaint based on conversations with her former clerks. Aliza Shatzman is founder of that project.

ALIZA SHATZMAN: We are filing this complaint because we can shoulder risks that, frankly, many law clerks perceive they cannot. But I hope that clerks will learn about this complaint and feel empowered to come forward to file complaints themselves.

JOHNSON: Shatzman says she's heard of the judge yelling, issuing all-caps emails. She says one clerk quit after only one month on the job. And at least four others got offered jobs there as clerks but then withdrew, apparently because they heard problems about the workplace through the whisper network.

KELLY: The response from the court to this complaint is what, Carrie?

JOHNSON: There is no response from the judge herself or from officials in the 2nd Circuit Appeals Court. And a judiciary spokesman here in D.C. has declined comment. The courts actually manage themselves. It's part of their tradition of independence and the separation of powers. But this case is interesting, in part because this project says Judge Merriam is the subject of a previous complaint. There's a public order from 2023 that does not name this judge but seems to match details in the new filing from The Legal Accountability Project. That investigation found the judge had an overly harsh management style. Officials closed the investigation after the judge agreed to watch workplace videos and receive some counseling.

KELLY: Just fill in a little bit of the context here for us. The misconduct process in the federal courts, how is it supposed to work?

JOHNSON: Filing a formal complaint is very rare. Only a few of them are filed every year even though there are hundreds of federal judges. Law clerks are wary because they fear retaliation. They really can't report bullying or abusive conduct without that getting back to the judge, and that could destroy their legal careers. Federal judges have so much power, especially over clerks. And people who work in the federal courts don't have the same employment protections other Americans do. Again, Aliza Shatzman.

SHATZMAN: Federal judges are exempt from antidiscrimination laws. So in most other workplaces, if you are mistreated in this way, you can sue your harasser.

JOHNSON: And that's worth emphasizing. The federal courts are exempt from Title VII antidiscrimination laws. So people who work there generally cannot sue over mistreatment on the job. They have to use the court's internal process to complain and try to seek justice. And our NPR investigation this year found problems with that process.

KELLY: So, Carrie, where does this situation go from here?

JOHNSON: If the 2nd Circuit Court decides to proceed with an investigation, it might interview current and former law clerks and maybe other people in the courthouse or chambers. Shatzman and other advocates for clerks have been trying for years to get Congress to expand workplace protections for people who work for the courts. So far, that's gone nowhere in Congress. And judges can only be removed from office if they're impeached. That hardly ever happens. But in a few recent cases, judges have been pressured to resign or retire. That's what happened with a federal judge in Alaska who allegedly created a sexualized environment with his clerks. He resigned and has since been disbarred.

KELLY: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thank you, Carrie.

To bridge the gap, OpenAI is reportedly developing plans to integrate advertising directly into ChatGPT conversations.

Why it matters

OpenAI sits on a “goldmine” of user intent data. By entering the advertising fray, the Sam Altman-led company would directly challenge the “Big Three” of digital ads—Google, Meta, and Amazon—who currently control 60% of the global market (excluding China).

The Strategy

According to a report citing internal sources, OpenAI is “tweaking” its AI models to prioritize sponsored information in specific contexts.

The UX: Users may see sponsored results for products (like mascara) when asking for recommendations.

The Format: Employees have reportedly mocked up sidebars for sponsored content and clear disclosure labels to indicate paid results.

The Balance: A key internal focus is “not turning off users.” OpenAI is treading carefully to ensure ads don’t feel intrusive or compromise the personal nature of the chat experience.

By the Numbers

OpenAI’s scale makes it a formidable advertising platform:

900 million: Current weekly active users.

2.6 billion: Target active user base by 2030.

60%: Combined market share of Google, Meta, and Amazon in digital ads.

The Pivot

While CEO Sam Altman has publicly downplayed ad ambitions in the past, the company’s recent actions suggest a shift in priority:

Hiring: OpenAI has been recruiting digital advertising veterans over the past year.

Features: Development is underway for shopping features specifically designed to host retail ads.

The bottom line

AI is expensive to run. While OpenAI has relied on subscriptions and enterprise deals so far, the massive compute costs required to reach billions of users are making a high-margin ad model almost inevitable.

What’s next

There is no confirmed timeline for when ads will go live. OpenAI remains in the testing and “mockup” phase as it weighs user sentiment against the need for revenue.",https://techlabari.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/nonlinear-000334.jpeg,N,,2026-01-01 03:58:34.922955
