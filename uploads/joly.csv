In the U.S., where there has been significant pushback against corporate climate activism, as much as 78 percent of the public want companies to engage the government on climate action.
What this means The public is not just open to corporate climate advocacy; they expect it.
As global attention watches Climate Week NYC and COP 30 this fall, companies have a clear mandate to use their influence to shape policy and accelerate climate action.","At a time when it’s hard to find consensus on many issues — particularly in the sustainability space — new research shows a majority of the public want companies to step up and fill the climate change void left by some governments around the world.

New data from Trellis data partner GlobeScan shows that 85 percent of people around the world believe large companies should actively encourage governments to take stronger action on climate. While the percentage of those who strongly agree has slightly declined over the last few years, the overall consensus remains clear: People expect business to lead on climate advocacy. Only 15 percent of respondents express disagreement, underscoring the enduring public mandate for corporate climate leadership.

Support is especially strong in emerging markets, where citizens are looking to business as a catalyst for progress:

Kenya (94 percent)

Nigeria (94 percent)

Vietnam (93 percent)

Indonesia (92 percent)

Even in countries where climate policy is politically sensitive, such as Germany (70 percent) and the Netherlands (72 percent), strong majorities still support corporate engagement. In the U.S., where there has been significant pushback against corporate climate activism, as much as 78 percent of the public want companies to engage the government on climate action.

What this means

The public is not just open to corporate climate advocacy; they expect it. This presents a strategic opportunity for businesses to step into a leadership role that goes beyond internal sustainability efforts. Advocacy can build trust and legitimacy, especially in regions where climate impacts are felt most acutely. At the same time, silence or neutrality may be perceived as indifference.

At a lower price point but luxury nonetheless.

In my opinion, Loro Piana has a lot more personality, preppy classics with a quirky flair – as we’ve seen on Jeremy Strong. None of the Gwyn pieces, to me, have that character. I’m not saying they’re in competition, my point is the market, and who this is for and who it would appeal to. Because at the more affordable range for the mall shopper, there’s Banana Republic. Slightly above that is Reformation and even Ralph Lauren, with a certain section of their line. A higher jump from there is where you find a brand like Veronica Beard, for example. And Nili Lotan – similar energy to Gwyn and also sold at Goop. And then Loro Piana and The Row at the top. Who’s the person bypassing these options and choosing Gwyn? Not that they aren’t out there, I’m just curious who they are and how many there are.

Consumers want financial companies they can trust. Is your bank, broker or insurer on this most-trusted list? Check out our 2025 list and find out more about why building and keeping customer trust is vital to these companies.

Americans are feeling a bit more optimistic and resilient about their financial situations this year, despite stubborn high prices, interest-rate uncertainty and fast-changing U.S. policy on trade and tariffs.

Consumers are looking for the best deals, whether that's for groceries or in the companies they do business with. This makes it more critical than ever for financial firms to earn and maintain their customers' trust.

This trend is seen in Investor's Business Daily's sixth annual report on the Most Trusted Financial Companies. This independent customer survey, co-branded with MarketWatch, shows that over the past three years the highest IBD Trust Index score has risen from 85.3 in 2023 to 89.9 in 2025 for the top company on the list (out of a possible 100). This year, that company is USAA.

USAA serves active military members, their families and veterans. It tops the list of the 30 most trusted financial companies for 2025. Divisions of USAA (its credit-card, home- and automobile-insurance, and bank operations) account for four of the top 10 spots on the list. USAA also ranked highest on our lists in 2022 and 2023.

For this year's list of the Most Trusted Financial Companies, IBD and polling partner TechnoMetrica asked thousands of customers about their online brokers; fund companies; wealth managers; credit-card companies; banks; and auto, home and life insurers. The survey ranks companies in eight areas customers deem most important, including financial soundness, prices and confidence in management. We identify the 30 Most Trusted Financial Companies and the top four in each of eight business categories.

Financial companies where people put their money and trust

Customers ranked USAA's credit-card division as No. 1 on the list, followed by USAA's home-insurance and auto-insurance divisions in second and third place, respectively.

USAA customers lauded the company's customer service as ""fantastic,"" and appreciated products and services to support family members.

Michael Moran, president of USAA Bank, told IBD, ""We have a clear sense of mission: [to] ensure the financial security of our membership. That mission drives everything we do. We're proud of the trust we've built with our members by being there in the moments that matter as well as for their everyday needs.""

Financial companies' soundness is critical

In the 2025 IBD survey, customers declared financial soundness and security to be the most important attribute of the companies they trust. Quality of products and services offered was a close second. How well companies protected their privacy and security, along with ethics and values, also were of importance.

For IBD's list of the Most Trusted Financial Companies in 2025, we asked more than 6,200 survey participants about how they judged the financial soundness of the companies they do business with. The survey was conducted from May to July by IBD polling partner TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence.

There were again eight categories of companies in this year's survey: ETF/fund companies; online brokers; wealth managers; credit-card companies; banks; and life, home and auto insurers.

Financial companies vie for eight trust attributes

Our survey covered eight areas of trust. The attributes for the 2025 IBD Most Trusted Financial Companies survey were financial soundness, quality of products and services, ethical business practices, privacy and security, customer service, prices, sensitivity to customer needs, and confidence in company management.

The first phase of our survey was conducted in March and April. The purpose of that phase is to identify the trust characteristics, or attributes, that are most important to consumers.

Financially sound/secure received the highest weight (19%) in our study, topping our list of the most critical trust factors for financial companies. Quality of products/services took the second spot (17%), followed by the commitment to protecting the privacy and security of personal data (15%).

More than 90% of survey respondents said trust was ""very important"" in their relationships with financial firms.

The second phase of the survey was conducted from May to July. Using the eight trust attributes arrived at in Phase 1, respondents evaluated the company they most often utilize in each of the eight business lines.

Our survey not only tallies the 30 most trusted financial companies but also reveals the most-trusted companies in the eight categories of financial companies.

Schwab tops most-trusted investment companies

A standout this year, Charles Schwab (SCHW) swept the investing group, ranking first among ETF/fund companies, online brokers and wealth managers. Schwab's investing divisions also took three of the top 10 places in the overall trust rankings.

""Trust is everything,"" Rick Wurster, CEO of Schwab, told IBD. ""We strive to earn our clients' trust by putting them at the forefront of every decision we make and by treating them the way we would like to be treated. We are here for them when and where they need us.""

Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard are among the perennial favorites in the wealth-management categories of the survey. Fidelity topped the categories in 2024 and scored a hat trick in 2023.

Fidelity Investments' ETF/fund division, online brokerage and wealth-management division placed highly not only in the investing categories but also claimed three spots in the overall most-trusted list.

Other companies among the four most trusted in the investing categories include JPMorgan Funds (JPM); E-Trade, a division of Morgan Stanley (MS); and U.S. Bank, part of US Bancorp (USB).

Banks rise in trust index

Banks as a group are climbing in the IBD Trust Index. The group rose a step again this year, beating out insurers. But banks still lag investment and credit-card companies.

Joining USAA on the list of the four most-trusted banks are Chime, a fintech company that partners with FDIC-insured banks; Capital One Bank, part of Capital One Financial (COF); and Chase Bank, owned by JPMorgan Chase.

""Customers want more than just services,"" Andy Navarrete, head of global enterprise affairs at Capital One, told IBD. ""They're looking for great value, personalized guidance, compelling experiences and simple tools that make managing money feel less intimidating and more empowering.""

Most-trusted credit-card companies

Among credit-card companies, four stood out for customers in our 2025 survey.

They were USAA; American Express (AXP)); Discover, which was acquired this year by Capital One Financial; and Chase.

USAA, American Express and Discover also were the top three credit-card companies in the 2024 Most Trusted Financial Companies special report.

The top 10 on our most-trusted list

Financial-services firms have faced both internal and external challenges garnering the trust of their customers. Those that focus on the attributes in our 2025 survey, especially financial soundness and quality products, should be recognized for their successes.

These companies' divisions round out the top 10, ranked according to their IBD Trust Index score:

-- USAA, credit cards

-- USAA, home insurance

-- USAA, auto insurance

-- Schwab, ETF/fund companies

-- Fidelity, ETF/fund companies

-- USAA, banks

-- Vanguard, ETF/fund companies

-- Schwab, online brokers

-- Schwab, wealth management

The buyers secured $53M in acquisition financing from Goldman Sachs, Cushman & Wakefield announced Thursday.

Nuances for Kiwi managers Chris Douglas, partner at Mapua Wealth, said it was for that sort of reason that it had been difficult for fund managers to outperform for a long time.
Lee said there were a number of reasons why active managers might underperform but one was fees.
Research consistently shows that the average active fund earns negative risk-adjusted returns once all fees, transaction costs, and other expenses are accounted for.
These costs create a high hurdle that managers must overcome to break even with a low-cost index fund.","Avoiding too much exposure to the United States in the first half of this year might have served active investment managers well, but they aren't generally delivering better returns than the market overall, new data indicates.

S&P Dow Jones Indices has published its mid-year Spiva Scorecard, which shows that 60 percent of actively managed global equity funds in New Zealand were able to outperform the S&P World Index in the first half of this year.

This is based on returns net of fees.

The scorecard looks at the performance of actively managed funds against benchmarks over a number of time horizons.

Active managers are those who select investments for their funds, to try to beat the market. In contrast, passive funds tend to aim to track an index.

S&P Dow Jones Indices head of index investment strategy Sue Lee said the global index was usually where active managers did not do well.

Listen to No Stupid Questions with Susan Edmunds

""If you look at the 10-year or 15-year performance rate, 100 percent of [managers] we examine actually underperformed the benchmark, so this 60 percent outperformance rate is actually very unusual, and one of the highest we've seen in New Zealand.""

She said it could be because of how managers dealt with US investments earlier this year.

""If you look at everything in the same currency, in USD, a lot of developed markets and emerging markets actually outperformed the US market peak, partly driven by the sharp depreciation of the US dollar...I think a lot of [active managers] actually had underweight in the US equities and if they have done that, they outperform the benchmark.""

New Zealand equities also lagged other markets in the first half of this year, partly because of concerns about the local economy.

Lee said 62 percent of actively managed New Zealand equity funds underperformed the S&P/NZX50 in the half-year.

She said there were a small number of stocks in New Zealand that had high index weightings, such as Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Auckland International Airport and Infratil.

""Active managers will be evaluated against the benchmark and how they how they positioned in these three stocks relatively to benchmark can actually be a very big factor in New Zealand ... these stocks did really well the past years and ... they became such a high weighting in the index.

""But then in the first half [year], that kind of flipped and each of these stocks underperformed the benchmark.""

She said any manager who had less exposure to those big stocks would have outperformed.

Nuances for Kiwi managers

Chris Douglas, partner at Mapua Wealth, said it was for that sort of reason that it had been difficult for fund managers to outperform for a long time.

""Globally if you didn't hold Invidia, Facebook, Google Amazon, Microsoft, it's going ot have a big impact on the performance of your funds.

""That's certainly been a headwind for sure over the last five or ten years for any active manager.""

He said there were some nuances to keep in mind in New Zealand.

The ""global equity"" fund universe here would include global infrastructure investments, for example. ""That gets caught up in the data and shows they've under performed but they should be in their own peer group in another market ... sometimes when you're looking at the broader peer groups they have, within New Zealand there's some different funds that are quite different characteristics to what a global equity fund would be [overseas] ... it's not always an apples versus apples comparison.

""The structure of the product, the biases it might have, the indices tracking which might not always nicely match what the S&P indexes are.""

Lee said there were a number of reasons why active managers might underperform but one was fees.

""Fees really add up over time and passive funds usually have a much better cost compared to active funds.""

Costs biggest deterrent

University of Auckland finance lecturer Gertjan Verdickt said it was ""exceptionally challenging"" for active managers to consistently outperform a passive index.

""First and foremost are costs. Research consistently shows that the average active fund earns negative risk-adjusted returns once all fees, transaction costs, and other expenses are accounted for. These costs create a high hurdle that managers must overcome to break even with a low-cost index fund.

""Second, our markets are reasonably efficient. This means that finding genuinely mispriced stocks is a challenging task, and doing so consistently over extended periods is even more difficult. Industry scorecards from around the globe confirm this, showing that the percentage of active funds that underperform their benchmarks almost always increases over longer time horizons, such as 10 or 15 years. Outperformance is the exception, not the rule.""

Verdickt said managers would chase returns.

""If you are a manager with a bad year, you will likely copy the strategy of a winner - making that strategy obsolete. Similarly, investors chase returns: if you invested in a loser, you will switch toward a winner. However, not every strategy can handle a significant inflow of capital.""

He said the most powerful predictors of future success were not the specific stocks a fund holds, but rather characteristics of the fund itself.

""The two that stand out are fund momentum (a fund that has been performing well tends to continue performing well) and fund flow (skilled managers tend to attract new investment).""

He said best-performing funds were often those that are ""too small"" in relation to their manager's capabilities.

""This implies that top managers are exploiting market inefficiencies before the broader market catches on and floods the fund with so much capital that the strategy becomes diluted.

""It's a common belief that a key benefit of active management is the ability to protect capital in a downturn ... However, my view is that the evidence on this is mixed: Recent analysis that tested top-performing strategies across different market cycles found that, while they did perform somewhat better during recessions, the difference was not statistically significant. This suggests that while some individual managers might successfully navigate a downturn, it isn't a guaranteed feature of active management as a whole.""

He said people should also remember that performance data was flattered by survivorship bias.

""A huge percentage of funds-in some cases up to half over 15 years-are merged or liquidated. These are typically the worst performers, and when they are removed from the data, the average performance of the remaining funds appears much better than reality. Any sound analysis must take this into account.""",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--FiVyvoz0--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1643826055/4NZW75H_copyright_image_140486?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-09-25 19:10:28.602479

This led to two questions: Why should businesses focus more on sustainable waste management?
And what can they do to make their sustainability efforts work?
Additionally, a 2023 Inside Higher Ed survey revealed that 45% of students considered environmental sustainability in their enrollment decision.
Sustainable waste management is not just about ticking boxes anymore.","Be it discarded to-go containers tossed in airports, soda cans discarded in stadiums, or excess food composted on university campuses, nearly all organizations and businesses generate large amounts of waste every day. In response, many invest heavily in sustainable waste management systems. But their efforts often fail to deliver results. The problem isn't a lack of intent, but rather poor integrated planning, operational inefficiencies, failure to adapt to changing demands, and inadequate employee and public engagement. This led to two questions: Why should businesses focus more on sustainable waste management? And what can they do to make their sustainability efforts work?

From rising global temperatures to overflowing garbage, the world is facing urgent environmental challenges. Hence, businesses now shoulder a responsibility that extends beyond market share and profit margins. The growing responsibility has moved sustainability from the sidelines to the centre of corporate discussion, making it a business imperative rather than an option.

As consumers become more environmentally aware, a brand's reputation is increasingly tied to its sustainability goals. A company's clear demonstration of environmental, social, and ethical efforts builds customer trust and loyalty. ""The best thing that can happen from a brand perspective is that their sustainability goal is reflected in brand value,"" says Julianna Doherty, the CEO of Recycle Away.

Recent research shows that sustainability not only reduces waste management costs and improves brand value but also significantly influences consumer behavior. People who were once concerned about price tags and brand values are now shifting their focus towards sustainable businesses, even if it means paying more. A study published by Brand Finance reveals that 11.9% of supermarket shoppers and 9.1% of apparel consumers decide their purchasing choice based on a brand's sustainability values. Additionally, a 2023 Inside Higher Ed survey revealed that 45% of students considered environmental sustainability in their enrollment decision.

However, despite this realization, many businesses still treat recycling and waste management as an afterthought rather than integrating them into their core strategy. According to research, 58% of businesses do not even maintain any formal record of their waste management practices, an oversight that can lead to reputational, environmental, and financial consequences.

Some well-intentioned, eco-conscious companies sometimes opt for the easiest and fastest solutions, rather than the most sustainable ones. For them, the extra effort required for effective recycling is often unnecessary. ""People sometimes assume that one size fits all,"" remarks Doherty, highlighting the need for customized approaches. On the other hand, a few companies spend large sums on new technologies but fail to ensure effective execution and management, leading to poor outcomes.

However, blending design-first thinking with human-centered strategies can dramatically improve waste management efficiency. Since collection and first sorting begin at the bin level, people's perception of trash bins directly influences their behaviour. By redesigning trash bins, using colour coding, clear universal signage, and strategic placement, businesses can improve waste separation and reduce the costs and effort associated with recycling. ""Colour and signage are important in making effective waste streams. Without them, people get confused about whether to use the bins or not, leading to waste contamination,"" advises Doherty.

Sustainable waste management is not just about ticking boxes anymore. It's about designing smarter systems that encourage people to use them in order to create a better environment. With the right mix of planning, tools, and public engagement, businesses can turn waste into a powerful opportunity for revenue and reputation.",https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4623789/recycle-away-systems-solutions.png,N,,2025-09-25 21:05:40.399119

L’Orient-Le Jour recently celebrated its centenary, marking a century of independence, editorial freedom, and journalistic rigor. Its longevity owes much to a constantly evolving newsroom, continuous renewal, and unwavering commitment to digital transformation — without ever compromising its mission.

Free from state or political funding and supported by shareholders committed to editorial independence, L’Orient-Le Jour represents a singular voice in the Arab media landscape, offering a pluralistic, free, and sovereign vision of Lebanon, in constant dialogue with its diaspora. Guided by humanist principles and rejecting all forms of fanaticism, it defends the rule of law, cultural and religious diversity, integrity, transparency, and freedom of expression.

A French-Lebanese national, former French Minister of Culture Rima Abdul Malak has consistently championed these values throughout her career, spanning humanitarian work, diplomacy, and cultural policy — from her work at Paris City Hall to the Elysée presidential palace, and from New York to refugee camps around the world. Building on a century-long legacy of resilience in the face of regional upheavals, she will lead L’Orient-Le Jour into a new phase of development: expanding its international reach, broadening its editorial offerings, driving digital innovation, and engaging new audiences — all while remaining true to its founding values.

""Rima Abdul Malak will bring renewed energy to extend the newspaper’s reach, adapt its business model to new industry challenges, and strengthen its influence both in the Middle East and internationally. Determined and sensitive, she has always defended press freedom and supported civil society in Lebanon. Her international experience, strategic and operational skills, and deep attachment to Lebanon and its diaspora are essential assets to secure the future of L’Orient-Le Jour at the helm of a committed team,"" said Nayla de Freige, Chair of the Board of Directors of the L’Orient-Le Jour Group.

""Nothing is more essential today than the cause of information. Defending it is a democratic struggle, the foundation of freedom, justice, and trust. In a world shaken by geopolitical crises, disinformation, and polarized opinions, L’Orient-Le Jour plays a crucial role in fostering informed and free public debate. I am honored to dedicate my energy to this next chapter of its history, consolidating its independence, amplifying its impact, and strengthening the vital link between Lebanon and all those around the world who continue to believe in its future,"" stated Rima Abdul Malak.

On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, Nayla de Freige wishes to commend the dedicated work of Fouad Khoury Helou, Group Director since 2021, who successfully expanded the newspaper’s audience while maintaining its financial stability despite the multiple crises that have shaken Lebanon and the region in recent years.

""I leave my position satisfied to have successfully guided L’Orient-Le Jour through a challenging security and economic context. I extend my gratitude to the shareholders, the editorial and administrative teams, and the readers of L’Orient-Le Jour, a newspaper that remains, in my eyes, one

of Lebanon’s strongest symbols,"" said Fouad Khoury Helou.

Born in 1979, Rima Abdul Malak spent her early years in Beirut before her family fled the civil war and settled in Lyon. A Political Science graduate, she began her career in international solidarity, working in Palestinian territories for CCFD (Catholic Committee Against Hunger and for Development), and later directed Clowns Without Borders, providing psychosocial support to children affected by war and poverty.

Culture soon became her main focus: at the Institut Français (French Institute), the Paris City Hall under Mayor Bertrand Delanoë, and as a cultural attaché in New York, fostering exchanges between France and the U.S. In 2019, she became the culture advisor to President Emmanuel Macron, playing a key role during the Covid pandemic to protect, through unprecedented measures, the press, artists and cultural institutions.

From 2022 to 2024, she served as France’s Minister of Culture, the first French-Lebanese in a French government. Her priorities included youth, heritage, creation, and media independence. She strengthened public broadcasting, promoted media literacy, supported press cartoonists, and prepared the ‘États Généraux de l’Information’ (a collective 9-month study by a French independent organization on the right to information). At the European level, she contributed to the Media Freedom Act which aimed to protect the freedom of journalists and media pluralism.

Since leaving government in January 2024, Rima Abdul Malak has been actively involved with several Lebanese institutions, including the Samir Kassir Foundation for Press Freedom, the Sursock Museum, Metropolis Cinema, and Saint Joseph University (USJ).

She sits on the Board of Reporters Without Borders, the international committee of ALIPH (The International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage), and chairs the jury of the ‘Planches Contact’ photography festival in Deauville. She also founded the “Rima Poésie Club » (Rima Poetry Club) and has produced several performances centered around her passion for poetry.

A distinctive figure in the French-Lebanese cultural dialogue, her career reflects a steadfast belief that words, arts, and ideas can help shape the future.

Founded in 1971 from the merger of L’Orient (founded in Beirut in 1924 by Georges Naccache and Gabriel Khabbaz) and Le Jour (founded in Beirut in 1934 by Michel Chiha), L’Orient-Le Jour is Lebanon’s only French-language daily. Its Board is chaired by Nayla de Freige and its team comprises over 100 professionals, including around 60 journalists.

The newspaper has given space to some of the most prominent thinkers, columnists, writers, and journalists of modern Lebanon. A standard-bearer of the Francophonie, it strives to provide independent, rigorous, and high-quality reporting for all those connected to Lebanon and the Middle East.

L’Orient-Le Jour is overseen by a management committee including Nayla de Freige (CEO), Elie Fayad and Anthony Samrani (Editors-in-Chief), Ludovic Blecher (Board Executive Member), Emilie Sueur (Director of Digital Development), and Nicole Karkour (Marketing Director). Starting Nov. 10, Rima Abdul Malak will succeed Fouad Khoury Helou as Executive Director and member of the management committee.

Since its founding, the newspaper has upheld democratic values, pluralism, openness, and cultural and religious dialogue. It won the 2022 ‘Grande Médaille de la Francophonie’ from the Académie Française, and the 2021 ‘Albert Londres’ Prize — awarded to journalist Caroline Hayek. Its credibility is recognized internationally for analysis quality, reliability, and insight into Middle Eastern affairs.

In June 2025, L’Orient-Le Jour became the first Lebanese media outlet — and one of the few in the Middle East — to receive the Journalism Trust Initiative (JTI) certification, developed by Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Modeled on an ISO standard, this certification serves as a mark of professionalism and transparency.

In 2020, the group launched its English-language sister publication, L’Orient Today, distributed digitally.

Founded in Beirut in 1929 by the poet Georges Schehadeh and taken over in 1955 by Salah Stetie, L’Orient Littéraire is the cultural supplement of L’Orient-Le Jour, covering all news related to books and literature in Lebanon. It showcases the best Lebanese and Arab voices writing in French, with Alexandre Najjar as editor-in-chief since 2006.

The L’Orient-Le Jour Group is fully independent, receiving no funding from political parties or governments. Revenues come from newspaper sales, subscriptions, partnerships, and advertising.

The Société Générale de Presse et d’Édition, a Lebanese public limited company, publishes L’Orient-Le Jour. Its shareholders are primarily the Edde family, the Helou family, the Choueiri Group, and the Pharaon Group. All shareholders are committed to upholding the integrity, independence, and editorial freedom of the newsroom.

Anyone under the age of 18 is strongly advised by children’s media safety and mental health organizations to stay away from popular artificial intelligence companions — social chatbots programmed to use human-like features and develop human-AI relationships.

Still, 72% of teens reported using AI companions at least once, according to a July survey by Common Sense Media, a research nonprofit that advocates for children’s online safety. More than half of teens also said they interacted with these platforms at least a few times a month.

Additionally, 1 in 3 teens said they’ve used AI companions “for social interaction and relationships, including role-playing, romantic interactions, emotional support, friendship, or conversation practice,” Common Sense Media found.

But parents and researchers are sounding the alarm that AI companions pose serious risks to children and teens, which can include intensifying mental health conditions like depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD and bipolar disorder.

Megan Garcia testified last week on the suicide death of her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, during a U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism hearing on the harm of AI chatbots. Setzer, she said, “spent his last months being manipulated and sexually groomed by chatbots designed by an AI company to seem human, to gain trust, and to keep children like him endlessly engaged by supplanting the actual human relationships in his life.”

Last fall, Garcia said she became the first person in the U.S. to sue an AI company in a wrongful death lawsuit as a result of her son’s passing. Garcia’s lawsuit against Character Technologies — the company behind the AI companion tool Character.AI, which her son used — is still pending in the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Florida Orlando Division. Other defendants in the case include the company’s founders and Google, which holds licensing rights for Character.AI.

Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission announced in September it is seeking information from seven tech companies regarding how their AI companion tools “measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.” Some of the companies involved in the FTC’s probe include Character Technologies, OpenAI, X, and Meta.

Notably, OpenAI, also announced it will begin implementing guardrails to better protect teen ChatGPT users this month, including new parental controls.

What can schools do?

The Jed Foundation, a nonprofit for youth suicide prevention that also warns against the use of AI companions among minors, recently penned an open letter to the AI and technology industry calling for it to “prioritize safety, privacy, and evidence-informed crisis intervention” for children and teens using their tools.

AI companions are “a serious issue,” said Laura Erickson-Schroth, chief medical officer at The Jed Foundation. “It’s really providing this kind of emotional support that isn’t coming from a human being, and it’s also providing incorrect guidance, frequently, to young people, giving them misinformation.”

As K-12 leaders navigate the prevalence of AI companions among their students, Erickson-Schroth recommends that they first develop an AI strategy districtwide in partnership with parents, students and community members. That should include conversations around ways certain AI tools may help or misinform users in schools and address concerns around student data privacy and data security, she said.

When it comes to the use of AI-based mental health tools in schools, Erickson-Schroth stressed that the technology “should always augment and not replace the caring adults in a young person’s life.”

Some promising AI tools can be useful for supporting student mental health, she said, such as personalized AI apps for meditation, mood tracking or gamified experiences that promote self-care. Some AI tools can even supplement therapy to help young people develop cognitive behavioral therapy skills.

However, she said, “when you think about young people engaging with emotionally responsive AI by themselves — without any structure around it — that’s when I think it gets really scary, because young people’s brains are still developing.”

Digital literacy programs are also key for addressing this challenge, Erickson-Schroth said. That can include classroom lessons that allow students to act as detectives regarding these AI tools.

It’s important to ask them questions about how they use AI and where they think these systems get their information, she said. Other questions could include asking students to explore the ways in which AI is most likely to be wrong.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JkbV_h7Jd9EsgKEfO74cnxYS7DvgOoTZzBgh5gLfim4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTQ2MjIzNDYyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-25 20:11:02.414146

PALO ALTO, CA, UNITED STATES, September 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- For organizations choosing new notebooks for their teams, artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical consideration. As AI becomes a part of every business workflow, it’s more and more critical to invest in devices that can handle on-device AI processing smoothly and quickly. Of course, notebooks still need to deliver good battery life and strong performance for everyday work applications, and depending on the industry, performance for resource-intensive and graphics-intensive apps may also be a consideration.

Principled Technologies (PT) compared an HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 processor to a Dell Pro 14 Plus laptop powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro and a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 laptop powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro. PT found that the HP system delivered advantages in a number of areas, including multitasking performance and AI performance. The PT report covers these results and what they mean, as well as looking at privacy protection, thermal performance, serviceability, battery life, and more.

According to the report, “For the demands of next-gen workloads, your teams need a system

and processor designed to handle AI and other rising applications. Delivering high performance scores, a workday’s worth of battery life, and comfortable physical user experiences, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC we tested also featured quickly serviceable components, a helpful built-in AI assistant, and intelligent privacy features. Compared to a Dell Pro 14 Plus and a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, each powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro, the AMD Ryzen™ AI 7 PRO 350 processor-powered HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC is a powerful and performant choice for the AI era.”

Meghan Markle made a sparkling statement at a charity event in Santa Barbara this weekend, debuting a dazzling new piece from her go-to jeweler, Logan Hollowell.

The Duchess of Sussex, 44, wore the 14-karat gold Queen Water Drop Moonstone Ring, which features a pear-shaped moonstone surrounded by a halo of white diamonds and retails for $4,195.

Her choice to wear a ring named “Queen” wasn’t lost on royal watchers, especially given her complicated relationship with her official title. Since stepping back from royal duties in 2020, the Duchess has carefully curated her public image — and her jewelry choices often speak volumes.

The piece may also carry a symbolic tribute to Harry’s late mother — moonstone is associated with the goddess Diana, as noted on the jewelry brand’s website.

For the charity event, Markle paired the diamond sparkler with a Carolina Herrera navy sleeveless button-down dress ($2,490) cinched at the waist and caramel leather Ralph Lauren Tenney pumps, letting her jewelry take center stage. She added her Cartier Tank Française watch, stacked with her signature Cartier Love bracelet and finished the look with a Jennifer Meyer mini-bezel tennis bracelet.

The ring — which Markle wore to Kevin Costner’s One805LIVE! charity concert — marks the latest addition to her growing Logan Hollowell collection. The mother of two has been a longtime fan of the Los Angeles-based brand, frequently sporting its celestial-inspired pieces.

Most notably, she has worn the brand’s constellation necklaces representing her children Archie and Lilibet during several public appearances, including her 2021 birthday announcement of her 40×40 mentorship program.

This January, the actress and businesswoman returned to Instagram after a five-year hiatus with a new profile photo in which she wears her Logan Hollowell diamond tennis necklace ($26,995).

Capital Rx markets itself as a transparent PBM, meaning discounts it receives from pharma manufacturers for favorable placement of a drug on a health plan's formulary are passed onto employer and plan clients. For context, the “Big 3” PBMs (CVS Health’s Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx) have long been accused of engaging in spread pricing and rebate holding for profit.

Zooming out: The Big 3 PBMs control ~80% of the market. They’ve gained significant influence over prescription drug costs and patient access to medications due to their vertical integration with major health insurers. This has allowed the Big 3 to create drug benefit contracts that are often intentionally complex and contain opaque clauses, making it difficult for employer customers to understand their true costs and savings.

Yes, but: As healthcare and prescription drug spending keep rising for self-insured employers and their workers, businesses are increasingly jumping from one of the Big 3 to a newer PBM that promises pricing transparency and a greater share of rebates.

That’s due, in large part, to shifting federal guidelines that have narrowed the pool of people who are eligible for this year’s COVID-19 vaccine. In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines, but limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain health problems. Previous booster shots had been recommended for everyone six months of age and older.

CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

Last week, a top vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also voted to change the recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine to allow individuals over six months of age to access the vaccine after discussing their options with a health care provider, though the panel fell short of issuing a blanket recommendation. The panel also rejected a proposal to require a prescription to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

The new recommendations must now be formally approved by the acting CDC director before they can take effect.

In some states, top officials have implemented new policies to ensure that residents can access COVID-19 shots. But Georgia has so far been slower to respond to the changing guidelines.

Ahead of last week’s ACIP meeting, the state’s Department of Public Health announced that it would be halting distribution of the newest version of the COVID-19 vaccine to local health departments until after the federal panel issued its annual recommendations. On Monday, DPH spokesperson Nancy Nydam Shirek said that the agency is holding off on issuing statements until the CDC officially approves the recommendations.

Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at my local pharmacy?

In the U.S., pharmacies — rather than doctor’s offices — have increasingly become the venue where many Americans seek common vaccines like those for the flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV.

Part of the reason for that is convenience, according to Ashley Chinchilla, who works as the associate director of the Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences program at the University of Georgia’s College of Pharmacy.

“Pharmacies tend to have a little more flexible hours than a lot of other locations that offer vaccines,” Chinchilla said. “We tend to be open a little bit later. A lot of them have at least some weekend hours, and so for people who are working full time, it’s sometimes a little bit easier to get to a pharmacy than to another location.”

In Georgia, pharmacists can typically administer vaccines as long as they have an agreement with a supervising doctor, which most pharmacies do. But, Chinchilla added, “the state law that allows pharmacists the authority to administer vaccines under protocol without a prescription is tied to the ACIP recommendation.”

That means pharmacists practicing in Georgia are unable to administer an updated COVID-19 vaccine until the CDC formally approves the recommendations, and as a result, many pharmacies are still requiring a prescription for anyone seeking the vaccine.

At CVS, Georgia is one of five states where prescriptions are still required before pharmacists can administer a shot. Florida, Louisiana, Utah, West Virginia and the District of Columbia also require residents to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine prescription.

“Once the CDC approves ACIP’s recommendations, we’ll be able to offer the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines — without a prescription — in these states,” said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault.

Walgreens, which is offering updated COVID-19 shots in every state except Georgia, Louisiana, Utah, and the District of Columbia, said that it is also waiting for the CDC director to adopt ACIP’s updated recommendations before their pharmacists can administer the vaccine.

“Once that happens, Walgreens will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide, including in Georgia, to individuals three years and older, no prescription required,” Walgreens spokesperson Brigid Sweeney said.

Representatives for Kroger and Publix, which also operate in-store pharmacies, did not reply to requests for comment.

Where can I access the COVID-19 vaccine in my area?

Dr. Joanna Dolgoff, a pediatrician based in Hiram and a member of the Georgia chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that shifting policies on vaccine access have caused confusion among many of her patients over access to the vaccine.

“I think parents are very confused about what’s going on with the COVID vaccine,” she said. “They’re hearing all different things. They don’t really know what to believe. So I think there’s a lot of confusion out there.”

Her advice for parents and others who are seeking a COVID-19 vaccine is to check with their local primary care provider to get the most up-to-date and accurate information.

“Talk to your doctor, make sure that you will have access to the COVID vaccine,” Dolgoff said. “Find out where, locally, that vaccine is being offered, so that you go to the right place.”

Dr. Cecil Bennett, a family medicine doctor based in Newnan, said his office will be following recommendations from organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians, which advises everyone six months of age and older to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. He also urged patients to follow the advice of reputable, science-based organizations.

“The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, are dependable organizations that are not a part of the political spectrum,” he said. “CDC, NIH, FDA have proven to be political entities and no longer scientific and dependable entities. So patients should rely on their doctors more now for proper advice and not listen to what they hear on television from political bodies.”

I don’t have a primary care provider. Can I still get a COVID-19 vaccine?

If you don’t have a primary care provider, you’re not alone. Georgia has broad primary care provider shortages across most of the state, impacting all but three of its 159 counties.

If the ACIP recommendations are approved by the CDC’s acting director, Georgia residents will likely be able to access COVID-19 shots at their local pharmacy without needing a prescription. But until that happens, residents may be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19 at retail clinics, which are typically operated out of grocery stores, pharmacies, and other retail establishments.

Common retail clinics include CVS’ MinuteClinics and Kroger’s The Little Clinic, which offer scheduled appointments as well as walk-in visits.

Thibault, the CVS spokesperson, said that MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and therefore “are not subject to the same rules that apply to [a] pharmacy and do not require a prescription from patients to be able to administer the vaccine.”

Humana is being required to cover more than $32 million in attorneys’ fees following its $90 million settlement of a federal False Claims Act case, even as a looming appellate challenge raises questions about the future of whistleblower litigation in the United States.

The lawsuit, filed in 2016, alleged that between 2011 and 2017 Humana deliberately inflated the bids it submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). By overstating its projected costs, the complaint argued, Humana secured more favorable terms for its contracts, ultimately leading to substantial overcharges to the government. “This is the first case of its kind to resolve allegations of fraud in the Part D contracting process,” Phillips & Cohen said in a statement at the time of settlement.

Humana did not admit liability in the agreement and maintained it had complied with federal rules. The company said it chose to resolve the matter to avoid the expense and uncertainty of prolonged litigation.

Chief U.S. District Judge Greg Stivers in Louisville, Kentucky, ruled this month that the insurer must pay legal fees and costs to the lawyers for Steven Scott, a former Humana actuary whose allegations of Medicare Part D fraud were resolved last year. “The first case of its kind to resolve allegations of fraud in the Part D contracting process,” Scott’s counsel, Phillips & Cohen, said previously in a statement about the settlement.

Scott was represented by Kellogg Hansen and Phillips & Cohen. His share of the recovery amounted to nearly $26.1 million, equivalent to 29 percent of the government’s settlement, according to court filings. Attorneys argued they were entitled to fees above the $10.44 million Scott had already paid them under a contingency arrangement. While Stivers permitted substantial additional recovery, he rejected a larger request for $41 million, finding that “shockingly high” rates could not be justified for Kentucky, though he agreed to apply higher national benchmarks according to Reuters.

The fee order comes as the False Claims Act’s “qui tam” provisions face their most serious constitutional test in decades. Last year, U.S. District Judge Kathryn Mizelle in Florida ruled that allowing private citizens to litigate on the government’s behalf amounted to an improper delegation of executive authority. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has urged the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold Mizelle’s finding. The Justice Department, by contrast, has defended the law. Oral arguments are expected in December.

The outcome matters not only for insurers but for all sectors reliant on federal reimbursement. In 2023 alone, whistleblowers initiated 979 suits under the statute, producing $2.4 billion in settlements and judgments, according to the Justice Department.

Whistleblowers typically receive between 15 and 25 percent of recoveries when the government intervenes, and up to 30 percent if it declines. In Scott’s case, the government chose not to intervene, giving him the right to a larger share.

A volatile landscape for health insurers

Humana’s exposure mirrors wider industry vulnerability. In July, Omnicare, a CVS Health subsidiary, was ordered to pay nearly $949 million in damages for allegedly billing Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for invalid prescriptions. The unit has since filed for bankruptcy protection. “Given that ruling and a number of other issues facing our business, we now are taking necessary steps to move forward and ensure the continued delivery of safe and reliable pharmacy service to our customers,” said Omnicare President David Azzolina.

For insurers active in Medicare and Medicaid markets, these developments illustrate both the financial stakes and the regulatory uncertainty surrounding federal reimbursement. Should the 11th Circuit limit or strike down the False Claims Act’s qui tam provisions, the enforcement landscape would be transformed – reducing exposure to whistleblower suits but potentially inviting other forms of government oversight.

For now, the Humana decision ensures a significant payday for the whistleblower’s lawyers, while the larger question of the statute’s constitutionality remains unsettled.

A strong focus on health equity and cultural safety in surgery has seen Dr Jamie-Lee Rahiri (Ngāti Porou, Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara, Te Ātihaunui-a-Pāpārangi) named the L’Oréal–UNESCO For Women in Science Fellow for Aotearoa New Zealand in 2025.

Rahiri has had a stellar rise as an early-career clinical researcher at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland, focused on understanding and addressing health inequities among Māori.

Currently a third-year general surgery trainee at North Shore Hospital, the senior research fellow has been recognised for improving surgical care for Māori patients and inspiring the next generation of wāhine Māori into surgery.

“My research seeks to embed equity, and improve the cultural safety and effectiveness of surgical care pathways in Aotearoa,” Rahiri says.

Earlier, Rahiri worked with South Auckland communities to improve outcomes for Māori patients after bariatric surgery.

Now, training to become a surgeon herself, is another way of leading culturally safe surgical care for whānau Māori.

“One of the projects that I'm leading right now, that's quite exciting, is centred on weight-loss outcomes after surgery. This is an area in Aotearoa, unfortunately, that is still growing in the sense that it urgently needs compassion, surgical excellence and equity embedded within its delivery,” says Rahiri.

Rahiri is the only New Zealander and one of four across Australasia to win the regional section of the prestigious international awards.

The win comes hot on the tail of her winning the John Corboy Medal, the highest honour for a surgical trainee from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.

Rahiri’s PhD, Exploring Māori Experiences of Bariatric Surgery, uses a kaupapa Māori approach to redesign surgical pathways, ensuring care is equitable and culturally safe.

In 2024, she won an early career excellence award from the University of Auckland.

Rahiri is the founder of Te Piringa Kōtuku – a Kaupapa Māori Surgical and Primary Health Research Institute and a pioneer of initiatives including Te Poka Pū – National Māori Surgical Interest Group to support and advance Māori into surgery.

“This Fellowship is not just recognition of my work – it acknowledges the communities, mentors, and whānau who have shaped me,” says Rahiri. “As a doctor, researcher, and mother of three daughters, I want my girls to know they can stand tall in any space they choose. And it reminds me that the work to transform surgery for Aotearoa is only just beginning.”

The L’Oréal–UNESCO For Women in Science Fellowship programme, now in its eighteenth year in Australia and New Zealand, champions equality and visibility of women in STEMM. Each Fellow receives $25,000 to further their research, with flexibility to use the funding in ways that matter most to them.

Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences deputy dean Professor Matire Harwood, who received the same fellowship in 2017, says she’s over the moon that Jamie-Lee has received the award, which will help her continue to create meaningful medical outcomes for Māori.

“She’s an amazing researcher and clinician who always gives to her community, as well as an amazing mum and partner,” Harwood says.

Alex Davison, chief executive officer at L’Oréal Australia & New Zealand, says:

""This Fellowship is more than an award; it’s an intergenerational commitment to help women overcome systemic barriers, build leadership skills, and inspire the next generation of scientists.

“With the recent international expansion of Foundation L’Oréal’s For Girls in Science programme and the rollout of UNESCO’s ‘Imagine a World with More Women in Science’ campaign, we’re seeing increased global demand for initiatives that elevate female voices in science.

“This is echoed through government policy. These programmes work together, recognising young girls inspired by science today who become the Fellows of tomorrow, and we are proud to echo these sentiments through our For Women in Science programme.""",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 17:13:25.150647

A handy, high-quality TV that slots into any room in your home

The picture on this Philips Smart TV looks good even if you’re sitting close. HD keeps text clear, and cartoons look bright and fun from a few feet away. Sports look good, without blurring, and older shows look clean. The edge around the screen is tight, so it blends in with shelves and stands instead of standing out too much.

Roku makes having a small TV simple. You can pin your go-to apps to the front page, continue watching shows right where you left off, and search to easily find where you can watch the next part. Free channels with ads are great for quiet afternoons, and you can block purchases and shows that are not suitable for kids. The phone app features the same buttons as the regular remote, along with a keyboard for logging in. Additionally, you can use headphones for private listening late at night.

The TV connects to everything you need. HDMI works for consoles and streaming devices, and ARC sends sound to a soundbar with one cord. A USB port allows you to view photos, and Wi-Fi connectivity is seamless. It’s lightweight, making it easy to mount, but it also comes with its own stand. Turn it on, select what you want to watch, and it remembers where you left off last time, so you don’t need to navigate through menus every time.

This small TV’s size is excellent for tight spaces and close couches. It gives kitchens a screen for recipes and news. Guest rooms get movies without needing a huge TV. And offices get dashboards that can switch to games on the weekend.

“There’s not enough capacity available in the United States or supply available in the United States,” Beekhuizen added.
So as a result, we have no choice but to import that key raw material for our product.” Dive Insight: Campbell’s has employed several mitigation strategies to offset tariff expenses, including collaborating with suppliers, finding alternative sources, employing productivity and cost savings efforts and price increases.
The food maker has found some success, particularly with its Rao’s brand of premium pasta sauce, by working with Italian suppliers to fight tariffs.
Campbell’s is also continuing to evaluate alternative sources for many of the goods it imports, including tinplate, but transitioning is a protracted process.","Dive Brief:

The Campbell’s Company said a lack of domestic supply of certain steel derivatives used for canning limits its ability to fully offset the impact of tariffs, according to CEO, President and Director Mick Beekhuizen.

The food giant expects to mitigate 60% of tariff costs in fiscal 2026, but over half of its projected tariff exposure is tied to Section 232 duties on steel and aluminum, said EVP and CFO Carrie Anderson on a Sept. 3 earnings call.

“There’s not enough capacity available in the United States or supply available in the United States,” Beekhuizen added. “If it was available, we would buy it locally. We’re not able to do that. So as a result, we have no choice but to import that key raw material for our product.”

Dive Insight:

Campbell’s has employed several mitigation strategies to offset tariff expenses, including collaborating with suppliers, finding alternative sources, employing productivity and cost savings efforts and price increases. However, the food company still expects tariff-driven expenses to reach about 4% of the costs of products sold in fiscal 2026, which began Aug. 4.

The food maker has found some success, particularly with its Rao’s brand of premium pasta sauce, by working with Italian suppliers to fight tariffs.

“We have some flexibility with some production in Georgia, and we’re working with the co-manufacturer on that with our partner in Italy,” Beekhuizen said on the Sept. 3 earnings call. “However, there is also only so much we can do around that.”

While some levers exist for certain goods, limited tinplate capacity poses a larger challenge which could drive price hikes and financial strain, particularly for Campbell’s meal and beverage business, executives said.

“We’re limited to where we can source tinplate. And as a result, we do have to look at some surgical price increases, and so that’s built into our plan as well,” Anderson said at Barclays 18th Annual Global Consumer Staples Conference 2025 on Sept. 4.

Campbell’s is also continuing to evaluate alternative sources for many of the goods it imports, including tinplate, but transitioning is a protracted process.

“So sometimes that’s taking a little bit longer, particularly if you want to switch suppliers because we want to make sure that we maintain the quality of our product and maintain that consumer proposition,” Beekhuizen said on the Sept. 3 earnings call.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/c3rUzDpz9qUOQmE4Io31GxTQEn2MJZVNivukcgasEBE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE4MzA5NTIzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-25 16:11:28.149460

So far in two games this season, Fields is 19-of-33 passing for 245 yards with 1 TD and 0 INT.","QB Justin Fields is set for a non-contact practice on Thursday, though HC Aaron Glenn said that the Jets' starter remains in the concussion protocol.

""So again, he still has to go through the whole protocol before he's totally cleared,"" Glenn told reporters ahead of Monday night's game at Miami. ""But I like where he's at.""

If Fields, who sustained a concussion on a hit by Joey Bosa in the Week 2 game against Buffalo, is deemed recovered from the head injury Glenn said: ""If he's cleared, he's starting.""

If Fields isn't ready, Tyrod Taylor would again lead the Green & White offense as he did last week at Tampa Bay.

The last time Fields played against Miami, he authored an epic performance.

It was during the 2022 season when the Dolphins visited Chicago's Soldier Field and Fields, in his only game against Miami in his four-year NFL career, was calling signals for the Bears. In that game he rushed for 178 yards — including a highlight-reel 61-yard touchdown — on 15 carries and threw for 3 TDs while posting a 106.7 passer rating. He accounted for the Bears' 10 longest plays from scrimmage in that game with runs of 61, 17, 17, 14, 13 and 12 yards and passes of 18, 16, 12 and 12 yards

His rushing total in the game set an NFL record for rushing yards by a quarterback in a regular-season game, surpassing the 173 yards by Michael Vick on Dec. 1, 2002 in an overtime win over the Vikings. Fields also became the first player in league history to rush for at least 140 yards and throw 3 or more TD passes in a game since at least 1950.

So far in two games this season, Fields is 19-of-33 passing for 245 yards with 1 TD and 0 INT. He has carried the ball 17 times for 97 yards (5.7 per carry), including a long gain of 33 yards, with a pair of TDs, 7 first downs while averaging 48.5 yards a game rushing.

In the past two games the Jets were forced to play from behind and last week scored 21 points in a furious fourth-quarter rally against the Bucs.

""We have to start fast,"" Glenn said, no matter if it's Fields or Taylor at quarterback. ""And another thing, what we talked about today, man, we have to have a high level of execution, and that's in all three phases, the offense, defense and special teams. Now we have to run the ball better. Listen, I know we were going against three really good teams that we played, but that doesn't matter to me.

""I have an expectation of this team on how we operate, and I'm not going to stand down from that, and our guys won't stand down from that. And they know for a fact that we have to prove it in those areas, we have to get our running game going, which opens up our passing game. We all know that, and we want to make sure we execute at a high level all three phases.""

Glenn and the Jets are also dealing with injuries to other players. LBs Quincy Williams (shoulder) and Marcelino McCrary-Ball (hamstring) have been placed on injured reserve and ""will be out a while,"" Glenn said. He said that edge Jermaine Johnson (ankle) and newly acquired CB Jarvis Brownlee Jr. (ankle) are week-to-week. RB Kene Nwangwu (hamstring), WR Josh Reynolds (hamstring), DT Jay Tufele (illness) and S Tony Adams (hip) all returned to practice.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/sxs1vdtij8vs8d5plznq,N,,2025-09-25 16:11:18.242778

Even as emissions regulations tighten across Europe, the company has somehow managed to squeeze more power and efficiency out of one of its 3.0-liter engines. While EVs may be the future, the Bavarians have shown there’s still plenty of life left in internal combustion engines.

More Power, Fewer Emissions

The uprated 3.0-liter powertrain will be introduced to the M340i xDrive Sedan and M340i xDrive Touring in Europe starting this autumn. When working in conjunction with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, the engine now pumps out 387 hp and 398 lb-ft (540 Nm). These figures represent gains of 18 hp and 30 lb-ft (40 Nm) over the current version of the same engine in European specification.

This new powertrain will be added to the M440i xDrive Coupe, M440i xDrive Convertible, and the M440i xDrive Gran Coupe. Additionally, the M240i xDrive Coupe now comes standard with the more powerful six-cylinder as well.

Thanks to the extra grunt, BMW has been able to shave off 0.1 seconds from each model’s 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time. Perhaps more impressive are the improvements in fuel efficiency. In the case of the M240i xDrive Coupe, BMW says that fuel consumption has been reduced to 8.0 l/100 km (29.4 US mpg) over the previous engine’s 8.7-8.8 liters/100 km (26 US mpg) on the combined WLTP cycle. At the same time, CO2 emissions have also been cut from 199-200g/km to 183g/km.

BMW 3-Series and 4-Series models with the same engine are even more efficient. The M340i xDrive Sedan sips 7.5 l/100 km (31.3 US mpg) while the Touring is rated at 7.9 l/100 km (29.7 US mpg). The M440i xDrive Coupe, Convertible, and Gran Coupe are rated at 7.7 l/100 km, 7.7 l/100 km, and 7.8 l/100 km (30.5 – 30.1 US mpg), respectively.

It’s worth noting that the North American-spec M340i has already been delivering these figures since last year.

As a kid in Seattle, New York Fashion week felt like a far away land, completely out of my reach.
When we get to the Ralph’s Club New York event, I’m struck by the ambiance they’ve curated for the night.
Usher Talks Ralph’s Club New York Where do you wear your Ralph’s Club NY?
Shooting the Ralph’s Club New York campaign was an incredible experience, truly a masterclass in collaboration and vision.","I wake up during fashion week the same way I wake up every morning: later than I said I would, a much needed iced-coffee quickly in hand, listening to NPR on my phone. On paper it’s a typical morning, but internally I’m waking up with a rising ball of anxiety in my chest (a larger one than is normal before I’ve taken my daily Wellbutrin). It’s my first fashion week and I get to do it as an editor at i-D, a childhood dream come true.

I can’t help but fear that the “I’ve never done this before” of it all might be radiating off of me. I’m hoping a couple sprays of Ralph’s Club New York, Ralph Lauren’s newest fragrance adding the perfect touch of masculine intrigue to my aura for the day, and a good pair of sunglasses, will mask the nerves. I’m feeling the need to pinch myself as I get ready, it’s as if I’m in my very own fairytale, only this time the princess is riding the subway and femme-ing it up for the day in what feels like light drag. In all honesty I have hardly any idea what to expect, they didn’t cover “how to behave at a fashion show” in my degree but, as always, I’m eager to learn. As a kid in Seattle, New York Fashion week felt like a far away land, completely out of my reach. Now, it’s my job.

My first event of the day is the Anna Sui show, which she’s holding at the iconic Chelsea Hotel. Anna is a staple of Girl World and I’m lucky enough to be attending the show wearing pieces from her Fall Winter 2025 collection (a particularly exciting moment for a newbie like me). As I’m walking up to the hotel, the cameras are flashing and I’m reminding myself in my head that I actually am supposed to be here. I do my best to contain myself as I walk through the doors to see a copy of Anna’s new book, “The Nineties,” on each seat. I make notes of the soundtrack as I’m currently in the process of curating my music for the season.

After a fabulous show, some exciting celeb spottings (hi Sofia Coppola!), and a visit with my fellow i-Diva Nicolaia, I’m headed back downtown. My friend Ryan’s brand Saturn Los Angeles is part of an Epōc studios Discovered Brand streetwear pop-up so I make a stop in the village to say hi and check out the clothes. Before I know it I’m skipping happy hour to head home to catch up on our fashion week content for socials and get ready for the Ralph’s Club event.

Tonight, Ralph Lauren Fragrances are bringing some of New York’s finest to the financial district’s Hall des Lumiéres, in the old Emigrant Savings Bank Building, to launch the Ralph’s Club New York fragrance with the face of its campaign, Usher. Being the paramount fixture of American luxury, I’m expecting Ralph Lauren to draw many of the city’s premier gentlemen. As such, I’m feeling extra pressure to put my best foot (and look) forward. The fragrance itself is juicy, bursting with blackcurrant and sandalwood providing the perfect masculine finishing touch to balance out my glam for the night.

On the train to the party, I look back on the past few years of my life with my best friend (who also happens to be my +1). We lived together for an intern spring and summer just three years ago, and now we’re both in the city full time with big girl jobs. In just a matter of months I went from an anxious student who didn’t know what was coming next, to a (still anxious) editor at my dream magazine. After years of hard work, building up my portfolio and experience at my school’s student fashion magazine, this is my life! Three months in, I’m still waiting for it to feel real.

When we get to the Ralph’s Club New York event, I’m struck by the ambiance they’ve curated for the night. The atmosphere perfectly complements the seductive fragrance. Though I’m wearing some of my favorite heels and jewelry, I feel like I’m walking into a proper gentlemen’s club, suited for any and all with exquisite taste. The venue is breathtaking, it smells like Ralph’s Club New York and champagne, there’s Stevie Wonder playing, and I’m feeling like a bona fide gent. We take a lap, say hi to friends and colleagues, and sample the fragrance on an art-deco cardstock diamond from a sleek metal tray—all handled by white-gloved attendants. A little while later, Usher arrives to greet the crowd and join the party. With a drink in one hand and a mic in the other, he stands above the party to share some words on the enchanting glamor of New York—which has been distilled into a bottle and labeled Ralph’s Club New York.

After a very long day, we make a stop for pizza on our way home to keep me from getting too hangrumpy (my personal alternative to hangry). I’m ready for some sleep and a little time to unwind and feel deeply impressed by my colleagues whose fashion month continues into Europe (I’m grateful to be opening and closing with New York for my first time around). As the week goes on, I can’t help but feel like my favorite Lebron meme: smiling through it all, can’t believe that this is my life.

Usher Talks Ralph’s Club New York

Where do you wear your Ralph’s Club NY?

Usher: Ralph’s Club New York has become a true signature for me. It’s the kind of fragrance you reach for when you want to make an authentic statement, without saying a word. It is perfect for a night out, whether that’s a quiet dinner in the city or an evening connecting with friends. It just has that magnetic quality that elevates any occasion.

What are your favorite smells?

Scent is powerful. For me, I gravitate towards things that have a dynamic opening – a real vibrant energy, like a juicy fruit. And then it needs to evolve into something smooth, warm, and sophisticated, like a rich wood or a creamy vanilla. That’s why Ralph’s Club New York truly resonates with me. It has that distinctive blackcurrant that gives you that initial bright hit, and then it settles into that perfect blend of bourbon vanilla and sandalwood, which is just pure class.

Tell me about shooting the campaign. Any fun stories from set?

Shooting the Ralph’s Club New York campaign was an incredible experience, truly a masterclass in collaboration and vision. The energy on set was palpable, and everyone – from the creative team to the crew – was focused on capturing the essence of the fragrance.

Do you remember the first time you listened to Frank Sinatra?

Absolutely. It wasn’t just a listening; it was an awakening. There was such a command in his voice, an effortless cool, and a storytelling ability that just drew you in. It was pure sophistication, a master at work. He shaped the landscape for so many artists who came after him, and his influence is still felt today.

Talk to me about adapting such a classic. What are your favorite versions?

Adapting a classic, whether it’s a song or a concept, is about paying homage to the original while finding your own truth within it. It requires deep respect for the foundation but also the courage to bring a fresh perspective. My favorite versions are always those where an artist understands the core of what made the original timeless, but then infuses it with their unique voice, allowing it to resonate with a new generation without losing its soul.

The campaign is all about experiencing a side of New York that’s both old and totally contemporary. You’ve lived in so many places, do you see yourself as a New Yorker?

New York has a spirit unlike anywhere else. It’s a city that constantly reinvents itself, yet always holds onto its incredible history and cultural depth. While I haven’t spent my entire life here, I’ve certainly experienced its transformative power. The energy, the diversity, the relentless pursuit of greatness – it’s infectious.",https://i-d.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/RLF02_3d5192.png,N,,2025-09-25 15:14:44.032664

Top Democrats unloaded on the White House for turning up the pressure in Washington’s funding standoff, instructing agencies to prepare for mass layoffs if Congress fails to pass a spending bill by Oct. 1.

In a memo from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), seen by Politico and published in full by Puck, the administration signaled it is prepared to go further than the usual furloughs seen in past shutdowns.

“RIF notices will be in addition to any furlough notices provided due to the lapse in appropriation,” the document states, using the government’s term for a “reduction in force.”

The directive also warned that “programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown,” casting blame on Democrats for risking job losses.

Democratic congressional leaders responded by accusing the White House of weaponizing federal employment to pressure the opposition.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries went further, directly attacking OMB director Russell Vought as a “malignant political hack.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer protested that the tactics were “nothing new” and warned any firings would be challenged in court.

“This is an attempt at intimidation,” he said. “Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one — not to govern, but to scare. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government. These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uR0BjIJZfr4gkgynK6iL8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mediaite_845/2615b2366afc49c5584141e990f6e0f1,N,,2025-09-25 19:10:19.730429

Should You Invest $1,000 in CVS Health Right Now?
Before you consider CVS Health, you'll want to hear this.
MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and CVS Health wasn't on the list.
While CVS Health currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","One of the best ways for any investor to lock in additional portfolio upside is to start exploring areas where few others are willing to venture, especially when those are the least popular ones in the entire market.

In the consumer staples sector, one company (usually a quiet one) is starting to break into new 52-week highs. This theme is likely to continue.

Shares of CVS Health Corp. NYSE: CVS are now one of the hottest performers in the industry, especially as its market share has directly increased from the decreased footprint seen in its closest competitor, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. NASDAQ: WBA, a company that has been closing more and more physical locations each quarter.

That open field ahead could be one reason markets have become bullish on CVS, but that’s not all.

That's what investors dig deeper into the company's finances to consider where those could expand in the coming quarters. Today’s bullish section seems to be merely a shadow of the future potential this company can offer.

More than that, steady and predictable companies like CVS will probably become preferred now that the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has called the stock market a “Highly valued ""asset.

Newfound"" Optimism for CVS Stock

This $96.8 billion company has a wide road ahead of it in terms of size expansion, and its new 52-week high price could be the market pricing in this simple fact. More than just a 70.1% rally on a year-to-date basis, there are other fundamental reasons why CVS is going to be a winner for all its shareholders.

Shareholders, including Ameriprise Financial, increased their holdings by 5.2% as of August 2025, bringing their stake to a new high of $565.4 million as of today. As bullish as this may seem, this latest addition was only a shadow of the overall $3.3 billion in institutional buying of CVS stock that took place over the past quarter alone.

There must be a reason deeper than just technical momentum to explain why all this new optimism has been coming into CVS. This one must be coming from the financials themselves, especially as Barclays analyst Andrew Mok raised his price target on CVS stock to a new high of $87 per share, implying 14% additional upside and a new 52-week high.

That being said, this view is significantly higher than the consensus target of only $78.25 per share for CVS. This isn’t where the benefits end, however.

Strong Financials Boost Shareholder Confidence

Management knows that this expanding market share, following the competition’s de-competition, presents an opportunity to reward shareholders willing to stick by CVS through thick and thin. This is why the stock now pays $2.66 in dividends, translating to an annualized yield of 3.5% to beat inflation rates in the United States.

Here’s how to make sense of all this bullishness going on around CVS today.

As of the company’s latest quarter, which reported a net earnings per share (EPS) of $1.81, 24% above the MarketBeat consensus of $1.46, the stage has been set for an unexpected streak of financial outperformance ahead.

In the company’s press release, investors will see the leading key performance indicators (KPIs), such as net revenues reported at $98.9 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 8.4%. This is no easy task for a company operating in one of the economy's most traditional (and relatively steady) areas.

Not only did revenue increase from last year, but efficiencies also improved. Not many people know that CVS has strong connections to government health programs, which directly benefit the company in medicine and service inflation (which has been high over the past 12 months).

This direct aid has enabled CVS to reinvest in technology efficiencies, resulting in a smoother connection between caregivers and patients, which reinforces the strength of its expanding market share. The question now is whether these reinvestments are being made in good faith, particularly the shareholder dividend program.

Investors can answer this by examining the cash flow statement, measuring whether free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) is increasing in line with the rest of the company's finances. With $185.1 billion in free cash flow, CVS has more than enough room to keep affording (and expanding) its dividend program moving forward.

All these investments and government aid will likely send CVS into another earnings beat in the coming quarters, where investors can lock in new upside opportunities for their portfolios in a less crowded stock than the other hot names in the market today.

(part 2) | The Drum,Oscar Quine,,,,,https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/09/25/what-do-you-need-do-make-sure-your-brand-ai-ready-part-2,"Here are the strategies, opportunities, and challenges you should consider to ensure your brand is ready for this brave, new, LLM-enabled future.
Content categorization, taxonomies, FAQs, transcripts, tables and multimodal assets all help AI parse your content and trust your brand.
As AI tools favor authoritative, high-quality sources (think major news outlets and official websites), it’s crucial to keep brand information accurate, consistent and up to date across credible channels.
“The relationship between AI search tools and digital media outlets is not a balanced one.
And the more your brand is cited in reputable, locally relevant sources, the more confidently AI tools will surface you in their answers.","From virtual assistants to voice-led discovery, the way consumers find what they want is changing. Here are the strategies, opportunities, and challenges you should consider to ensure your brand is ready for this brave, new, LLM-enabled future.

Annaleis Montgomery, SEO account director, Tug Agency: “Appearing in AIOs, LLMs, AI Mode and social search all feed into each other and are all based on your website and how crawlers see the website as an entity. To optimize your content for search, it still needs to be website first; brand messaging is consistent, content is helpful and relevant and this is then demonstrated and reiterated across trusted and primary sources (and your social media platforms). Linking to or from these sources is vital in building your site as a trusted entity and one that LLMs are likely to advocate for.

“Creating topical authority still stands, but has evolved into understanding your audience and what prompts they are searching for. We are leaning away from individual keyword improvement to a cluster of terms or prompts that your website is satisfying. Leveraging AI measurement tools can also help you identify gaps in misunderstanding or opportunities for content creation.”

Anisha Kshetrapal, performance marketing consultant, Rika: “It’s already well-established that AI-driven search is shaping consumer behavior at scale, with Bain and Company estimating that about 80% of consumers rely on generative agents for at least 40% of their searches. Yet, many brands and their tech teams haven’t updated their digital properties or strategies to keep pace.

“At Rika, we began this journey with our clients over 18 months ago and one standout success is De’Longhi, spotlighted by OpenAI in a recent press release for the launch of the product recommendation feature.

“So, how can you replicate that? We’ve identified three pillars that make the difference. Firstly, content structure. AI rewards depth and clarity. Brands need to move beyond keyword tactics and build content that answers real questions with authority. EEAT principles (experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness) are central. Content categorization, taxonomies, FAQs, transcripts, tables and multimodal assets all help AI parse your content and trust your brand.

“Secondly, technical fundamentals. An API-first CMS, site speed, UX (great frontend) and schema markup are as important as ever. In the answer-engine era, they decide whether AI can crawl, contextualize and interpret your content. And thirdly, brand strategy. The more a brand is recognized and referenced, the more likely it is to be recommended. Above-the-line investment keeps you in the consideration set more than you know.”

Eli Ferrara, head of creative innovation, FCB Canada: “To win in the age of AI search, brands must go beyond traditional SEO and focus on shaping their narrative. AI models draw from both training data, which can be over a year old and largely outside of a brand’s control, and real-time web data, where brands do have some control. This is where the battleground lies. As AI tools favor authoritative, high-quality sources (think major news outlets and official websites), it’s crucial to keep brand information accurate, consistent and up to date across credible channels.

“Adding to the complexity, these models don’t always pull from the same sources, so ongoing monitoring matters. New tools now track how brands are represented across AI models, giving marketers a way to spot gaps and update content strategically. If you don’t shape the data around your brand, the AI will do it for you…and you may not like the result.”

Dennis Kirschner, CMO and co-founder, ShowHeroes Group: “To enhance their visibility in AI search results, brands should prioritize investing a significant portion of their marketing and communication budget into the open web. AI search tools primarily draw data and insights from premium publications on the open web. By focusing on these sources, brands can connect directly with the materials that inform AI overviews.

“The relationship between AI search tools and digital media outlets is not a balanced one. These tools extract data from publications, often with minimal compensation for the content creators. So, by investing more in the open web, brands not only improve their search visibility but also support digital publications and their high-quality editorial output, contributing to the long-term viability of the digital publishing industry.”

Jonathan Hassell, CEO, Hassell Inclusion: “The same way that accessibility helps SEO, accessibility can help improve your standing in AI search. While the exact methods AI tools use to determine which sources to display remain unclear, making your content accessible significantly increases the chances of being recognized.

“Take video content; it’s one of the most consumer marketing formats, but AI struggles to summarize it without a clear transcript. Providing accurate transcripts not only ensures your brand and names are spelled right, it also helps AI interpret, trust and understand your video content.

“The more accessible and well-structured the information on your site, posts, or documents, the more confident AI will be in using them as reliable sources. If images need to be scanned to read the text in them, AI is less likely to select your content, making accessibility a crucial strategy for standing out in AI search results.”

Conor Wynne, creative technology director, Verve The Live Agency: “Since the get-go, SEO has spat out one-size-fits-all results: glossy pages stuffed with meta tags, often making it hard to find what you actually want. But the demographic raised on 5G and web3 know exactly what they’re after. They don’t just want an answer, they want their answer, shaped around taste, context and nuance.

“That’s why AI feels so natural in 2025. It’s not a pile of links; it’s a conversation. It can zoom out when you’re exploring something new, or dig deeper when you need detail. And now, after some bumps, it’s pulling from places that actually feel credible: licensed feeds alongside the messy brilliance of Reddit threads and communities. That blend of fact-checked reporting and human insight is a potent mix.

What fascinates me most is the (maybe unwarranted) trust we’re putting into AI. We trust it not because it’s always right, but because it feels more personal, like it gets what we actually mean, not just what we typed. That’s exactly how audiences approach live experiences, too. Generic doesn’t cut it any more. We expect things to be tuned to our world.”

Shannon Millard, vice-president, platform solutions, Epsilon: “People are drawn to the kind of curation AI seems to offer. Like asking a knowledgeable friend, they’re starting to expect much more specificity. It’s not ‘sports underwear’ any more, it’s ‘what underwear is good for running in the summer and stops chafing?’ That’s the sort of query that AIs are picking up and brands need to write for.

“Review your site, your app and how you show up on retailer pages so the product data is structured in a way that machines can make sense of. Adjust titles, product descriptions and metadata to genuinely answer questions. Natural language is what AI understands best, so use it. And don’t stop at describing what a product is, explain why it’s useful in different contexts, for different people, across different needs.

“But remember, search is just one touchpoint in a much bigger journey. People are still influenced by emails, shop experiences, TV placements and app connections. Brands that combine answers to specific, human questions with consistent visibility across channels will be best placed to keep customers coming back.”

Dane Buchanan, global chief data and analytics officer, M+C Saatchi Performance: “AI search is rewriting the rules of discovery. For over 25 years, Google has defined how people find your brand. Now LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Perplexity and Gemini, are competing to be the first stop for answers – and brands can’t afford to sit it out.

“There’s no rulebook yet, but three levers matter: what’s in an LLM’s training data (often 6–18 months old), how your brand appears on today’s live web and the context of a user’s prompt. While brands can’t control these directly, they can shape them.

“The winning move? Create content that works for humans and machines: clear, distinct and grounded in real consumer needs. Back it up with credible proof, make it crawlable and diversify formats – text, video, structured data, FAQs and reviews. Then track how you show up across platforms. Once you have a benchmark, test, optimize and repeat.

“Stop chasing keywords. Start building cultural and credible brand-led signals that AI can’t ignore.”

Lorraine van den Biggelaar, head of organic performance, Locaria: “In the AI search era, authority wins. A well-thought-out keyword mapping strategy is no longer good enough. We are no longer competing for keyword rankings on a page-by-page basis; we are competing to become a source for LLMs. And they’re looking at how your brand is presented as well as how it relates to every other source mentioning it. It’s no longer just about the overall structure and content of your site; it’s about contextual authority and consistency across everything that’s out there.

“That all sounds great, but how do you apply this to your brand strategy? And if you’re active in multiple languages and markets, how do you take control? A few tips. Firstly, publish fact-rich, credible content, ideally containing first-hand knowledge and information from recognized experts. For brands that are active in multiple markets, this means going beyond simple translation. You need native-language content shaped by local search habits, cultural nuance and region-specific terminology. And the more your brand is cited in reputable, locally relevant sources, the more confidently AI tools will surface you in their answers.

“And finally: practice patience. Establishing a reputation, especially across multiple markets, takes time and should be part of your long-term strategy, because meaningful authority isn’t built overnight.”

Cora Lin, VP analytics, Jack Morton: “AIO – or, as we like to call it, GEO (generative engine optimization) – might sound complex, but succeeding in AI search actually hinges on simplicity. Forget technical overhauls; focus on clear, human-friendly content.

“The key? Strong, well-structured content offering valuable, accessible information. Ensure high website usability with easy navigation for both users and AI. Provide clear context, using structured formats such as lists and headings. Minimize jargon and instead opt for concise, engaging language. After all, people use AI to distill complex information into direct answers. Brands can win by mirroring this: being direct and easy to understand from the outset.

“If you’re already prioritizing clear, structured content, you’re well-positioned for GEO. Test your content by summarizing it with an AI engine to ensure key takeaways are easily understood and align with your brand’s message. In the age of AI, simple and accessible wins.”",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/marten_newhall.jpg?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-09-25 16:11:42.982971

How Has the Digital Ad Spending Market Size Shifted in Recent Years?

The size of the digital advertising expenditure market has seen considerable increase over the past few years. It is projected to expand from $649.18 billion in 2024 to $709.65 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.3%.

The historic period's growth can be credited to factors such as higher internet usage, widespread use of mobile devices, the expansion of social media, advanced data analytics and target marketing, growth of e-commerce, and increased video content consumption.

This shift suggests increasing maturity in India’s commercial real estate investment landscape and growing comfort among domestic investors with large-scale commercial real estate exposure.","A domestic real estate fund has acquired a 2.4 million square foot office campus in Chennai from Singapore’s Keppel group for ₹2,550 crores, marking the largest transaction ever completed by an Indian fund in a commercial real estate sector traditionally dominated by international capital.

Prime Offices Fund (PRIME), managed by Nuvama and Cushman & Wakefield Management Private Limited (NCW), announced the acquisition of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum-certified campus located in Porur, Chennai. The transaction represents a complete buyout from Keppel’s real estate division and establishes a new benchmark for domestic institutional investment in India’s rapidly expanding office market.

Chennai is witnessing a surge in office space absorption, led by increased demand from Global Capability Centres (GCCs), Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) companies, with the city recording the second-largest absorption among metros after Bengaluru in the first half of 2025. The Porur campus serves a diversified tenant base comprising both global capability centers and domestic technology companies, positioning it strategically within Chennai’s most attractive office corridor.

NCW represents a 50:50 joint venture between Nuvama Asset Management Limited and global real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield. The Prime Offices Fund achieved its first close in January 2025 with a corpus of approximately ₹1,700 crores, making this Chennai acquisition its second major investment and demonstrating rapid deployment of capital in premium assets.

Gaurav Puri, Chief Investment Officer at NCW, described the acquisition as strong validation of their investment strategy. “Chennai continues to attract deep occupier interest, especially from GCCs, and Porur stands out as a micro-market with long-term fundamentals,” he stated, emphasizing the fund’s focus on sustainability, agility, and institutional-grade quality.

The transaction occurs against a backdrop of exceptional growth in India’s commercial real estate sector. The Indian Commercial Real Estate Market is expected to reach $49.30 billion in 2025 and grow at a compound annual growth rate of 21.10% to reach $128.40 billion by 2030, reflecting unprecedented investor confidence and occupier demand.

The first quarter of 2025 maintained strong momentum in the office market with large deal closures at a sustained pace amid robust fresh leasing activity, according to market analysis from Cushman & Wakefield. This momentum has particularly benefited Chennai, where institutional-grade developments with campus-style amenities command premium valuations.

The acquired asset offers institutional-grade infrastructure with excellent connectivity to key residential and commercial hubs, addressing the evolving requirements of global occupiers seeking sustainable, performance-driven office environments. The LEED Platinum certification aligns with increasing corporate emphasis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) compliance in real estate decisions.

Sustainability demand for green-certified office spaces is expected to rise by 20% in 2025 as tenants recognize the long-term benefits of energy-efficient, eco-friendly buildings, making the Chennai campus’s environmental credentials particularly valuable for long-term value creation.

The transaction reinforces Chennai’s emergence as a preferred destination for institutional real estate investment, benefiting from its established technology ecosystem and competitive operational costs compared to traditional markets like Bengaluru and the National Capital Region (NCR). Porur specifically has evolved into a micro-market with strong infrastructure development and occupier interest from multinational corporations.

For Keppel, the divestment represents part of broader portfolio optimization strategies as the Singapore-based conglomerate focuses on core business segments. The transaction multiple achieved reflects premium valuations for well-located, sustainably developed office assets in India’s tier-one markets.

PRIME’s investment philosophy centers on acquiring future-ready, sustainable, performance-led assets in strategic micro-markets that cater to evolving global occupier needs. The fund targets prime commercial office assets across key high-growth micro-markets throughout India, with particular emphasis on ESG-compliant developments serving blue-chip tenants.

The landmark deal demonstrates growing sophistication among domestic institutional investors and their ability to compete effectively against international capital pools for marquee assets. This shift suggests increasing maturity in India’s commercial real estate investment landscape and growing comfort among domestic investors with large-scale commercial real estate exposure.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-09-25 15:12:45.869203

The ""game-changing"" addition will be implemented in three New Jersey store locations.

On September 17, a ShopRite store in Clinton, New Jersey, announced the introduction of AI-powered shopping carts at the location.

Caper Cart, the carts being added to the chain, were developed by Instacart, a San Francisco-based company that operates delivery and pick-up services from grocery stores across the U.S. and Canada.

'IT'S THAT EASY'

The store said in a Facebook post that the cart automatically clips coupons for shoppers and shows the aisle location of items on sale in the store.

The cart can also scan and weigh items placed in it, providing consumers a running total for their shopping spree.

ShopRite shoppers can also experience a quicker checkout with these carts.

Customers can add a payment method to their Price Plus account, receive a one-time code to their phone and walk out of the priority exit near the first register.

""It's that easy!"" the retailer said.

The carts are equipped with a screen that displays prices to customers.

It also features a camera that helps recognize what products shoppers add to their cart.

The screen can also be used to select produce items which the cart can then weigh to add a total price to your list.

Two other ShopRite locations in New Jersey will receive Caper Carts.

The towns include Flemington and Greenwich Township, according to Lehigh Valley Live.

MyCentralJersey reported the Clinton and Flemington stores will have 30 AI-powered carts while the Greenwich location will have an additional 10.

""We’re excited to introduce Caper Carts to our ShopRite stores in Flemington, Clinton and Greenwich,"" Sam Colalillo, a ShopRite owner and third-generation grocer said, per MyCentralJersey.

""Our customers now have a smarter, faster way to shop, with tools to track spending, find savings and check out directly from the cart using a saved payment method.

""It’s a game-changer for convenience and we’re proud to bring this innovation to our stores.""

WHEEL IN

The Colalillo family operates additional ShopRite locations in Bethlehem and Yardley, Pennsylvania, where they have also rolled out Caper Carts.

Caper Carts can be found in nearly 100 cities across 15 states, the company said.

These carts have rolled out in other retailers like Kroger, where the program has been dubbed ""KroGo,"" and Wegmans. The carts can be found at Wegmans Dewitt in Syracuse, New York.

On September 25, Instacart announced a new savings feature for the carts.

The cart now has eligibility tracking for Electronic Benefits Transfer for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (EBT SNAP) items.

""Together, these new Caper features make it easier for customers to access savings, maximize their benefits, and stay on budget as they shop,"" the company said.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/09/JA_Grocery_Check_Out_OP.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-09-25 15:13:15.023727

The new score indicates the company is now outperforming 97% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.

It's best to wait for the stock to form a new pattern and breakout.

The stock earns a 97 EPS Rating, which means its recent quarterly and annual earnings growth tops 97% of all stocks.

Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D- shows moderate selling by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks. Look for the rating to improve to at least a C or better.

In Q1, the company reported 40% earnings growth. That marks two straight reports with rising EPS growth. Top line growth increased 14%, up from 8% in the prior report. That marks one quarter of accelerating revenue growth.

Insurance companies are increasingly citing COVID decisions to improperly narrow historically available coverage, and policyholders should be aware that these decisions are contrary to the historic purpose and understanding of the coverage available under property/business interruption policies, as well as a significant number of prior rulings holding that loss of access, loss of use, and loss of functionality of property constitute “physical loss or damage” under these policies.

Helios AI levels the playing field for smaller food companies, unlocking enterprise-grade insights that have historically been out of reach.","Agtech company Helios AI, which specializes in AI-powered software for predicting soft commodity prices and disrupting the food supply chain, has won over Silicon Valley venture capitalists. The Tysons, Virginia-based agtech has secured $4.7 million in seed funding to finance its next phase of growth, including the launch of its AI copilot for food supply chains. Led by Collide Capital, the funding round extended other backers including S&P Global Ventures, Stray Dog Capital, Angeles VC, Equity Alliance and Supply Change Capital. Proceeds from the round will be directed toward supporting Helios AI’s recent growth, including the hiring of key talent.

Alongside the capital infusion, Helios AI has unveiled Helios Horizon, the first-of-its-kind AI-powered co-pilot that delivers actionable insights to food supply chains. The platform integrates price forecasting and climate predictions across more than 75 agricultural commodities and 2,500 price series, including staples like coffee, soybeans and cocoa.

Powered by a multi-agent AI system, where specialized sub-agents handle distinct datasets and tasks under a supervising agent, Helios Horizon provides analysis, drawing from billions of real-time signals from around the world. According to Helios’ internal benchmarks, its forecasting accuracy is five times higher than standard industry models that rely on basic seasonality and supply-demand inputs.

The capital will also support Helios AI’s expansion, including key hires as the firm builds on its commodities coverage. This follows its earlier rollout of advanced price forecasting models over the summer, positioning Helios Horizon as a tool to streamline decision-making for a wide range of users, from farmers to retailers.

Francisco Martin-Rayo, Co-Founder and CEO of Helios AI. “It’s like having a team of Bloomberg analysts in your pocket 24/7.” He added in a post on LinkedIn: “This isn’t just about technology. It’s about access. For the first time, tools once reserved for Wall Street are in the hands of everyone: from independent farmers and local distributors to CPG giants and global retailers.”

Martin-Rayo also shared the genesis of the company, explaining, “Helios AI was born from a simple but urgent belief: food supply chains deserve foresight, not just hindsight. Too many procurement leaders, growers, and food innovators are forced to react to crises instead of anticipating them. That gap has real costs — for margins, for resilience, for people.”

Collide Capital Founder and Managing Partner Brian Hollins commented, “What excites us about Helios AI is their ability to combine deep technical talent with a huge, underserved opportunity. Helios AI levels the playing field for smaller food companies, unlocking enterprise-grade insights that have historically been out of reach. In a market measured in the trillions and undergoing rapid transformation, that kind of democratization is not just disruptive — it’s inevitable. Helios AI is positioned to lead that wave.”

For investors in the agricultural sector, this development highlights the growing intersection of agtech and data analytics, where AI-driven platforms could enhance supply chain resilience amid ongoing challenges like climate risks and commodity price volatility.

ID24,J&J,2025-09-25 17:09:52+00:00,The Athletic,Eagles 'prototype' RT Lane Johnson demonstrates his value: 'Best player I've ever been around',Zach Berman,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6659872/2025/09/25/eagles-lane-johnson-value-nfl/,"During 13 seasons, Lane Johnson has developed into longtime Philadelphia Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland’s prototype for an offensive tackle.
“It’s pretty tough to re-create Lane Johnson.” You don’t need to remind the Eagles.
Correlation does not imply causation, but the sample is large enough to realize how devastating Johnson’s absence is for the Eagles’ offensive line.
“Lane Johnson is, in my opinion, no question about it in my mind that he’s the best player I’ve ever been around,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said.
The comparison grid included sacks allowed, quarterback hits allowed, quarterback hurries allowed, pressures allowed, pass block win rate, quarterback time to throw, run block win rate and team rushing yards.","During 13 seasons, Lane Johnson has developed into longtime Philadelphia Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland’s prototype for an offensive tackle. Similar to Johnson’s former linemate Brandon Brooks at guard, Johnson has the ideal combination of critical factors Stoutland seeks at the position.

There’s one problem.

“When I think of ‘prototype,’ I think of something that can be re-created,” veteran offensive lineman Brett Toth said. “It’s pretty tough to re-create Lane Johnson.”

You don’t need to remind the Eagles. When Johnson exited their Week 3 win over the Los Angeles with a stinger, the offense initially stalled. When the Eagles review film of last season’s loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ahead of this Sunday’s matchup, they’ll see how the offense was a shell itself without the six-time Pro Bowl tackle.

Since the start of the 2016 season, the Eagles have played 131 games with Johnson in the lineup. They’re 91-39-1 in those games — winning at a nearly 70 percent rate. They played 35 games without Johnson. They’re 12-23 in those games, winning at only a 34 percent rate. Correlation does not imply causation, but the sample is large enough to realize how devastating Johnson’s absence is for the Eagles’ offensive line.

“He’s the best offensive lineman that’s f—ing come through the Eagles,” center Cam Jurgens said. “You’re going to notice that — when he’s on or off the field.”

The Athletic started exploring what it is about Johnson that made him so difficult to replace last week, before the evidence again revealed just how much the Eagles miss him. To their credit, they still won the game with Fred Johnson (no relation) eventually settling into the position. But they don’t want to make a habit of it. Lane Johnson was limited at practice Wednesday, although he appears on track to play.

It could prove to be a difference. It’s been in the past. There are several reasons, and one simple conclusion.

“Lane Johnson is, in my opinion, no question about it in my mind that he’s the best player I’ve ever been around,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “He is one of the best players in the NFL, and sometimes it’s hard to see that as an offensive lineman. It doesn’t show itself, but Lane gives us so much ability to do different things because of who he is as a football player.”

Johnson did not respond with his words after he was named second-team All-Pro last season. Rather, he responded with a piece of paper taped next to his locker. It offered a side-by-side comparison to Detroit Lions offensive tackle Penei Sewell, who was first-team All-Pro. Johnson took it as a slight.

An offensive lineman’s effect on the game can be difficult to quantify — “Good days, no one said your name,” Toth said — but Johnson offered data that comes from reviewing film that demonstrates his value. The comparison grid included sacks allowed, quarterback hits allowed, quarterback hurries allowed, pressures allowed, pass block win rate, quarterback time to throw, run block win rate and team rushing yards. Johnson’s numbers were more favorable in each category.

One category especially stood out when demonstrating Johnson’s value: “Island Rate,” a metric that measures how often an offensive lineman is left on an “island” one-on-one against a pass rusher. Johnson’s listed Island Rate was 75 percent, first among his position. The Eagles’ offense often relies upon its bookend offensive tackles blocking one-on-one without the help of a defender.

“He’s a freak athlete — long, strong, can anchor very quick,” Jurgens said. “That’s what you want in this system.”

The key, of course, is Johnson’s technical ability as a blocker and his rare athleticism as a converted junior college quarterback. But his teammates push back on the supposition that it’s that simple. When you play the position, you see the subtleties of Johnson’s game.

“As far as the O-line standpoint, you know where the quarterback is going to be … (from) being detailed, and you know what the defense presents, and you know what to expect when a D-end is lined up in a different position or whatnot,” said veteran lineman Matt Pryor, who was Johnson’s teammate from 2019 to 2022 before rejoining the Eagles this season. “This is very detailed and just technically sound. Not many times he’s going to be off balance, out of place, but when he is, he’s athletic enough to recover from it, which you don’t see often.

“Just from experience, I think he’s just at that pinnacle of (the position). He’s done it so great for so long that he’s kind of hit that point to where it’s just perfection.”

Johnson’s absence affects the entire offensive line. Since 2016, the Eagles have had a sack rate of 8 percent, and the average time for the quarterback to throw is 2.87 seconds when Johnson is not on the field. When Johnson plays, the Eagles allow a sack on 6.5 percent of pass attempts and have an average time to throw of 2.92 seconds. Teammates talk about the information Johnson brings back to the sideline after the first few drives.

Johnson, 35, is the Eagles’ longest-tenured player. During the offseason, he said he was “getting close to my peak, as weird as it is to say.” He keeps signing contract extensions, prolonging a career teammates suggest will lead to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Johnson acknowledged he doesn’t recognize the music in the locker room, yet he still enjoys it. It’s easier to express that optimism about not yet peaking in June than in September after facing Steve Spagnuolo’s blitzes, but Johnson sounded just as energized this month as he did when practices were in shorts and shells.

“I feel good. As long as my back and hip aren’t too bad, I feel like I’m better than I was in my 20s,” Johnson said. “Look at movement and all that stuff. So yeah, I feel better than what I thought I’d be at 35. These guys keep me young. I’m around a lot of younger gentlemen. They keep me young and healthy.”

The worst he felt was in 2021 when lingering ankle injuries affected his physical performance and contributed to anxiety that caused him to leave the team. He’s a different person now — and a better player, too. Johnson acknowledged he thought his body would wane. It hasn’t happened. He studied athletes who’ve extended their careers into their 40s, such as LeBron James and Olympians. He’s specific about his diet and his training. Even Jalen Hurts, a devotee to regimen, marvels at the “routine” Johnson uses. Look at a picture of Johnson now compared with when he came into the league, and you would wish you aged like he did. He joked he wishes there was a combine for players 10-plus years into the league to compare how they’ve aged.

He’s at a point in his career at which the understanding of the game merges with the physical and technical capabilities. Remember: Johnson did not start playing offensive line until college. He moved from quarterback to tight end to defensive end to offensive tackle. Early in his NFL career, he was still learning the position. Now, he can teach a Stoutland meeting. Toth started doing the math in his head of how many snaps Johnson has taken — the answer is 10,915 snaps, when including the postseason — and explained how hard that experience is to replicate. A Johnson replacement does not have that convergence of skill, athleticism and experience.

“There’s always stuff to clean up, but nothing can take the place of experience,” Johnson said. “And the good thing about playing offensive line, it’s a lot different than being an aging receiver. I have to be quick in the 5-yard, 10-yard space versus running a route. So, glad I did choose to end up being an offensive lineman after all, so you can kind of age gracefully somewhat. But, yeah, I’m still fighting and still playing.”

And still fighting for awards. The NFL is introducing a “Blocker of the Year” award. Johnson wished it had been instituted before Year 13. He’d be lying if he said he was not trying to win it. And he hopes his play is enough for first-team All-Pro, too. That still matters. If his value isn’t clear when he’s on the field, just see how it looks when he isn’t there.

“I still have the spirit of still trying to prove myself, like I’m still trying to make my first Pro Bowl, trying to get on the (Pro Bowl) wall down there,” Johnson said, referencing a wall of Pro Bowlers at the team facility. “That’s how I attack every day.”

Johnson was not necessarily the prototype when he entered the league, and Stoutland put Johnson through a workout in Groveton, Texas, in his first year as offensive line coach. Stoutland sent 20 video clips to Howie Roseman in a fit of enthusiasm. Owner Jeffrey Lurie asked Stoutland about the workout, and Stoutland could only respond with, “Wow.” It’s a word he does not use often. The excitement was about what Johnson could become. Two factors made Johnson the prototype: the way Johnson developed and the way the game evolved.

“I feel like the past decade, yeah, I am a part of the new style,” Johnson said. “When I came to the league, it was really, big mauling (tackles) … so I wouldn’t necessarily be what they’re looking for. So, the game evolves. You look at linebackers now, they’re more of a safety size. … (I fit) for what we wanted to do, heavy zone, run around a lot. But yeah, I mean, I feel a lot better now in my 30s than in my 20s, just because I only take it more seriously. When you’re young, we take things for granted, and you can be reckless, but better focus in my 30s, and I enjoy that, man.”

It also helped that he played in Philadelphia for Stoutland. Johnson often thinks about how his career arc would have gone had he been drafted in the top three as opposed to No. 4 in 2013.

“I thought about what would happen if I went to Miami,” Johnson said. “Kansas City wouldn’t have been bad. Jacksonville … ”

He stopped, as if others could finish the thought.

“It’s something you can appreciate in time,” Johnson said. “I know I have.”

If a prototype cannot be re-created, Johnson is offering what he knows. His talent cannot be replicated. His experience is hard to match. But if he can help you, he will.

“The best part about Lane is that he doesn’t gatekeep,” Jordan Mailata said.

Johnson has spoken about how he’s an only child, and teammates become his family. There’s a brotherhood that does not exist in different professions, and it’s why he wants to cling to playing professional football for as long as he can. He’s been a resource for teammates who battle anxiety. He gives training and lifestyle tips. You might see players in the locker room with toe spacers at Johnson’s suggestion. He hosts teammates at his “Bro Barn” to work out with him. Mailata recently pulled a reporter aside to show off a package in his locker with a device that helps the lungs optimize breathing. It was ordered at Johnson’s urging.

“His success goes for everyone. … He’s always sharing,” Mailata said. “It doesn’t matter how good of a player he is … it doesn’t matter what you are, where you were drafted, where you come from. He’s gonna help you. That doesn’t get talked about enough.”

“I know players from around the league, when they came in the rookie year, their vets aren’t as helping as others,” Pryor said. “It’s understandable, because you never know if somebody’s in there to take a spot or not. But he’s the opposite. He’s very helpful. He’s trying to coach everybody up. But just his mindset, from doing this s— 13 years at a high level … All-Pro on and off the field. Very special person.”

Johnson thinks there’s something else those teammates have going for them: playing in Philadelphia. It can be portrayed as a challenging place to play. That might be true, but Johnson thinks the pressure and football culture helped him maximize his talent. If he were in Jacksonville, he’d still have the rare combination of athleticism and skill. He might not have found the elixir of a fan base that boos a team that’s won 19 of 20 games — while losing without Johnson on the field, of course.

“You either go up from there or go down,” Johnson said. “And it definitely amplified me.”

There will be a time when the record with and without Johnson will no longer be applicable. Another right tackle will take on the task of succeeding him rather than filling in for him. That will be daunting.

How do you replace the prototype?

“You’ve had that guy on your team for 13 years that’s just continuously performed at that level, that’s not something that many teams have ever had the privilege to have,” Toth said. “So he’s one of those stories where it’s like, appreciate it as long as you can, because what he’s done here is remarkable.”

U.S. medtech stocks fell on Thursday after the U.S. Commerce Department opened a probe into imports of medical devices, pressuring shares across the sector.

Analysts said the investigation may weigh on companies with globally sourced supply chains and create a modest overhang for the stocks.

Companies like GE HealthCare GEHC, Becton Dickinson BDX, Stryker SYK, Insulet PODD, Intuitive Surgical ISRG and ResMed RMD were among the worst performers on the S&P Health Care Equipment index (.SPLRCMED), down between 4% and 11%.

Abbott ABT slipped 1.6% and Medtronic MDT fell 2.3%, while the S&P Health Care Equipment index dropped 2% on the day.

Medtech shares have been volatile this year amid supply chain disruptions, cost inflation and softer demand in some international markets.

The medtech index has seen a modest 2.3% rise this year versus a 12.5% rise in the broader S&P 500 index SPX.

Needham analyst Mike Matson said the probe ""creates a new overhang for the already-beleaguered sector, but the actual impact of any new tariffs depends on companies' ability to pass through the costs to customers.""

Earlier this month, the Secretary of Commerce launched a Section 232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to assess how imports of personal protective equipment, medical consumables, and medical devices impact national security. The department said it would make recommendations within 270 days.

""We look forward to continuing our work with the Administration...to strengthen our already-robust and uniquely American industry,"" said CEO Scott Whitaker of medtech association AdvaMed.

Section 232 allows the President to restrict imports if they are found to ""threaten to impair"" U.S. national security.

While the list of products covered is broad, ""we don't think it's right to hit the panic button"", J.P. Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus said in a note.

I may be wrong.” A lot of the personal memories in this book, I’ve tried to write for years.","ADHow many years?

JKFive years in total. I’d been thinking about the book before that, but in 2020, I started out with this idea—a silly idea, actually. It started with me wanting to write a book about three sisters who had superpowers. I thought a lot about levitation and shooting fire with your eyes. And the interesting thing about these sisters was that they resisted. They sat me down and told me in English, even though Swedish is my mother tongue: “There’s so much pressure already on us to be perfect, to be superhero-esque, and it would be great if there was a possibility for us to exist in this book and be human. Can’t you allow us to just be human with all of our flaws, with all of our mistakes, and the almostness of being human?” That was the moment that I allowed the book to be something that I didn’t want it to be. Oftentimes, the spark that starts a book for me is when I realize that the characters have enough agency to rebel.

ADWas the character of Jonas always present, or did you add the more autobiographical elements once the sisters became human?

JKThe structure was quite clear from the beginning. I just sensed that once I put fictional sister and personal memory side by side, the book vibrated with something.

ADDid you know which personal memories you were going to use? Or were you improvising?

JKI was improvising. Finding the balance between the nonfiction and the fiction was a bit tricky in the beginning. But it was a process of trusting the energy of the piece. And I think a lot about that, both in my teaching and in my creative practice. It’s so much about being honest about what moves you. I realized as a person, as a writer, as a father, I am someone who likes to be surprised. I enjoy mystery. Like the fact that Evelyn and her sisters go to New York, and Evelyn decides to stay because she feels at home there, finally, after her whole life waiting to feel at home. In a way, she disappears. That happens around the same time that Jonas loses his friend Emma to suicide. So, there’s this loss of Evelyn, and the loss of Emma, and the uncontrollable meaning that arises once you put two things together that you don’t fully comprehend. I have a feeling that this book saved me in some sense. It gave meaning to memories that I haven’t really been able to understand before, because I started looking at them through the fictional lens of the sisters. Parts of myself that I have spent years hiding and judging.

ADI was reading Mourning Diary by Roland Barthes last month, and he related writing about memory to pinning a butterfly. In other words, does writing about memory change the function of that memory permanently?

JKI had a conversation with my youngest son recently about butterflies. We were sitting in Prospect Park, and he was asking me questions like, “What are your top three bugs?” And he brought out the fact that if you are a scientist and you focus on butterflies, you must really like them; it’s a little bit strange that you pin them down. If we use that metaphor, if you really like your memories, is the real value in pinning them down and making them beautiful, stretching their wings, and being impressed by their colors? Or is the real value investigating them with the courage to say, “I may not remember this correctly. I may be wrong.” A lot of the personal memories in this book, I’ve tried to write for years. But I’ve never been able to touch them. They have felt too painful to return to. I couldn’t understand why they wouldn’t let me go. I felt like these memories were kind of pinned. At first, I didn’t think some of those memories would fit in a novel. Memories about what happened after my parents’ divorce. Memories of growing up in a country where I spent years looking for a sense of home and never found it. But also memories of just going with my dad to a tennis tournament and realizing how painful it was for him that we didn’t have a car. It’s not a big memory. But once you stay with the “smallness,” you realize that it actually contains a whole world.

ADThis is where I think “craft” as a concept gets tricky. It seems when you talk about your book that, like your memories, your sisters are in your mind as real beings, and they’re somewhat autonomous from yourself and surprising you. I feel like a lot of writers are ashamed of the idea that their characters live in their heads.

JKI think they’re ashamed because, in essence, you’re saying that the work is more important than you. And I’ve always had the feeling that what is coming out on the page is much more interesting than whatever I am. When I look in the special cemetery of my failed projects that never saw the light of day, very often the idea is too smart. It did not come from an element that I was trying to suppress or understand. It’s an idea that I came up with to create an effect in a potential reader. I’ve never been able to finish those books because I have tried to control them. With every book, I have one particular moment when I go, This thing has had an artificial heart, but that artificial heart now pumps with blood. With the sisters, it was a moment at the Cullman Center. I had just frothed some milk in this tiny kitchen at the New York Public Library, and I realized that the sisters were cursed. I saw that so vividly. They grew up with the story that someone put a curse on them, and that everything they love, they will lose. They choose very different ways to try to break the curse. Ina chooses structure. Evelyn chooses to transform herself. Anastasia chooses to inject artificial ingredients: music or drugs. And I’ve used all of those strategies myself. But my main thing that I’ve used in my life is writing, my written words, trying to break the curse that my father put on me that I would be a failure, because I’m convinced that one of the ways that we can break free from curses is by storytelling. We can tell our way free in any language.

AD You open the book with an incredible, dense party scene. On a technical level, how did you accomplish that without being muddy?

JKI think you avoid muddiness by being very hyper-clear about what is emotionally at stake for one person who is present. We know that Ina arrives at this party, and she’s way too tall to be there—and feels way too boring. She has already memorized the timetable for the night buses. She is basically counting down the seconds until she can leave. And the first thing she says to her sisters is, “You’re not going to leave me, right? We will take care of each other.” Two seconds later, her sisters are gone. Ina is by herself. And all of us have been that person at a party. So as muddy as a party scene is, as sticky as the floor is, as loud as the music is, as much as the bass is thumping, if you can get the emotional clarity, anything else becomes easy. I like the fact that the book opens with the scene where time is being inverted. It starts, it ends. It’s New Year’s Eve. They do the countdown thing, and they go ten, nine, eight . . . and then they reach zero, and Ina doesn’t kiss the man she’s met, Hector, but then someone checks the time and realizes, Hey, actually we got it wrong. Midnight is in ten seconds. They get another chance. They get another countdown. They go from ten to zero, and this time they kiss each other. So maybe that’s a lesson that we can take. Ina realized that her fear of making a mistake was worse than her fear of actually trying.

ADSince we initially recorded this interview, you’ve had the happy news that The Sisters was longlisted for the National Book Award for Fiction. How does it feel for the three of them—and for you—to be acknowledged in a country and a language that is very much relevant to both the novel and the project of writing the novel?

JKI got the happy news when I was in Korea for a book festival. It was 10 PM on a Saturday, and I was alone in a hotel room in Seoul after a day of lectures and interviews when congratulatory texts started pouring in. I couldn’t believe it. Since I didn’t have anyone to share the amazing news with, I started dancing on my own, strangely enough, to a Justin Bieber song. Then I had to stop because I had a late-night virtual mediation session with my wife to discuss our potential future in the US.

Are you ready for ? This week, Kim Kardashian announced the collaboration between her shapewear brand and the athletic-wear giant (out September 26), first teasing the drop with a star-studded campaign video, then following that up with a surprise fashion performance on the steps of the New York Public Library.

To cap things off, the business mogul co-hosted a celebratory launch event last night, held at the Nike House of Innovation in NYC. There, she turned heads in a blueberry-gray ensemble that was styled like a skintight catsuit.

Kim Kardashian arrives to the NikeSkims launch event in New York City.

While the monochromatic fit blended seamlessly, it wasn’t actually a catsuit, but rather a collection of separates. The set consisted of a long-sleeve, mock-neck top, which Kim tucked into a set of high-waisted leggings with a V-panel in the front. Both of the pieces were decorated with white pinstripes along the side, and because they were slightly sheer, she also wore a matching gray bra underneath her top.

For the event, Kim wore a spandex-y, gray ensemble from the new capsule.

The reality star accessorized the look with a matching elastic skull cap with knotted material in the back. She also added some pointy pumps, which made it seem like her bottoms were actually pantaleggings (a look that Kim’s long been a fan of, thanks to her ongoing friendship with Demna, who pioneered the design).

The pieces were decorated with white pinstripes on the side.

""It's time to move on and focus on the Raiders,"" Williams said.","The belief that Johnson has in Williams was evident against the Cowboys when the coach kept the offense on the field on fourth-and-goal from the 4 late in the third quarter. The quarterback responded by throwing a touchdown pass to receiver DJ Moore.

""Him and I talk and meet every single day,"" Williams said of Johnson. ""And then getting out there on the practice field builds a lot of confidence in him to be able to call the plays whatever moment it is … whether it's fourth-and-4 on the goal line and the trust between us to be able to try and go get it.

Nevertheless, WoodMac remains bullish about natural gas power generation, predicting that the global sector will add 890 GW of new gas-fired generation capacity through 2040.","Canadian energy infrastructure company, TC Energy Corp. (NYSE:TRP), has unveiled plans to invest $8.5 billion over the next five years in U.S. power projects, banking on predictions of a 45 billion cubic feet per day increase in natural gas demand to meet surging power demand. According to TC Energy CEO François Poirier, gas-fired generation will power the ongoing AI build-out, adding that his company has a footprint in eight of the ten largest U.S. electric utilities.

“It’s all about energy--and natural gas is going to be the backbone,” Poirier said in an interview.

Poirier says favorable policies by the Trump administration will make it easier for the company to achieve its lofty goal, saying that time spent on permitting and construction could be cut in half. The energy executive has predicted that U.S. LNG exports will double from the current 12 bcf/d to 24 bcf/d over the next 10 years. Back in May, Poirier reaffirmed TC Energy’s capital expenditure guidance of $5.5 billion to $6 billion in the current year, and said it remains on track to place assets worth $8.5 billion into service in 2025. TC Energy reported that its projects are tracking ~15% below budget.

TC Energy is not the only organization that has predicted robust growth in U.S. natural gas demand.

Last year, Morgan Stanley predicted that the U.S. natural gas market is entering a new growth cycle thanks to the advent of AI data centers, clean energy manufacturing and the cryptocurrencies boom. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) global electricity demand increased by 4.3% in 2024, up from 2.5% growth recorded in 2023.

Meanwhile, S&P Global Commodity Insights recently predicted that natural gas will be the only fossil fuel that will increase its share in the energy mix of the United States, China, and India by 2050, even as oil and coal usage decline globally. S&P Global has projected that renewables will supply 20% of global energy by 2050, up from just 4% currently. “By 2050, gas shall be the only fossil fuel with a potential increase in the energy mix for the US, China, and India,” the report stated.

The analysts note that coal-to-gas substitution has been driving the energy transition in the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia while India has been lagging here. India’s energy mix remains heavily skewed towards fossil fuels, with oil and gas accounting for 77% of primary energy use while renewables contribute just 2%. However, S&P Global has predicted that fossil fuels’ share in India’s energy mix will fall to 66% by 2050, while renewables will rise to 16%. India will mainly use natural gas as a transition fuel during this period, as a more flexible and cleaner alternative to coal.

But it’s not all tailwinds. Some warn that gas-powered generation could soon face significant headwinds due to manufacturing constraints.

According to Wood Mackenzie, the gas turbine market could face ""turbo lag"" from 2025-2040 due to rising costs, manufacturing constraints and competition from renewables. WoodMac notes that global orders of gas turbines jumped 32%Y/Y in 2025, driven by projections for a big load growth from AI. electrification and hydrogen production. However, the global data and analytics provider has warned that rising capital costs coupled with power prices below the cost of new gas generation could alter this trajectory, particularly in the United States. High costs of imported gas are likely to remain the main challenge for Asia despite the region’s strong power demand growth, while decarbonization goals will limit growth in Europe.

""While power markets will require natural gas-fired power as part of the energy transition through 2040, gas's role will have limits,"" said David Brown, Director of Energy Transition Research at Wood Mackenzie. ""High fuel costs in some regions, rising construction costs, and continued cost declines for renewables and energy storage will constrain gas's growth potential.""

Nevertheless, WoodMac remains bullish about natural gas power generation, predicting that the global sector will add 890 GW of new gas-fired generation capacity through 2040. The U.S. and China are expected to lead the charge, accounting for a combined 47% of global annual additions while India, Southeast Asia and the EU will account for the rest.

CVS Health (CVS, Financial) is proactively addressing potential regulatory challenges in the pharmacy benefit management sector.

The company is a major player in the healthcare industry, with significant operations in retail pharmacy, pharmacy benefit management, and health insurance.

Financial metrics indicate a mixed performance with declining margins but stable revenue growth.

Key players in the pharmacy benefit management sector, including CVS Health (CVS), are proposing voluntary adjustments to their business practices to preempt regulatory actions from federal authorities. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents major PBMs, has drafted proposals aimed at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The initiatives include expanding access to affordable biologic alternatives and enhancing compensation to rural pharmacies. These measures are part of efforts to address criticism and potential regulation aimed at reducing drug prices by targeting the role of intermediaries in the healthcare market.

CVS Health Corp is a diversified healthcare company with a robust portfolio of services. Its operations span over 9,000 retail pharmacy locations across the United States, making it a significant player in the retail pharmacy sector. Additionally, CVS Health is a leading pharmacy benefit manager, processing approximately 2 billion adjusted claims annually. The company's acquisition of Aetna has positioned it as a top-tier health insurer, serving around 27 million medical members. The recent acquisition of Oak Street Health further enhances its offerings by adding primary care services, potentially creating synergies across its business lines.

With a market capitalization of approximately $94.48 billion, CVS Health operates within the healthcare sector, specifically in the healthcare plans industry. The company's strategic positioning in these markets underscores its influence and reach within the healthcare ecosystem.

Financial Health Analysis

CVS Health's financial performance presents a mixed picture. The company reported a revenue of $386.64 billion, reflecting a 3-year revenue growth rate of 10.4%. However, profitability metrics indicate challenges, with an operating margin of 2.65% and a net margin of 1.17%, both of which have been in decline over recent years.

The company's balance sheet shows a current ratio of 0.8 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.07, indicating a moderate level of leverage. The Altman Z-Score of 2.2 places CVS Health in the grey area, suggesting some financial stress, though not at immediate risk of bankruptcy.

Insider activity has shown some caution, with recent insider selling transactions totaling 7,500 shares over the past three months, which may indicate a lack of confidence in short-term stock performance.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

CVS Health's valuation metrics suggest it is trading at a relatively high level compared to historical norms. The P/E ratio stands at 20.81, close to its 1-year high, while the P/S ratio of 0.25 and P/B ratio of 1.22 are also near their respective highs.

Analyst sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a target price of $81.06 and a recommendation score of 2, indicating a moderate buy. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 68.77 suggest the stock is approaching overbought territory.

Institutional ownership remains strong at 86.35%, reflecting continued confidence from large investors, despite recent insider selling activity.

Risk Assessment

CVS Health's financial health grades indicate areas of concern, particularly in profitability and leverage. The company's ROIC of 3.67% is below its WACC, suggesting inefficiencies in capital utilization.

Sector-specific risks include potential regulatory changes impacting the pharmacy benefit management industry, as highlighted by the recent news. Additionally, the company's beta of 0.55 indicates lower volatility compared to the market, which may appeal to risk-averse investors.

Overall, while CVS Health faces challenges in profitability and regulatory risks, its strong market position and diversified business model provide a foundation for potential long-term stability.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000AUE.png?20,N,,2025-09-25 13:16:05.791042

Plus, as part of the confirmed technical specifications, Audi's premium mid-sized sedan can be optioned with performance upgrades previously reserved for the sportier S6 for the first time.

The new A6 is due to hit showrooms in the final quarter of 2025. Prices range from $64,100 for the Premium trim, up to $67,500 for Premium Plus and $71,400 for the top shelf Prestige option. This means the entry-level A6 Premium is $3k cheaper than the BMW 540i 5 Series it will rival, and a whopping $8K less expensive than the equivalent Mercedes E450 E-Class. Put another way, you could buy an entry-level 2026 A6 and one of 10 of the ‘fastest cars on earth’ for the same price as a new V6 E450.*

It should be noted that prices for BMW’s entry-level, 255-horsepower 530i and the 255 hp Mercedes E350 start from $59,900 and $63,900 USD respectively.

Power Up To 362 HP, But Audi Still Slower Than Its Rivals

Paired with a revised seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch gearbox, Audi’s reworked 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 – the only engine option confirmed so far – sends 362-horsepower and 406-pound feet of torque to all four wheels, 27 hp and 37 lb ft increase respectively over the old model. While this does bring the A6 up short against the 375 hp BMW 540i and Mercedes E450, the A6 will nevertheless hit 0-60 MPH in 4.5 seconds. That’s just one-tenth shy of both the Bimmer and the Merc, and a sizeable six-tenths quicker than the model it replaces. Top speed is electronically limited to 130 MPH.

We should probably point out that the Audi is slightly less frugal than either of its rivals too, returning an average of 23 miles-per-gallon. The BMW and the Mercedes, meanwhile, hover around 28 and 25 MPG, respectively.

S6 Performance Upgrades Now Available; New ""Human-Centric"" Cabin

Interestingly, for the first-time, Audi’s premium mid-sized sedan can be optioned with S6 upgrades, including all-wheel steering for more nimble handling, and a rear differential than distributes torque as needed to each individual wheel. Steel sport suspension is also an option alongside adaptive air suspension (standard on the Prestige trim), the former of which drops the ride height by 0.8-inches for a more road-holding ride. All of this works in tandem with a chassis that has been re-engineered to make the A6 less gloopy than before whilst still retaining long-distance ride quality. More robust front and rear subframes help improve overall body rigidity, and lighter-weight aluminum components are incorporated into the suspension to keep the A6’s girth down. Interestingly though, Audi has not yet confirmed an overall curb weight.

Alongside a brand-new exterior design, Audi has also worked improve the “human centric” (urgh) cabin design, which was hardly a ramshackle cow shed to begin with. One of the more notable – and optional, sadly – additions is Audi’s ‘digital stage,’ which combines an 11.9-inch digital driver cluster and the 14.5-inch infotainment touchscreen into one, curving OLED screen that dominates the dashboard (whether this will inspire another one of our ‘hall of fame cabin design’ lists remains to be seen). In a neat touch, a separate 10.9-inch display is also mounted in front of the passenger with this package in pseudo-Ferrari F12berlinetta style. Audi also claims that improved seals, tire foam, bushing in the drivetrain mounts, and heavier-duty acoustic window glazing have improved cabin sound insulation by 30%.",https://static0.hotcarsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2026-audi-a6-usa-pricing-10.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-25 17:13:20.981361

Trish Donnelly, who had years-long stints at Urban Outfitters, Polo Ralph Lauren and J. Crew, is now leading Chico’s FAS as division CEO, according to LinkedIn posts Wednesday from holding company KnitWell Group and Donnelly herself.

Most recently, Donnelly was president of The Row, and also has had leadership roles at PVH, including CEO of Calvin Klein Global. She began her work at Chico’s — whose brands include its namesake and White House Black Market women’s apparel retailers and lingerie retailer Soma — this week.

Chico’s hasn’t had its own chief since Molly Langenstein’s departure in January 2024, shortly after its acquisition by private equity firm Sycamore Partners. In the newly created role, Donnelly oversees all product and customer-facing functions across brands and leads day-to-day operations of KnitWell Group’s campus.

Dive Insight:

In 2019 Sycamore Partners tried and failed numerous times to acquire Chico’s but succeeded four years later. The firm paid $1 billion in cash and swiftly moved it into its KnitWell holding company. That group also includes Ann Taylor, Loft and Talbots, which Sycamore already owned.

The retail conglomerate had been struggling for while, though it made progress during Langenstein’s four-year tenure. How Chico’s is doing now is less clear because, as a privately held company, it no longer needs to report on its performance.

KnitWell in its post called out Donnelly’s history leading multi-brand retail companies — she was CEO of PVH Americas for nearly two years, CEO of global at Urban Outfitters for five years and before that Urban’s North America president for over a year.

“Trish is an exceptional leader with a proven record of success and is widely respected for uniting teams around a shared vision and for delivering results,” KnitWell CEO Lizanne Kindler said on LinkedIn. “Her passion for retail and dedication to customers are truly unmatched.”

In her post, Donnelly said that “It’s a transformative time in retail,” and that she and the brands’ teams will be writing “the next chapter of growth for our brands.” It’s true that her experience could be transformative for Chico’s and its stable, but the company has no shortage of operational challenges, according to Liza Amlani, principal at Retail Strategy Group.

“Trish Donnelly’s appointment signals Chico’s ambition to elevate its brands and sharpen its customer strategy. Her track record at PVH, The Row, and J.Crew gives her the product, digital, and brand credibility the company has lacked,” Amlani said by email. “The challenge will be translating luxury and premium brand experience into a highly promotional, margin-sensitive environment where inventory discipline and speed-to-market are critical. If she can pair her brand vision with operational rigor, Chico’s has a real chance at reinvention. Otherwise, the appointment risks becoming more about optics than execution.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/WifqJwPLqe3-SPbABR4cFDOXVYpuKa6atlUoKqLQJIQ/g:nowe:35:208/c:1244:703/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMTg2OS5qcGVn.webp,N,,2025-09-25 13:17:40.118221

After the Food and Drug Administration changed its regulations around the COVID vaccine this summer to limit access, New York state crafted a workaround to preserve people’s ability to get a booster. Nonetheless, confusion has reigned in pharmacies across New York City.

An executive order by Gov. Kathy Hochul technically allows pharmacies to administer the vaccine to anyone three years old and older. But the Centers for Disease Control recently changed its guidelines around the COVID vaccine that further mixed messaging, creating a choose-your-own-adventure scenario for shot-seekers.

Here’s what to know now about finding (and paying for) the new COVID shots in New York City 2025:

Can I get a COVID booster in New York City, and where?

Yes, you can, but where you get it depends on a few factors.

At CVS, Walgreens and independent pharmacies, the COVID vaccine is allowed to be administered, but availability and whether you will have to pay for it varies (more on this below).

Hochul’s Sept. 5 executive order allows pharmacies in the state to offer the COVID vaccine to those under 65 without an underlying health condition and without a prescription.

She did this in response to the FDA releasing the most restrictive COVID vaccine regulations since the shot’s inception. The federal policy said that only those 65 and older or people with an underlying condition are eligible to get the updated vaccine.

Hochul’s executive order suspends those federal rules until Oct. 5, and she may choose to extend it further.

Despite the governor’s order, availability of the vaccines is spotty in New York City. When THE CITY reached out to pharmacies across the five boroughs in recent days, many were not offering the shot, or were administering it only to certain populations.

At Esco Pharmacy in Hell’s Kitchen — where Hochul herself received the COVID booster last week — pharmacists are following FDA guidelines and not offering the vaccine to anyone between the ages of 18 and 65 who do not have a health condition.

“It is confusing to our staff and the patient, as well,” said Danny Dang, pharmacist at Esco, of the current guidelines. “We do see the benefits of the vaccination. I’ve seen a lot of patients who came to us for COVID treatment that could have been prevented by the vaccine if we had done it earlier.”

Dr. Marisa Donnelly, epidemiologist and author of the column “Your Local Epidemiologist,” explains that just because pharmacies are allowed to administer a vaccine doesn’t mean they will.

“There’s still, I think, a lot of internal policies that different pharmacy companies have,” Donnelly says. “They’re all allowed to give vaccines, but that doesn’t mean that they necessarily will. They can still go with their own guidelines and decide not to give a vaccine if they don’t want to. But they are allowed within the state.”

Who should get the booster?

Under the executive order from Hochul, everyone over three years old should be able to get the COVID shot. But, as stated above, the CDC and FDA says something else entirely, muddying the waters.

The New York City Health Department says it is especially important for the following groups of people to get the COVID booster:

All adults ages 65 and older

All children ages 6 to 23 months

People who are pregnant or recently gave birth

People of any age who have an underlying condition that increases their risk for severe COVID-19

People at high risk of exposure, such as health care workers and people living or working in a nursing home or other congregate setting

People living with someone with an underlying condition that increases their risk for severe COVID-19

People who have never been vaccinated before

Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, recommends the shot for anyone whose last vaccine was over six months ago, since immunity starts to wane after four to six months.

“On top of that, the last set of vaccines were protected against an earlier variant,” Lee says. “Right now, the variants that are circulating are different from previous, so your protection is probably even lower against the current variants. So if you haven’t gotten a vaccine for at least six months or greater, then it’s a good idea to get the vaccine, especially headed into winter.”

What about shots for city kids?

All kids three years to 18 are eligible to be vaccinated in New York State –– no prescription or underlying health condition needed. (6 to 23 month old kids are considered a high risk population and so their eligibility for the vaccine was never under threat)

However, THE CITY found that availability for shots for young people is spotty. Some independent pharmacies that are offering the vaccine for adults just don’t have it available or stocked for kids.

Lauren Naturale, a Sunset Park mom, tried to get her six-year-old daughter vaccinated before traveling for a family wedding where a lot of older people would be in attendance.

Naturale attempted to make a vaccine appointment for her daughter at CVS, but when she went to finalize, would repeatedly get an error message. She tried again the following week and was able to make an appointment. Upon arrival at a CVS that was 40 minutes away, Naturale was told the store must have miscategorized them in CVS’s system because they did not have vaccines for children under 12.

“It sounds like you can get them, it would just be great if there was clear information,” Naturale said about children’s vaccines in New York.

She wasn’t able to get her daughter one before they left for the wedding.

“Hopefully we’ll be able to make that happen when we get back to the city,” Naturale said.

Shots for all young people under 19 years old should be covered by your insurer by law. (More on this below.)

Do I need a prescription?

No, you do not need a prescription to get the COVID shot. Hochul’s executive order from earlier this month made it clear that people seeking the COVID vaccine do not need a prescription. If a provider demands one, try another pharmacy, call your local health department about finding a vaccine, or contact your primary care doctor.

What is this going to cost me?

This really depends on your insurance and whether your insurer is choosing to cover the COVID vaccine right now.

That’s because a key committee at the Centers for Disease Control — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — declined last week to recommend the COVID vaccine this season. Its recommendation is the federal standard insurers traditionally follow for coverage of all kinds of medical services.

What this means: Local pharmacies are allowed to give the COVID vaccine, but it may not be paid for by your insurance. At CVS, an out of pocket COVID vaccine could cost you up to $249.99. At Esco Pharmacy, an independent pharmacy in Hell’s Kitchen, it costs about $265, staff there said.

Earlier this month, the state’s Department of Financial Services issued guidance encouraging insurers to continue covering the COVID vaccine, but that isn’t binding. However, the letter notes that New York State law requires insurers to fully cover vaccines for children under 19, because they were deemed necessary immunizations in 2020 –– a decision that still stands.

Some insurers, like UnitedHealthcare, are choosing to continue covering the shot for everyone despite the ACIP declining to recommend the shot.

“For our standard commercial plans, we will continue to cover claims for COVID-19 vaccines with no cost share,” UnitedHealthcare said in a statement. The insurer said they recommend members who use an employer sponsored plan to confirm benefits with their specific plan.

My local pharmacy isn’t offering the shot. What now?

Dr. Lee recommends contacting your doctor’s office or the local health department if you’re having trouble getting the vaccine.

Walgreens and CVS have the COVID vaccine available for those under 65 without a health condition. But to schedule an appointment online, you have to “confirm you are eligible,” or answer yes that you have a health condition.

“My guess is the reason that that is existing is because it’s a national website,” Donnelly says. “And so I imagine that they have some of those settings for everywhere across the country, even if they don’t necessarily apply to New York State. But I do think that that’s a potential source of confusion for people.”

Dr. Donnelly worries that mixed messaging around the COVID vaccine is causing less people to get it, and even worse, sowing distrust in the medical system.

“I think the biggest issue right now is there’s so much noise around vaccines and it’s so confusing to follow,” Donnelly says. “So I think that’s actually a potential deterrent for a lot of families that want to get vaccinated, but that maybe don’t understand that they can or they are eligible now.”

What else can I do to prevent COVID?

Dr. Lee notes that while the COVID vaccine does protect against the worst outcomes of the virus, it doesn’t guarantee not getting it.

“You also want to continue to take other types of precautions, especially when you’re in a location or an area where the risk of getting infected is high,” Lee says. “Say you’re in a very crowded location, it’s still important to make sure that the area is well ventilated. That, and evidence has shown that masks can help cut down transmission. So, all of these things that came out during the beginning of the COVID pandemic still hold.”

During this time of mixed messaging, it’s important to distinguish which evidence is scientifically sound.

“If you see something that’s repeated across different respectable and evidence-based websites, then you can feel more confident that it’s a consensus that different folks have come to the same conclusion,” Lee says.

Some of the most reliable sources, he says, include international health organizations like the World Health Organization, Health Canada, and the U.K.’s The National Health Service.

Dive Brief:

Instacart announced Thursday that it has added a new tool to its Caper Carts that helps SNAP shoppers manage their spending by tracking eligible items and providing a running total of purchases on the device’s screen.

The tech company has also added other tools to its proprietary smart carts, including on-cart loyalty signup, a Cart Cash savings program and improved product recommendations.

Dive Insight:

With the new features, Instacart aims to make it easier for smart cart users to access promotions and track their spending as they shop.

The company’s EBT SNAP tool allows users to simultaneously track running totals of both eligible and non-eligible items in real time, and builds on the company’s efforts to allow SNAP shoppers across the country to use SNAP benefits to pay for online purchases. When checking out, Caper Cart users scan a barcode on the cart’s screen and finalize payment with their EBT SNAP card.

Instacart’s new Cart Cash program, meanwhile, lets users earn cash back by achieving shopping milestones, like making a certain number of store purchases in a month, and clipping exclusive coupons. Shoppers can sign up for the program by joining a retailer’s loyalty program — a task they can now do on the cart’s screen by inputting their phone number or scanning a QR code. After users link their loyalty accounts on the Caper Carts, they can access features that incorporate their shopping preferences, like “buy again” and list building.

Instacart’s updates to Caper Cart aim to provide store in-store shoppers with many of the tools that its online shopping platform provides. The cart’s screen provides suggestions for items similar to those a shopper has bought and points users to nearby product deals as they move through the aisles. Instacart also pushes special discounts to shoppers after they check out that are redeemable on retailer e-commerce sites or apps built on the tech company’s technology.

Over the past year, Instacart has also added several other features to its Caper Carts, including gamification, on-screen advertising and location-based coupons.

In an interview last month, Instacart Chief Connected Stores Officer David McIntosh said the digital shopping experience and new savings tools have become key selling points for Caper Carts.

And yet, many retailers aren’t yet convinced that smart carts, which have been around for over 20 years, are ready for widespread adoption. Kroger, Schnuck Markets, Wakefern Food Corp. and Wegmans all offer Caper Carts in some of their stores, but none yet offer the carts chainwide.

Tech companies other than Instacart, like Veeve and Shopic, offer clip-on units that add smart-cart capabilities to regular grocery carts.

Summary

Helmerich & Payne has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 due to secular headwinds and a deteriorating oil industry outlook.

HP's earnings are highly sensitive to U.S. drilling activity, with recent OPEC production increases and oil price declines posing significant risks.

Technological advancements in drilling have reduced HP's revenue potential, resulting in stagnant earnings despite rising U.S. oil output.

Given HP's rich valuation, weak growth prospects, and high cyclicality, the stock is likely to continue underperforming and should be avoided by long-term investors.

Almost six years ago, I recommended selling Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) due to secular business headwinds and my expectations for a dividend cut. Since that article, the stock has dramatically underperformed the broad market, as

Jobless data, consumer confidence

In the U.S., the Labor Department's latest weekly jobs data showed jobless claims fell to 218,000 for the week ended Sept. 20, down 14,000 from the previous week. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the cooling labor market was overriding concerns about sticky inflation, prompting the central bank's first interest rate cut of the year.

Back in Europe, investors were also monitoring consumer confidence figures.

In their report on consumer confidence in Germany, published Thursday morning, GfK and the Nuremberg Institute for Market Decisions (NIM) said the downward trend in the consumer climate had halted due to improved income expectations.

However, Rolf Bürkl, head of consumer climate at NIM, said that market watchers should approach the data with caution.

""Whether this marks the beginning of a sustained turnaround is more than uncertain. The consumer climate remains at an extremely low level,"" he explained in the report. ""The geopolitical situation, concerns about jobs, and renewed fears of inflation are likely hinder a thorough recovery at the moment.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104370057-RTSS40E.jpg?v=1529452258&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-09-25 14:14:26.743215

ID42,Walmart,2025-09-25 16:05:28+00:00,Digiday,ChatGPT is now 20% of Walmart's referral traffic — while Amazon wards off AI shopping agents,Allison Smith,,,,,https://digiday.com/media/chatgpt-is-now-20-of-walmarts-referral-traffic-while-amazon-wards-off-ai-shopping-agents/,"Other retailers are seeing a lift, too: ChatGPT now drives more than 20% of referral traffic to Etsy, nearly 15% to Target and 10% to eBay.
To be sure, referral traffic from ChatGPT remains a sliver of the overall pie.
In August, referral traffic from ChatGPT to Amazon fell nearly 18% to less than 3% month-over-month.
Like Amazon, Walmart is developing its own shopping agents that customers can use to shop on its e-commerce site.
Max Sinclair, founder of Azoma, said his firm helps brands track and grow traffic from ChatGPT and Amazon’s Rufus.","Data from Similarweb, a web traffic analytics company, shows that one in five of Walmart’s referral clicks in August came from ChatGPT, up 15% from July. Other retailers are seeing a lift, too: ChatGPT now drives more than 20% of referral traffic to Etsy, nearly 15% to Target and 10% to eBay.

To be sure, referral traffic from ChatGPT remains a sliver of the overall pie. For Walmart and its peers, referral clicks account for less than 5% of total site visits — outweighed by direct traffic, paid channels and search engines. But the speed at which ChatGPT has climbed into the top tier of referral sources shows how how AI is starting to influence how consumers shop online. Shoppers are increasingly clicking through links inside AI chat responses, pushing major retailers into the shopping journey historically dominated by Google search. The ramifications could be huge for brands, especially as platforms like ChatGPT start enabling checkout.

A new study authored by OpenAI’s Economic Research team and Harvard economist David Deming found that around 2% of all ChatGPT queries involve shopping — about 50 million queries per day. With 2.5 billion prompts flowing through ChatGPT daily, even a small slice translates into significant shopping intent. Researchers noted that users are often asking for recommendations like “recommend a good laptop under $1,000” or “How much are Nikes,” suggesting AI tools are taking on a role once reserved for Google. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.

Separately, nearly 60% of U.S. consumers have used a generative AI tool for help with online shopping, per an August 2025 survey from Omnisend.

“We know that everyone’s using ChatGPT all the time, and everyone’s using Gemini and all the other tools all the time. So that should be reflected in the traffic a bunch of websites are getting, and that’s what the data seems to confirm,” Juozas Kaziukėnas, an independent analyst, said in an interview. He also wrote about the trend in a LinkedIn post.

Amazon bets on Rufus

The referral surge also reflects Amazon’s deliberate absence. Unlike Walmart, eBay and Target, Amazon has blocked many AI crawlers from scraping its site, Modern Retail previously reported. That means ChatGPT can’t provide real-time Amazon product links, nudging consumers toward rival retailers instead. In August, referral traffic from ChatGPT to Amazon fell nearly 18% to less than 3% month-over-month.

For Amazon, the move was defensive. The company’s marketplace is not only the largest store of e-commerce data in the world but also the backbone of a $56 billion advertising business built around shoppers browsing its site. Letting outside AI tools surface product links directly to users would risk bypassing Amazon’s storefront altogether, undermining both traffic and ad revenue.

Instead, Amazon has been laser-focused on growing its own consumer-facing AI chatbot known as Rufus, among a myriad of other AI-related investments. Rufus now appears in Amazon’s main search bar, in addition to a widget at the bottom of the screen, which opens the bot’s chat interface. Amazon has also started populating Rufus’s chatbot interface with ads. At the end of last year, Amazon said that customers have asked Rufus over half a billion questions, an Amazon spokesperson previously told Modern Retail.

Still, Amazon’s absence has effectively pulled 600 million product listings off the “agentic shopping shelf,” according to Scot Wingo, author of the Substack Retailgentic and founder of ReFiBuy, a company that helps brands and retailers optimize for agentic AI — a type of bot that autonomously completes tasks on its own, without human input. Walmart, with its 420 million SKUs, now fills more of the surface area inside AI chat results.

Amazon’s stance is notable given that major retailers like Walmart and eBay have not made any changes blocking AI bots from their sites. Like Amazon, Walmart is developing its own shopping agents that customers can use to shop on its e-commerce site. But unlike Amazon, Walmart is apparently open to a future in which consumers might rely on third-party bots to shop from its website. Walmart U.S. Chief Technology Officer Hari Vasudev told The Wall Street Journal that he expects the industry to eventually adopt common standards that would let outside shopping agents interact directly with retailers’ own systems.

Kaziukėnas said that the black-box nature of AI makes it hard to know exactly how systems decide which retailers to surface, but “it does look like there’s a preference for trusted major outlets,” he said. “There’s seemingly a tendency to pick kind of bigger retailers, as opposed to just picking any random small Shopify store.”

Monetizing AI

For now, retailers are enjoying a surge of free clicks. But that is unlikely to last. In July, the Financial Times reported that OpenAI is working on a payment and checkout system within ChatGPT that would allow users to complete purchases directly in the app. If ChatGPT is already driving tens of millions of shopping-related queries a day, the company has every incentive to capture value through affiliate fees, advertising or transaction fees, according to Kaziukėnas.

“We are now in this unique environment in time where ChatGPT is becoming important. It’s still sending lots of traffic, often to major retailers. But this will drastically change in the future if these things continue to go in the direction they’re going,” Kaziukėnas said. “This traffic will not be free in the future.” It’s a concern that brand executives have repeatedly expressed to Modern Retail.

AI companies still haven’t proven how they’ll generate enough revenue to offset the enormous costs of running the technology. Bain & Co. projects that by 2030, firms will require roughly $2 trillion a year to cover computing needs, but revenues are expected to lag $800 billion.

Agencies are already responding to the shift. Max Sinclair, founder of Azoma, said his firm helps brands track and grow traffic from ChatGPT and Amazon’s Rufus. On average, his customers have seen a sevenfold increase in visits from ChatGPT, Sinclair said.

“With ChatGPT, it’s very easy to prove ROI to our customers, because we can say, ‘This is how many visits you’re getting to your website before we started working with you. This is how many you’re getting afterward,” he said.

As AI has become more popular, brands and retailers are working to navigate a potential future where bots like OpenAI’s Operator shop on their behalf without human intervention. But whether or not fully autonomous shopping ever becomes more than science fiction, the early steps alone are enough to reshape how people shop.

“The impact of AI on shopping is a range,” Kaziukėnas said. “At the start of that range is just links in chat responses, very basic, very simple. And we are very close to that start right now. Maybe we will get to that finish point. But even if we don’t, it will be disruptive by itself.”",https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/ai-privacy-digiday.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:18:17.961842

The deal marks the first strategic acquisition in the Texas company’s history.

Tito’s officials said that the move would provide strategic sales support and expanded distribution capabilities to the blanco tequila producer, which they called one of the country’s “fastest-growing tequila brands.”

Eduardo ""Lalo"" González, the company’s co-founder, will continue to lead the business.

""My late father is the namesake of this brand, and I know he would be proud to see how far we've come,"" González said in the announcement. ""This moment is a natural continuation of our journey, and we're excited to introduce LALO to more people across the world while preserving every element that makes us special.""

""I've known the LALO founders for a long time,” added Tito’s founder Tito Beveridge. “They care about the juice. They keep it simple. They do things the right way, not the flashy way. That felt like home to us.""

Otherwise, everybody’s free speech is at risk, dependent on the political tides.” THE CHALLENGER: Helena Buonanno Foulkes sat down with me last week for a lengthy video interview.

They really didn’t want to stay here.” That’s a contrast from May, when lawmakers made a change requested by FM to help keep the big insurer in Rhode Island.
***The Rhode Island Life Science Hub, per spokeswoman Sarah Sutton, “announced the investment of $4 million in nondilutive funding to 5 companies either relocating to Rhode Island or building their businesses in the state.","Fallout from the assassination of Charlie Kirk in Utah continues to roil American politics, media and entertainment.

The most prominent example is ABC’s decision to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel “indefinitely” following conservative criticism for these remarks: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

Closer to home, a Barrington teacher faced conservative scorn for his remarks about Kirk, and the School Committee appointed an outside lawyer to review the matter. In a statement, the Rhode Island ACLU condemned political violence since it chills and erodes the First Amendment.

“At the same time,” the civil liberties group added, “stifling controversial, and even offensive, speech in response to that violence also erodes those principles.”

Kirk has been cited as an exemplar of free speech – “Charlie Kirk was practicing politics the right way,” argued Ezra Klein – so the idea of suppressing speech in his memory strikes some as ironic. President Trump continues to wage legal fights against media organizations, even as the response of Trump’s FCC chair to Kimmel discomfited GOP senators.

Big TV corporations with local operations figure in the fallout: WPRI owner Nexstar (which is seeking FCC approval of a $6.2-billion deal) said its ABC affiliates would preempt Kimmel’s show. Sinclair (which owns WJAR and recently acquired the non-license operations of WLNE) went further, calling on the FCC and ABC to take additional action after Kimmel’s suspension.

Back in the Ocean State, the RI ACLU said the probe of the Barrington teacher highlights the danger of stifling speech: “While speech directly intended to provoke violence is not protected by the First Amendment, the ability to speak freely in one’s private capacity about public issues – including the right to criticize, challenge and denounce opposing political views, however crudely – must be safeguarded, especially when that speech is considered unpopular or provocative. Otherwise, everybody’s free speech is at risk, dependent on the political tides.”

THE CHALLENGER: Helena Buonanno Foulkes sat down with me last week for a lengthy video interview. Here are some key highlights.

***Gov. Dan McKee’s campaign has made clear that Foulkes’ role at CVS Health will be a key issue in the governor’s campaign. Asked why the central claim made in a federal lawsuit against CVS is wrong – that the company failed in its role as a gatekeeper of highly addictive drugs – Foulkes blamed the opioid crisis on Purdue Pharma and said CVS was a leader in responding. “We cut off over 600 pill-mill doctors. We did the biggest drug takeback movement the country’s ever seen. And I personally led an effort where I got together with other chain drugstore leaders to make sure we advocated for legislation to reduce the number of pills you could get when you left minor surgery,” she said. CVS, WalMart and Walgreens have paid out millions in settlements related to opioids, so should there have been more skepticism about surging opioid prescriptions? “I think it’s really easy to Monday morning quarterback,” Foulkes responded. She said pharmacists tried their best to assess whether patients had a legitimate need for medication.

***During her campaign announcement, Foulkes pledged to work energetically to grow jobs in Rhode Island. Her rhetoric on that sounded a lot like what Gina Raimondo said when she ran in 2014. Data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve shows that Rhode Island’s labor participation rate remained largely flat under Raimondo until the COVID pandemic. So why would things be any different with Foulkes? She said she would target better-paying jobs.

***Asked if she could invite anyone to a dinner party from throughout the course of human history, Foulkes picked Rosa Parks, Nancy Pelosi, George Washington, Gandhi and one of the founders of Salve Regina University.

THE INCUMBENT: Gov. McKee, not surprisingly, appears to be aiming to elevate his profile as we edge into campaign season: He urged the Public Utilities Commission to deliver at least $25 million in additional energy rate relief; McKee also directed the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner to make an aggressive review of what is driving health insurance premium increases and identify ways to confront them. McKee announced the availability of an additional $500,000 to support RIPTA; he signed on with fellow governors in a joint letter urging Congress to help reduce health insurance costs; McKee was interviewed for a PBS NewsHour piece on economic fallout from the Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind.

THE SPEAKER: As he ponders his possible entry to the race for governor, House Speaker Joe Shekarchi said Hasbro was hell-bent on leaving Pawtucket for the bauble of Boston’s Seaport District.

“They were not interested” in subsidies and land being offered by local officials in Rhode Island, Shekarchi told the Law 401 podcast from Roger Williams University School of Law. “They wanted to move for two reasons [for things] that we don’t have around: they wanted to go to a talent pool, an employment pool, that had a lot of experience in online gaming …. The other issue moving to Boston, they wanted to be near Lego .… The handwriting was on the wall for Hasbro. They really didn’t want to stay here.” That’s a contrast from May, when lawmakers made a change requested by FM to help keep the big insurer in Rhode Island.

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL: Amid news that commercial health premiums for nearly 175,000 Rhode Islanders will climb next year, AG Peter Neronha offered this comment via Bluesky: “These increases are awarded by the Health Commissioner in a vacuum – without any appreciation of the overall health care crisis in RI – and where he has offered little. Rhode Islanders have every right to be upset with the Gov for ignoring the crisis that we have been speaking about for so long.”

PVD: Providence Mayor Brett Smiley has scaled the heights of state and city government since he came to Rhode Island to manage Charlie Fogarty’s gubernatorial campaign way back in 2006. For now, Smiley remains an odds-on favorite to win reelection next year. But state Rep. David Morales (D-Providence) argues Smiley isn’t doing enough to tackle the capital city’s affordability crisis, and he announced his challenge to Smiley this week.

“It’s time City Hall worked for us,” Morales, 27, said while unveiling his run via video this week. “For too long, politicians like Brett Smiley have asked us to trust their experience while working families are struggling to get by. The cost of living is crushing us.” (Smiley’s campaign said he’s focused on governing and touted his experience in finance, management and government.) Smiley has a big edge in campaign fundraising, and he’s built his recognition and political relationships over time. Morales hopes to channel the paradigm-shift of Zohran Mamdani. Will it be enough to build a citywide coalition and chip away at the incumbent’s East Side base? (You can watch my recent interview with Morales to get a better sense of him.) For now, it’s worth noting how one of the candidates for an open Ward 2 seat, Jill Davidson, worked with Morales before his recent departure from the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council.

DISMAL SCIENCE: A few economic notes ….

***With President Trump pursuing a remake of the Federal Reserve, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will keynote the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce’s Economic Outlook Luncheon on noon Tuesday at the Crowne Plaza in Warwick.

***The Rhode Island Life Science Hub, per spokeswoman Sarah Sutton, “announced the investment of $4 million in nondilutive funding to 5 companies either relocating to Rhode Island or building their businesses in the state. With these most recent awards, RILSH has now deployed a total of $16M since its launch to RI-based companies.” However, there are more grim tidings about Boston’s “biotech winter,” as Kara Miller reports in the Globe.

***The number of Rhode Island based jobs rose by 500 from July to August, as the state’s unemployment rate fell from 4.8 to 4.6%, per the RI Department of Labor and Training.

***Paige Parks from Rhode Island KIDS COUNT warns that greater efforts to address childhood poverty in the state are vital “since children who live in poverty, especially at a young age, have worse outcomes as adults.”

HOUSING: House GOP Leader Michael Chippendale (R-Foster) led the charge last week in asserting that RIHousing, the state’s housing finance agency, spends too much on administration and not enough on developing housing. He said there should be an audit to dig deeper. The quasi-public agency rejects Chippendale’s criticism.",http://warwickonline.com/images/og-warwick.png,N,,2025-09-25 13:16:15.962111

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.","Investors in Kraft Heinz Co (Symbol: KHC) saw new options become available today, for the November 7th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KHC options chain for the new November 7th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $23.00 strike price has a current bid of 4 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $23.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $22.96 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KHC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $26.36/share today.

Because the $23.00 strike represents an approximate 13% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 75%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.17% return on the cash commitment, or 1.47% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Kraft Heinz Co, and highlighting in green where the $23.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $27.00 strike price has a current bid of 50 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of KHC stock at the current price level of $26.36/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $27.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.32% if the stock gets called away at the November 7th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KHC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Kraft Heinz Co, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing KHC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $27.00 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $27.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.90% boost of extra return to the investor, or 16.09% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 68%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 51%.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $26.36) to be 25%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

The Shanghai Summer International Consumption Season, running from July to October each year, has become a signature event showcasing the city's culture, travel, sports, and entertainment.
Global retailers further enriched the season with flagship openings and new retail experiences.
""Shanghai's dynamic business environment and diverse, open-minded consumer base provides IKEA with a valuable platform for innovation,"" said Cindy Ruan, vice president, Communication & Public Affairs, IKEA China.
In terms of store displays, IKEA Shanghai has actively embraced local characteristics by capitalizing on three major trends among shoppers: the coffee culture, the elderly shoppers' group, and the pet economy.","Editor's note:

As global investors recalibrate amid uncertainty, Shanghai remains a magnet.

The figures tell part of the story. As of the end of June this year, the number of foreign-invested entities paying taxes in Shanghai rose 18.7 percent compared with 2020. In the first seven months of 2025 alone, 3,624 new foreign firms registered, a 3.1 percent year-on-year increase, bringing in close to US$10 billion in fresh capital.

Behind these numbers lies a larger question: how will Shanghai sustain its appeal while much of the world economy slows? In the months ahead, this column will explore how policy changes, corporate strategies, and on-the-ground dynamics continue to shape investment in the city.

The Shanghai Summer International Consumption Season, running from July to October each year, has become a signature event showcasing the city's culture, travel, sports, and entertainment.

This year, Shanghai rolled out a range of tailored experiences for international travelers and customers, from pop culture and fitness to traditional aesthetics and urban discoveries, along with perks such as multi-day tour passes. The city is also leveraging shopping festivals, exhibitions, and sports events to boost inbound tourism.

From January to June, the city welcomed 4.248 million inbound tourists, up 38.5 percent year-on-year. Sales of tax-free goods for tourists surged 85 percent, with purchases under the ""refund on purchase"" scheme soaring 28.1 times compared to the previous year.

Global retailers further enriched the season with flagship openings and new retail experiences.

Coach

In May, American fashion brand Coach opened its first resort retail store in China at Shanghai Disney Resort, combining shopping with social spaces and offering signature collections alongside Disney-exclusive editions. Adjacent to the shopping area, the Coach Café serves classic coffee beverages, specialty pastries, and other signature treats.

Coach has rolled out a series of targeted service initiatives across its multiple stores in Shanghai, including multilingual assistance and payment convenience, tax-free shopping guidance and tax refund services, city-specific customized offerings, and digital support solutions.

These are all designed to enhance the shopping experience for international visitors.

""We remain committed to pioneering new localized consumer experiences, unlocking more possibilities for a better life for consumers, and injecting fresh momentum into Shanghai's development as an international consumption hub,"" said Liliana Lucioni, president of Coach China.

Through diverse and innovative business models, it keeps up efforts to help build Shanghai's reputation as a premier launchpad for new products. Coach is focused on delivering products and experiences that resonate with Chinese consumers and align closely with local preferences, she noted.

The first Coach Coffee Shop was unveiled at Shanghai New World Daimaru last year, representing the global fashion house's latest venture into crafting interactive experiences for local consumers' evolving appetite and desire for self-expression.

The many successful pilot and debut products as well as new initiatives and achievements have inspired us to continue bringing more opportunities for a better life to Chinese consumers, she said.

L'Oréal

L'Oréal – a Paris-based international company rooted in Shanghai for 28 years – has staged immersive activations, bold product innovations and engaging consumer touchpoints during the summer consumption season, and has blended technology, art and lifestyle to make beauty Shanghai's latest calling card and ignite a surge in summer consumption.

In July, L'Oréal AirLight Pro Hairdryer was launched, which aims to deliver an unparalleled drying and styling experience for salon clients, following its debut at last year's China International Import Expo.

The ""Lancôme Génifique Ultimate Lotion Launch Event"" was a two-day limited-time urban water park hosted at the Jing'an Kerry Centre in August. It staged a160-meter pool, a semi-transparent blue lifebuoy canopy, and giant product models to create a stunning visual juxtaposition and attendees experienced and shared the product's key selling points organically, sparking a viral ""urban water fun"" trend.

Creating these immersive experience scenarios and fostering emotional connections is the latest response to consumers today who seek not only products, but also the emotional value and the experience behind them.

""Shanghai is the ideal global launchpad for many new brands and products. Leveraging the city's vibrant consumer market and forward-thinking consumer mindset, we will continue to launch more new products and brands here, solidifying Shanghai as the premier destination and trendsetter for global beauty trends,"" said Lan Zhenzhen, chief corporate affairs and engagement officer of L'Oréal North Asia and China.

L'Oréal is boosting research and innovation investment in Shanghai. Through open innovation programs like BIG BANG, it encourages startups and SMEs to accelerate their innovative efforts, aiming to catalyze significant advancements in beauty technology solutions and reshape the future of beauty.

Apart from product offerings, it's also leading the way with new consumption concepts: the pioneering ""The Beauty of Longevity"" concept was unveilded earlier this year in Shanghai, and it intends to drive innovation, deepening partnerships with industry players, and bringing the ""New-Age Beauty"" concept to a wider audience.

IKEA

IKEA's Xuhui outlet was unveiled in Shanghai 27 years ago as the Swedish furniture giant's first physical store in China and amidst a rapidly evolving retail landscape, it keeps on focusing on the genuine needs of Chinese families, offering integrated home furnishing solutions tailored to Chinese consumers' preferences, becoming their trusted ""home furnishing expert"".

""Shanghai's dynamic business environment and diverse, open-minded consumer base provides IKEA with a valuable platform for innovation,"" said Cindy Ruan, vice president, Communication & Public Affairs, IKEA China.

IKEA has consistently deepened its local connections in the city by offering products, solutions, and professional services tailored to the needs of local consumers, she explained.

A series of refreshing summer drinks were offered in its restaurants in Shanghai stores during the hot weather to diversify the beverage menu for shoppers.

Six home living scenarios were set up inside the ""IKEA Blue House, Home's Hidden Playbook"" time-limit exhibition in early September.

Staged at Tank Shanghai art park, it's part of the Shanghai Summer tailor-made events to introduce new products as well as new brand positioning to Chinese consumers to enhance home living experiences.

In the new fiscal year starting on September, the group plans to introduce over 1,600 new furniture and home goods items, 23 new product collections, and more than 50 new food offerings, hoping to align with consumer's lifestyle needs and expectations.

In terms of store displays, IKEA Shanghai has actively embraced local characteristics by capitalizing on three major trends among shoppers: the coffee culture, the elderly shoppers' group, and the pet economy.",https://obj.shine.cn/files/2025/09/19/a6b139ef-92e7-4409-9f12-c52c3ca26505_0.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:17:20.900090

PALO ALTO, CA, UNITED STATES, September 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- For organizations choosing new notebooks for their teams, artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical consideration. As AI becomes a part of every business workflow, it’s more and more critical to invest in devices that can handle on-device AI processing smoothly and quickly. Of course, notebooks still need to deliver good battery life and strong performance for everyday work applications, and depending on the industry, performance for resource-intensive and graphics-intensive apps may also be a consideration.

Principled Technologies (PT) compared an HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 processor to a Dell Pro 14 Plus laptop powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro and a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 laptop powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro. PT found that the HP system delivered advantages in a number of areas, including multitasking performance and AI performance. The PT report covers these results and what they mean, as well as looking at privacy protection, thermal performance, serviceability, battery life, and more.

According to the report, “For the demands of next-gen workloads, your teams need a system

and processor designed to handle AI and other rising applications. Delivering high performance scores, a workday’s worth of battery life, and comfortable physical user experiences, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC we tested also featured quickly serviceable components, a helpful built-in AI assistant, and intelligent privacy features. Compared to a Dell Pro 14 Plus and a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, each powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro, the AMD Ryzen™ AI 7 PRO 350 processor-powered HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC is a powerful and performant choice for the AI era.”

Johnson & Sons for falsely marketing their packaging as recyclable",Not Available,,,,,https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-bimbo-sc-johnson-plastic-bags-recycling-lawsuit/,"Philadelphia is suing two major manufacturers for allegedly mislabeling plastic bags as recyclable.
The lawsuit says the companies are misleading consumers into thinking that if they recycle the plastic bags, they will be made into new products.
Philadelphia banned all single-use plastic bags and non-recyclable paper bags in 2019 in an effort to reduce waste and save money.
Residents used nearly 1 billion plastic bags a year — bags that littered local streets and waterways and got caught in recycling plant machinery, creating dangerous conditions, according to the city.
""Largely due to manufacturers' deceptive statements to consumers that they can recycle plastic bags, plastic film is the number one contaminant causing problems for Philadelphia's municipal recycling system,"" the lawsuit says.","Philadelphia is suing two major manufacturers for allegedly mislabeling plastic bags as recyclable.

Bimbo Bakeries, a bakery product manufacturer with its U.S. headquarters in Horsham, Montgomery County, and S.C. Johnson & Son, a household supply manufacturer, have engaged in ""parallel deceptive marketing,"" leading consumers to think they can buy the companies' products without contributing to plastic waste, according to a lawsuit the city filed Tuesday in the Court of Common Pleas with co-counsel Hausfeld LLP, a Philadelphia firm.

Language and symbols – including the chasing arrows symbol – used on Bimbo's plastic film bread bags and on S.C. Johnson's Ziploc bag packaging ""is profoundly misleading at best,"" the lawsuit says. ""Even if it is theoretically possible to recycle plastic bags under limited circumstances, technical and economic realities foreseeably make it so that no matter how hard consumers try to recycle those plastic bags, those bags will nevertheless almost always go to waste.""

Bimbo brands include Thomas', Sara Lee, Entenmann's, Arnold, Freihofer's and Stroehmann Pennsylvania Dutch Bakers. S.C. Johnson has owned the Ziploc brand since 1998, according to the lawsuit.

The city is seeking injunctions against the companies to revise their labels related to recycling, and suing for an undisclosed amount of damages.

Bimbo said in an emailed statement that it is ""committed to zero waste across our operations, including consumer packaging, and to being a strong partner in every community we serve, especially our hometown of Philadelphia.""

The company had not yet been served with the complaint and would review it upon receipt, Bimbo said.

S.C. Johnson & Son did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit says the companies are misleading consumers into thinking that if they recycle the plastic bags, they will be made into new products.

""Companies that label their products with the goal of implying their product is recyclable when it isn't are not just breaking the law, but they are violating public trust and contributing to waste,"" Mayor Cherelle Parker said in a press release.

The bank’s stress test, published in Navigating Nature Risk: Applying the TNFD’s LEAP Framework, analysed 250 mines linked to 30 companies and about 9,000 European power facilities. It found that transition risks such as higher water prices, stricter pollution rules, expansion of protected areas and increased minerals recycling pose the greatest threat to miners.

Power companies faced smaller potential earnings declines of around 10%, mainly due to physical risks such as droughts and floods.

The World Economic Forum estimates that adopting nature-positive practices could unlock over $430 billion in cost savings and new revenue across the mining and metals value chain by 2030. Yet nearly three-quarters of mining assets overlap with sensitive locations, most commonly areas of high physical water risk. Copper mines, concentrated in water-stressed countries such as Australia, South Africa and Chile, were the most exposed.

Barclays said biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation are emerging as systemic financial risks. “These risks are increasingly materialising across our clients’ operations,” said Marie Freier, head of sustainability.

Things to Know Ahead of UNFI’s Q4 Earnings

UNFI is expected to have been pressured by the cybersecurity incident disclosed in early June, which forced management to shut down IT systems and disrupt distribution. The company expects the cyber incident to reduce fiscal 2025 net sales by about $350 million to $400 million and lower adjusted EBITDA by $40 million to $50 million, leading to a total estimated net loss of $50 million to $60 million, which includes the estimated tax impact.

The company has also been dealing with the financial impact of exiting its relationship with Key Food and closing the Allentown distribution center. The contract has been terminated with a $53 million fee that is set to be recognized in the fiscal fourth quarter. These factors are expected to have impacted the top and bottom lines in the to-be-reported quarter.

Despite these near-term challenges, UNFI continues to demonstrate growth and operational resilience, supported by strong demand in its wholesale segment and ongoing consumer interest in natural and organic products. Strategic initiatives, such as expanding its customer base, optimizing the distribution network and investing in automation, have improved efficiency and market reach. Lean management practices have further enhanced execution, aligning supply with customer needs and driving cost savings.

The MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 in 19.5'' for steer and drive axles is designed to take on the challenges of regional and urban transport.

It offers exceptional safety and versatility year-round, in any weather conditions and on any road.

It is essentially designed for trucks that make frequent deliveries on short or mid-distance routes.

The MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D 19.5'' line is available in several sizes (285/70R19.5 since June 1, 2025 and 245/70R19.5 and 265/70R19.5 since September 1, 2025) and approved for most global markets.

Mileage (1), outstanding braking performance (2), versatility and robustness for enhanced safety and durability.

The MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 19.5'' line stands out thanks to its:

Enhanced mileage (1) : MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 tires offer up to 30% more mileage on the steer axle and 15% more mileage on the drive axle compared to the previous generation, for less frequent replacements and lower fleet operating costs.

Outstanding long-lasting braking performance (2): An internal test performed under the supervision of DEKRA in June 2025 showed that when worn down to 3.5 mm of rubber, MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 tires achieved wet braking distances up to 8 m shorter than their competitors (41.36 m vs. 49.29 m), a boon for drivers in urban and suburban areas.[1]

All-season versatility: The 3PMSF marking guarantees consistent year-round performance for safety and easy handling in any weather and road conditions.

Enhanced robustness and retreadability: Innovative Duracoil technology ensures a more robust, longer-lasting casing to limit unplanned downtime and maintain the tire's performance throughout its lifespan.

Optimized rolling resistance (3): These Class C tires save users an average of €705/year/truck and can reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 1 tonne/year/truck compared to the previous generation.

Electric vehicle compatibility (4): With higher load indices in 245/70R19.5 and 285/70R19.5 (e.g. +300 kg per axle compared to the previous line in 285/70R19.5, for up to 6.3 tonnes per axle with the new line), these tires are designed for the increasing popularity of electric vehicles, since they can bear the extra weight of batteries and meet the specific needs of electric trucks.

Last-mile delivery is a major challenge for regional and urban transport.

Increasingly congested city centers and tighter environmental regulations are making last-mile delivery a crucial but often expensive phase for fleet managers.

Last-mile delivery can be stressful for drivers due to frequent braking in heavy traffic, difficulty accessing certain areas in bad weather, road conditions, and low-emissions zone restrictions.

Those demanding conditions are when MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 tires show their full potential: high mileage, outstanding braking performance, all-weather versatility, and high load indices. So many features designed to bring fleet managers and drivers peace-of-mind for urban and regional deliveries, while controlling costs and ensuring optimal safety for every trip.

Michelin's innovation and technological expertise for total performance with no trade-offs

Innovation is central to Michelin's approach: it invests over one billion euros in research and innovation every year and holds over 12,000 active patents worldwide.

The MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 features Duracoil, Powercoil, and Regenion technologies, which are the products of decades of expertise and know-how.

A light, robust, and flexible casing:

Duracoil: A high-quality nylon reinforcement on the bead wire provides effective protection for the casing, ensuring greater stability on the road and extending the tire's lifespan.

Powercoil: New, lighter yet more robust steel cables improve rust-resistance, optimize endurance, and enable increased load capacity, which is key for electric vehicles and intensive use.

A self-regenerating tread sculpture:

Regenion: This award-winning technology is based on self-regenerating tread sculptures produced using 3D metal printing to ensure optimal grip and longevity for treads, while also reducing fuel consumption.

With over 130 years' experience, Michelin continues to support transport professionals with reliable and innovative solutions designed for contemporary challenges, confirming its commitment to safety, sustainable mobility, and total performance with no trade-offs.

H&M CEO Daniel Ervér said: “Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit compared with the same quarter last year.
“This is also reflected in the reception we received on the launch of H&M in Brazil in August.
With the H&M brand’s global strength and a locally relevant customer offering, we have taken an important step into a large fashion market.
The operating profit for the nine-month period amounted to SEK12.03bn with an operating margin of 7.1%.","During the quarter ending 31 August 2025 (Q3), H&M’s operating profit grew 40%, reaching SEK4.91bn, up from SEK3.51bn in the previous year quarter.

H&M’s operating margin now stands at 8.6%.

H&M CEO Daniel Ervér said: “Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit compared with the same quarter last year. The increase in profit shows that we are on the right track as a result of the progress we have made in our plan.

“This is also reflected in the reception we received on the launch of H&M in Brazil in August. With the H&M brand’s global strength and a locally relevant customer offering, we have taken an important step into a large fashion market. We see good potential to grow both in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America.”

H&M’s overall performance in Q3

During the third quarter, H&M’s sales rose by 2% when adjusted for currency fluctuations.

However, there was a 4% reduction in the number of stores compared to the same period in the previous year.

The company’s gross profit remained stable at SEK30.14bn, translating to a gross margin increase to 52.9%, up from 51.1%.

Performance in nine months

H&M experienced a consistent performance with a 2% rise in net sales in local currencies during the first three quarters.

Gross profit for this period stood at SEK88.74bn, corresponding to a gross margin of 52.5%.

The operating profit for the nine-month period amounted to SEK12.03bn with an operating margin of 7.1%.

The company anticipates that sales for September 2025 will align with those from the same month in the previous year.

“In an environment of ongoing uncertainty with cautious consumers, all of us within the H&M group are consistently focusing on our customer offering – always giving the best value for money. Our strong culture, together with good cost control and flexibility, allows us to continue building a stable foundation for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth in an increasingly complex environment, while taking additional important steps towards our ambitious sustainability goals,” Daniel Ervér added.

Store closures and currency impacts cause H&M’s sales to decline amid surge in profit

Chloe Tedford-Jones, apparel analyst at GlobalData says: “Continuing its trend from the previous quarter, H&M’s group sales fell 3.4% to SEK59.0bn in Q3 FY2024/25, however, this was partially hindered by the strength of the Swedish Krona, as sales in constant currency grew 2%. This led sales for the first nine months of its financial year to be down 1.9%, and remain flat in constant currency. H&M attributes its Q3 decline to the continued optimisation of its store network, evidenced by the closure of 135 underperforming locations, while it is also impacted by its ranges remaining less enticing than competitors with better fashion credentials such as Inditex. While the short-term impact of store closures has led the brand to expect sales in local currencies to remain flat in September, cost saving measures have already led to some improvement in operating profit, which rose 40.1% to SEK4.9bn in Q3. This corresponded to an operating margin of 8.6%, an improvement of 2.7ppts on the same period last year, driving a c9% increase in its share price in early morning trading.

“Western, Eastern, and Southern Europe were the group’s best performing regions in Q3, with sales rising 3% in local currencies, likely helped by improving consumer confidence as economic headwinds subside, as well as strong brand visibility. Asia, Oceania and Africa was the group’s worst performing region, where sales fell 2%, carrying out the most store closures in this market as the group continues to crack down on low profitability stores. The combination of cautious consumer spending and the negative impact of ongoing store optimisation limited the group’s performance in its home region of the Nordics, with sales remaining flat. North and South America rose 1%, aided by store openings in new locations, especially in Latin America, with the opening of H&M in Brazil in August of 2025 being well received, and the group planning further expansion in the region.

“Net sales for its Portfolio brands increased by 1% in local currencies in Q3, as stronger fashion credentials at fascias like ARKET and COS boosted sales amid low consumer confidence. The group continues to optimise its store footprint, with over 200 store closures planned for 2025. A large proportion of these closures are for Monki, however, the group plans to refurbish many of these into Weekday stores, a brand with better perceived fashion credentials, particularly among Gen Zs. This is likely to have a negative impact on sales in the short term, however early signs of improvement in local currencies point to a successful transition to growth in the future. The group is also investing in flagship store improvements through curated offerings and technological integration, while also improving its omnichannel offering by upgrading its online channel, allowing online sales to reach over 30% of the group’s revenue in the quarter.

“At the heart of the group’s turnaround is a renewed focus on marketing, with the eponymous H&M brand generating buzz by holding its first fashion show in seven years at London Fashion Week this month, using talent such as Romeo Beckham, Lila Moss and Lola Young to ensure maximum reach among the brand’s core audiences. As H&M continues to redefine itself against ultra-fast fashion and premium competitors, the brand must continue to improve its fashion credentials through marketing and celebrity endorsement..”",https://www.just-style.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/09/HM.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:16:30.795668

Dive Brief:

Kraft Heinz is piloting an AI agent to help employees better access information about the company’s ketchup production process, with plans for more use cases down the line.

The tool, called The Cookbook, went from idea to prototype in fewer than three months, the company told CIO Dive. It was created in partnership with Microsoft and built using Azure OpenAI. Workers have access to 150 years of Kraft Heinz expertise in ketchup production.

“With the stroke of a keyboard or tap on a tablet, users will be able to ask The Cookbook questions on everything from the thickness and color of a batch of Heinz Tomato Ketchup to insights about the efficiency of our production processes,” the company said. The Cookbook is still in the early stages, with just a select group of U.S. team members having access. The company declined to say how many.

Dive Insight:

Kraft Heinz is adding an agent to its AI portfolio in pursuit of efficiency and knowledge preservation. Prior to The Cookbook, the company launched TasteMaker, which was designed to accelerate product development and marketing.

“This is not the first AI agent to be deployed at Kraft Heinz,” Pat Nestor, head of decision intelligence products and platforms, said in an email to CIO Dive. “We continue to explore integrated AI solutions that can drive scalability and connectivity across the organization, unlocking further value for the business, our people and consumers.”

The new tool comes after the global food and beverage giant has honed its innovation funnel, driven in part by efforts to identify the right use cases and formulate business value assessments to track success.

Nestor told CIO Dive earlier this year that the company works to pressure test use cases upfront and monitors AI projects using a mix of quantitative and qualitative metrics. The process helps ensure allocated resources are going to the right use cases and avoid dead-end projects that are plaguing businesses across the economy.

This year, 42% of companies are abandoning the majority of their AI projects, up from 17% in 2024, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence report published in March. CIOs and their enterprises often grapple with connecting use cases to business goals, sifting through vendor hype and failing to prioritize responsible practices, among other implementation challenges.

Kraft Heinz executives have touted a number of beneficial, worker-facing AI use cases, such as within the pickle-producing process and across its supply chain.

“We aim to use key learnings and insights from The Cookbook pilot to scale to other brands, products, and Kraft Heinz businesses, and we are currently in the process of exploring additional use cases for the technology,” Nestor said Tuesday. “We know it’s essential that we preserve and protect our subject matter experts’ knowledge and commitment to quality.”

Despite the AI inroads, significant changes lie ahead for Kraft Heinz.

The food and beverage giant is planning to reverse much of its $46 billion merger from 2015 and split into two companies, with one focusing on sauces, spreads and seasonings, and another housing grocery staples, such as Lunchables and Oscar Mayer. Splits and mergers often include technology hurdles, from migrating workloads to untangling tech debt.

The company has run up against many of the same challenges that others in the industry face, including changing consumer patterns and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In general, the focus on technology has sharpened in the wake of the turmoil as businesses pursue ways to alleviate pressure.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/FQOib67aFQ7NSDw6-jgUTkQfPmpg6n7jinsgQErYkyk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzEyMTY4MzgzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-25 10:09:19.899593

The group is also investing in flagship store improvements through curated offerings and technological integration, while also improving its omnichannel offering by upgrading its online channel, allowing online sales to reach over 30% of the group’s revenue in the quarter.

“At the heart of the group’s turnaround is a renewed focus on marketing, with the eponymous H&M brand generating buzz by holding its first fashion show in seven years at London Fashion Week this month, using talent such as Romeo Beckham, Lila Moss and Lola Young to ensure maximum reach among the brand’s core audiences.

The company, however, cautioned that tariffs on imports would weigh more heavily on margins in the current quarter.

In a statement, H&M said its autumn collections had been “well received.” Chief executive Daniel Erver, who took over in January 2024, said the company was “taking further steps in the right direction” as he continued efforts to improve profitability and sharpen the brand’s appeal against fast-fashion rivals such as Shein and Inditex’s Zara.

Operating profit for June to August rose to US $ 531 million, up from US $ 380 million a year earlier, and beating analyst expectations of around US $ 400 million in a poll conducted by LSEG. The result followed two consecutive quarters of falling earnings and was driven by a 2% rise in local-currency sales alongside improved efficiency.

Despite the profit beat, H&M warned that tariff-related costs would be more pronounced in the current quarter, which runs through November.

Analysts at JP Morgan said the performance could prompt higher expectations for the full year, although they noted that H&M’s comments on tariffs were more restrained than anticipated. Both JP Morgan and Alphavalue welcomed a 9% drop in inventory levels, with the retailer reporting stronger full-price sales as shoppers purchased more items in season.

H&M said markdowns in the third quarter were slightly higher than a year earlier and are expected to rise further in the fourth quarter, partly because Black Friday falls one day earlier this year.

Sales fell to US $ 6.2 billion from US $ 6.4 billion, slightly above analyst expectations of US $ 6.15 billion. Local-currency sales in September were expected to remain flat compared with an unusually strong figure in the same month last year.

The company, whose customers are considered more price-sensitive than those of Inditex, has faced sustained pressure as consumers cut spending amid higher living costs. With the prospect of higher US tariffs, H&M has also been working to diversify its supply chain by sourcing closer to its second-largest market after Germany.",https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HM-reports-stronger-than-expected-Q3-profit-but-warns-of-tariff-impact.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 09:14:08.542323

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Swedish fashion group H&M reported on Thursday a substantially larger than expected rise in third-quarter profit as customers responded well to its autumn collections, although the company warned of a tariff-related impact in the current quarter.

Shares in the world's second-largest listed apparel retailer soared 10% in mid-morning trade, taking a year-to-date rise to 16%.

""The autumn collections have been well received,"" H&M said in a statement.

NEW CEO TARGETS FASHION-CONSCIOUS SHOPPER

Daniel Erver, CEO since January 2024, has been working to improve profitability and appeal to shoppers with trendier styles, aiming to compete with fast-fashion rivals Shein and Inditex's Zara as the sector contends with disruption from U.S. tariffs.

""We are taking further steps in the right direction,"" he said on Thursday.

After two consecutive quarters of falling earnings, H&M said June-August operating profit jumped to 4.91 billion crowns ($523 million) from a year-ago 3.51 billion supported by a 2% increase in local-currency sales, a stronger product mix and tighter cost control.

Analysts polled by LSEG had on average forecast a profit of 3.68 billion crowns.

H&M cautioned that tariffs on imports would weigh more heavily on margins in the current quarter, which runs through November.

JP Morgan analysts said the profit beat may prompt higher expectations for the full year, noting meanwhile that the comment on tariff impact may be slightly more subdued than some had anticipated.

MORE IN-SEASON SHOPPING AT FULL PRICE

Analysts at JP Morgan and Alphavalue also welcomed a 9% drop in inventory levels as the retailer said shoppers were buying more products in season - at full price rather than in end-of-season sales.

H&M said markdowns in the quarter were marginally bigger than a year ago, and that it expects them to be up somewhat in the fourth quarter, partly because Black Friday falls one day earlier.

Sales in reported currency fell to 57.0 billion crowns from 59.0 billion, slightly above the expected 56.8 billion.

The company said it expected local-currency sales in September to be flat compared with an unusually high year-ago figure.

H&M, whose customer base is considered more price-sensitive than Inditex’s, has faced greater pressure in recent years as consumers tighten spending amid higher living costs and global uncertainty.

The outlook for higher U.S. tariffs has pushed H&M to seek suppliers closer to the U.S. market - its second-biggest after Germany, accounting last year for 13% of group sales.

But currency effects impacted growth by around five percent. Sales were up 2 percent in local currencies during the three months to Aug. 31, while store count was reduced by 4 percent versus the same time last year.

The impact of a strong Swedish krona made those numbers less rosy, with net sales falling from 59.01 billion Swedish krona, about 5.14 billion euros, to 57.02 Swedish krona, or 4.97 billion euros.

Stricter cost controls, with administrative expenses falling 5 percent to 25.17 billion Swedish krona, and one percent in local currencies, combined with a reduction in stock of 9 percent in Swedish krona and 1 percent in local currencies, helped with the boost.

“We are taking further steps in the right direction. Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit by 40 percent compared with the same quarter last year while also having reduced the stock-in-trade,” said chief executive officer Daniel Ervér.

The stronger-than-expected yet mixed results reflected Ervér’s efforts to lay the groundwork for recovery.

“We think H&M has taken various steps to improve its offer for customers, which should lead to a stronger sales performance in time. However, a lot of things have to improve together and so far the recovery has been somewhat unbalanced in our view,” RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain said in a trading note.

“We see potential for H&M to move closer to a double-digit operating margin goal over time, driven by gross margin gains and further cost efficiencies, but we see this as more of a longer term aspiration,” he added.

H&M has been squeezed between the Chinese low-cost, ultra-fast fashion players like Shein and Temu on the pricing end, and Inditex’s behemoth Zara, which has strengthened its fashion credibility, on the other end.

Ervér has been trying to upscale the brand and bring back its cool factor, including partnerships with celebrities such as Charli XCX, a runway show at London Fashion Week and downsizing its massive stores while upscaling their design quotient.

“Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit compared with the same quarter last year. The increase in profit shows that we are on the right track as a result of the progress we have made in our plan,” he said.

Smaller stores indicate where he wants to take the brand. “This is a good example of how we are developing the customer experience but also strengthening our brand,” he added.

H&M also launched in Brazil in the quarter, and has its sights set on expansion across Latin America.

“We continue to focus fully on updating a large part of our stores globally, with improvements in layout, presentation and tech to further enhance the customer experience, while at the same time the physical and digital channels strengthen and complement each other,” he said.

“In an environment of ongoing uncertainty with cautious consumers, all of us within the H&M group are consistently focusing on our customer offering – always giving the best value for money.”

Looking ahead, sales in early September were “on par” with the same month last year, when they rose 11 percent.

“Overall, H&M is showing clear progress on its turnaround journey.","H&M Group has delivered a strong third quarter (June to August 2025), with operating profit rising by 40% to SEK 4,914 million (£388.77m), compared with SEK 3,507 million (£277.42m) in the same period last year.

According to its nine-month interim report, which was released today (25 September), H&M Group recorded an increased operating margin of 8.6%, compared to 5.9% a year ago.

While net sales in local currencies climbed 2% in Q3, the stronger Swedish krona impacted recorded sales. The group reported SEK 57,017 million (£4.51 billion) in sales, down from SEK 59,011 million (£4.51bn).

The brand – which owns H&M, COS, & Other Stories and Arket – said gross profit in Q3 stood at SEK 30,143 million (£2.38bn), delivering a gross margin of 52.9%, up from 51.1% in the same period last year.

The report attributes the margin enhancement to improvements across supply chain operations and favourable external cost factors, offsetting some adverse currency effects.

On the cost side, the group reduced selling and administrative expenses by 5% in SEK terms to SEK 25,167 million (£1.99bn).

The company highlighted that cost control has been a critical lever in strengthening profitability.

As of 31 August 2025, the group operated 4,118 stores globally — a net reduction of 180 stores (–4%) year-on-year. During the first nine months, 36 new stores opened and 171 closed.

Over 30% of H&M’s sales now occur online and the business said it is enhancing customer experience via upgraded store layouts, tech investments, and tighter alignment between physical and digital channels.

H&M launched its first store, and an online presence, in Brazil at end of August 2025, with further store openings planned across Latin America. Other planned expansions include El Salvador, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Malta, via franchise, as well as the first COS store in India.

H&M expects sales in September 2025 to match last year’s levels in local currency terms, but said this must be viewed against strong comparatives from 2024.

To mitigate pressures ahead, H&M says it will lean on supply chain flexibility, pricing strategy and cost control.

Robyn Duffy, consumer markets senior analyst at RSM UK, said the latest results show H&M’s “turnaround strategy is making progress”.

“Despite sluggish sales growth of just 2% in local currencies, operating profit surged 40% on the back of tighter stock management, an improved gross margin and firm cost control. A sharper product mix and faster stock turnaround reduced inventory by 9% year-on-year, easing markdowns and lifting margins.

“Overall, H&M is showing clear progress on its turnaround journey. The next challenge will be sustaining profitability while continuing to invest in product, customer experience, stores and digital capability to reinforce its global position.”

The report attributes the margin enhancement to improvements across supply chain operations and favourable external cost factors, offsetting some adverse currency effects.

On the cost side, the group reduced selling and administrative expenses by 5% in SEK terms to SEK 25,167 million (£1.99bn).

The company highlighted that cost control has been a critical lever in strengthening profitability.

As of 31 August 2025, the group operated 4,118 stores globally — a net reduction of 180 stores (–4%) year-on-year. During the first nine months, 36 new stores opened and 171 closed.

Over 30% of H&M’s sales now occur online and the business said it is enhancing customer experience via upgraded store layouts, tech investments, and tighter alignment between physical and digital channels.

H&M launched its first store, and an online presence, in Brazil at end of August 2025, with further store openings planned across Latin America. Other planned expansions include El Salvador, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Malta, via franchise, as well as the first COS store in India.

H&M expects sales in September 2025 to match last year’s levels in local currency terms, but said this must be viewed against strong comparatives from 2024.

To mitigate pressures ahead, H&M says it will lean on supply chain flexibility, pricing strategy and cost control.

Robyn Duffy, consumer markets senior analyst at RSM UK, said the latest results show H&M’s “turnaround strategy is making progress”.

“Despite sluggish sales growth of just 2% in local currencies, operating profit surged 40% on the back of tighter stock management, an improved gross margin and firm cost control. A sharper product mix and faster stock turnaround reduced inventory by 9% year-on-year, easing markdowns and lifting margins.

“Overall, H&M is showing clear progress on its turnaround journey. The next challenge will be sustaining profitability while continuing to invest in product, customer experience, stores and digital capability to reinforce its global position.”

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Swedish fashion group H&M reported on Thursday a substantially bigger rise than expected in third-quarter profit as shoppers took to autumn styles, but warned of higher tariff related costs in the current quarter.

The world's second-largest listed apparel retailer predicted the cost of tariffs on imports would have a bigger impact on gross margin in the three months through November.

H&M is trying to boost profitability and attract shoppers through trendier clothes to compete with Shein and Inditex' Zara, while U.S. tariffs disrupt the fast-fashion industry.

""The autumn collections have been well received,"" H&M said in a statement.

Following two consecutive fiscal quarters of falling earnings, June-August operating profit was 4.91 billion crowns ($523 million) against a year-earlier 3.51 billion and a mean forecast in an LSEG poll of analysts of 3.68 billion, on sales growth measured in local currencies of 2%.

H&M said it expected local-currency sales in September to be flat compared with a high year-ago figure.

It said markdowns in the third quarter were marginally bigger than a year earlier, and that it expects them to be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter, partly because Black Friday falls one day earlier.

In reported currency, sales fell in the third quarter, to 57.0 billion crowns from 59.0 billion against an expected 56.8 billion.

H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB Nine-month report 2025

Third quarter (1 June 2025 — 31 August 2025)

Sales in local currencies increased by 2 percent in the third quarter, with 4 percent fewer stores at the end of the quarter compared with the same point in time last year. Converted into SEK, net sales amounted to SEK 57,017 m (59,011). Net sales in SEK were negatively affected by a currency translation effect of around 5 percentage points due to the strengthened Swedish krona.

Gross profit amounted to SEK 30,143 m (30,133), which corresponds to a gross margin of 52.9 percent (51.1).

Selling and administrative expenses decreased by 5 percent to SEK 25,167 m (26,602). In local currencies these expenses decreased by 1 percent.

Operating profit increased by 40 percent to SEK 4,914 m (3,507), corresponding to an operating margin of 8.6 percent (5.9). An improved customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control have contributed to the increase in profit in the quarter.

The result after tax increased to SEK 3,212 m (2,3061), corresponding to SEK 2.01 (1.441) per share.

Cash flow from operating activities increased to SEK 9,985 m (8,215).

The stock-in-trade decreased by 9 percent to SEK 37,938 m (41,738) and the composition of the stock-in-trade is assessed to be good. Currency adjusted the stock-in-trade decreased by 3 percent compared with the previous year. The stock-in-trade in SEK represented 16.4 percent (17.8) of rolling 12 months sales.

H&M opened its first store as well as online in Brazil at the end of August, which has been very well received by customers.

Nine months (1 December 2024 — 31 August 2025)

In local currencies net sales increased by 2 percent in the first nine months of the financial year. Converted into SEK, the H&M group’s net sales amounted to SEK 169,064 m (172,285).

Gross profit amounted to SEK 88,737 m (91,357). This corresponds to a gross margin of 52.5 percent (53.0).

Selling and administrative expenses amounted to SEK 76,594 m (78,612). In local currencies these expenses were on par with the previous year.

Operating profit amounted to SEK 12,031 m (12,682), corresponding to an operating margin of 7.1 percent (7.4).

The result after tax amounted to SEK 7,753 m (8,6011), corresponding to SEK 4.86 (5.351) per share.

Cash flow from operating activities amounted to SEK 22,714 m (24,782).

The autumn collections have been well received. In local currencies the H&M group’s sales in the month of September 2025 are expected to be on par with the same month last year. Sales development in September 2025 should be seen in the light of high comparative figures from last year.

H&M ranks as number 1 out of 200 fashion companies in the latest What Fuels Fashion? report by Fashion Revolution, which evaluates companies transparency on decarbonisation and other sustainability areas.

“We are taking further steps in the right direction. Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit by 40 percent compared with the same quarter last year while also having reduced the stock-in-trade,” says Daniel Ervér, CEO.

Comments by Daniel Ervér, CEO

The positive sales trend continued in the third quarter. Sales increased by 2 percent in local currencies during the period, while at the same time the number of stores decreased by 4 percent at the end of the quarter compared with the same point in time last year.

Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit compared with the same quarter last year. The increase in profit shows that we are on the right track as a result of the progress we have made in our plan.

This is also reflected in the reception we received on the launch of H&M in Brazil in August. With the H&M brand’s global strength and a locally relevant customer offering, we have taken an important step into a large fashion market. We see good potential to grow both in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America.

In September we opened a new flagship store in Le Marais, Paris, with a specially curated assortment, presentation and interior design concept. This is a good example of how we are developing the customer experience but also strengthening our brand. Another example is the upgrade of our digital store that was rolled out earlier this year. We are getting positive feedback from our customers and can see that the digital store has made an important contribution to the profitable growth in the quarter. We continue to focus fully on updating a large part of our stores globally, with improvements in layout, presentation and tech to further enhance the customer experience, while at the same time the physical and digital channels strengthen and complement each other.

In an environment of ongoing uncertainty with cautious consumers, all of us within the H&M group are consistently focusing on our customer offering – always giving the best value for money. Our strong culture, together with good cost control and flexibility, allows us to continue building a stable foundation for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth in an increasingly complex environment, while taking additional important steps towards our ambitious sustainability goals.

The European standard Optigal® range is engineered to perform in harsh environments, offering unmatched corrosion resistance and durability.

The Union Territory’s intense cold, long monsoons, and freeze–thaw cycles often lead to rust and erode steel’s structural integrity, driving demand for highly durable steel that resists corrosion. Optigal® Prime is designed to meet this urgent need, making it ideal for mountain homes as well as large-scale, high-end infrastructure and construction projects such as state-of-the-art airports, railway stations, highways, and other critical developments across the region.

Developed by ArcelorMittal – one of its parent companies, Optigal® range sets a new benchmark for durability. The product’s debut in Jammu & Kashmir strengthens AM/NS India’s leadership in pioneering a new market segment for high-quality C4 specialty steel – a grade previously unavailable in the country, making the company the sole domestic producer.

Mr. Ranjan Dhar, Director and Vice President of Sales & Marketing at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India) said, “Optigal® Prime’s availability in Jammu & Kashmir reiterates our commitment to provide quality, durable, and sustainable innovations to our diverse range of customers, be it individual home builders or customers involved in large-scale projects. The European standard Optigal® range is engineered to perform in harsh environments, offering unmatched corrosion resistance and durability. We believe this offering will play a key role in building future-ready constructn and infrastructure across the region which is quality conscious. This new offering is available for the first time in India, outside of Europe where it has been a favourite product.”

Mr Dhar also highlighted AM/NS India’s recent contributions to the region’s infrastructure transformation, including supplying steel for two iconic projects: the world’s highest rail bridge – ‘Chenab Bridge’ (with 100% of steel supplied); and India’s first and only cable-stayed rail bridge – ‘Anji Khad Bridge’ (with 70% of steel supplied).

Optigal® Prime offers a 15-year warranty and advanced finishes such as Silicon Modified Polyester (SMP), Super Durable Polyester (SDP), and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF). Designed for roofing, cladding, and a range of architectural applications, it is built for environments that demand resilience. The technology of Zinc-Aluminium-Magnesium coating used for it provides up to three times the protection against corrosion and weathering compared to conventional coatings.

Six specialised variants, High Gloss, Anti-Dust, Anti-Graffiti, Anti-Static, Anti-Microbial, and Cool Roof, make Optigal® Prime a versatile range of high-performance steel. Whether used in sloping mountain home roofs or cladding for public buildings that face year-round weather swings in Jammu and Kashmir, the variants are built to ensure endurance without compromise.

Manufactured at AM/NS India’s advanced facility in Pune, Optigal® Prime reflects the ‘Make in India’ mission and meets strict sustainability standards. It features low Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), contains no heavy metals or hexavalent chromium, and is fully recyclable. The company currently produces seven lakh tonnes of colour-coated steel annually, with plans to reach 1 million tonnes.",https://pimwp.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/2025/09/Farhana-PIM-Template-1.png,N,,2025-09-25 15:12:33.931072

Privia Health is acquiring a value-based primary care business from Evolent Health as the physician enablement company continues to expand its care delivery network into new geographies.

Evolent has agreed to sell its accountable care organization business, called Evolent Care Partners, for $100 million in cash, the companies announced aftermarket Tuesday. Another $13 million is contingent on the ACO’s performance in traditional Medicare’s largest value-based care program in 2025.

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and positively contribute to Privia’s adjusted earnings next year. Analysts said the deal is favorable for both parties.

Dive Insight:

Privia Health is one of the biggest physician enablement companies in the U.S., with a footprint in 15 states and Washington, D.C. The company, which went public in 2021, helps medical groups, hospitals and other providers implement value-based care arrangements in which financial payouts are tied to patient outcomes, care quality and other metrics instead of being based on the volume or complexity of services provided.

Through the acquisition, which Privia is financing with cash on hand, Privia is adding Evolent Care Partners’ more than 120,000 lives in the Medicare Shared Savings Program, various commercial programs and Medicare Advantage. The deal brings Privia’s total number of attributed lives in value-based care arrangements to 1.5 million across both new and existing states, the Virginia-based company said.

Analysts estimate roughly 70,000 to 80,000 of those lives are in MSSP, a program that represents a significant earnings contributor for Privia. Participating ACOs, or groups of providers that link up to take on financial risk, are paid a portion of the savings they generate for Medicare, with the goal of improving outcomes while lowering costs by incentivizing providers to better manage patient care.

Outperformance in MSSP was behind Privia’s decision to raise its guidance for 2025 results in August.

Bringing Evolent Care Partners onboard gives Privia a chance to hike the ACO’s shared savings rate to its own level, analysts said. Evolent Care Partners had a shared savings rate of 5.9% in 2024, which — although decent — is lower than Privia’s 9.3% savings rate across its ACOs, according to a CMS database and company data.

“We see potential for [Evolent Care Partners] to generate additional earnings through [Privia] improving MSSP performance over time,” TD Cowen analyst Ryan Langston wrote in a note on the acquisition.

Evolent Care Partners is also affiliated with more than 1,000 doctors, so the deal includes access to a large potential customer base for Privia’s technology and services platform.

Overall, Evolent estimates that the assets being sold to Privia represent roughly $10 million in adjusted earnings before taxes and other accounting adjustments.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/93IiP8ViBH4r9xt0RR4Xsu5K_sj6UTU3zvWY-U7-kjY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTMwMjQ4MTE5XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-25 08:08:07.857993

Fortive Corporation (NYSE: FTV) is what you get when industrial know-how meets the software age. The company makes gear, software, and services for industrial, safety, and healthcare markets—think Fluke test tools, safety and asset-management platforms, even diagnostic equipment for labs and clinics. Since spinning off its Precision Technologies arm (now called Ralliant) in June 2025, Fortive has focused even more on boosting productivity, safety, and healthcare solutions. Its two main segments—Intelligent Operating Solutions (IOS) and Advanced Healthcare Solutions (AHS)—help lay the digital tracks for what’s often called Industry 4.0 (that’s the smart, connected next chapter for factories and hospitals). Fortive faces off with the likes of Emerson Electric, Rockwell Automation, and Schneider Electric in automation; Keysight Technologies, Mettler-Toledo, and Cognex in test and inspection; and Thermo Fisher Scientific and Danaher in diagnostics. What sets Fortive apart? Recognizable brands, powerful software, lots of recurring revenue, and a relentless improvement drive thanks to its in-house playbook, the Fortive Business System.

Recent Performance

Over the past year (through September 24, 2025), Fortive shares dropped 13.8%. That’s a far cry from the S&P 500, which climbed 16.2%—putting Fortive over 30 points behind the market. Much of that shortfall can be traced to the spinoff of Ralliant in June, which shrunk Fortive’s revenue and left investors guessing about the transition. On top of that, weaker orders from industrial customers (thanks to tariffs and general macro jitters) left core revenue flat in the second quarter and pushed Fortive to just miss earnings expectations. It all adds up to cautious sentiment and a share price lagging its peers.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Fortive is planning for mid-single-digit core revenue growth and high-single-digit adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth in the medium term. Tailwinds from digital transformation in manufacturing and infrastructure are expected to help, but recent results have been slow—Q2 2025 revenue from continuing operations came in at $1.02 billion, down 0.4% year-over-year, and core growth even dipped 0.7%. Management is guiding for full-year revenue between $6.2 and $6.4 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.50–2.60. Those forecasts are underpinned by steady software and service revenues, some targeted acquisitions in IOS, more safety and compliance offerings, and incremental help from cost cuts and buybacks. Over the long haul, trends like predictive maintenance, connected worker solutions, and lab automation could help Fortive outpace the broader sector—if it succeeds in selling more software to its existing customers and making the most of its platform investments.

Quality & Moat

Fortive’s profitability is consistently strong: in Q2 2025, its adjusted EBITDA margin hit 28.4%, and operating margin clocked in at 16.8%. That’s right in line with its last five years (16.6% average), but a little below the market’s 18.7%. What really stands out is free cash flow yield, at 6.3%—that’s way above its own five-year average (2.4%) and the market’s (1.9%), thanks to tight working capital management and a chunky $345 million in buybacks in the first half of 2025. Return on invested capital (ROIC) comes in at 6.8%, slightly under its own average and trailing the market’s 11.1%, so there’s work to do on being more efficient with its money. Fortive’s moat is built on its stable of niche, mission-critical brands and its proven Fortive Business System, which spreads best practices and keeps the agility high. Management’s made a habit of disciplined investing—shedding businesses like Precision Technologies, cherry-picking M&A deals, and keeping the cost base healthy even in rocky markets.

Valuation

At a forward P/E of 24.3x, Fortive trades a bit cheaper than the market average of 25.9x. Its EV/Sales ratio sits at 3.5x—again, below both its own five-year average of 4.2x and the market’s 4.7x. Investors are clearly factoring in stagnant top-line growth, but Fortive’s strong cash flow, resilient margins, and chances for growth in software and services could set the stage for a higher valuation if momentum picks up.

Market Sentiment

Since the spin-off, investors have been pretty cautious—Fortive’s 50-day price trend is down slightly (–0.53%), but volatility is actually lower than the wider market (19.3% versus the S&P 500’s 23.1%). That points to a steady, if subdued, trading pattern. Short interest is moderate, around 2.9% of Fortive shares (down from 3.6% earlier this year), so there isn’t a wave of bearish bets. Almost all shares (about 95%) are held by institutions, and analysts’ consensus price target sits at $81.15—suggesting a good chunk of potential upside if growth perks up. Insider ownership is minimal (under 1%), and there haven’t been any big insider stock moves since the split.

Key Risks

Cyclical End-Market Exposure: If industrial capital spending takes a dive—say, from a manufacturing slowdown, energy sector weakness, or worsening global tensions—orders for Fortive’s instrumentation and connected solutions could dry up fast.

Tariff and Trade Uncertainty: Anywhere tariffs on Chinese imports stick around or go higher, Fortive might have to eat those costs or pass them to customers—either way, it could mean lower sales and squeezed margins.

Post-Spin Execution: After separating from Precision Technologies (now Ralliant), Fortive faces classic reshuffle risks: getting integrations right, making smart bets with the cash, and delivering promised cost savings. If any of those fall short, it could hold back performance.

Competitive Pressure: Tough competition from giants like Honeywell, Danaher, and Emerson—not to mention nimble software and automation specialists—could chip away at Fortive’s market share and pricing power.

Financial Leverage: With net debt running 1.89 times EBITDA (above the market average of 1.37x), Fortive carries moderate debt. If interest rates surge or cash flow slows, repaying that debt could get more challenging.

Bull Case

Undervalued Relative to History: Both EV/Sales and forward P/E are below Fortive’s typical levels and underneath the market’s, hinting at room for the valuation to bounce higher if growth steadies.

Strong Free Cash Flow: A free cash flow yield above 6% gives Fortive plenty of wiggle room for buybacks, paying down debt, and making deals that drive value over the long haul.

Digital Transformation Tailwinds: Industry 4.0 isn’t just a buzzword here—growing demand for automation, predictive maintenance, and connected workforce tools could help Fortive’s IOS segment outgrow the market.

Spin-Off Clarity: With the Ralliant spinoff complete, management can double down on its priority areas—like software, services, and healthcare diagnostics—which could surface hidden value.

Disciplined Capital Allocation: Management’s repeat use of the Fortive Business System and steady buybacks have a track record of boosting returns on invested capital over time.

Bear Case

Slowing Revenue Growth: Core revenue trends have been flat or negative recently, raising doubts about the health of demand and suggesting few reasons to expect an immediate turnaround.

Modest ROIC: Return on invested capital remains well below the market average, signaling Fortive isn’t getting as much bang for its buck as investors would like.

Macro and Tariff Headwinds: With ongoing trade and tariff uncertainty and a sluggish global economy, there’s a risk that customers keep deferring spending and margins stay under pressure.

Execution Risk Post Spin: If Fortive doesn’t invest the Ralliant proceeds wisely—particularly into fast-growing software offerings—its growth story could stall out even further.

Cyclicality in Market Crashes: History shows that Fortive underperforms the S&P 500 during big market selloffs, typically falling further and taking longer to recover—making it a riskier ride when markets get rocky.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings Release: Due out in late October 2025, this update will shine a light on post-spin organic growth, profit margins, and any refreshed guidance.

Investor Day Follow-Up: Management’s next big strategy update (date to be confirmed) promises more detail on where they’ll invest, how they see margins improving, and what M&A could look like.

Macro Data Points: Keep watch on the ISM Manufacturing PMI (out October 1) and mid-October U.S. industrial production numbers for clues on whether demand is turning a corner or not.

Regulatory Updates: New rules for U.S. healthcare devices or surprises with tariffs—especially on markets like China or the EU—could cause a material shift in Fortive’s Advanced Healthcare Solutions results.

Investment Conclusion

After offloading Ralliant, Fortive’s now a more focused industrial and healthcare tech outfit. The company boasts strong free cash flow and trades at a relatively attractive valuation, especially compared to its history. But the road ahead isn’t without bumps—recent organic growth has been sluggish, trade and tariff worries loom large, and there’s always a risk the post-spin plans take longer to pay off. That said, Fortive’s collection of quality brands, steady recurring revenues, and proven management discipline provide a solid base. For long-term investors with an eye on digital transformation and healthcare automation, today’s share price could represent an appealing entry point—as long as they’re comfortable with the ups and downs that come with industrial cycles and the uncertainty that can follow a major spin-off.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-25 03:08:00.158661

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

Handovers will start Oct. 1 and run through Jan. 1.

Fabrice Megarbane is being appointed president of the Consumer Products Division, following Perakis-Valat’s departure. Megarbane, currently the group’s chief global growth officer since January 2024, has spent the last 24 years working at the company. Among his leadership roles has been serving as CEO of L’Oréal China and president of the company’s North Asia Zone.

As chief global growth officer, Megarbane has helped shape L’Oréal’s future path. “In this critical function, he has brilliantly strategized growth, and fostered a more integrated, multizone approach across the group, including driving significant e-commerce expansion with key platforms like Amazon and TikTok,” the company said in a statement.

“He has also spearheaded several of the group’s key transformation projects, helping drive agility, optimize the group’s ways of working and ensure the company is ‘future fit,’” L’Oréal said.

While at L’Oréal China, he lassoed record market share and doubled sales. “He also positioned the region at the forefront of digital and data excellence, mastering the complexities of modern consumer engagement, and ensured all industrial sites achieved carbon neutrality by 2022.

“Fabrice’s unique blend of strategic insight, deep market knowledge and exceptional leadership qualities, proven during his transformative tenure in China and most recently as chief global growth officer, makes him the idea choice to lead our Consumer Products Division,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L’Oréal, in the statement. “I am confident that he will continue to drive innovation, accelerate growth and inspire our teams in this new chapter.”

Vianney Derville is succeeding Megarbane as chief growth officer. He most recently has served as president of Europe for the group.

L’Oréal called Derville “a distinguished leader renowned for orchestrating profound transformations, driving exceptional growth and fostering strategic market leadership.”

His is a new global role in which he is meant to leverage his in-market experience, strategic vision and ability to inspire teams to accelerate L’Oréal’s growth, the company added.

Derville was appointed to his role overseeing Europe in 2016, after jobs in Japan, Spain, France and the U.S. Sales in Europe last year reached more than 11.4 billion euros, and the continent was the biggest contributor to the company’s growth overall.

“The Europe zone has also consistently gained market share and demonstrated strong online dominance,” L’Oréal said.

Derville has also been credited with bolstering public affairs within Europe, which has a complicated regulatory terrain.

“Vianney’s deep understanding of our markets, his proven track record of driving significant growth and transformation, coupled with his exceptional ability to unite and inspire teams make him the perfect choice to be our new chief growth officer,” Hieronimus said. “I look forward to working with him closely as we shape L’Oréal’s future growth trajectory, continue the ‘One L’Oreal’ transformation project leveraging AI and write the next chapter of the group’s history.”

Taking the role of president of Europe is Emmanuel Goulin, who is currently president of travel retail. The executive has been credited with navigating the post-COVID-19 world. He spearheaded the “beauty experience” in travel retail, which refocused L’Oréal’s activities in airports around the traveler’s journey. Goulin transformed the organization and optimized the company’s operational footprint in the channel.

Goulin started at L’Oréal 25 years ago. He has held positions in Japan, Hong Kong, the U.K. and France. The executive returned to Europe in 2022, taking the role of general manager of L’Oréal Italy, where he instigated double-digit growth and helped forge the group’s sustainable development.

“Emmanuel has a deep understanding of the European landscape, forged through leadership roles in three of its key markets,” m Hieronimus said. “This, together with his great track record of delivering major business and transformational impact, positions him as the ideal leader to drive innovation, accelerate growth and inspire our teams in our biggest region.”

Eva Yu is being named president of travel retail, and is to join L’Oréal’s extended executive committee. Currently president and managing director of L’Oréal Hong Kong, she will be based in both Paris and Sinagapore.

“Eva has led the subsidiary through an extraordinary evolution, resulting in a significant increase in market share, in addition to widespread recognition for its retail excellence,” L’Oréal said.

Yu started at the company in 2000 as brand manager for Biotherm in Hong Kong, where it became among the top brands market-wide. In 2011, she became the first Asian and first woman appointed managing director of travel retail in APAC, where she helmed L’Oréal’s duty-free business in 27 markets.

“Eva’s remarkable career, marked by her vision, and incredible ability to foster unity and harmonize efforts across different functions and markets, makes her an outstanding leader,” Hieronimus said.

“Her deep understanding of the Asian market and her proven track record in driving both business transformation and people development, positions her as the ideal choice to lead our strategic travel retail business into its next chapter of growth and innovation,” he said.",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Fabrice-Megarbane.jpg.jpg?crop=0px%2C110px%2C2339px%2C1308px&resize=1000%2C563,N,,2025-09-24 14:20:53.922745

From 2020 to April 2025, the retailer's store number — including hypermarkets and Sam's Club — fell from 429 to 334.
That coincided with the addition of seven new Sam's Club stores, according to data from the China Chain Store & Franchise Association.
He added ""community stores face their own challenges, having to compete head-on with 24-hour convenience stores and delivery platforms"".","Walmart Inc is betting small will be big in China. The US retailer opened its fourth neighborhood store at its China headquarters, Shenzhen, Guangdong province, on Sept 13, signaling that the compact format has found traction and is expected to scale.

Each store, about 500 square meters in size, mainly carries some 2,000 stock-keeping units or products tailored to the most frequent needs of nearby residents. In the store, food dominates — fresh produce, bakery, hot meals, ready-to-eat options and snacks — covering what Walmart calls ""five meals a day"".

Jason Yu, general manager of CTR Market Research, said community stores are becoming a vital part of Walmart's proximity retail strategy in China. Consumers today lean toward shopping close to home or using instant retail platforms for daily, high-frequency purchases, which the traditional hypermarket's all-in-one format can no longer fully satisfy.

""Smaller formats offer advantages in cost efficiency, flexible site selection and curated assortments tailored to neighborhood needs, while instant retail extends their catchment area — making the model a strong fit with Walmart's omnichannel approach in China,"" Yu said.

For Walmart, community stores fill a strategic gap between its sprawling Sam's Clubs and shrinking hypermarkets. Walmart's China net sales jumped 30 percent year-on-year to $5.8 billion in the second quarter, driven by Sam's Club expansion and its double-digit growth in transactions, as well as its e-commerce growth at 39 percent.

Sam's remains the company's profit driver in China, with 57 outlets across 25 cities. At the 2025 Walmart global investment conference, Zhu Xiaojing, CEO of Walmart China, revealed that eight Sam's Club stores in China are expected to reach annual sales volume of over 3.6 billion yuan ($500 million) per store at the end of this year.

Even so, their suburban footprint leaves downtown areas underserved.

Neighborhood markets address that gap with its bigger stores that enhance one-stop experiences and 30-minute reach by e-commerce. The compact store is intensifying its coverage by reaching customers within a 10-minute walk and sharing supply chains with Sam's to break bulk packs into smaller sizes.

The expansion comes as Walmart's hypermarket model wanes. From 2020 to April 2025, the retailer's store number — including hypermarkets and Sam's Club — fell from 429 to 334. That coincided with the addition of seven new Sam's Club stores, according to data from the China Chain Store & Franchise Association.

The decline reflects long-standing issues: sites misaligned with shifting population flows, bulk pack sizes mismatched to smaller households and rising operating costs.

Despite that, Yu said hypermarkets will still serve one-stop shopping needs, though much of that demand is being diverted to e-commerce and specialized retail channels. He added ""community stores face their own challenges, having to compete head-on with 24-hour convenience stores and delivery platforms"".

Yet demand for them remains relatively stable, and Walmart has an opportunity to differentiate through private-label products and value-added services, he added.

""The pilot stores in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, in my view, are also a signal of Walmart's intent to scale the format into China's smaller third- and fourth-tier cities,"" he said.

Government policy is lending momentum to the shift. Earlier this month, the Ministry of Commerce and eight other ministries issued a notice to accelerate the rollout of""15-minute community life circles"", underscoring support for small-footprint retail and commerce.

The latest report released by Worldpanel shows that small supermarkets grew 7.3 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2025, stabilizing overall modern trade (defined as hypermarkets, supermarkets, and convenience stores). Community grocery stores also performed well, with sales up 4.7 percent.

Competition is already intensifying. In the first half, leading discount retailers continued to capture market share through business model upgrades and supply chain optimization. Aldi advanced steadily through localization strategies: its store in Kunshan of East China's Jiangsu province set a new sales record in China.

Leveraging their experience in Shanghai, regional supply chains, and a ""high quality groceries and lifestyle products"" strategy, Aldi's penetration in the eastern region increased by 1.2 percentage points, according to Worldpanel.

Traditional e-commerce players are expanding into offline formats to break the limitation of the pure online shopping experience. JD Group's JD Mall offers immersive lifestyle solutions, while JD Fresh has accelerated its store model (central stores plus satellite community shops) in the northern region, boosting penetration by 0.4 percentage point.

In the first half, China's fast-moving consumer goods market saw moderate recovery. Price-sensitive and experience-driven consumers demand higher product quality and functionality. This pursuit drives offline and online channels to reshape the consumption landscape through both competition and complementarity, according to Worldpanel.

In offline channels, Sam's Club, Aldi, and JD Fresh precisely target consumer needs via membership formats, hard discount formats and community models. Traditional supermarkets have focused on optimizing product selection as part of their upgrades, while integrating with online-to-offline services to overcome customer traffic challenges, according to Worldpanel.",http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202509/24/68d35128a3108622d642200f.jpeg,N,,2025-09-24 16:16:30.527661

M&A as a Growth Driver

2025 started with a number of large-scale acquisitions in the MedTech sector. Among others, Stryker and Boston Scientific announced deals exceeding USD 1 billion. While the number of transactions is declining, overall deal volume is rising.

Healthcare and life sciences companies that complete more than one acquisition per year have generated an average total shareholder return (TSR) of 13.6% over the past decade, compared to just 0.3% for inactive players. Even a limited number of strategic acquisitions (>1 deal/year) has proven beneficial, with an average TSR of 11.5%. The key is not quantity, but the strategic quality of transactions.

Still, only just over half of companies in the sector pursue add-on acquisitions. Growth also comes at the cost of rising debt: companies completing three to five deals recorded 1.7 times higher net debt than non-acquirers. Venture capital activity reflects a similar trend: while Series E+ financing rounds show record deal activity (+25% in volume), pre-seed and early-stage investments are slowing.

Political Environment as a Catalyst

The change of government in the U.S. could provide new momentum. Leadership changes and staff cuts at the FDA and other agencies may benefit MedTech—particularly diagnostics, which faced tighter regulation under the Biden administration and could now benefit from some relief.

At the same time, the FTC continues to apply stricter merger control guidelines and has recently blocked Edwards’ planned acquisition of JenaValv (USD 945 million) as well as the PE-backed acquisition of Surmodics (USD 627 million). The M&A environment in MedTech therefore remains challenging.

Key Areas for M&A in 2025/26

GLP-1 drugs

The rapid rise of GLP-1 therapies has raised concerns that they could replace demand for certain MedTech devices. So far, however, demand for glucose monitors and insulin pumps remains stable, as nearly half of patients discontinue GLP-1 therapy due to side effects or costs. GLP-1 may in fact open new opportunities in orthopedics and obesity surgery, while driving proactive health management in diagnostics. According to a Strategy& survey (PwC), 76% of professionals in therapeutic instruments expect GLP-1 to have an impact, compared to only 33% in monitoring devices. Partnerships with biopharma companies, particularly around novel GLP-1 delivery methods, could become a decisive deal driver.

Artificial Intelligence

AI is emerging as a true platform technology in MedTech. Its applications go far beyond diagnostics, potentially supporting regulatory and compliance processes.

Diagnostics and life sciences

The pandemic has heightened demand for fast, reliable diagnostics. This trend is reinforced by demographic change and the growing importance of personalized medicine, often coupled with subscription models to secure long-term patient engagement.

Surgical instruments and devices

An aging population is driving demand for surgical procedures and high-quality equipment. Advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), miniaturization, precision technologies, and digitalization create significant investment opportunities.

MDR Compliance and Post-Merger Integration

MDR compliance can determine the success or failure of an acquisition. Companies should address the following issues as part of due diligence and integration:

Agreements with notified bodies: The success of a MedTech transaction can hinge on regulatory factors, most notably the involvement of the notified body (i.e., the neutral institution designated by an EU member state to conduct conformity assessments). Because cooperation agreements with notified bodies often contain differing terms and conditions, and for reasons of efficiency, it is generally advisable to establish a uniform agreement with a single body.

Deal structure: Depending on whether the transaction is structured as a share deal or an asset deal, notification of the competent authority may be required, particularly if production processes, monitoring systems, or quality assurance measures are affected.

CE marking: Verify whether certifications are valid, extensions have been applied for, and whether there are risks of restrictions, suspension, or revocation.

Transition arrangements: In the event of a change of notified body, establish clear agreements with both the former and the new institution regarding the period during which products with the old identification number may continue to be marketed and the timing for the transition to the new number.

Integrating regulatory aspects into transaction planning at an early stage is essential to mitigate risks and secure synergies.

Conclusion

Despite a complex regulatory landscape and political uncertainty, M&A remains a key driver of growth in MedTech. Strategic acquisitions—in diagnostics, surgical devices, and AI-enabled platforms—offer significant opportunities, while GLP-1 therapies should be seen not as a threat but as a catalyst for innovation. Success will depend not only on the right deal strategy but also on managing MDR compliance and post-merger integration effectively.",https://www.taylorwessing.com/-/media/taylor-wessing/images/social-media/life-sciences--healthcare.jpg?as=0&dmc=0&iar=0&thn=0&udi=0?&hash=82457FDB1597A1EEFC28E54DC9168C79,N,,2025-09-24 10:08:20.512299

CVS Health's long-term care pharmacy subsidiary Omnicare LLC and 110 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 22, seeking to resolve issues related to a recent $948.7 million U.S. Department of Justice civil judgment against the company, according to a statement.

All litigation against the debtor is subject to an automatic stay while the bankruptcy case proceeds.

The company said that it will either implement a standalone restructuring or seek a sale of its assets.

Omnicare responds to bankruptcy filing

""Omnicare has been engaged in a civil lawsuit alleging technical violations of pharmacy law based on practices the government knew about and approved,"" Omnicare President David Azzolina said in a statement.

""There were no allegations of harm to any Omnicare patients nor did the government allege that any patient got anything other than the medicine they needed when they needed it,"" Azzolina said.

""The District Court nevertheless imposed an extreme and, we believe, unconstitutional penalty,"" he said.

Why did Omnicare file for bankruptcy?

The long-term care pharmacy filed for bankruptcy protection to address a $948.7 million civil judgment against it that was awarded to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

A unanimous jury on April 29 found Omnicare, the nation's largest long-term care pharmacy, liable for alleged fraudulent dispensing of drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled people in assisted-living facilities and other residential long-term care facilities, according to a U.S. Attorney's Office statement.

After a four-week trial, the jury ruled that Omnicare billed Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for over 3 million of alleged false claims, resulting in over $135.5 million in damages, the statement said.

The government is entitled to three times the amount of the assessed damages under the federal False Claims Act, or $406,778,442, plus statutory penalties to be determined by the court.

CVS Health also found liable

The jury also found Omnicare’s parent, CVS Health Corp., liable for causing Omnicare to submit alleged false claims, the statement said.

Omnicare, which provides pharmacy services to the long-term care market, including skilled nursing facilities, independent-living, and assisted-living facilities, filed its petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, listing $100 million to $500 million in assets and $1 billion to $10 billion in liabilities.

Omnicare's largest unsecured creditors:

U.S. Attorney's Office, owed $948.7 million.

Omnicell Inc., owed over $727,000.

Vakserve, owed over $455,000.

The Woonsocket, R.I., debtor's largest creditors include the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, owed $948.7 million; Omnicell Inc., owed over $727,000 in a trade payable; and Vakserve, owed over $455,000 in a trade payable.

The debtor is seeking approval for up to $110 million in debtor-in-possession financing and use of cash collateral to provide sufficient liquidity to the company while the case proceeds, according to the statement.

Omnicare operates 101 pharmacies in 44 states and provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities in 46 states, dispensing 40 million prescriptions to 800,000 patients each year.

This week, the company reported that both its revenue and earnings came in ahead of expectations for its fiscal third quarter of 2025. Investors are taking notice, but reactions have varied. Some view this as a sign that HP is regaining stability after a challenging year, while others point to competitive pressures and mixed analyst ratings as evidence that the company's best days may be in the past or perhaps not immediately ahead.

HP’s stock performance over the last year has reflected this uncertainty, with shares drifting lower overall despite a recent rebound. Over the past month, the stock rose nearly 2% and added about 15% over the past three months, recovering some losses but still showing a negative return for the year. While HP exceeded earnings expectations this quarter, discussions around its value compared to rival tech and AI companies remain active. The conversation has begun to shift from disappointment to cautious optimism, but the debate continues.

Following the recent positive surprise and a modest turnaround in momentum, investors may be weighing whether HP presents a bargain or if the market has already accounted for its prospects.

Most Popular Narrative: Fairly Valued

The most widely followed narrative currently suggests HP is trading very close to its estimated fair value, reflecting market consensus around its balanced future prospects and risks.

Accelerating adoption of AI-driven PCs and growth in premium device segments are fueling stronger-than-expected revenue growth, with AI PCs now over 25% of HP's mix and expected price uplifts of 5 to 10 percent, which directly supports higher top-line sales and margin expansion.

Want to know what’s powering HP’s latest valuation call? One critical assumption underpins this bold fair value. It is something even seasoned investors may overlook. Are you curious about the financial secrets behind those growth projections? Don’t miss the story behind HP’s market pricing signal and see which key numbers are moving the needle.

Result: Fair Value of $27.97 (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, competitive pressure in PCs and ongoing declines in the print segment could challenge HP’s renewed optimism and put future growth at risk.

Another View: Different Methods, Different Stories

And just last week, Barclays cut its Molson Coors recommendation to underweight from equal-weight.
Goyal's ability to diversify beyond traditional beer could determine whether Molson Coors remains relevant in a rapidly changing beverage landscape.
In recent years, Goyal has worked to move the company beyond its marquee beer brands Coors Light and Miller Lite.
Molson Coors said Goyal will receive an annual base salary of $1.1 million as president and CEO, along with an annual bonus with a target of 150% of his base pay.","Molson Coors shares fell about 3% yesterday to close at $45.09. The stock had declined 19% this year through the end of last week, trailing a 13% gain for the S&P 500 Index.

The company lowered its full-year guidance for the second consecutive quarter last month, citing continued pressure from weak consumer demand, falling U.S. market share and rising costs tied to aluminum tariffs.

Meanwhile, a recent Gallup survey revealed alcohol consumption among adults in the U.S. is at the lowest level on record. And just last week, Barclays cut its Molson Coors recommendation to underweight from equal-weight.

“Frankly we struggle to think of a positive catalyst for U.S. beer trends,” Barclays’ Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to investors, the latest sign that Wall Street's outlook for the sector has begun to sour.

The CEO transition comes at a critical juncture for the beer industry, which faces declining consumption and increased competition from cannabis and wellness alternatives. Goyal's ability to diversify beyond traditional beer could determine whether Molson Coors remains relevant in a rapidly changing beverage landscape.

“Molson Coors has not been very successful in attracting new shoppers to their portfolio or at keeping shoppers in their consumer base,” said Bump Williams, founder of beverage industry consultancy Bump Williams Consulting in Shelton, Conn.

Williams points to Molson Coors' flagging volume of beer and other malt-based beverages, which is down almost 7% across total U.S. retail outlets such as grocery, liquor and convenience stores, according to data his firm uses from NielsenIQ. He adds that the majority of its malt-based portfolio is declining in both volume and dollars with few exceptions.

The company has fallen behind its competitors in the innovation race, Williams noted, as it fails to keep pace with its peers now capitalizing on THC products, seltzers and other cocktail beverages.

“There needs to be a high sense of urgency to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace and not be content with sitting back on his laurels and waiting for business to fall into his lap,” Williams said.

Goyal, 49, assumes the role with more than two decades of insider knowledge — and his recent track record suggests he's grappled with the challenge of innovating as consumer habits shift. He started at the company in 2001 as a group manager and has been chief strategy officer since October 2019. He also held senior roles including chief financial officer of India operations and chief information officer for the U.K.

In recent years, Goyal has worked to move the company beyond its marquee beer brands Coors Light and Miller Lite. He helped to strike partnerships with Coca-Cola and Fever-Tree and led acquisitions of Zoa Energy — an energy drink brand co-founded by Dwayne Johnson — and Naked Life, a nonalcoholic canned cocktails maker.

“Rahul has strong institutional knowledge given his time with the company and more importantly, he is eager to bring new thinking with a focus on future growth,” Chairman David Coors said in a written statement announcing the move.

Goyal, who received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Mysore in India and his MBA from the University of Denver's Daniels College of Business, will take over on Oct. 1. He succeeds Gavin Hattersley, who will retire from the company and its board by Dec. 31. Hattersley, who announced plans to retire in April after six years in the role, will stay on as a special adviser through the year.

Molson Coors said Goyal will receive an annual base salary of $1.1 million as president and CEO, along with an annual bonus with a target of 150% of his base pay.

Gross margin expanded as strong full-price sales and lower cotton costs outweighed inflation and tariff pressures.","Tariffs have emerged as the biggest profitability drag for lululemon athletica inc. LULU, reshaping its margin profile in fiscal 2025. The removal of the U.S. de minimis exemption, which had previously allowed duty-free shipments under $800, has added significant costs to its e-commerce model. Combined with higher reciprocal tariff rates, management now expects a 220-basis-point (bps) hit to gross margin in fiscal 2025, nearly $240 million in incremental expenses, even after mitigation efforts like vendor negotiations, supply chain shifts and modest pricing. These structural headwinds are expected to intensify in fiscal 2026, with management projecting a net $320 million margin impact despite ongoing cost actions.

In second-quarter fiscal 2025, these pressures were already visible. Gross margin contracted 110 basis points year over year to 58.5%, as higher markdowns and tariffs weighed on profitability. Markdowns alone contributed 60 bps of pressure, well above management’s forecast, as the company worked to clear seasonal inventory amid weak U.S. demand. While EPS of $3.10 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues of $2.53 billion missed the same, with flat U.S. sales and a 3% comps decline offsetting strong international growth. Operating margin fell 210 bps to 20.7%, with SG&A expenses rising 9% as lululemon continued to invest in marketing, store openings, and digital initiatives.

lululemon cut its full-year 2025 outlook, now guiding for a 300-bps gross margin decline versus prior expectations of just 110 bps. Third-quarter fiscal 2025 is set to see even steeper pressure, with a projected 410-bps drop due to tariffs, de minimis removal and fixed cost deleverage. With U.S. softness persisting and margin headwinds mounting, management does not expect meaningful relief until its product refreshes gain traction in fiscal 2026.

Margins at Risk Amid Tariff Pressures: How Peers RL & NKE Are Faring

With tariffs and the loss of duty exemptions squeezing profitability across apparel, peers like Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL) and NIKE Inc. NKE are navigating margin pressures in contrasting ways.

Ralph Lauren delivered strong margin performance in first-quarter fiscal 2026 despite tariff headwinds, aided by higher average unit retail, reduced discounting and a favorable channel mix. Gross margin expanded as strong full-price sales and lower cotton costs outweighed inflation and tariff pressures. Management noted tariffs remain the biggest headwind, particularly in the second half, but emphasized supply chain flexibility, selective pricing and cost efficiencies as key levers to offset pressure while sustaining operating discipline and long-term profitability.

NIKE’s margins remain under pressure as tariff-related costs add to ongoing challenges from discounts, supply chain deleverage and channel mix shifts. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, gross margin fell sharply, reflecting heavier promotional activity and a weaker mix, while new tariffs are expected to cut into profitability by roughly 75 bps in fiscal 2026, with the greatest hit in the first half. Management is mitigating through sourcing shifts, selective price increases and tighter expense discipline.

The retailer is focusing on enhancing the communication between the consumers and employees. The retailer is implementing massive changes to its online shopping system. This system will highlight an easier and more inclusive platform for everyone.

Details about Walmart’s massive change

The retail giant, Walmart, is about to make a massive change to expand the company’s communication between consumers and its 1.5 million employees. It has been stated that the company has detailed its uses for the upgrade of the Walmart Translation Platform. This platform has been created to make shopping a more inclusive and easier experience for everyone.

In addition, the first announcement of the Walmart Translation Platform (WTP) was made in June. The WTP provides real-time translation for about 44 different languages. It even goes a step further, however, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide a better understanding of the intention and context of the ones who will use it.

How the WTP will work

When it comes to this platform, there is a certain process that consumers need to know about. Consumers are required to type into the search bar the specific product or item they require. However, the typing aspect is in Spanish. At certain times this can be a Spanish dialect from Colombia, a Spanish dialect from Mexico, or even Puerto Rico or Chile.

According to the director of localization, content and accessibility at Walmart International, Arpitha Shetty, this means that there are different variations for different nationalities. She further stated, “So what we do is we adapt that local Spanish, that particular dialect, to the catalog in English so a user gets the best possible experience. We translate their intent, to get them what they want.”

In addition, the app is created in such a way to be able to recognize these nuances and also map the variations back to the entry to assist consumers in finding what they are looking for. For example, when Walmart cites a consumer in Quebec who is searching for a specific brand of yogurt. The consumer may enter “yogourt liberte” in the search bar of Liberte Yogurt, which is a brand, and it does not refer to freedom yogurt as a literal translation would suggest.

The impact of the platform

Through this specific AI and human linguists, the WTP would be able to recognize the difference and point the consumer to the correct product. Also, this system makes use of Walmart-specific ecommerce data to recognise and correctly translate names of unique store brands. This will assist the system when consumers enter specific brand names and may even misspell these names. The system will be able to recognise this because it also has access to the ecommerce data of Walmart.

As stated by the senior vice president and chief product officer at Walmart International, Tim Simmons, this would allow consumers to have a better shopping experience. It also gives access to cost savings to the company including am easier experience for employees.

Simmons further stated that, “Beyond the efficiencies we’ve gained employing agentic AI, we’re creating a better overall experience with the focus on cultural adaptation throughout the whole tech-stack. Running the new Walmart Translation Platform costs around 1% of the previous system. We’re saving more than $20 million, every year.”

Additionally, this system is proof that America’s retail giant, is truly out to make life easier for both its consumers and employees. As we continue to live in a world that is driven by technology it is always good to invest in these digital platforms, because it makes life easier for consumers and businesses.",https://www.eldiario24.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/walmart-ai.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 09:09:48.796649

What's the story

Bengaluru-based on-demand logistics start-up Porter has reported a massive 57% jump in its operating revenue for the fiscal year 2025. The company's revenue stood at ₹4,306 crore during the period, according to financial statements filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). This revenue growth is part of Porter's overall financial improvement, which also includes turning a net loss in FY24 into a net profit in FY25.

Profit milestone

Porter turns net profit for the first time

Along with the revenue surge, Porter also managed to turn profitable in FY25. The company reported a net profit of ₹55 crore for the year. This is a major turnaround from its performance in fiscal 2024 when it had posted a loss of ₹96 crore. The improvement comes as a result of Porter's strategic expansion into new categories and geographies over the past year. The company currently has a presence in more than 25 cities.

This move, framed within the context of Giorgio Armani's meticulously crafted succession plan, underscores a broader trend of consolidation in the sector, where legacy brands are increasingly being positioned for long-term financial stability and global scalability. For investors, the potential acquisition of a stake in Armani's beauty division by L'Oréal represents not just a transaction, but a calculated alignment with market dynamics that prioritize brand-value capture and strategic diversification.

Strategic Fit: L'Oréal's Beauty-Centric Playbook

L'Oréal's interest in Armani's beauty division is no accident. The French beauty giant has long adhered to a strategy of focusing on high-margin, aspirational brands within its portfolio, as seen with its acquisitions of Tom Ford and JacquemusWhat’s Next for Giorgio Armani? LVMH, L’Oreal ... - WWD[ 1 ]. Armani's existing licensing agreement with L'Oréal—set to expire in 2050—has already proven lucrative, generating €1.5 billion in revenue in 2024, or roughly 10% of L'Oréal's luxury division and 3.45% of its total group salesL’Oréal Only Interested in Armani’s Profitable Beauty Business[ 2 ]. By acquiring a minority stake (initially 15%, expandable to 54.9% over three years), L'Oréal could deepen its control over this revenue stream while leveraging Armani's iconic brand equity to bolster its premium offeringsIn Final Act, Armani Opens Door to Sale of Firm He Cherished[ 3 ].

This approach mirrors the Estée Lauder model, where brands like Tom Ford are licensed out to maintain creative independence while ensuring financial returns for the parent companyL’Oréal Only Interested in Armani’s Profitable Beauty Business[ 2 ]. For L'Oréal, the key advantage lies in its ability to integrate Armani's beauty line into its existing luxury portfolio—brands such as Yves Saint Laurent and Kiehl's—without diluting the Armani name's aspirational allure.

Premium Beauty Consolidation: A Sector in Motion

The broader premium beauty sector is witnessing a surge in consolidation, driven by the need to capture value in an increasingly competitive and saturated market. According to a 2025 McKinsey report, the global beauty industry is projected to reach $590 billion by 2030, with skincare alone accounting for 40% of total valueThe future of the beauty industry in 2025 and beyond[ 4 ]. This growth is fueled by innovation in categories like injectables and sun care, as well as a shift toward hyperpersonalization and sustainabilityThe future of the beauty industry in 2025 and beyond[ 4 ].

L'Oréal's 2024 performance exemplifies this trend. Its Consumer Products Division grew by 5.4%, driven by emerging markets and product innovations such as Elvive Glycolic GlossL'Oréal Consumer Products Division: 2024 trends[ 5 ]. The company's focus on “democratizing and premiumizing beauty” aligns with consumer demand for both accessibility and luxury, a duality that Armani's brand could amplify. By acquiring a stake in Armani's beauty division, L'Oréal would not only secure a high-margin asset but also strengthen its position in a sector where brand legacy and innovation are equally critical.

Competitive Dynamics: LVMH and EssilorLuxottica in the Frame

While L'Oréal is a strong contender, it faces competition from LVMH and EssilorLuxottica, both of which are vying for a stake in Armani's broader fashion and eyewear segmentsWhat’s Next for Giorgio Armani? LVMH, L’Oreal ... - WWD[ 1 ]. However, L'Oréal's singular focus on beauty gives it a distinct advantage. Unlike LVMH, which must balance its luxury fashion and wine portfolios, or EssilorLuxottica, which is primarily an eyewear giant, L'Oréal's expertise in beauty product development, distribution, and marketing is unmatched.

Moreover, Armani's will explicitly prioritizes L'Oréal for the beauty division, reflecting the designer's confidence in the company's ability to preserve the brand's creative identity while ensuring financial growthIn Final Act, Armani Opens Door to Sale of Firm He Cherished[ 3 ]. Pantaleo Dell'Orco, Armani's longtime collaborator, has also emphasized the importance of maintaining the brand's ethical and artistic integrity—a goal that aligns with L'Oréal's track record in managing luxury beauty brandsL'Oréal Consumer Products Division: 2024 trends[ 5 ].

Risks and Considerations

Despite the strategic rationale, risks remain. The premium beauty sector is highly competitive, with brands like Shiseido and Estée Lauder also vying for market shareThe future of the beauty industry in 2025 and beyond[ 4 ]. Additionally, integrating Armani's beauty division into L'Oréal's portfolio could face challenges, particularly in maintaining the brand's exclusivity while scaling production to meet global demand. Regulatory scrutiny in key markets, such as the EU and the U.S., could also delay the transaction.

However, these risks are mitigated by the structured nature of Armani's succession plan, which allows for a phased acquisition and provides L'Oréal with time to assess integration strategiesWhat’s Next for Giorgio Armani? LVMH, L’Oreal ... - WWD[ 1 ]. The company's existing licensing agreement also offers a blueprint for collaboration, reducing the likelihood of operational disruptions.

Conclusion: A Win for Brand-Value Capture

For investors, L'Oréal's pursuit of Armani's beauty division represents a strategic bet on the future of premium beauty. By acquiring a stake in a brand with €1.5 billion in annual licensing revenue and a legacy of luxury, L'Oréal is positioning itself to capitalize on the sector's growth while reinforcing its dominance in high-margin beauty categories.

The company’s chapter 11 filing is linked to recent litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In April, Omnicare was found liable for improperly billing the United States government, resulting in $135 million in damages in “one of the largest damages verdicts rendered by a jury in a False Claims Act case,” according to the U.S. Dept. of Justice.

Omnicare was found to have distributed drugs that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law between 2010 and 2018 and billed Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. In July, a judge ordered Omnicare to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages.

David Azzolina, president of Omnicare, said the district court imposed “an extreme and … unconstitutional penalty.”

“Omnicare has been engaged in a civil lawsuit alleging technical violations of pharmacy law based on practices the government knew about and approved,” Azzolina said. “There were no allegations of harm to any Omnicare patients nor did the government allege that any patient got anything other than the medicine they needed when they needed it.”",https://skillednursingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/10/money-1273908_1920-e1520457921451.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 04:02:00.574658

In Walmart’s latest earnings report, it revealed that its U.S. comparable sales increased by 4.6% year-over-year during the second quarter of this year. Also, according to recent data from Placer.ai, foot traffic in Walmart stores spiked by 1% during the quarter.

The increased consumer demand comes after Walmart quietly rolled out 7,400 price rollbacks during the quarter, 2,000 more than it introduced during the same time period last year, to attract price-conscious consumers.

“We’re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon during an earnings call on Aug. 21.

Walmart suffers major loss from a concerning problem

Amid higher sales, Walmart also revealed in its earnings report that its U.S. operating income only increased by 2% year-over-year during the quarter, flagging that its growth was offset by a roughly $400 million expense attributed to “higher-than-anticipated” liability claims.

Liability claims are formed when customers or employees injure themselves on a retailer’s property. Customers may also file a claim when they are harmed by a defective product purchased from the retailer.

During the earnings call on Aug. 21, Walmart Chief Financial Officer John Rainey emphasized that the inflated liability claim expense isn’t due to a higher number of claims.

“While this claim count has decreased year over year, the cost to resolve claims has risen, both for us and across the retail industry, and we’ve increased our accrual to reflect these trends,” said Rainey. “We accrued an additional $450 million over and above our planned expense in Q2, which equates to a headwind of 560 basis points to adjusted operating income growth in the quarter. We have and continue to take actions to mitigate the number and cost of these claims.”

He also said that the company expects “continued inflation in claims cost” for the rest of the year, but not at the same magnitude as it experienced during the first half of the year.

Walmart is battling a growing trend that is hurting retailers nationwide

Walmart isn’t the only company that recently sounded the alarm on higher liability expenses. Best Buy, Dollar Tree, and Dollar General have also warned analysts during recent earnings calls that liability claims are becoming a major headwind.

“This is something we’re seeing across all industry, the cost of settling claims is getting higher,” said Dollar Tree Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning during an earnings call on Sept. 3. “And therefore, while we haven’t seen any increase in the rate of claims, we are seeing those claims come in more costly.

The cost of liability claims has been skyrocketing for retailers over the past few years. This is mainly the result of social inflation, which is when the cost of insurance claims outpaces economic inflation due to broader interpretations of liability, extended legal battles, larger compensatory jury awards, growing public sentiment that injured parties should receive larger compensation and other factors.

Far beyond Tylenol, Kenvue has been struggling with its direction as sales have slumped.
In 1955, McNeil introduced the first Tylenol product, Elixir Tylenol, a liquid for children.
No one was ever charged in the deaths, though one suspect, who has since died, was convicted of extortion for sending a letter to Johnson & Johnson promising to stop the killings in exchange for $1 million.
Johnson & Johnson scrambled to respond, regaining public trust by quickly pulling Tylenol from American shelves and introducing new tamper-resistant packaging.","The pain reliever Tylenol is a classic American brand, with tens of millions of users and a 70-year history. The company behind it, Kenvue, is just two years old and unknown to most Americans.

The Trump administration is expected on Monday to link Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism, a connection that remains unproven. That has put Kenvue in the spotlight, faced with a growing public relations nightmare for a product that has weathered crises before. Most notably, in the 1980s, Tylenol became the textbook example of how to manage a corporate crisis, after product tampering killed seven people and triggered a nationwide panic.

Johnson & Johnson survived the traumatic episode, rescuing a product it had manufactured for decades. But in 2023, looking toward its more profitable medical businesses, the company spun off Tylenol and other consumer brands into a new business, Kenvue. Based in Summit, N.J., Kenvue also makes other nostalgic and well-known brands, like Band-Aid, Listerine, Neutrogena and Johnson’s Baby Shampoo.

Renewed public attention on Tylenol began early this month, when The Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration’s plans to release a report tying Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism. The company’s stock has plummeted by 16 percent since then, and was down by 6 percent on Monday.

Melissa Witt, a spokeswoman for Kenvue, said in a statement on Monday that “we believe independent, sound, science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.” She added, “We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.”

Researchers have studied a potential connection for years, but so far the studies have not shown that Tylenol use among pregnant women causes autism.

Kenvue has made repeated attempts to forestall Monday’s announcement, and to try to reassure customers. The company’s interim chief executive, Kirk Perry, met earlier this month with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary, to make the case that there was no link between Tylenol and autism and that the product offered a safe and important way of relieving fevers in pregnant women, according to an account in The Journal.

Ms. Witt confirmed to The New York Times that the company had “engaged in a scientific exchange with the secretary and members of his staff as it relates to the safety of our products.”

This month, the company also added language to the frequently asked questions section of its website seeking to reassure consumers that they should not be “concerned about acetaminophen and autism.”

Tylenol is the best known among some 600 products containing the active ingredient acetaminophen, an analgesic. Each week, nearly a quarter of U.S. adults use a medicine that contains acetaminophen, according to a trade group for consumer health care products.

Even with the generic competition, Tylenol still generates roughly $1 billion in annual sales for Kenvue, according to an estimate from Morningstar, the financial services company. (Kenvue does not report its revenue from Tylenol.)

“Any potential threat to the product could have a noticeable impact on the firm’s earnings power,” Keonhee Kim, a Morningstar analyst, wrote in a note to investors.

Kenvue, along with major retailers that sell their own generic versions, was named a defendant in the litigation. But a federal judge rejected those claims, dismissing them for lack of reliable scientific evidence. The families are appealing the decision.

Far beyond Tylenol, Kenvue has been struggling with its direction as sales have slumped. In July, the company ousted its chief executive, Thibaut Mongon, and replaced him with Mr. Perry, a veteran in the consumer goods business. In recent months, the company has generated interest from activist investors who have pushed for the company to be acquired, or to sell off some of its business lines.

Acetaminophen was first discovered in the 19th century, but it wasn’t until the late 1940s that researchers showed it could reduce pain and lower fevers.

At the time, research was beginning to show safety risks associated with taking too much aspirin, the leading pain reliever on the market. McNeil Laboratories, a family-owned company in Philadelphia, saw an opportunity to market acetaminophen as a safer alternative.

In 1955, McNeil introduced the first Tylenol product, Elixir Tylenol, a liquid for children. McNeil packaged the product like a cartoon fire engine and marketed it as being “for little hotheads.”

In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil. The next year, Tylenol became available over the counter, without a prescription.

Over the years, Tylenol has occasionally been subject to recalls for quality control issues. The product has also weathered a series of debates in the medical community and regulatory proposals about its known side effects, like liver damage, when taken at high levels.

In 2013, an investigation by the news organization ProPublica found that over three decades, Johnson & Johnson’s McNeil unit “repeatedly fought against safety warnings, dosage restrictions and other measures meant to safeguard users of the drug.” (The company said it takes the product’s risks seriously and always acted to mitigate them.)

By far the biggest threat to the product came in 1982, when someone tampered with capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol, lacing them with cyanide and killing seven people, including a 12-year-old girl, in the Chicago area. No one was ever charged in the deaths, though one suspect, who has since died, was convicted of extortion for sending a letter to Johnson & Johnson promising to stop the killings in exchange for $1 million.

Johnson & Johnson scrambled to respond, regaining public trust by quickly pulling Tylenol from American shelves and introducing new tamper-resistant packaging. The episode inspired a true-crime show, “Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders,” released on Netflix this year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/22/multimedia/22HS-KENVUE-01-bczl/22HS-KENVUE-01-bczl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 17:17:00.039845

The move is significant because specialty pharmacy is an increasingly important player in the U.S. health system given the flood of expensive drugs on the market derived from biotechnology. Such medicines are more complicated than pills and capsules picked up at the corner drugstore or available by mail order and often require specialized administration, refrigeration, packaging and patient instructions.

In Walmart’s case, the retail giant says refrigerated and reconstituted medicines make up 30% of the company’s pharmacy sales. Adding the new specialty pharmacy capabilities such as refrigeration allows Walmart to now be able to deliver 90% of all prescriptions.

Walmart says it’s ""the first retailer to deliver refrigerated and

reconstituted prescriptions alongside groceries and everyday essentials in a single, convenient online order."" Amazon could not be reached Monday for comment but Walgreens and CVS Health have long had the ability to deliver specialty medicines and there are grocery store chains that also own and operate specialty pharmacies where delivery is available.

“We continue to unlock new levels of convenience while also broadening access to critical medications,” said Kevin Host, senior vice president of Pharmacy at Walmart. “Adding refrigerated prescriptions to our Pharmacy Delivery capabilities is the result of listening to our customers, identifying where we can create even better, seamless experiences, and keeping the communities we serve at the heart of what we do.”

Aside from customer convenience, there is a big financial reason for Walmart to be expanding its specialty pharmacy capabilities. Specialized medications are the nation’s top sellers and a key reason healthcare costs are rising. GLP-1 weight loss prescriptions Wegovy, Rybelsus, Saxenda, Ozempic and Zepbound — specialized medications that require injection — are the “single biggest driver” of employer health costs, adding 1% to the total premium expense for 2025, according to data released last fall from the benefits consultancy Aon.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d17b5bcfc9935d5dba187e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-22 16:18:28.019872

As of 2024, 78 percent of chemicals delivered or purchased by key supplier facilities for production aligned with ZDHC MRSL.
As of 2024, 92 percent of LS&Co.’s key wet finishing facilities were ZDHC Academy participating facilities.","Levi Strauss & Co. (LS&Co.) is deepening its commitment to sustainability through targeted action across key impact areas. The San Francisco-based company’s 2024 Sustainability Goals and Metrics Report shares its progress to reaching goals pertaining to waste reduction, circularity, responsible cotton sourcing, chemical management and more.

Here’s five takeaways from the data-driven report.

Waste

LS&Co is pursuing TRUE Zero Waste certifications for its company-operated facilities.

The company’s distribution center in Henderson, Nevada earned TRUE Silver certification with a 95.2 percent waste diversion rate in 2023 into 2024. Similarly, the Northampton Distribution Center in the U.K. holds TRUE Certification and has diverted 90.8 percent of waste from landfills during the same period.

These recognitions support LS&CO.’s goal to achieve zero waste to landfill from company-operated facilities and 50 percent waste diversion across strategic suppliers by 2030. In 2024, LS&Co reports that key suppliers (which the company defines as suppliers covering more than 80 percent of its global product units) diverted 77 percent of waste from landfill—up one percent from the prior year.

Cotton

Climate change weighs heavy on LS&Co.’s sourcing. In 2024, Levi’s products were made with more than 80,000 metric tonnes of cotton. Cotton accounts for nearly 90 percent of the raw materials sourced annually for LS&Co. products.

Though the report notes how some climate modeling suggests that warming temperatures and rising CO2 concentrations may yield short-term benefits to cotton production, LS&Co. expects the frequency and severity of weather events to increase, potentially disrupting cotton supply and production.

The company aims to mitigate this risk through several programs such as being member of the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol, the science-based, farm-level pilot program focused on advancing sustainable cotton production in the U.S. and supporting Better Cotton Initiative and the Organic Cotton Accelerator.

“LS&Co.’s suppliers purchase cotton on a global scale and ensure redundancy within our supply chain to reduce potential risks associated with supply chain disruptions, including those caused by weather variability and other climate-related issues. Consistent with LS&Co.’s overall risk mitigation strategy, our supply chain is designed to be resilient. Any associated cost increases are expected to be absorbed into business-as-usual activities and are considered in our financial planning process,” the company states in the report.

Circularity

LS&Co. is closing in on a comprehensive plan to make the company “circular ready.” The company is working with a third-party consultant on a strategy that is primarily based on the Circular Economy framework and principles of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. By 2026, the company aims to have established governance for plan execution, defined methodology and actions to reach the goal, defined target years, project plans and KPIs and alignment and integration with the company’s overall business strategy.

Chemical management

In 2024, LS&Co. achieved Champion Level status under the 2025 ZDHC Brands to Zero Program, the highest performance tier under the initiative. The Champion Level is awarded to brands that meet defined thresholds across ZDHC key performance indicators, fulfill critical milestones in the Roadmap to Zero Program and demonstrate meaningful integration of ZDHC guidelines, platforms and solutions into both corporate strategy and value chain practices.

LS&Co. continues to work toward its goal of strategic garment wet finishing manufacturing and fabric mills use 100 percent certified Screened Chemistry by 2026. As of 2024, 78 percent of chemicals delivered or purchased by key supplier facilities for production aligned with ZDHC MRSL. Additionally, 22 percent of the key wet finishing facilities’ auxiliary chemicals used for LS&Co. were certified Screened Chemistry.

The segment’s core revenues increased 2% on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2025.

Solid momentum in the clinical diagnostics businesses, led by growth in the Beckman Colter Diagnostics unit, has been buoying the segment’s performance. In the second quarter, core revenues from the clinical diagnostics businesses rose in low single digits. In the quarter, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics unit delivered high single-digit core revenue growth outside China. This marks its fourth consecutive quarter of achieving mid-single-digit or higher growth driven by rising demand for products like DxC 500i Clinical Analyzer and DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer.

Recovery in the molecular diagnostics business, driven by an increase in demand for non-respiratory disease tests, has been supporting the performance of the Diagnostics segment as well. However, lower sales in China, owing to volume-based procurement program and healthcare reimbursement changes, are concerning for the segment.

In the quarters ahead, Danaher’s Diagnostics segment is expected to balance these headwinds with continued product innovation and by offering a wider variety of new diagnostic tests. While challenges in China may persist, steady international growth and rising demand for advanced diagnostic solutions position the segment to remain a resilient contributor to the company’s overall performance. For 2025, Danaher anticipates core revenues from the Diagnostics segment to be flat to increase in low single-digits on a year-over-year basis.

For decades, the personal computer has been the central battleground for digital conflict, the primary target for threat actors, and the last line of defense for users.

A new report from HP Wolf Security, released on September 12, illuminates a sobering reality: attackers aren’t just creating new superweapons; they are perfecting the art of digital deception, using the very tools built into our systems against us.

The report’s findings are a stark reminder that as technology advances, so does the sophistication of those who seek to exploit it. But beyond the immediate threats, this landscape reveals a more profound strategic truth.

In an industry of tech conglomerates juggling everything from cloud infrastructure to data servers, HP’s intense, almost singular focus on the PC ecosystem is proving to be a profound competitive advantage. This concentration is not a limitation; it is the driving force behind the company’s leadership in both endpoint security and the burgeoning era of the AI PC.

This week, we’ll examine how HP’s sharp focus on the PC ecosystem gives it a competitive edge. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, a car from Audi due around 2027 called the Concept C, which is on my short list of cars I want to own in the future.

Evolving Threat: Deception Gets an Upgrade

The latest HP Wolf Security Threat Insights Report makes one thing clear: cybercriminals are masters of refinement. They are increasingly relying on “living-off-the-land” (LOTL) techniques, a notoriously sneaky method where they use legitimate, pre-installed tools within the Windows environment to carry out attacks.

As Ian Pratt, global head of security for personal systems at HP, notes, this creates a significant dilemma for security teams who struggle to distinguish “green flags from red.”

The report details several ingenious campaigns that highlight this trend:

Ultra-Polished Phishing: Attackers are moving beyond poorly worded emails. One campaign used a meticulously crafted fake Adobe Reader file, complete with a realistic loading bar, to trick users into executing a reverse shell script hidden within an SVG image. The attack was even geofenced to German-speaking regions to slow down analysis and detection by global security systems. This demonstrates a level of patience and polish designed to exploit user trust in everyday applications.

Malware in Plain Sight: In another sophisticated attack, threat actors hid malware payloads within the pixel data of image files. Disguised as project documents, these files used legitimate system tools like PowerShell and CMD to execute their malicious code and then, crucially, to delete the evidence, making post-breach forensics incredibly difficult.

Resurgent Stealers: Despite law enforcement crackdowns, the Lumma Stealer malware has returned, using IMG archive files to deliver its payload. This method leverages trusted software like WinRAR and built-in system features to bypass security filters that might otherwise flag a suspicious executable.

As HP threat researcher Alex Holland states, “Attackers aren’t reinventing the wheel, but they are refining their techniques.” By chaining together multiple legitimate tools and hiding their actions within common file types, they create a level of noise that makes traditional, detection-based antivirus software increasingly unreliable.

The data is compelling: HP found that at least 13% of email threats bypassed one or more email gateway scanners, proving that determined attackers can and will get through initial defenses.

The Power of Focus: HP’s PC-Centric Strategy

This unique corporate structure has become HP’s strategic superpower.

Unlike competitors such as Dell Technologies, whose massive portfolio spans servers, enterprise storage, networking, and cloud services, HP’s business is overwhelmingly concentrated on personal systems and printing. Since its split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), HP has been able to dedicate its engineering, research, and development resources almost exclusively to the endpoint — the device sitting on your desk or in your lap.

This focus fosters a deep understanding of the PC that a more diversified company may struggle to match. For a company like Dell, the PC is one product line among many. For HP, the PC is the core business, creating an imperative to lead in innovation, reliability, and, most importantly, security. With no sprawling enterprise division to distract, the company’s success is tied directly to the quality and security of its PCs.

This dedication has culminated in the development of HP Wolf Security, a platform that operates on a fundamentally different principle than traditional antivirus software. Instead of relying solely on detecting a threat, it operates on a Zero Trust model of containment and isolation. It assumes that a threat might get through and uses micro-virtualization to open risky attachments, links, and downloads in their own isolated containers. The malware can detonate, but it’s trapped inside a virtual machine, unable to harm the underlying PC or access user data. It’s the digital equivalent of handling a suspicious package in a bomb disposal chamber.

This defense-in-depth approach is a direct and powerful answer to the LOTL techniques highlighted in the threat report.

From Security Leadership to AI PC Dominance

HP’s sharpened focus on the PC is now paying dividends in the next major technological shift: the AI PC.

The era of the AI PC is defined by the ability to run powerful generative AI models locally on the device, thanks to the integration of neural processing units (NPUs) alongside traditional CPUs and GPUs. Achieving this requires a masterful orchestration of hardware and software — a level of integration possible only for a company with a profound understanding of PC architecture.

Crucially, security is the bedrock upon which the AI PC revolution will be built. As users begin to run AI models on their personal and corporate data locally, the PC will transform into an even more valuable target for attackers. The need for a locked-down, resilient device will be non-negotiable.

In this environment, HP’s long-term investment in hardware-based security gives it an almost insurmountable lead. The proven success of HP Wolf Security builds trust, making it a key selling point for the next generation of AI PCs. Customers will favor platforms that deliver powerful AI performance while protecting sensitive data with security rooted below the operating system at the silicon level.

The focus that built a best-in-class security suite is the same focus now building the most trusted platform for personal AI.

How to Strengthen Your Digital Security

While companies like HP are building more secure systems, user vigilance remains essential. The threats described in the report prey on human behavior. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself:

Cultivate Healthy Skepticism: As the fake Adobe lure shows, attackers are masters of disguise. Treat all unsolicited attachments and links with suspicion, even if they appear to come from a trusted brand or contact. Hover over links to verify their destination and be wary of any document that asks you to enable macros or content.

Keep Software Updated: Regularly update your operating system, web browser, and all applications. These updates frequently contain patches for security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

Use Strong, Unique Passwords and Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Never reuse passwords across different services. Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords and enable MFA wherever possible. MFA provides a critical second layer of defense that can block an attacker even if they have your password.

Prioritize Hardware-Based Security: When purchasing new equipment, look beyond simple specs. Invest in devices that have security built in from the ground up, with features like hardware-enforced isolation and below-the-OS protection. This is where solutions like HP Wolf Security truly shine, providing a safety net that software-only solutions cannot match.

Wrapping Up

The latest HP Wolf Security report serves as a crucial barometer for the cyberthreat landscape. It shows us that the future of attacks lies not in radical new inventions, but in the subtle and sophisticated perfection of old techniques designed to slip past our defenses by hiding in plain sight. Traditional, detection-based security is no longer sufficient to counter this evolving threat.

In this challenging environment, HP’s unwavering focus on the personal computer has allowed it to architect a more resilient defense. By pioneering a containment-based security model, it has created a platform that can withstand the very attacks that are designed to be undetectable. This same strategic focus is now positioning HP to lead the AI PC revolution, where performance and security are not just features, but foundational requirements.

For users and businesses alike, the lesson is clear. In an age of ever-increasing digital threats, the most secure path forward is with technology forged from a clear and dedicated vision.

Audi Concept C

Audi Concept C embodies the brand’s new design philosophy with a vertical frame front, retractable roof, and titanium-toned body, previewing the future of its all-electric sports cars.

For years, we’ve seen concept cars that feel more like fantastical sculptures than blueprints for the future. They scream for attention but often lack a clear connection to the brand that built them.

This month, however, Audi tore the veil off something truly special, Concept C. In doing so, it has not only charted its own future but has also quietly put the entire industry on notice. Concept C isn’t just a car; it’s a statement of intent, and frankly, it’s the most compelling vision of the grand electric tourer I’ve ever seen.

The immediate comparison many are making is to Jaguar’s recently teased Type 00 concept, a wild, low-slung hypercar with aggressive aerodynamics. While the Jaguar is a stunning piece of design, it feels like a beautiful outlier, a nod to past glories like the XJ220 rather than a logical next step.

The Audi Concept C, by contrast, feels like the perfect, evolutionary leap for its parent brand. It takes the sleek, muscular DNA of the current Audi e-tron GT (which I drive). It infuses it with technology and a breathtakingly futuristic design language. This is a car that could only come from Audi, embodying its core philosophy of “Vorsprung durch Technik” (Advancement through Technology).

Visually, the Concept C is a masterpiece of minimalist aggression. Its liquid-metal-effect paint flows over a body devoid of sharp creases, appearing almost organic. The traditional grille is gone, replaced by an illuminated “Digital Grille” that can display communication signals to pedestrians and other vehicles.

The technology beneath is even more radical. Audi hints at a next-generation solid-state battery platform, promising a range of over 600 miles and 10%-80% charging in under 15 minutes. The interior eschews physical screens entirely, instead projecting a fully holographic, AI-powered interface onto a crystal dashboard that anticipates the driver’s needs. It’s a seamless blend of luxury and forward-thinking tech that makes even the most advanced current EVs feel dated.

The Audi Concept C interior combines minimalist design with intuitive technology, creating a refined and distraction-free driving experience.

This car is a clear signal of where Audi’s design language is headed. The hard shoulder lines of the past decade are being softened, replaced by flowing, aerodynamic surfaces. The integration of light as a communication tool will become a signature element, moving beyond simple indicators to become an interactive part of the vehicle.

The Concept C proves that the future of car design is not about adding more screens, but about making the technology disappear into a clean, intuitive, and luxurious environment.

Of course, a vision this advanced won’t come cheap. Should the Concept C make it to production — and Audi insiders suggest a limited run is planned for the end of the decade — expect a price tag that comfortably exceeds $250,000. It will compete in the rarified air of ultra-luxury EVs, and based on this concept, it will be worth every penny. It is a masterful fusion of brand identity, stunning design, and plausible next-generation technology.

It’s not just my Product of the Week, it’s the blueprint for the car of the decade — and I really, really want one.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Investment Narrative Recap

Owning shares in Hewlett Packard Enterprise means believing in its push toward AI and hybrid cloud as growth drivers, alongside its ability to integrate Juniper Networks and execute in an evolving IT infrastructure market. The appointment of Phil Mottram as Chief Sales Officer brings experienced leadership but does not materially alter the near-term catalyst, the successful integration of Juniper, which remains the central focus. The biggest current risk continues to be execution surrounding this integration and realizing anticipated synergies, as these could impact profitability and momentum if mismanaged.

The recent $2.9 billion multi-tranche debt offering is particularly relevant, as it supports HPE’s balance sheet post-acquisition and provides liquidity for ongoing operations and investment. This announcement speaks directly to HPE’s challenge of balancing growth funding with prudent risk management, especially as increased leverage heightens the need for reliable cash flow to service debt and deliver expected value from recent acquisitions.

However, investors should also be mindful that, as integration risk comes to the forefront, ...

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is projected to achieve $44.4 billion in revenue and $2.7 billion in earnings by 2028. This outcome assumes a 10.3% annual revenue growth rate and a $1.6 billion increase in earnings from the current $1.1 billion level.

(ABT) stands out as a case study in balancing shareholder returns with strategic reinvestment. The company's recent 7.3% dividend increase in 2025, raising the quarterly payout to $0.59 per share, underscores its commitment to rewarding investors while maintaining financial prudenceAbbott Reports Second-Quarter 2025 Results[ 1 ]. This growth follows a decade of disciplined capital allocation, with dividends rising from $0.36 per share in 2020 to $0.59 in 2025—a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.44%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) Dividend History[ 5 ]. However, the true test of sustainability lies not in the payout itself, but in the company's ability to reinvest earnings effectively while maintaining flexibility in a sector marked by regulatory and macroeconomic headwinds.

Dividend Sustainability: A Closer Look at Payout Ratios

Abbott's 2025 dividend sustainability is anchored by a sharp decline in its earnings-per-share (EPS)-based payout ratio, which fell from 93% in 2024 to 27.54% in 2025ABT: Dividend Analysis - Abbott Laboratories at date 2025 07 19[ 2 ]. This improvement reflects robust earnings growth outpacing dividend increases, a critical factor for long-term stability. Complementing this is the free cash flow (FCF)-based payout ratio of 83% in Q2 2025, which, while elevated, remains well within safe territory given Abbott's $1.2 billion in operating FCF for the quarter—comfortably covering the $1.0 billion in dividendsAbbott Reports Second-Quarter 2025 Results[ 1 ].

These metrics contrast sharply with broader healthcare sector trends. While the industry's average dividend payout ratio for 2024 was 6% (based on ReadyRatios data)Abbott Reports Second-Quarter 2025 Results[ 1 ], Abbott's 2025 EPS-based ratio appears higher. However, this discrepancy highlights the company's unique positioning: unlike peers such as

, which reported a mere 5.6% FCF payout ratio in early 2025ABT: Dividend Analysis - Abbott Laboratories at date 2025 07 19[ 2 ], prioritizes a balanced approach. Its strategy aligns with sector-wide practices, where healthcare firms have historically directed 95% of net income to shareholders via dividends and buybacks between 2001 and 2022Health Care Sector Shareholder Payouts Up 300[ 6 ]. Abbott's approach, therefore, reflects a deliberate choice to reward shareholders while retaining sufficient capital for innovation.

Reinvestment Initiatives: Fueling Future Growth

Abbott's reinvestment strategy in 2025 is a testament to its long-term vision. The company has committed $500 million to expand manufacturing and R&D facilities in Illinois and Texas, with projects slated for completion by year-endAbbott Reports Second-Quarter 2025 Results[ 1 ]. These investments, which will create 300 U.S. jobs, focus on advancing transfusion diagnostics—a critical area given the aging global population and rising demand for blood screening technologies. Additionally, Abbott plans to construct a cardiovascular device manufacturing plant in Georgia by 2028, further solidifying its domestic production capabilitiesHealth Care Sector Shareholder Payouts Up 300[ 6 ].

These initiatives are not merely defensive responses to looming tariffs but proactive steps to future-proof the business. By strengthening its U.S. manufacturing footprint, Abbott mitigates supply chain risks and positions itself to capitalize on domestic healthcare demand. The company's reinvestment also extends to its balance sheet: a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.27 as of 2025Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Financial Ratios[ 4 ] provides ample flexibility for further capital allocation without overleveraging.

Long-Term Shareholder Value: A Delicate Equilibrium

The interplay between dividend sustainability and reinvestment is pivotal for Abbott's long-term value creation. Its 2025 reinvestment initiatives, coupled with a historically low EPS-based payout ratio, suggest a company that is neither overcommitting to dividends nor neglecting growth opportunities. This balance is further reinforced by Abbott's 51-year streak of consecutive dividend increasesDividends are an important part of Abbott’s heritage and investment identity[ 3 ], a track record that underscores its ability to adapt to economic cycles while maintaining investor trust.

Critically, Abbott's reinvestment aligns with macroeconomic realities. As global healthcare systems grapple with cost pressures and technological disruption, companies that can innovate while maintaining shareholder returns will outperform. Abbott's dual focus on expanding its diagnostic and cardiovascular portfolios—while sustaining a dividend yield that has averaged ~2.5% over the past five years—positions it as a rare hybrid: a defensive healthcare play with growth-oriented DNA.

Conclusion: A Model for Sustainable Capital Allocation

Abbott Laboratories' 2025 performance exemplifies the art of sustainable capital allocation. By lowering its payout ratios through earnings growth, committing to strategic reinvestment, and maintaining a resilient balance sheet, the company has created a framework for enduring shareholder value. For investors, this represents a compelling case study in how a mature healthcare firm can navigate sector-specific challenges while delivering consistent returns. As the healthcare landscape evolves, Abbott's disciplined approach may well serve as a benchmark for others to follow.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758356897344.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-21 05:07:12.713194

The recent downturn follows a Q4 2024 earnings report that fell short of expectations, with revenue of $4.94 billion lagging behind the estimated $4.98 billion.

The company’s 2025 guidance, which projected flat revenue growth and mid-single-digit adjusted EPS expansion, further dampened market optimism despite management’s confidence in long-term resilience.

Operational adjustments have also drawn attention. Regulatory scrutiny, including a Texas Attorney General investigation into toothpaste packaging, has raised compliance costs and reputational risks. Conversely, Colgate’s partnership with Erthos to develop sustainable biopolymer packaging aligns with growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products. Such initiatives aim to bolster brand loyalty and differentiate the company in a competitive market, though their near-term impact on margins remains uncertain.

The Altaviva device is inserted near the ankle.
The Altaviva device is designed to have a 15-year battery lifespan under expected therapy settings and delivers therapy automatically, requiring no daily intervention or manual adjustments from the patient.
""The Altaviva device represents a transformative milestone and ushers in a new bladder control therapy with advanced features.
“This overactive bladder is a huge market,” Medtronic Chairman and CEO Geoff Martha said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript of the call.","Medtronic said it has won an FDA nod for an implantable tibial neuromodulation therapy that treats urge urinary incontinence.

The Altaviva device is inserted near the ankle. The Dublin-based company said nearly 16 million people have urge urinary incontinence, a common symptom of overactive bladder (OAB) characterized by a sudden, intense urge to urinate, often followed by involuntary leaks before reaching the bathroom.

The Altaviva device is designed to have a 15-year battery lifespan under expected therapy settings and delivers therapy automatically, requiring no daily intervention or manual adjustments from the patient. Recharging will take up to 30 minutes when using the default recharging speed, eliminating the need for daily at-home charging equipment.

""Too many people silently struggle with the challenges of urgency and loss of bladder control, often believing that relying on diapers or pads is their only option,"" said Brett Wall, executive vice president and president of the Medtronic Neuroscience Portfolio. ""The Altaviva device represents a transformative milestone and ushers in a new bladder control therapy with advanced features. Medtronic has earned its position as the global leader in neuromodulation by consistently pushing the boundaries of innovation, and this FDA approval underscores our unwavering commitment to delivering therapies that truly change lives.""

The device will sit calmly in Medtronic’s Pelvic Health Business. The company said it expects the Pelvic Health business to be a key driver in the future.

“This overactive bladder is a huge market,” Medtronic Chairman and CEO Geoff Martha said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript of the call. “It's millions of patients. And the idea of going from basically an implantable device in your upper buttocks, the sacral nerve modulation, to something that's above your fascia on the ankle, it's not quite a wearable, but it's pretty close to wearable, is really going to open up that market.

S&P and Moody’s at same level Although Moody’s didn’t change the company’s rating, the move to a positive outlook comes less than three months after S&P Global Ratings downgraded XPO’s debt to BB from BB+.
When S&P made that move, it put the two agencies’ rating of XPO (NYSE: XPO) at levels considered equivalent.
However, the S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) outlook on XPO is stable, in contrast to the new positive outlook at Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) just bestowed this week.
“The positive outlook reflects expectations that XPO will improve profitability and maintain credit metrics despite current industry challenges,” Moody’s said.","XPO’s ratings were affirmed by Moody’s at Ba2 for the Corporate Family Rating (CFR) and Ba2-PD for its Probability of Default rating.

S&P and Moody’s at same level

Although Moody’s didn’t change the company’s rating, the move to a positive outlook comes less than three months after S&P Global Ratings downgraded XPO’s debt to BB from BB+. When S&P made that move, it put the two agencies’ rating of XPO (NYSE: XPO) at levels considered equivalent.

However, the S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) outlook on XPO is stable, in contrast to the new positive outlook at Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) just bestowed this week.

The change to a positive outlook and the reasons Moody’s cited for the move stand in stark contrast to what S&P Global said in July in conjunction with its downgrade of XPO that came down at the start of July, even though both companies are effectively at the same place.

While S&P Global made its call largely on the basis of its expectation of the freight recession dragging on, Moody’s more optimistic outlook is tied to a “slow recovery” in freight markets as well as various operating changes XPO has implemented.

“The positive outlook reflects expectations that XPO will improve profitability and maintain credit metrics despite current industry challenges,” Moody’s said.

Moody’s added it expects improvement in XPO’s operating performance going into 2026, “driven by cost reduction initiatives and profitable growth from its network expansion following the acquisition of certain terminals previously owned by Yellow Corporation.” XPO acquired the terminals from Yellow in late 2023 and began opening them within the XPO network last year.

We’ve heard this statement previously

And in a sentence that could have been written anytime in the last two to three years, Moody’s said: “In addition, we expect a slow recovery in key transport areas such as freight volumes and spot pricing over the next year.”

The ratings agency also was upbeat about the outlook for XPO’s finances. “We anticipate that XPO will maintain a prudent approach to capital allocation while achieving profitable growth and stronger credit metrics, even in the face of end-market headwinds,” the ratings agency said. “We project that XPO will sustain solid profit margins and strong interest coverage, with debt-to-EBITDA stabilizing under 3.0x in 2026.”

XPO in the second quarter recorded revenue of $2.08 billion, almost identical to a year earlier. Its net income of $106 million was down from $150 million a year earlier.

Moving from a positive outlook to an actual upgrade, Moody’s said, would need “an improvement in margins, a sustained debt-to-EBITDA ratio approaching 3.0x and EBITDA-to-interest coverage of approximately 5 times.”

Reasons for a possible downgrade would include debt-to-EBITDA rising to 4X, or “if the company fails to improve EBIT margin from the current level of 8.5%,” Moody’s said.

An XPO spokesman declined comment on the Moody’s report.

XPO’s stock is up about 13.7% in the last year and 8.7% in the last three months.

The strategist remains bullish on the overall market and sees opportunities for growth in various sectors.

Bank of America's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, Savita Subramanian, has predicted that earnings growth will extend beyond the technology and artificial intelligence sectors, signaling a significant market broadening BofA’s Savita Subramanian: There are signs of earnings broadening beyond tech and AI[ 1 ]. This prediction comes as the strategist remains bullish on the S&P 500, noting that while previous market growth has been concentrated in AI and tech, data suggests a wider distribution of earnings growth is emerging. Subramanian emphasized that the combination of Federal Reserve rate cuts and accelerating profit growth creates a favorable environment for stocks. She noted, ""We’ve been bullish on the S&P 500. I think that continues, but I do see signs that it’s not just about AI and tech.""

Subramanian acknowledged the impact of AI on job markets but highlighted potential offsetting factors. She pointed to likely tightness in manufacturing and skilled labor markets, stating, ""You can’t use robots to build an entire building. So, I think that skilled manufacturing labor market could actually heat up."" This manufacturing-focused theme represents her top recommendation for investors seeking growth potential.

Long-term bond yields are seen as a more significant factor for equity markets than short-term Fed rate decisions, according to Subramanian. Her quantitative analysis suggests that stocks can withstand higher yields than many expect, with significant multiple compression not expected until yields reach 7%. However, she cautioned that if yield curve steepening stems from declining demand for U.S. Treasuries rather than improved growth expectations, markets could face headwinds.

Subramanian expressed preference for commodity-related investments, particularly in sectors such as materials (XLB), energy (XLE), and industrials (XLI), where she expects a real pickup in margin growth and sales. These sectors, she concluded, represent areas of interest for investors seeking growth potential.

Boston Scientific is about to raise its long-term revenue targets at its investor day, doubling down on confidence as product rollouts and operational wins keep the company ahead of the curve.

What does this mean?

At its biennial investor day in late September, Boston Scientific is expected to announce fresh financial targets for the 2026-2028 period. Analysts are looking for the company to boost its organic revenue growth guidance to between 9% and 11%, up from the previous 8% to 10% range for 2024-2026. This optimism comes as the firm continues hitting quarterly milestones, propelled by strong product pipelines and strategies like cost cutting, tariff management, and effective pricing. Recent launches have powered robust earnings, with Boston Scientific raising its 2025 forecast after topping expectations in July. According to research firm Needham, these updated targets fit squarely with market consensus, reinforcing the company's reputation as a medtech front-runner.

Why should I care?

For markets: Boston Scientific sets the pace for medtech.

A stronger growth outlook could reignite investor enthusiasm across the medical technology sector. As Boston Scientific delivers steady margins and successful launches, it points to the kind of reliable growth that’s increasingly hard to find among large-cap health stocks. This makes the company’s progress a key indicator for both peers and long-term market sentiment.

Data Center Frontier: How are you helping data center operators strike a balance between capital expenditure and long-term operational efficiency in thermal and water systems, especially amid AI build urgency?
Brandon Peterson, CoolIT Systems: We’re proud to offer a technology that improves both capital expenditures (CapEx) and long-term operational efficiency (OpEx), especially when compared to legacy air-cooling solutions.
While data center operators are increasingly adopting liquid cooling to meet the thermal requirements of modern processors, the technology also brings valuable secondary benefits.
By focusing on both immediate and long-term efficiency, Trane ensures that data center operators can maintain optimal performance while adhering to environmental standards.","For the second installment of our Executive Roundtable for the Third Quarter of 2025, we turn to one of the central dilemmas facing the industry: how to balance the breakneck pace of AI-driven construction with the need for long-term operational efficiency.

AI data centers are being built at a scale and speed never before seen — often measured in gigawatts — with cooling and water systems under intense scrutiny for both cost and sustainability. The challenge for operators is finding solutions that deliver immediate capacity while avoiding efficiency trade-offs that could become long-term liabilities.

We asked our panel of experts how they are helping operators strike the right balance between capital expenditure and operational efficiency in thermal and water systems, especially in the context of AI build urgency.

In response to our inquiry, CoolIT's Brandon Peterson highlights how liquid cooling not only meets the thermal needs of AI processors but also drives significant CapEx and OpEx savings by reducing reliance on air infrastructure, lowering fan and chiller loads, and enabling warm-water efficiency at gigawatt scale.

For his part, Mukul Girotra emphasizes Ecolab’s early role in site selection and cooling design, helping operators balance water and power efficiency while minimizing environmental impact, then extending that optimization through digital tools and continuous improvement once facilities are live.

Finally, Becky Wacker of Trane underscores her company's holistic approach to balancing CapEx and OpEx via smart services, sustainable system design, and flexible financing models, enabling operators to maintain efficiency, resilience, and sustainability as AI-driven demand accelerates.

And now onto the second Executive Roundtable question for Q3 of 2025.

Data Center Frontier: How are you helping data center operators strike a balance between capital expenditure and long-term operational efficiency in thermal and water systems, especially amid AI build urgency?

Brandon Peterson, CoolIT Systems: We’re proud to offer a technology that improves both capital expenditures (CapEx) and long-term operational efficiency (OpEx), especially when compared to legacy air-cooling solutions.

While data center operators are increasingly adopting liquid cooling to meet the thermal requirements of modern processors, the technology also brings valuable secondary benefits. Liquid cooling enables data centers to reduce or eliminate a substantial part of the air-cooling infrastructure that would otherwise be required.

In terms of efficiency, liquid cooling lowers the power server fans consume, reduces the need for air conditioning and air handling within the data hall, and decreases the load on facility-level equipment, especially when systems are designed for warm-water operation.

With AI data centers now being built at gigawatt scale, the resulting CapEx and OpEx savings are significant.

Mukul Girotra, Ecolab: First, we’re collaborating very early on in the site selection process to help our customers evaluate what cooling topology for a given region is truly most sustainable with least holistic impacts on watersheds and power grids. This includes evaluation of climate, geography, source of power generation, water sources available, their respective qualities, as well as local water stress/strain.

In taking this approach, we can support in the evaluation of what cooling topologies are able to drive the best balance between WUE and PUE interests, which in turn can allow for allocation of as much power to compute (increasing that amount of compute per interconnection) as possible. Which in aggregate can have considerable positive impacts on power grids and watersheds.

When a decision is made to use water as part of data center cooling topologies, as part of our design consultation, we’re also able to identify continuous improvement projects within identified customer ROI/IRR that drive reductions in total cost of operation.

Once a data center is up and running, through deployment of our technology and digital innovation we’re able to support our strategic partners in continuing to align operational and design efficiencies and identify opportunities for efficiency capture.

Becky Wacker, Trane: Focusing on post-initial construction CapEx expenditures, finding a balance between capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx) is crucial for efficient capital deployment for data center operators. This balance can be influenced by ownership strategy, cash position, budget planning duration, sustainability goals, and contract commitments and durations with end users.

At Trane, we focus on understanding these key characteristics of operations and tailor our ongoing support to best meet the unique business objectives and needs of our customers. We address these challenges through three major approaches:

1. Smart Services Solutions: Our smart services solutions improve system efficiency through AI-driven tools and a large fleet of truck-based service providers. By keeping system components operating at peak efficiency, preventing unanticipated failures, and balancing the critical needs of both digital monitoring and well-trained technicians, we maintain critical systems. This approach reduces OpEx through efficient operation and minimizes unplanned CapEx expenditures. Consequently, this enables improved budgeting and the ability to invest in additional data centers or other business ventures.

2. Sustainable and Flexible System Design: As a global climate innovator, Trane designs our products and collaborates with engineers and owners to integrate these products into highly efficient system solutions. We apply this approach not only in the initial design of the data center but also in planning for future flexibility as demand increases or components require replacement.

The selloff followed a mix of earnings-related concerns and broader macroeconomic pressures, despite institutional buying activity and sustainability-focused initiatives.

The stock’s underperformance was partly driven by a revenue miss in Q4 2024, where the company reported $4.94 billion in sales, falling short of the $4.98 billion estimate. While adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 exceeded expectations, the revenue shortfall raised questions about demand resilience in key markets. Management attributed the weakness to foreign exchange headwinds and macroeconomic volatility, projecting flat revenue growth for 2025 and adjusted EPS growth in the low- to mid-single-digit range.

Institutional investor activity highlighted both optimism and caution. Cordatus Wealth Management and Nordea Investment Management added to their holdings in late September, while firms like Cambridge Investment Research Advisors reduced positions. These moves reflected divergent views on Colgate’s ability to navigate inflationary pressures and currency fluctuations. Meanwhile,

initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating, citing long-term confidence in the company’s stability.

Colgate’s strategic focus on sustainability and cost efficiency emerged as potential tailwinds. The company announced accelerated net-zero carbon emissions goals and a partnership with Erthos to develop biopolymer packaging, aligning with growing ESG investor preferences. However, insider selling, including $3.57 million in shares sold by the CEO and 24,704 shares by the Chief Legal Officer, introduced short-term uncertainty. High options volume on September 19 further signaled hedging or speculative activity among institutional players.

Macroeconomic factors, including rising oil prices and central bank rate hikes, added to market-wide unease. While Colgate’s Consumer Staples sector positioning typically offers defensive appeal, the company’s year-to-date decline of 8.76% underscored its vulnerability to broader economic risks. Analysts noted that oil-driven inflation and interest rate uncertainty could dampen consumer spending, indirectly affecting demand for household essentials.

Despite these challenges, Colgate’s dividend reaffirmation and institutional ownership (82% of shares held by institutions) remain key positives. The company’s focus on productivity programs and ESG alignment could support long-term resilience, though near-term guidance revisions and earnings performance will remain critical watchpoints for investors.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/news/med-image/compress-1b531aac1c8bc001.png,N,,2025-09-19 11:11:47.790948

Background: Instacart, Credit Karma

Since 2013, Notion has been helping teams of all sizes organize their work, collaborate and customize workflows. Today, the company’s software is in use in more than half of the Fortune 500 companies.

At the helm of Notion’s financial strategy is CFO Rama Katkar, who joined the company in 2022. Katkar oversees strategic finance, corporate finance, accounting, corporate development, business operations and business technology teams. Under her leadership, Notion surpassed 100 million total users in 2024, while continuing to serve a diverse customer base from five-person teams to enterprises with 10,000 seats. The company now has more than 1,000 employees across multiple global offices.

Historically, the company relied on product-led growth, where individuals could try Notion for free and then bring it into their teams. The strategy has been highly effective, with nearly half of Notion’s paid customers originating from free users. More recently, the company has complemented this with a sales-led effort, targeting larger accounts and expanding its offerings to include AI features.

“I’m excited to see us continue to grow sales, while also investing in the product-led online funnel that drives it,” Katkar said. “This two-pronged approach should set us up for durable, efficient growth for many years to come.”

One of the company’s most significant strategic decisions was embracing AI early, Katkar said. It launched Notion AI in November 2022 and has continued to integrate AI into new products, such as Notion Mail and Notion Calendar.

“Given this pace of very rapid product development, we’ve had to build flexible processes and systems to enable our teams to prioritize innovation and take risks on emerging AI technologies,” Katkar said, adding that the company has also stayed nimble with its approach to pricing its AI tools. “Throughout this journey, a small cross-functional group of product, engineering, go-to-market and finance leaders has guided our AI strategy collaboratively. It’s been a fun challenge, and the process has enabled us to drive meaningful revenue from AI while also maintaining strong cash flow margins.”

Katkar expects the rapid pace of change in technology, regulations and policy to continue, presenting both business opportunities and risks.

“At Notion, we take a structured approach to systematically evaluate change, asking whether it presents a risk or opportunity, and how significant it may be,” she said. “We also solicit critical input from a number of cross-functional stakeholders across the company. It’s an exciting time to be building in tech, but managing this rate of change is an ongoing challenge.”",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/13051001/san-franciscodigital-headshots091925-15-katkar*1200xx1600-900-0-0.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 12:45:25.728284

When Mary May started buying from third-party sellers on Walmart 's online marketplace, she said she assumed the products she was purchasing were the same as the ones she'd long bought in stores.

So in late March when she said she saw a ""ridiculous sale"" on her favorite Neuriva brain supplements on Walmart's marketplace, she bought eight bottles for her and her sister.

But when some of the once-daily oral supplements arrived from a seller calling itself Lifeworks-ACS, the 59-year-old mother of three noticed there were misspellings on the bottle and the packaging looked different than it usually did. Weeks later, CNBC confirmed the supplements were counterfeit – and the seller had taken the identity of another business to sign up for the marketplace.

""Walmart betrayed me. …They let me purchase something that could have harmed me, my family,"" May, who was refunded by Walmart for the fake products, told CNBC in an interview from her home in Pleasant Shade, Tennessee. ""As a customer, I expect them to care about my well-being when I purchase something from them. Whether it's from a third-party seller or not, it's on Walmart's website.""

CNBC

May and other shoppers both loyal and new have turned to Walmart.com for better prices and a wider selection than they often get in stores, powering a new wave of sales for the largest U.S. retailer as it races to catch up with Amazon's marketplace. Those customers helped Walmart's U.S. digital business turn profitable this spring after years of losing money, an important milestone for a company that has said e-commerce is the key to increasing its future earnings.

But Walmart's digital boom came as it made it easier for third-party sellers to join and sell on its marketplace, a strategy that has come with a cost, a CNBC investigation uncovered.

Shoppers going to Walmart.com for deals on top brands are sometimes receiving counterfeit, potentially dangerous products instead, CNBC found. Third-party sellers on Walmart's platform in certain cases aren't who they say they are, as CNBC found at least 43 vendors who used the identity of another business to set up their account. Over time, Walmart made its seller and product vetting more lax than Amazon's policies in a bid to woo sellers away from its rival, according to nine marketplace sellers and four current and former Walmart employees.

""It's very disturbing,"" said Elaine Damo, the owner of Lifeworks-ACS, which provides services for children and adults with developmental disabilities.

""It's a domino effect, and it trickles and affects everyone,"" said Damo, who told CNBC she was sent returns from more than a dozen customers — including May — who had purchased counterfeits from the third-party seller that was impersonating her business.

CNBC

Reckitt, the maker of Neuriva, said it ""immediately opened an investigation"" after learning about the counterfeit supplements May bought and said ""the health and safety of consumers is our top priority."" It said anyone who believes they may have bought a fake item should stop using it and contact the company's customer care team.

Over the last five years, the number of sellers and items for sale on Walmart's marketplace has exploded. The platform's U.S. revenue grew 45% and 37%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, Walmart has said. That expansion has fueled Walmart's U.S. e-commerce business, which is second only to Amazon in online sales dollars, according to research from financial firm Mizuho. It's nearing $100 billion in annual revenue and is on pace to represent 10% of all domestic online sales by 2026, Mizuho said.

But that meteoric rise came partly from Walmart's decision to accept some risks in the interest of growth, current and former employees said.

Tammie Jones, who worked on Walmart's seller vetting team from September 2023 to April 2024, said she was pressured to approve seller applications, even when she had concerns about the applicant's credentials or documentation.

""It got to a point where they were just like, 'You know what? Just go ahead and approve everybody,'"" Jones said of her managers' directives. ""They wanted that business, so they were willing to take a chance on it.""

In a statement, Walmart said ""trust and safety are non-negotiable for us.""

""We're unwavering in our commitment to delivering everyday low prices, a broad assortment, and innovative shopping experiences. Counterfeiters are bad actors who target retail marketplaces across the world, and we are aggressive in our efforts to prevent and combat their deceptive behavior,"" Walmart said. ""We enforce a zero-tolerance policy for prohibited or noncompliant products and continue to invest in new tools and technologies to help ensure only trusted, legitimate items reach our customers.""

Counterfeits and fraud are endemic to third-party marketplaces. Amazon, among others, had trouble policing counterfeits as they grew. But Amazon has since tightened its vetting, according to interviews with sellers and e-commerce consultants. Meanwhile, it became easier for bad actors to join and sell on Walmart's marketplace, CNBC's investigation found.

Adam Jeffery | CNBC

CNBC

Walmart has required less documentation and vetting to sign up for its marketplace and had imposed fewer restrictions on the types of products people could sell than its main e-commerce rival, according to a review of Walmart's and Amazon's seller applications and interviews with sellers, former employees and e-commerce consultants.

""If you look at Walmart, they look more like a flea market than a trusted marketplace. It's like the Wild West on their platform,"" said Bob Barchiesi, the president of the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, a non-profit that fights counterfeits and warns fake goods can pose serious health and safety risks. ""You can't try to sell trust from aisle five and then let counterfeiters in"" online.

As part of its reporting, CNBC tested the authenticity of 20 items offered by third-party sellers that had stolen the identity of a real business. All of the products were determined to be counterfeit.

CNBC

Beyond the tests, CNBC reviewed hundreds of product listings and seller pages on the platform and reviewed hundreds of securities filings, earnings call transcripts and internal documents for its investigation. CNBC also interviewed more than 90 people, including third-party sellers on Walmart and Amazon, marketplace consultants, professors, members of law enforcement, and more than a dozen current and former Walmart employees. Some of those current and former staffers declined to be named because they said they could face termination or because they signed confidentiality agreements.

CNBC also spoke with Walmart shoppers about their experiences. While some consumers know the risks of buying health and beauty products on online marketplaces, some said Walmart's brand brings a different level of legitimacy than traditional platforms because it is a trusted brick-and-mortar retailer. Other shoppers told CNBC they weren't even aware they were buying from third-party sellers when shopping on Walmart.com.

""I trust Walmart, I thought I was buying it from them,"" said Aurora Aguilar, who bought skin-care products from a seller impersonating a legitimate business. ""It's their website.""

Product tests and stolen identities

CNBC purchased and tested six items for its investigation, all of them highly rated, deeply discounted beauty products offered by sellers that were impersonating legitimate businesses. It also tested 14 more items that were purchased by Walmart shoppers and returned to Lifeworks-ACS, which sent them to CNBC.

Christina Locopo | CNBC

In most cases, brands authenticated the products for CNBC. In other instances, lab testing conducted by scientists at St. John's University determined whether products were fake by comparing them to an authentic product.

These items are just a sample of the hundreds of millions of goods sold on the platform.

CNBC centered its investigation on beauty products and health supplements because they're some of the most dangerous counterfeits on the market, often made with harmful ingredients that can make people sick, counterfeit experts said. The fact that consumers ingest them or rub them into their skin increases the safety risk, the experts said.

Typically, marketplaces aren't liable for the products their sellers offer. But legal experts said the argument that certain platforms could be held responsible for the sale of harmful products is gaining momentum.

In July, weeks after CNBC shared its reporting with Walmart, the company tightened vetting for some third-party sellers who list health and beauty products on its marketplace, according to emails sent to sellers that were reviewed by CNBC.

The fraudulent sellers uncovered by CNBC took credentials from a wide range of companies. Some purported to be large, publicly traded businesses, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific and Rockwell Medical. Others were smaller companies, including a California juice shop, Chicago pizza chain Dimo's Pizza and the New York City grocery chain D'Agostino.

CNBC

Most of the sellers were offering high-end beauty products at as much as 91% off the typical retail price listed by the brand or one of its authorized partners.

Representatives or owners of the companies that were being impersonated by sellers on Walmart.com all told CNBC they did not have marketplace accounts. They said details like names and addresses listed on publicly available documents were used without their consent. All of the accounts were eventually taken down.

Dimitri Syrkin-Nikolau is the owner and founder of Dimo's Pizza. He said he felt ""powerless"" as he waited for Walmart to take down the fraudulent page and was concerned about damage to his business's reputation.

""We spent 16-plus years building the reputation here in Chicago,"" said Syrkin-Nikolau, adding it took weeks for the page to be removed. ""To know that somebody could just take our name and sell whatever they would like on Walmart's website where we have no control doesn't feel good.""

The cost of growth

Walmart, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, has become a core part of tens of millions of Americans' lives since its founding more than six decades ago. In its most recent fiscal year, it posted a staggering $681 billion in revenue. The discounter has more than 4,600 U.S. locations, and about 90% of the country's population lives within 10 miles of a store.

Still, even the largest U.S. retailer has to grow somewhere. At Walmart, that expansion is happening online.

Through Walmart's third-party marketplace, which fuels novel business like its Amazon Prime rival Walmart+ and its advertising platform Walmart Connect, the retailer can grow profit faster than sales, Walmart executives and Wall Street analysts have said.

The platform also allows Walmart to increase its range of merchandise, which means more customers buying from its website.

""The more sellers that you have selling product, the more customers are going to come and take advantage of that marketplace,"" CFO John David Rainey said at a conference in June.

As Walmart scaled its marketplace, it positioned the platform as more seller-friendly than Amazon, the place to go to avoid its rival's restrictions and policy changes, sellers and former Walmart employees said.

Between 2019 and 2024, the number of sellers on Walmart's marketplace grew more than 900%, according to estimates from Marketplace Pulse, which collects data on leading e-commerce platforms. The increase came as the company made the marketplace a core piece of its strategy, but also overlapped with a period when Amazon ramped up security controls on its platform, banned many sellers and became known as one of the strictest marketplaces to sell on, according to interviews with sellers and e-commerce consultants.

As a result, some sellers sought refuge on Walmart.com during that period, telling CNBC there was less vetting and looser restrictions on the types of goods they could sell. Walmart rarely, if ever, asked them to provide details on how they sourced their goods, the sellers added.

Some sellers, industry experts and former employees said the relatively lax controls made it easier for bad actors to join the platform and sell fake, stolen or dangerous products.

""Walmart has evolved into kind of a dumping ground for all the banned Amazon sellers,"" said Chris McCabe, who used to be a member of Amazon's seller performance team and now runs the consultancy firm ecommerceChris, helping Amazon sellers reinstate suspended accounts. ""Walmart doesn't seem to have as robust a system of enforcement.""

Christina Locopo | CNBC

Walmart didn't comment specifically on McCabe's remarks. An Amazon spokesperson, when asked if the company has made its platform more strict for sellers, told CNBC that ""we are proud of the progress we have made in preventing counterfeits within the Amazon store.""

""This has required significant innovation and perseverance, and it would not be possible without the partnerships we have been able to build with brands, associations, policymakers, law enforcement, and others,"" the Amazon spokesperson said.

Marketplace Pulse estimates Amazon had 21 times the number of sellers that Walmart had at the end of 2024. Given that scale, some brand owners have had more issues with fakes on Amazon's platform than on Walmart's, according to interviews with brand protection firms, e-commerce consultants and counterfeit experts. But Amazon has shown more of a willingness to address some of its problems, said Barchiesi, the president of the IACC.

When the IACC reached out to Walmart in November 2024 inviting the company to join its Marketplace Advisory Council, the retailer stopped responding and didn't ultimately join the initiative, Barchiesi said. The program, which officially launched in May, brings together brands, payment processors and e-commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay and Alibaba to develop best practices and work to get fakes off of online marketplaces.

CNBC

In response, Walmart said it has a relationship with the IACC and has attended many of its conferences since 2019, where the retailer discussed marketplace safety with the organization and industry partners.

About a week after CNBC shared its reporting with Walmart and asked for a response, including to Barchiesi's comments, the company reached out to the IACC to set up a meeting and later agreed to join the advisory council, the group said.

Barchiesi later said the meeting, and the steps Walmart recently took to tighten vetting for some third-party sellers, are a ""critical step forward.""

'There's a lot of money to be made in the gray market'

In the early days of Walmart's marketplace, it had a stricter approach to combating counterfeits and a higher bar for approving sellers, former employees told CNBC.

Seller vetting was considered more stringent than Amazon's, and was so strict that ubiquitous computer maker Dell didn't make the cut when it first applied, said Steve Grigory, who worked on the platform's business development team between 2016 and 2019.

""The trust and safety team rejected them because they weren't good enough and I'm like, 'What the hell are you talking about?'"" said Grigory, who eventually got Dell onto the platform.

But then the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. and Walmart's online business surged. It soon became clear that the marketplace was Walmart's next frontier.

In February 2020, Walmart's then-CEO of U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore, said the platform was growing, but there was still more work to do, including making ""selling easier"" for its vendors.

The following year, it opened its door to Chinese sellers for the first time, according to Marketplace Pulse. By the end of 2021, overall vendors grew nearly 58% from the prior year.

""The biggest goal was just, let's bring on a lot of sellers… [and] get as many products live as we could … to grow the platform and really compete with Amazon,"" recalled one former employee who was involved with bringing sellers onto the marketplace at the time.

To woo sellers away from Amazon, Walmart tried to be more ""accommodating"" than its rival, including by letting sellers list ""certain higher-profile brands,"" the former employee said.

At the time, the only third-party seller allowed to offer Nike products was sports merchandise company Fanatics. Limiting Nike products to one seller reduced the risk of stolen, counterfeit or gray market items, or legitimate products sold outside of official channels.

But early in the pandemic, senior Walmart staff realized Nike products were only bringing in a few hundred thousand dollars in revenue per year, the former employee said. If Walmart allowed a wider range of third-party sellers to list the brand's items, staff reasoned it could generate millions and make the marketplace more competitive, according to the former employee.

Christina Locopo | CNBC

Some argued allowing more third parties to sell Nike products would increase the risk of counterfeits, but management ultimately decided it was a manageable risk relative to the ""size of the prize,"" the former employee recalled.

""There's a lot of money to be made in the gray market,"" the former employee said of management's sentiment. ""If we're going to make [millions] in sales on these Nike products, the percentage of counterfeit from that is probably small enough that it's net worth us doing this, even if we have to play whack-a-mole or refund some customers.""

'Approve, approve, approve'

As Walmart's marketplace grew, adding sellers became a bigger priority and the company began to loosen its vetting and onboarding process, some former employees said.

By the time Jones joined Walmart's seller vetting team in September 2023, she said she had a clear objective from management: ""approve, approve, approve.""

The 54-year-old from Savannah, Georgia, had been with the company since November 2021. When Jones later joined the seller vetting team, she said she reviewed seller applications that didn't pass the initial, automated process.

At first, she said she was required to examine the seller's inventory, call the vendor to make sure they were who they said they were and ensure the business had been open for a certain period of time, among other checks.

CNBC

""But then things changed,"" she said in an interview with CNBC. If Jones could verify the seller's phone number, business address and employer identification number, or EIN, she was told to approve the application, regardless of the inventory the person wanted to offer.

Then, her managers stopped requiring her to call applicants, and she was told to ignore internal guidelines on how long the business had been open and other potential red flags, Jones said.

By that point, Jones said she felt like she was approving an application that should've been denied most of the time.

""It was a red flag for me,"" she said. ""I wasn't sure if something that I'm approving to be pushed through was going to be a product that could potentially harm someone, or if it was a product that was fake.""

Another person who worked in the department at the same time as Jones told CNBC that the team was told to stop doing inventory checks, but said they still felt like they were approving legitimate sellers most of the time.

Jones, who left Walmart in April 2024 for personal reasons including personal health issues and family matters, said she believes the lax approach she experienced is why CNBC found so many seller accounts that had used another business' identity.

In many cases, CNBC identified vendors who weren't who they said they were through a Google search and phone call, which sometimes took just a few minutes.

When CNBC notified the companies that their identities had been stolen, some said they had received mysterious packages at their homes or businesses that they later realized were customer returns.

""I got packages showing up at my shop, perfumes and stuff. I was like, 'Why am I getting these things?'"" said Ed Stuart, whose Cambridge, Massachusetts, business European Country Antiques was used to set up a fraudulent marketplace account. ""I tossed them all because there was no one to send them back to.""

Once the business owners identified by CNBC learned their information had been stolen, many of them contacted Walmart customer support to have the pages taken down. In some cases, product listings from those fraudulent sellers were removed soon after they were reported. But in others, products were still available weeks later. Even in cases where item listings were removed, many of the seller pages were still live for weeks or months after they were reported.

Nichole Magill, the owner of Florida-based Pint Sized Ice Creams, said her home address, which she used in her corporate registration documents, and her business name were stolen to set up a Walmart marketplace account.

Magill said that when she called Walmart to report it, she was transferred four times and then told she needed to send a ""legal letter"" to an office in California for it to be taken down. The page was eventually removed, but it's unclear when.

Syrkin-Nikolau, the owner of Dimo's Pizza, said Walmart's fraud department ""seemed incredibly receptive"" when he reached out in mid-March to notify them about the scam account. But around three weeks later, CNBC reviewed the seller page and found the account was still advertising luxury beauty products at more than 90% off their typical retail price and still using Dimo's business information. It was eventually taken down.

""Who'd be buying an Estee Lauder skin cream from Dimo's Pizza?"" said Syrkin-Nikolau. ""It's absolutely a fake account.""

When CNBC shared information about the scam businesses with Barchiesi from the IACC, he said the sellers would be ""automatic red flags"" in any marketplace ""that has minimal standards of knowing their customer,"" referencing a term platforms use when vetting third-party sellers.

""It's easier to keep people off the marketplace if you do the proper vetting,"" said Barchiesi. ""Once they get into the system, it's much more difficult, right? Because now the consumer's exposed.""

CNBC sent Walmart more than a dozen questions about its vetting processes, but the company declined to answer many of them. A spokesperson told CNBC the company would provide additional information about its seller and product vetting processes on the condition that CNBC not report it publicly, citing concerns that it could compromise its trust and safety systems. CNBC declined to accept information it could not report.

Walmart provided a general statement to CNBC about its commitment to trust and safety. It also issued a news release the day before CNBC's reporting deadline titled: ""Building Trust, Powering Progress: Walmart's Vision for a Safer Marketplace.""

In the release, the company said it operates a ""multi-layered enforcement system"" that includes seller vetting, restrictions on who can sell in certain categories and the use of artificial intelligence to help monitor product listings for policy compliance and intellectual property infringement. It said it proactively takes down listings that violate policies, removes sellers from the platform ""when necessary"" and enables ""rapid response capabilities"" that enable its trust and safety team to ""investigate and address violations quickly."" It said it also has brand protection tools for intellectual property owners.

""While counterfeits are estimated to represent a tiny minority of the products sold on marketplaces, it is an issue that plagues all retail marketplaces,"" Walmart said in its release. ""These fraudulent sellers — who grow savvier, faking credentials and dodging enforcement — erode trust, not just in the companies who run these marketplaces, but in the thousands of large and small sellers who act with integrity and seek only to bring value and assortment to those who shop with us.""

The 'Wild West' of marketplaces

When Paul joined Walmart's marketplace to resell toys, supplements, and other health and household items, he was relieved to find how ""lenient"" it was, he told CNBC in an interview before the July changes. A longtime Amazon seller, Paul spoke on the condition of anonymity and was identified by a pseudonym because he was concerned he would suffer reprisal from Amazon or Walmart, such as additional scrutiny. He told CNBC he had become disillusioned with Amazon after seeing how difficult it had become to resell popular products.

For example, when he tried to get approval to sell products on Amazon from brands like Lululemon or Nike, he said he needed an official invoice from an authorized distributor that showed he'd purchased 10 or, sometimes, as many as 100 units.

Meanwhile, at Walmart, he said he only needed to provide documentation showing he'd purchased one. Paul acknowledged to CNBC that he often buys one item directly from the company to ensure he gets approval, then sources the rest of his inventory through other channels. When asked for further details, Paul declined to share.

""It's more of a Wild West compared to Amazon,"" said Paul. ""So it's a breath of fresh air for somebody like me.""

CNBC spoke with eight people who have resold goods from household brands on Walmart's marketplace. Most said they'd never been asked to provide invoices proving how they sourced their products in order to list them for sale. Some of the sellers who said they were asked to submit documentation said they often only needed to show an invoice for one unit and occasionally, answer a few questions about their supplier.

Providing an invoice that only shows one unit, compared with 10 or 100, makes it easier for people to resell stolen or counterfeit goods, experts said. They would only need to buy one item directly from the brand to get permission to sell it on Walmart, which is cheaper and easier to do than having to buy multiple items. It's unclear if Walmart's policy on invoices changed after it tightened vetting for some third-party sellers in July.

All of the sellers who spoke to CNBC, who were interviewed before the July changes, said there were fewer restrictions at Walmart than on Amazon for most of the popular consumer goods they tried to sell.

Chris Grant, who's been an Amazon vendor for around 12 years and creates courses on how to sell on the platform, said sellers viewed Walmart as ""the place to take things you can't sell on Amazon."" He called it a ""shiny object"" and ""the promised land"" for disillusioned Amazon sellers.

Given Amazon's size and its success in getting brands to sell directly on the platform, it's gotten harder for third-party vendors to offer certain branded goods, sellers and e-commerce consultants said.

CNBC

In response, Amazon said third-party sellers are ""thriving"" on its platform and more than 60% of sales are from independent sellers, which are primarily small and medium-sized businesses.

Beyond product verification, there are clear differences in the ways that Amazon, Walmart and fellow legacy retailer Target currently vet and onboard marketplace sellers on their respective platforms.

On Amazon, sellers have to provide documents to prove their address, such as a bank or credit card statement, according to its application. Applicants must then either take a photo of their face and government-issued ID or conduct a video interview with an Amazon employee where they're required to hold up their ID, show their proof of address and answer questions about their business, according to its application, sellers and e-commerce consultants.

Adam Jeffery | CNBC

On Target's marketplace, sellers can only join by invitation. To be considered, applicants must be able to provide a U.S. business address, a W-9, an EIN and answer a wide range of questions about their assortment, according to its online application.

In March, Target Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said the company's strict approach is the ""right strategy"" and added it hasn't prevented growth.

""We believe the trust consumers have for the Target brand is a real competitive advantage and that trust should extend to our marketplace offerings, too,"" she said.

In the past, seller applicants for Walmart's marketplace were required to provide their EIN and upload both a W-9 and EIN form, key business verification documents that experts say are an extra layer of security, according to a video of Walmart's application uploaded in February 2022 by Helium 10, a software company for marketplace sellers.

Christina Locopo | CNBC

As recently as late March, applicants still needed to provide their EIN, but they were no longer required to upload their W-9 and EIN form that shows the number, according to a video of Walmart's seller application posted to YouTube on March 31 by an independent seller advisor.

Christina Locopo | CNBC

At the time, the only document U.S. sellers were required to upload as part of the business verification process was a copy of their driver's license or passport, according to the video.

Applicants could include additional IRS documents to improve their wait time and chances of being verified, but it was listed as ""optional,"" the video shows.

In July, after CNBC shared its reporting with Walmart, the company said U.S.-based sellers are ""required to upload"" EIN documents, not just the number itself. When pressed on CNBC's reporting that found the forms were optional, and asked when it started requiring them, Walmart said it initially verifies EINs through government and third-party systems to ensure they match the business listing.

""If the initial checks aren't successful, sellers are asked to submit additional documentation… for further verification,"" the company said. ""Sellers who can't provide the required documentation aren't permitted to sell on Walmart Marketplace.""

A video interview is not listed as a requirement to join Walmart's marketplace.

Big bets on beauty

As the number of sellers on Walmart's marketplace grew, so did the range of products it offered.

Last summer, Walmart announced it would add premium beauty products and expand its range of collectibles and preowned items to its marketplace to boost its assortment and draw more customers. Three months later, when Walmart reported earnings, it said the number of items on the platform had exploded – growing to nearly 700 million, a 67% increase from May.

Walmart's marketplace now offers a wide range of products that shoppers wouldn't typically associate with the discounter. Customers shopping for Great Value toilet paper or baking powder can also purchase preowned Rolexes or Louis Vuitton bags for thousands of dollars.

They can also buy thousands of skin-care products, cosmetics and perfumes from popular premium brands including Clinique, Lancome, Estee Lauder and Shiseido.

Adam Jeffery | CNBC

Many of those products have been offered at steep discounts, which experts say is a common red flag associated with counterfeits.

At first glance, many of the premium beauty products are highly rated, which can assure consumers the item is safe to buy. But a closer look shows some of the reviews are worse than they seem.

In February, CNBC analyzed reviews from some popular skincare products, including Sol de Janeiro's Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, which has become popular with tweens.

At the time, the product listing, which displays reviews for all sellers that have offered the item, had 4.6 out of five stars resulting from 2,526 ratings and 1,552 reviews. However, only 246 reviews came from customers who Walmart had verified purchased the item from its platform. Among those, 118, or 48%, were one star.

An analysis of the one-star reviews showed 90% alleged the product was not genuine.

""FAKE! Don't waste your money,"" one person wrote in March. ""This is not an authentic product and Walmart should be ashamed for selling counterfeit products on their site.""

CNBC analyzed ratings for eight other beauty products and found a similar trend.

""My daughter bought these at Sephora before. We ran out and saw these were a good price and decided to purchase,"" one person wrote in a review for Glow Recipe's Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Dew Drops. ""She broke out in hives each time she used the drops.""

Christina Locopo | CNBC

In response to questions about negative feedback on product listings, Walmart said complaints from consumers are flagged and reviewed and the company takes action ""as appropriate.""

The company added if a customer isn't satisfied with a purchase ""for any reason,"" they can use Walmart's return policy, which is designed to correct the issue ""quickly and easily.""

About three weeks after CNBC shared its reporting with Walmart, the company made major changes to its marketplace vetting policies for beauty and personal-care products. It sent an email to some sellers announcing new restrictions for the category and said it would start requiring certain sellers to participate in an ""enhanced vetting program"" for those kinds of items, according to emails sent to sellers that were reviewed by CNBC. The changes would address some of the issues raised in CNBC's reporting.

Adam Jeffery | CNBC

As part of the new program, some sellers would have to provide documentation for each personal-care or beauty item in their assortment. The documents include an invoice that demonstrates the product was sourced directly from a brand owner or manufacturer, or a letter of authorization from the brand owner that stated the seller was allowed to offer the product. It was unclear from the email which sellers would be required to participate in the enhanced vetting program. Walmart declined to provide additional detail about the changes and the factors that drove them.

""We continually enhance our marketplace policies and regularly remove items that violate our policies,"" it said in response. ""If we discover that a seller's items have been removed in error, we proactively work with the seller to quickly restore their listings.""

Numerous beauty and personal-care listings were taken down from the platform after the change, some sellers said.

Evolving legal landscape

The nature of online marketplaces makes it difficult to eradicate counterfeit goods. In the last two years, 50% of counterfeit items were bought from sellers on U.S.-based marketplaces, according to a study conducted by market research firm OnePoll and brand protection platform Red Points.

Part of the issue is a lack of regulation. While selling counterfeit goods is a crime, platforms face almost no liability for facilitating their sale, as long as they take down listings for fake goods after brands bring them to their attention. That's largely because of a 2010 court ruling that arose after Tiffany sued eBay over counterfeit products on the platform.

The court decided that eBay wasn't liable, even if it had general knowledge that fake Tiffany products were being sold on its site, primarily because it had promptly removed infringing listings that Tiffany had reported to the platform.

Kari Kammel, the director of the Center for Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Protection at Michigan State University, said the ruling made it so marketplaces are ""essentially immunized"" from being held responsible for bad actors selling on their platforms.

""They are not required to proactively vet products that are going up or to proactively screen all of their postings and all of their listings, or to even take consumer complaints about counterfeits,"" said Kammel.

Ever since, the ruling has put the onus on retailers and brands to police online marketplaces themselves, conduct test buys to find counterfeit products and submit requests to have the items taken down. It's a long and costly process that can lead to a game of whack-a-mole, where as soon as companies remove one infringing listing, another crops up, starting the process all over again.

Adam Jeffery | CNBC

Some critics of the ruling say it might have made sense in 2010, but the precedent doesn't take into account how modern marketplaces have developed and the technology they now have at their disposal.

Proponents of the ruling say that without it, marketplaces could be forced to police every listing, making it harder for them to run their platforms, which could limit consumer options for online shopping.

The first major piece of legislation to regulate online marketplaces, the Inform Consumers Act, took effect in June 2023 and requires online platforms to collect, verify and disclose certain information about some third-party sellers. The statute is relatively new, so it's unclear to what extent platforms could be held liable for gaps in vetting and verifying their sellers.

The Shop Safe Act, a bipartisan federal bill that aims to curb the sale of fakes on online marketplaces, takes the Inform Act a step further. It's designed to address some of the issues posed by the Tiffany vs. eBay ruling by incentivizing platforms to better vet sellers and the products they're offering. When platforms comply with certain anti-counterfeiting measures, they could be shielded from liability if a seller offers a fake product.

Brands widely supported the legislation, but it has so far failed to pass at least three times, most recently in the last Congress. That's partially because Walmart and other online marketplaces like Amazon, Etsy and eBay have lobbied against aspects of it, two U.S. Senate aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private, told CNBC.

""They generally would just rather not have to do any of these things, right? Like the status quo is pretty good for them,"" one aide said.

The aides cautioned that the platforms aren't outright against the bill and have been engaging with congressional staff on it. The legislation is expected to be reintroduced in the current Congress, they said.

Walmart and Amazon did not respond to CNBC's questions about their lobbying activities around the bill. They also didn't share their positions on the legislation.

Adam Jeffery | CNBC

As brands and consumers await more concrete policy changes, legal experts said the argument that certain platforms could be held responsible for the sale of harmful products like counterfeit body lotion or faulty fire alarms is gaining momentum, even if they were technically sold by a third party.

In the early days of online marketplaces, the courts routinely agreed that when a consumer was harmed by something they bought from a third-party seller, that vendor was liable, not the platform, because it was simply a conduit connecting buyers and sellers and it didn't actually own the product. However, that's started to change over the last few years after Amazon lost a number of cases involving harmful products sold by third-party sellers on its platform, legal experts told CNBC.

In those cases, the courts considered the control Amazon has over the sale process, and the tendency for consumers to be confused over who's responsible if they receive a harmful product. For those reasons, it's become harder for the company to argue that it isn't liable when something goes awry, said Aaron Twerski and Edward Janger, professors at Brooklyn Law School who've studied online marketplaces.

That same confusion can arise for Walmart.com because shoppers know and trust its physical stores, Twerski and Janger said. Consumers could be confused when shopping on its website, unsure if they're buying from America's trusted retail behemoth or an anonymous third-party seller.

""If Amazon should be liable, Walmart should be liable,"" said Twerski. ""Walmart is a stronger case for them being a seller than even Amazon, and Amazon is an extremely strong case for them being a seller.""

For that reason, taking a more lax approach to seller and product vetting could actually help Walmart's argument that it's not liable, said Mark Geistfeld, an expert in product liability and tort law and a professor of law at New York University.

""If they want to avoid getting into the Amazon space of liability, then maybe they should take a more hands-off approach,"" Geistfeld said. ""They're trying to maximize profit, so you have to assume that their decisions are directed along those lines. What's the way we can make the most amount of money at the least amount of cost?""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108200774-1758209551428-14_Products_CU.jpg?v=1758209679&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-09-19 07:06:21.417007

Nine years ago this week, Walmsley was appointed — “slightly to my surprise” — to lead the UK drugmaker.
Investors had been restive about GSK’s performance before Walmsley’s appointment, and one high-profile UK fund manager walked away from the stock soon after she took the helm.
Some shareholders urged her to spin off the consumer health division she ran before becoming CEO.
She echoes industry peers in saying that GSK is “engaging constructively” with the White House.","“I’m not famous for my patience,” Emma Walmsley remarks, as she discusses her oversight of GSK’s AI strategy in an adviser’s office in New York. Pharmaceutical companies like hers may represent “the biggest use case” of all for the technology, she predicts, and she is anxious to see AI deliver not just efficiencies but “bigger innovation, faster” at her $80 billion-plus group.

Nine years ago this week, Walmsley was appointed — “slightly to my surprise” — to lead the UK drugmaker. “I don’t think I grew up dreaming of or believing I would end up being a CEO,” she says, but the Oxford-educated former L’Oréal executive was picked “as an insider-outsider, for a radical change and transformation agenda.” For much of her tenure, others have been equally impatient to see the fruits of that overhaul.

Investors had been restive about GSK’s performance before Walmsley’s appointment, and one high-profile UK fund manager walked away from the stock soon after she took the helm. Some shareholders urged her to spin off the consumer health division she ran before becoming CEO. She resolved in 2021 to do so, promising that a step-change in performance would follow, but GSK’s board soon found itself having to push back against an activist investor that questioned her leadership.

Like many of its industry peers, GSK has struggled to excite investors since then, but Walmsley raised the group’s long-term revenue forecasts this year, reported double-digit growth in core operating profits at its latest earnings, and says it is now “a completely different company” from the one she took over.

GSK’s pipeline of drugs in development has never been stronger, she says. And now it is “heading into a chapter of very important execution and delivery of that pipeline,” with hopes that US regulators will approve two key treatments — for asthma and multiple myeloma — in the next few months. Securing those approvals, and more over the next 18 months to offset the effects of existing drugs coming off patent, will be critical to meeting her growth goals.

GSK’s $30 billion bet on an uncertain US market

This week, timed to President Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK, Walmsley announced that GSK would spend $30 billion in the US over the next five years. The commitment, hailed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as a “powerful example” of collaboration between the two countries, was paired with reassurance that GSK would keep investing in the UK, where some of its rivals have alarmed policymakers by pausing or abandoning investments.

Walmsley, who became a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 2020, identified the US as a top priority early in her tenure, and the market now accounts for just over half of GSK’s sales, up from less than 40% when she started. “It’s a great country to invest in,” she explains: “The incentives are there, and the talent is there, and — at least to date — the market is there.”

Her caveat speaks to fresh uncertainties the current US administration has created in the world’s largest health care market. Trump has threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, while his health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has questioned vaccines’ safety. GSK was among the recipients of a presidential letter in July that told pharmaceutical manufacturers to cut prescription drug prices in the US to match the lowest price offered in other developed nations.

The US has, meanwhile, reportedly been pushing UK officials to pay global pharma companies more, to narrow the gap in drug pricing between the two countries.

Walmsley, a mother of four, says giving birth in Paris, London, and New York gave her firsthand experience of the differences between the three countries’ medical systems. She echoes industry peers in saying that GSK is “engaging constructively” with the White House.

“I completely agree that we want more Americans to have affordable access to the health care that they need,” she says, adding that there are “countries, including our own, where we’d like to see a stronger commercial environment.” At the same time, she argues “the most critical thing is that America continues to lead the world in [incentivizing] innovation in the first place, because that is how we will reduce the cost of health care.”

Reframing the politics of drug pricing

Satisfying the conflicting expectations that investors, governments, patients, and other stakeholders have of pharma companies is a game of “multi-dimensional chess,” Walmsley says. Health budgets are also “a huge allocation of national capital, and today we’re in a world where, frankly, it’s unsustainable.”

But as governments respond to those stretched budgets by targeting her industry’s pricing, Walmsley is looking to reframe the debate. “It’s not as simple as saying, look at that headline price versus that,” she says.

The treatments themselves account for a small percentage of US health care spending, she notes, with costs inflated by a “burdensome” legal environment and by pharmacy benefit managers who act as middlemen between drug manufacturers, insurers, and employers.

“What is expensive is people being sick,” she says, arguing that the best thing that governments can do to bring down the cost of health care is to incentivise “breakthrough innovation” that will keep people out of the hospital.

That applies to vaccines too, she adds, without mentioning Kennedy. “There’s no better return on investment than stopping disease before it starts. The US spends $9 billion a year in hospitalization costs [to treat] vaccine-preventable diseases,” she says. GSK is “very proud of our science,” she adds, but it is trying to engage constructively, and counter industry critics “with science, with transparency, with answering people’s reasonable questions.”

She is hoping to see reform of “the whole incentive system,” she says. “What I hope for is that our industry is properly seen as a partner, and we stop this circular round of criticism.”

Motivating an organization when trust is fragile

When Walmsley took over from Sir Andrew Witty as CEO, she named “trust” as one of her three priorities, alongside innovation and performance. Having not grown up in the industry, she says it should not be disingenuous about “the reality of some poor historic behavior” that has shaken patients’ confidence.

“We have to recognize that shouting ‘trust us,’ as a profit-generating public company, is not the way to [change minds]. We have to go step by step, stakeholder by stakeholder, understand where people’s fears and frustrations are coming from,” she says. But even as she spends time listening to the concerns of politicians and patients, she adds, she is simultaneously trying to motivate the people in her company, and external messaging is not her most important task.

“I think you make a real mistake as a CEO if you worry more about your communication than you do about the delivery of the innovation that’s the core of our purpose,” Walmsley says. Internally, she focuses on the impact that GSK’s innovation can have on patients, “and you have to trust that the communication will follow.”

Tying AI investments to a purposeful goal

What Walmsley calls “inspiring with a purpose” also lies at the heart of her thinking about AI. A Microsoft board member and self-professed “total convert” to AI’s potential for improving early diagnosis and treatment, she says CEOs need to link their investments in the new tech clearly to the benefits they see it bringing.

“I don’t want us doing AI because we want to be the most AI company,” she says: “We’re not here to be great at AI; we’re here to change lives with innovative medicines and vaccines, and AI will help us do it better.”

The technology will also improve GSK’s marketing, reduce its back office costs, and make its forecasting more accurate, Walmsley predicts, but “these are going to be table stakes” — efficiency improvements that every company will make sooner or later. “The exciting and important part in our industry is the R&D part.”

Reaping the full benefits of AI, whether in efficiency or innovation, requires “hard work, and the boring stuff,” she says, like “really detailed change management governance.” So Walmsley oversees the AI strategy personally, and monitors progress in monthly check-ins with members of her leadership team, whom she presses for “demonstrated value delivery.”

“Frankly, I do want to ramp it up another level,” Walmsley says of the AI strategy: “This is something I’m very impatient for.”

GSK has a chief digital and technology officer, but has incorporated AI goals into the evaluations and incentives of other executives, from its head of R&D to its chief financial officer. It is a team that Walmsley has put together with her insider-outsider status in mind.

“I have never believed in the CEO as superhero, [the] smartest person in the room,” she says. “When you come in as a new CEO… you have to be very clear-sighted on who you are, what you’re good at, and where you have to hire the best team in the world to accompany you on this journey.”","https://img.semafor.com/c4a491319f7cd8011e2d97f11defe4bfa98a8cc1-3319x2489.png?rect=0,374,3319,1742&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-09-19 09:04:57.167002

ID42,Walmart,2025-09-19 04:28:15+00:00,Modern Retail,Walmart faced a roughly $400 million surprise expense last quarter - Modern Retail,Mitchell Parton,,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/operations/walmart-faced-a-roughly-400-million-surprise-expense-during-the-second-quarter/,"Until the pandemic, the annual cost increase of what it costs to settle these had been very constant over the past two decades — roughly 1% per year — the CFO explained.
“Post-Covid, for a number of reasons, we began to see the cost increase, and we’ve also increased our accrual since that period of time,” he said.
What this could include It is also not clear what led to this unexpected increase for Walmart in settling these claims.
“Based upon our expectation right now, we like where the accrual is at roughly the midpoint of that overall liability,” Rainey said.
“This quarter [in terms of the claims costs] was higher than what they previously expected, but it doesn’t mean the next quarter will be the same,” Chadha said.","Until the pandemic, the annual cost increase of what it costs to settle these had been very constant over the past two decades — roughly 1% per year — the CFO explained. “Post-Covid, for a number of reasons, we began to see the cost increase, and we’ve also increased our accrual since that period of time,” he said.

But in more recent quarters, the cost to settle these claims has increased even more than the company expected and budgeted for. Rainey expects it to be more expensive going forward. It’s unclear which cases in particular he may be referring to, and the company did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

“It’s disappointing that this is a larger amount and surprising to all those on the call,” Rainey said, though he added that surprises happen when a business is as large and complex as Walmart.

What this could include

It is also not clear what led to this unexpected increase for Walmart in settling these claims.

Rainey only mentioned injuries, but general liability insurance can also include property damage or other liabilities. He said for each of those incidents, the company self-insures and accrues a certain amount it expects to be the cost to settle those liabilities in the future.

“A lot of those are settled,” Rainey said. “In fact, the vast majority are settled just by us handling that with our customers. Sometimes, they go to torte, and that often results in them becoming more expensive. It’s a smaller percentage of them overall, but also a more expensive bucket there.”

He also noted that this is not a case of the company having more incidents, which he said have declined year over year — just that costs have gone up.

“We continue to emphasize safety and other measures in our stores to try to bring down [the] number of incidents.”

Karen Kelso, a vp for the research firm Kantar, said it could also be due to factors such as property loss due to unpredictable weather; higher costs to insure pricey new, automated distribution centers; increasingly expensive property costs, in general, or increased security for executives.

No more surprises

Rainey said the company’s operating income guidance remains unchanged despite the unforeseen costs representing three-quarters of a billion dollars in additional expenses.

That “really speaks to how we’re feeling about the momentum in the business and the strength of the core business overall,” Rainey added. The liability can span about $1 billion from the low end to the top end, according to the CFO.

“Based upon our expectation right now, we like where the accrual is at roughly the midpoint of that overall liability,” Rainey said. “I do think we’re going to experience higher costs into the future, but we don’t expect it to be a surprise like it was this quarter, or, said differently, to be more of a catch-up in this period.”

Mickey Chadha, a retail analyst and vp of corporate finance for Moody’s, said he doesn’t see the costs as substantial compared to Walmart’s overall profitability, especially as it is built into the company’s profitability guidance. The company still made $33.7 billion in gross profit last quarter, up 5.8%, and operating income of $6.7 billion, up 2%.

“This quarter [in terms of the claims costs] was higher than what they previously expected, but it doesn’t mean the next quarter will be the same,” Chadha said. “These come as settlements happen and that liability is put on, but it’s not something that you can extrapolate to say that it’s going to be the same amount next quarter, because these things are volatile.”

What this means for other retailers

Walmart’s handling of this situation could be a lesson to retailers who aren’t as large as the big-box giant.

Tom Faulkner, clinical professor of risk management and insurance at Butler University in Indianapolis, said his reaction was that Walmart has still been practicing good risk management by budgeting the losses it expects to have due to general liability claims — despite this quarter’s being unexpectedly large.

Faulkner said small retail operators, like those that may just have one store, don’t always do this. He recommends that any company, even those not as large as Walmart, should look back at their previous liability losses and estimate what the costs may be moving forward, such as by averaging the number of liability claims in one year and budgeting for that in the next year.

“The most efficient way for you to pay those small liability losses is to just budget for them,” Faulkner said. “Pack three cents on your product or whatever, but budget for them. … And then, as you retain your expected losses, you can increase your deductible on your liability insurance, which is going to lower the cost of the liability insurance.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/walmart-revenue-digiday.webp,N,,2025-09-19 01:04:24.182786
