There were a number of estimates that suggested that retail sales would be in the low single digits.
It ended up being in the mid-single digits around the 4% um, gain range, and even higher than that for e-commerce.
The big question is what happens in 2026, um, because there is just so much uncertainty with the economy, with interest rates, um, and of course with consumer confidence continuing to go down.
They gained share through the pandemic and continue to hold on to that share.","Let's talk about the holiday season and just kind of wrap 2025 and set up 2026 for us broadly.

Well, 2025 did pretty well. There was a relatively strong momentum in spite of consumer confidence levels. Even through the holiday season, we saw stronger than expected numbers. There were a number of estimates that suggested that retail sales would be in the low single digits. Um, some players even thought it would be negative. It ended up being in the mid-single digits around the 4% um, gain range, and even higher than that for e-commerce. Um, so the momentum of retail has been strong in 2025. The big question is what happens in 2026, um, because there is just so much uncertainty with the economy, with interest rates, um, and of course with consumer confidence continuing to go down.

And let's talk about Walmart and some of the other uh big retailers that are getting new CEOs, Target as well, and I don't know if these are on your coverage list, but I'm just going to list them because they're in the news as well. Camping World, Craft Heinz, Kohl's, Lulu Lemon, 7-Eleven, uh and it seems like changes in the air. So talk to us more specifically about Walmart and Target, please.

Well, Target has struggled a lot in the last few years and I am not entirely confident that um new leadership is going to write that ship. There are a number of operational and executional issues that they need to address. Walmart on the other hand has been on a roll. They have been doing incredibly well for several years. They gained share through the pandemic and continue to hold on to that share. They've invested heavily um both in their physical store experience, which is of course still the majority of their sales and they also have managed to continue to take share even in the dotcom and e-commerce sector. So those are things that are absolutely in Walmart's favor. Um and it's uh the new CEO of Walmart um likely is uh has a has a hard task ahead of them because they because the company has um has been doing so well to continue to grow on top of that is not going to be particularly easy. But that said, um if there is an economic downturn and if consumers do cut back on spending in 2026, these mass merchants like Walmart and Costco are likely to be beneficiaries.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SshzM0SV2fEPuPrvHMMdyQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/caaa3080-e4da-11f0-a7ff-64486baa1f62,N,,2025-12-29 17:00:03.205801

You can redesign the process end-to-end and embed AI, GenAI (generative AI), and agentic AI.
BPO providers need to invest heavily in agentic AI and those are the ones that will survive,” said Saurabh Gupta, president, research and advisory, HfS Research.
Many BPM companies have moved on to providing process optimisation and are delivering end-to-end solutions on process transformation rather than process management services.
Companies such as Genpact have launched “account payables as an agent”, decoupling from traditional services and focusing more on expertise, innovation, and outcome-driven solutions.","Yet, even as many agreed with this prediction, the sector delivered one of its biggest surprises in years: Capgemini’s $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS. The deal has forced a rethink of the future of business process management (BPM) — not as a low-margin, labour-heavy adjunct to information-technology (IT) services but as a business being repositioned for an AI-led operating model.

Explaining the rationale behind the acquisition, Capgemini Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Aiman Ezzat said BPM remained one of the fastest-growing segments.

“It is interesting to see that a business many assumed would eventually die is the one growing the fastest,” Ezzat said in an interaction with Business Standard. “For us the big opportunity lies in the complete transformation of end-to-end processes. For instance, take the claims process in insurance. You can redesign the process end-to-end and embed AI, GenAI (generative AI), and agentic AI. Such a transformation is complex and requires defining processes at a granular level. WNS gives us that capability,” said Ezzat.

The year 2026 is a year when the industry crosses the threshold from traditional BPM to intelligent operations powered by AI and driven by humans in the loop.

For decades, this industry — just like IT companies — depended on headcount–based delivery, fixed pricing models, and labour-intensive operations. But the impact of AI and GenAI is changing that play.

“This industry will look different in the next two years. BPO providers need to invest heavily in agentic AI and those are the ones that will survive,” said Saurabh Gupta, president, research and advisory, HfS Research.

“They have to reinvent themselves with technology providers coming into the BPO space as well. CommoditiSed BPOs will be hit the hardest and the ones that provide contextual services tailored to the needs of customers will survive.”

The BPM industry, worth $54.6 billion in 2024-25, according to the Nasscom data, continues to count the United States as its largest market, which is contributing about half its top line, with Europe adding another 30 per cent.

Banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) provides about 30 per cent of the revenue while hospitality and telecom contribute about 20 per cent each.

While the industry last year grew 4.7 per cent, its trajectory will depend solely on how fast it is able to adapt to the new technology. Many BPM companies have moved on to providing process optimisation and are delivering end-to-end solutions on process transformation rather than process management services. They are also moving beyond traditional pricing models to outcome-based pricing, often adopting a hybrid model depending on the specifics of each engagement.

“This transition is reshaping work. As workflows become more autonomous and data-rich, people will move into higher-order roles that demand judgement, orchestration, and strategic decision making, unlocking a level of performance previously out of reach. At industry level, this will accelerate consolidation because only organisations with true scale, deep domain depth, and strong platforms will be capable of leading the AI-enabled Digital BPS market,” said Keshav Murugesh, group CEO, WNS.

This shift is visible in how BPM firms are redesigning their offers. Companies such as Genpact have launched “account payables as an agent”, decoupling from traditional services and focusing more on expertise, innovation, and outcome-driven solutions. Such moves may cannibalise their existing revenue but analysts say they need to adopt it to be an agentic company rather than a pure-play BPO.

“These agentic solutions are taking hold with new clients who are net new to Genpact or are net new to that particular agentic solution,” Genpact CEO Balkrishnan Kalra said in a call with analysts in November.

This means traditional BPOs, which will continue to provide legacy services in finance and accounting, payroll management, contact centre, and supply-chain management, need to reinvent or get acquired because clients would not be ready to pay for the huge workforce.

Gaurav Vasu, founder of UnearthInsights, said: “Pure-play BPOs will find it hard to survive. We will see technology plus people plus industry domains come in and they will provide the business capability.”",https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-05/13/full/1747153926-986.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 16:00:30.395180

Uh we saw that it's been exploding over the last few years. It's set to continue next year.

It's really only Alphabet and Nvidia, maybe Tesla as a come behind story that have really surged this year. So is it a game of have and have nots or how do you see this playing out?

No, it's a great question. I mean, look, I think Nvidia obviously continues to do well, but I also am certain that Nvidia is going to heck get a heck of a lot more competition in 2026. AMD is, you know, an obvious one, but there's a lot of other little players. I mean, you know, Nvidia's uh deal with Grock recently to bring more of their technology in is a reflection of the fact that we're seeing more specialized types of models being developed. We're we're going from the days of big general purpose LLMs that you can use for everything to much more specialized areas. And each of those are going to require different types of hardware and I think in turn that's going to create additional opportunities, but it's going to create more diversity, which is going to be a little harder to figure out. But obviously I think, you know, you're going to continue to see folks like Nvidia and AMD do well. I do, as I said, I think you're going to start to see uh some of the smaller the cloud guys who are doing custom chips often through Broadcom will also start to benefit. We've seen already, you know, Google's been doing more with TPUs, uh Amazon has their Graviton chips. Um, we've got a a bunch of other companies. Microsoft is doing custom chips. A lot of these are arm-based. So arm is another company, you know, we haven't been talking about them a lot lately, but arm's helping drive some of this innovation. Intel, as you've talked about, you know, is doing well. They continue to plug away. Obviously, they had their challenges last year, but things are looking better in 2026. So, I think we're going to see a lot of different players uh from different areas uh all start to come together. And we'll see some smaller companies. Uh there's a little company called SiTime that does uh timing chips and all these networks have to be completely aligned from a timing perspective. They're doing some interesting stuff. So, I think there's a lot of different opportunities in different areas. Um but we're going to have a lot of the bears on the side just again, waiting to pounce on these oper these concerns that get raised, I think around a gentic AI.

And we'll have to see if those are dips worth buying or not. And Bob, what I'm realizing is we got to do another podcast real soon. So thank you for showing up.

In third-quarter fiscal 2025, TGT reported 2.4% digital comps growth and more than 35% expansion in same-day services, reinforcing that guests increasingly expect intuitive, fast and digitally assisted shopping experiences. TGT’s partnership with OpenAI represents a timely leap forward in how consumers discover and purchase products online.

At the core of this initiative is the ability for guests to shop directly through natural-language conversations. By describing what they need — whether a gift idea, a household item or products tied to a specific budget — shoppers receive curated recommendations without navigating menus or search bars. This AI-driven approach aims to replicate the feel of a personalized in-store experience, while streamlining the digital journey from discovery to checkout.

The partnership will also integrate tightly with TGT’s fulfillment ecosystem. Guests will be able to complete multi-item purchases, select Drive Up or pickup options and even shop for fresh foods — all within an OpenAI-powered chat interface. With two-day delivery available to 99% of U.S. households and next-day capabilities now covering more than half the country, TGT is uniquely positioned to operationalize this conversational demand at scale.

Supporting these innovations is a robust AI backbone already reshaping internal operations. Tools like Target Trend Brain and synthetic audiences help identify trends early and test consumer response before launch. On-shelf availability for key items improved more than 150 basis points year over year across TGT’s top 5,000 items.

While discretionary softness remains a headwind, OpenAI-led conversational commerce could provide TGT with a new demand engine.

We appreciate the trust being placed in this building by our first official tenant, and look forward to ongoing success as we continue to field strong prospect interest in the project’s remaining available buildings,” Lincoln Property Co. executive vice president John Orsak said in a news release.

As of Monday, SONAR’s Outbound Tender Rejection Index (OTRI) for the Phoenix market stood at 7.42%, rising week over week and signaling potential tightening in local trucking capacity. The increase suggests carriers are becoming more selective as prolonged low rates continue to push marginal operators out of the market.

While tender rejections are climbing, outbound volumes in Phoenix have remained relatively flat or declined compared with the same period in 2024 and 2023. That divergence points to a shifting balance of power, with carriers gaining leverage despite muted demand — an early indication that spot rates could begin moving higher and the shipper-friendly environment may be fading.

Industrial development accelerates around Phoenix

Walmart’s purchase comes amid a wave of new industrial construction across the Phoenix area, particularly in submarkets tied to advanced manufacturing and semiconductor investment.

In north Phoenix’s Deer Valley area, ViaWest Group and Barings have broken ground on ReDiscover Logistics Park, an 808,448-square-foot Class A industrial development targeting suppliers, manufacturers and distributors serving Arizona’s expanding chip ecosystem, In Business Magazine reported.

The site sits around 15 minutes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s multibillion-dollar fabrication campus, positioning it as a logistics hub for high-value, time-sensitive freight.

Last-mile and logistics firms follow region’s growth

Arizona’s population growth and industrial build-out are also drawing logistics service providers focused on speed and specialization.

Jet Delivery, a 75-year-old same-day and time-critical logistics provider, recently launched Phoenix operations, citing demand from healthcare, manufacturing, aerospace, tech and e-commerce customers for reliable last-mile coverage in the rapidly expanding metro area.

At the same time, Phoenix-based startup Speedora has entered the market with an asset-owned, white-glove delivery model for big and bulky freight, targeting retailers frustrated with damage claims and broker-heavy networks.

The company said Arizona’s growth and proximity to Southern California make it an ideal launchpad for regional expansion, according to a news release.

Specialized logistics firms are also scaling up alongside Phoenix’s industrial real estate boom. RK Logistics Group recently opened an 80,000-square-foot, temperature-controlled warehouse in Tempe, doubling its Phoenix-area footprint to nearly 158,000 square feet to support semiconductor, electric vehicle and renewable energy customers.

Company executives pointed to proximity to Sky Harbor International Airport, interstate highways and rail intermodal facilities as key advantages, reinforcing metro Phoenix’s growing role as a hub for high-value, time-sensitive freight.

Rail investment strengthens Arizona’s freight backbone

Infrastructure investment is reinforcing Arizona’s appeal as a logistics destination. Union Pacific recently completed a major expansion of its Casa Grande Yard west of Tucson, doubling capacity and adding new tracks, industrial leads and signal upgrades along the railroad’s Sunset Route.

The yard serves local industries and supports manifest freight moving across the Southwest.

Rail capacity upgrades are critical to handling growing inbound materials and outbound finished goods tied to manufacturing growth across the state, particularly as shippers seek alternatives to congested coastal gateways.",https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/29/Arizona_freight_market.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 14:00:12.672577

Altman flagged an opening for the company's Head of Preparedness on Saturday in a post on X. Describing the role, which carries a $555,000 base salary plus equity, as one focused on securing OpenAI's systems and understanding how they could be abused, Altman also noted that AI models are beginning to present ""some real challenges"" as they rapidly improve and gain new capabilities.

""The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025,"" Altman said, without elaborating on specific cases or products.

AI has been flagged as an increasingly common trigger of psychological troubles in both juveniles and adults, with chatbots reportedly linked to multiple deaths in the past year. OpenAI, one of the most popular chatbot makers in the market, rolled back a GPT-4o update in April 2025 after acknowledging it had become overly sycophantic and could reinforce harmful or destabilizing user behavior.

Despite that, OpenAI released ChatGPT-5.1 last month, which included a number of emotional dependence-nurturing features, like the inclusion of emotionally-suggestive language, ""warmer, more intelligent"" responses, and the like. Sure, it might be less sycophantic, but it'll speak to you with more intimacy than ever before, making it feel more like a human companion instead of the impersonal, logical ship computer from Star Trek that spits facts with little regard for feeling.

It's no wonder the company needs someone to steer the ship with regard to model safety.

""We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities,"" Altman said, ""but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused.""

According to the job posting, the Head of Preparedness will be responsible for leading technical strategy and execution of OpenAI's preparedness framework [PDF], which the company describes as its approach ""to tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.""

It's not a new role, mind you, but it's one that's seen more turnover than the Defense Against Dark Arts faculty position at Hogwarts.

Aleksander Madry, director of MIT's Center for Deployable Machine Learning and faculty leader at the Institute's AI Policy Forum, occupied the Preparedness role until July 2024, when OpenAI reassigned him to a reasoning-focused research role.

This, mind you, came in the wake of a number of high-profile safety leadership exits at the company and a partial reset of OpenAI's safety team structure.

OpenAI reorg at risk as Attorneys General push AI safety

In Madry's place, OpenAI appointed Joaquin Quinonero Candela and Lilian Weng to lead the preparedness team. Both occupied other roles at OpenAI prior to heading up preparedness, but neither lasted long in the position. Weng left OpenAI in November 2024, while Candela left his role as head of preparedness in April for a three-month coding internship at OpenAI. While still an OpenAI employee, he's out of the technical space entirely and is now serving as head of recruiting.

""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,"" Altman said of the open position.

Understandably so - OpenAI and model safety have long had a contentious relationship, as numerous ex-employees have attested. One executive who left the company in October called the Altman outfit out for not being as focused on safety and the long-term effects of its AGI push as it should be, suggesting that the company was pushing ahead in its goal to dominate the industry at the expense of the rest of society.

Will $555,000 be enough to keep a new Preparedness chief in the role? Skepticism may be warranted.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the businessman has proposed three candidates for the position.

Wilson has proposed Marc Maurer, former CEO of On; Laura Gentile, former marketing director of the U.S. television channel group Espn, and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision. The businessman is Lululemon’s second largest shareholder, with a stake of close to 9%.

Lululemon announced in December the departure of its CEO, Calvin McDonald, after seven years at the company, under pressure to turn the business around. Wilson, in fact, was one of the voices that pointed most strongly to the need for a profound change. The founder believes that shareholders will not trust any CEO proposed by the current board, so he has initiated the dispute for control of the board.

On the other hand, the Elliott Investment Management fund has accumulated a stake of more than one billion dollars in Lululemon and has announced its bet on Jane Nielsen, former Ralph Lauren executive, as the next CEO.

Wilson accumulates a 9% stake in Lululemon

Wilson stepped down as CEO of Lululemon in 2005, with the sale of 48% of the company to private equity firm Advent International. The company went public in 2007, with a valuation in excess of $1.2 billion.

The founder held the chairmanship until 2013, when a scandal over a television interview caused him to resign. He left the board for good in 2015 and, since then, up to four CEOs have tried to bring stability to the company.

Wilson later invested in Amer Sports, the Finnish sportswear parent company of outdoor brands such as Arc’teryx, Wilson, Salomon and Atomic; as well as in China’s Anta, one of the world’s largest sports industry groups, which is reportedly considering buying Puma.

The latest results recently published point to a two-speed fiscal year for Lululemon. The company posted a turnover of $2,565.9 million in the third quarter of the year, up 7% from the same period last year. However, its net profit fell by 12.8%, from $351.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $306.8 million in the same period of the current fiscal year.",https://www.modaes.com/global/thumb/eyJ0IjoiZCIsInciOjEyMDAsImgiOjY3NSwibSI6MSwidiI6IjEuMC4wNyJ9/files/2025/redaccion-empresas/lululemon/chip-wilson-lululemon-1200.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 14:14:01.124846

Market Update

In response to the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been gradually trending down from its post-pandemic peak, trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target. Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump’s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025.

The direction of packaging trends has morphed over the past decades, especially as society has wrestled with finding a balance between food preservation and sustainability.
“I’ve heard packaging described as a superhero — that we’re just asking it to do so many things,” said Allison Reser, director of sustainability and innovation at the Pet Sustainability Coalition.
“In the regenerative robust gasification process, we can handle all of these materials,” Welt said.
“It’s not up to a meat and poultry manufacturer to not provide packaging because someone might litter with it.","One thing packaging professionals can agree upon is we’re not where we need to be. Despite decades of a push toward more sustainable packaging, the consumer goods industry has yet to find a truly circular solution.

So often in packaging innovation, durability competes with sustainability. At a time when consumer confidence in food safety is on the decline, retaining strong barriers in meat and poultry packaging remains critical. Yet, sacrificing environmentally friendly materials and processes is not an option either.

The direction of packaging trends has morphed over the past decades, especially as society has wrestled with finding a balance between food preservation and sustainability.

“There was a shift as I started my career to removing the butcher from the supermarket,” said Bruce Welt, PhD, professor of packaging engineering at the University of Florida. “There was that period initially where there was a guy in a bloody smock with knives that was cutting up meat. He or she would wrap it in a Styrofoam-type tray and slap a label on it. That was unbranded and store packaged.

“Then with the advent of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and to some extent some use of carbon monoxide … a variety of packages came out.”

Innovations like the vacuum skin pack, master packs and semi-rigid trays were introduced.

“The vacuum skin packs brought multi-layer barrier film with fantastic graphics,” Welt said. “The MAP trays brought a sense of cleanliness. They weren’t leaking. And also a variety of films that either were highly permeable or not permeable, and then the whole variety of foodservice packaging — chubs and everything else — a great variety of materials that achieved the purpose and served humanity in a very efficient way. These are very low-cost, high-performing applications that now people are not happy with for some reason.”

The dissatisfaction Welt referred to is often due to the difficulty of recycling materials used in these multi-layer materials.

“I’ve heard packaging described as a superhero — that we’re just asking it to do so many things,” said Allison Reser, director of sustainability and innovation at the Pet Sustainability Coalition.

Reser noted that multi-material films feature several layers to serve a distinct purpose, whether that’s strength, moisture, oxygen, etc.

“There’s a lot of thought that’s been put into that design, but that design inherently is very difficult to recycle or do something with after it’s done because, to recycle something, you technically need to peel apart all those different layers and then turn those back into resins to then turn back into something else,” she explained.

What’s in the bag actually matters a lot more than the bag itself, according to Reser, as packaging typically only makes up 10% to 30% of a product’s overall environmental impact.

“But at the same time, I think we can do better,” Reser said. “We can streamline the functions of the package to design in true circularity.”

A proposed solution

For Reser, improvement looks like considering both the short-term and the long-term.

On the short-term, Reser encourages companies to switch to eco-friendly technology like mono-material packaging that is already available at scale.

“But then, even mono-material plastic or paper, those aren’t regenerative solutions,” Reser said. “They are less bad than other options. But long term I would love to see more innovation and focus on truly circular solutions.”

Welt has been working on developing exactly that — a circular solution for the packaging waste problem.

His team of researchers at the University of Florida have created what’s known as Regenerative Robust Gasification (RRG), an advanced recycling system that is able to take in any form of packaging material, and without the need to sort or separate, it can convert those substances into synthesis gas. From synthesis gas, many practical applications can be formed, but Welt advocates for the usage of methanol in particular.

“It’s a very versatile compound, synthesis gas; however, it’s not easy to transport,” Welt said. “In order to make this widely available to manufacturing, we have to convert it into something that can be transported. And the simplest thing to do is methanol.”

Welt noted that a lot of packaging today is not recyclable in our existing system — anything with mixed materials, including labels.

“In the regenerative robust gasification process, we can handle all of these materials,” Welt said. “With the right infrastructure for handling our waste, we don’t have to think as much about the materials. We can think more about the packaging application.”

Reser agrees that a new chemical recycling system could have a positive impact on redirecting material waste.

“My take on any of these advanced recycling systems is that it seems like a promising short-term solution to deal with all of this material that we already have out in the world,” she said.

However, Reser expressed caution in saying the technology could solve all the industry’s problems, given other factors that need to be taken into consideration.

“Is it using a lot more energy? Is it using a lot more water? Are there trade-offs that we need to consider before we go all into that kind of technology?” she asked.

Government involvement

As researchers and innovators continue to look for ways to improve the current recycling system, legislation has played more of a role in recent years in an attempt to address the issue.

To date, seven states — Maine, Oregon, Colorado, California, Minnesota, Maryland and Washington — have introduced Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation. The laws require food manufacturers to pay fees to manage the recycling of their products rather than holding municipalities and taxpayers financially and operationally responsible.

“That incentivizing companies to switch to better packaging is one positive outcome of these laws,” Reser said. “The other intent is that, with those fees, the municipalities are able to improve their recycling infrastructure.”

While Reser sees the implementation of EPRs as a step in the right direction toward creating a more sustainable future, Welt finds concerns with the new laws.

“I think ultimately the responsibility is on the municipality; it’s not on the producer,” he said.

“It’s the responsibility of the municipality through law enforcement to punish litterers,” Welt elaborated. “It’s not up to a meat and poultry manufacturer to not provide packaging because someone might litter with it. That’s just insane.”

Welt explained his viewpoint that the EPR laws are a violation of the Commerce Clause.

“When the Articles of Confederation were done in the United States, and we were a bunch of different states with their independent power before the Constitution, that’s what they were doing to each other — the states were taxing each other,” he said. “When we had the Constitution, the founders saw that this was a significant problem impeding interstate commerce, so they specifically put into the Constitution that states wouldn’t tariff other states, and that’s effectively what EPR is.”

Welt noted that EPR is currently being challenged in Oregon.

“Hopefully EPR will be a flash in the pan, and we will figure out a way to get away from that,” he said. “But I would certainly say that the industry should stop just bending over and taking this stuff and really put up a fight and not acquiesce to EPR.”",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2021/6/Sustainable-packaging_Lead1.png?height=635&t=1707863805&width=1200,N,,2025-12-29 13:01:57.128390

Instead, Samsung plans to bring Google Photos to its televisions.

The addition of Google Photos will allow users to view images from their Google account, with Samsung detailing that deep integration is planned. That will see Google Photos accessed as part of Daily+ and Daily Board for a seamless experience, while there are plans to have a number of ways to curate the images seen.

That will include Memories, Create with AI and Personalised Results, with Memories being an exclusive feature for Samsung TVs for the first 6 months. This exclusivity is familiar territory for Samsung and an key indicator that these features will be available on other platforms too – most likely Google TV which is found on Sony, Philips and other TVs.

Memories will allow you to curate stories based on people or locations to be shown on your Samsung TV. That sounds like a great way to show off the grandkids at a family gathering, for example.

Create with AI uses templates built on Nano Banana to transform photos into something more interesting, while Personalised Results will show photos related to topics, like a place or activity.

That means it's not just going to be a random selection of Google Photos that get displayed, but something that you have more control over.

An indication of future TV features?

The move suggests that Google is looking for ways to unlock some of its content and make it available elsewhere. Photos aren't new on TVs: most platforms already offer some way to show images, whether through access to a particular online gallery or via casting in some form.

But these always seem a little random where you never know what's going to be shown. Moving toward a personally curated experience will provide the satisfaction that users want, knowing that it's not just going to be a collection of screenshots, photos of the floor and all the rest of the stuff that fills your Google Photos library.

Instead, I'm expecting to be able to call up pictures of the cat to share with everyone all the time. Showing holiday snaps will be easy, while it looks like Samsung will also bubble up memories similar to Google Photos based around time.

Samsung says that these features will appear through 2026, with Memories the first to arrive in early 2026, followed by the other two options ""later in 2026"".",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGzks4B8xeoSNcCpHdsweW-789-80.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 12:01:17.364640

Today, Intel has officially sold 214.7 million shares to Nvidia at $23.28 per share, reports Reuters. At the time of the original announcement, that number was 6% above market price, but it's now 36% below what Intel is currently trading at.

The purchase was cleared by the FTC in early December, so it was only a matter of time before we received this news. Intel is worth $172.67 billion at the time of writing, a drastic recovery from 2024 and much of 2025, where it had been valued as low as $82.71 billion.

Over the years, Intel's massive capex spending had put a strain on its financials, which was paired with growing national security concerns over CEO Lip-Bu Tan's former ties to China. Just a few months ago, this commotion had transpired into a dire situation where President Trump was seeking to oust CEO Lip-Bu Tan, but the two eventually reconciled, leading to Washington purchasing an $8.9 billion stake in Intel.

There's no release window for the upcoming RTX SoCs, and it'll take some time before any fruit is borne from the new partnership.

Live Update At 10:03:00 EST: On Monday, December 29, 2025 NVIDIA Corporation stock [NASDAQ: NVDA] is trending down by -1.99%! Discover the key drivers behind this movement as well as our expert analysis in the detailed breakdown below.

Earnings Report and Financial Overview

One of the key strategies for traders is to remain objective and not let emotions drive trading decisions. As Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade, says, “I focus on what a stock is doing, not what I want it to do. Let the stock prove itself before you make a move.” This approach emphasizes the importance of analyzing actual market performance instead of being swayed by personal desires or expectations. By adhering to this mindset, traders can make more informed and strategic decisions, rather than relying on assumptions or wishful thinking.

Nvidia recently released its earnings report reflecting a landscape filled with strong profits alongside growing challenges. The company reported a massive revenue jump, showcasing $130.5B, aligning with unstoppable demand in GPU markets. With an enterprise valuation reaching close to $4.8T, Nvidia’s financial health seems robust from a snapshot view. However, peeling back the layers reveals complexities.

For starters, Nvidia’s remarkable 62.2% EBIT margin indicates operational efficiency. Yet the high P/E ratio standing at 47.28 raises eyebrows among cautious investors. From an income statement perspective, their EBITDA reported at $38.72B signifies substantial earnings before accounting adjustments.

In the broader context, Nvidia’s adaptive strategies reflect in its decision to forego Intel’s process in its chip production lines. This move didn’t fly well with investors, judging by the negative ripples in stock valuations. Moreover, strategic moves like SoftBank’s unloading of Nvidia shares indeed inject a layer of uncertainty, although Nvidia basks in investor goodwill built from years of innovation.

The shadows of Google’s aggressive push into AI computing loom, potentially slicing into Nvidia’s market share in the coming quarters. And Nvidia’s restructuring within the cloud division underscores a pivot from previously competitive stances to perhaps a collaborative or niche-focused approach. This news of high-ranking executives stepping aside introduces subtle doubts about the future trajectory of Nvidia’s cloud dominance.

Impact of Recent News on Stock

SoftBank Divestment: A Bold Move?

SoftBank is no stranger to bold moves, and its latest decision to partially divest from Nvidia is just that. Aimed at bolstering its commitment to OpenAI, this maneuver saw SoftBank selling hefty stakes. The shift, while financially driven for SoftBank, casts a slight cloud over Nvidia, indicating a multifaceted relationship entwined with market strategizing and fulfilling fiscal promises.

For Nvidia, it beckons investors to re-evaluate strategic ties and dependencies. Indeed, every shift prompts a corresponding adjustment in share price, especially when magnitude and timing mix into the equation.

Competitive Edge at Stake: Google’s Innovation

Google, with its fingers in the pie of AI computing, poses more than a mild threat to Nvidia’s stronghold. Google’s new initiative isn’t just a sideline attraction; it’s an audacious leap into territories Nvidia inhabits confidently. While Nvidia’s core audience expects innovation, the duel for dominance in AI computing could alter financial landscapes moving forward.

Should Google succeed in capturing even a fraction of Nvidia’s target audience, the implications on profits and market stance would be tangible. Nvidia’s investors are right to pay close attention—these developments could very well dictate stock performance over lengthy periods.

Leadership Changes: Strategic Restructuring

Nvidia’s internal shake-up in the cloud sector may seem minor, but in strategic landscapes, they can signify deeper objectives. By restructuring the cloud division and shifting talented executives, Nvidia hints at realigning operational trajectories. These shifts are likely intended to hedge against heavily resourced, competitor-dominated fields like those controlled by Amazon Web Services.

Such restructuring rarely leaves stock prices untouched. Investors mull over these decisions, contemplating long-term benefits against short-term disruptions. While beneficial restructuring is geared at maintaining innovative agility, its impartial results remain subject to speculation.

Future Directions and Considerations

In the wake of these pivotal shifts, Nvidia is embroiled in transformations likely to excite and challenge stakeholders alike. Its operational excellence discussed might sway market sentiments to positive or negative poles, depending significantly on upcoming executions of strategic pivots, especially in the cloud division.

Balancing profitability amidst fierce competition, both internal and strategic, will spotlight Nvidia’s nimble adaptability. In future quarters, Nvidia’s enduring superior performance will either shine a light on successful strategy or prompt reconsideration in the eyes of cautious market participants. As Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade says, “I never chase price. The best opportunities allow me to enter on my terms, not when I’m feeling pressured.” This philosophy might resonate with market traders observing Nvidia’s next moves, pushing them to assess entry points based on strategic successes rather than market hype.

Strategically, Nvidia needs to ensure its future-proofing measures, reinforcing areas like AI computing while bolstering its unique values against up-and-coming disruptors like Google’s. Dynamic industry movements necessitate equally adept responses, simultaneously assuring stakeholders while leveraging innovation to remain at industry pinnacles.

Navigating these competitive waters, Nvidia remains a stalwart, inspiring intrigue and analytical scrutiny worldwide. As the narrative develops, watch closely—Nvidia’s next moves are not just speculative intrigue, but essential business evolution recognized across technological and financial realms.

What I Liked From Hanover, Chris Black’s New Basics Brand","Photo: Michael Zhao

Shopping at Hanover, longtime Strategist columnist Chris Black’s new clothing line, is like stumbling across a stash of perfectly faded vintage Ralph Lauren with none of the off-putting odors and stains associated with thrifted men’s sportswear. While not quite as cheap as vintage, the prices are surprisingly low for new clothes that are entirely produced in Los Angeles. The most expensive offering is a $155 pair of jeans made of deadstock North Carolinian denim — more than $100 cheaper than a comparable pair from Buck Mason.

It sounds too good to be true, but each piece I tried felt sturdily made from high-quality materials. I am a slender six-foot-two, which makes me a medium in most brands. But Hanover’s team sent large tops across the board, and that was definitely the right call. The first run is selling out quickly, so I wasn’t able to try everything, but I’ve compiled photos and notes for all the pieces I managed to test, starting with my favorites and ending with the rest.

This 100 percent cotton pique polo shirt made me nostalgic for the Ralph Lauren shirts I’d find in my dad’s closet as a kid: softened from decades of washing and drying with the reassuring heft of a garment that’s made to a higher standard than it needs to be. True to its description, it looks good tucked or untucked. And I especially appreciated how the collar still rests flatly against my upper chest when one or both buttons are unfastened, as I’m wont to wear it. At just under $100, it’s priced in line with what Todd Snyder charges for a similar unfaded style that’s produced in Portugal.

Between its natural-looking fade, smallish hood, and metal grommets for a missing drawstring, this sweatshirt feels like something that could have been salvaged from a schoolyard lost and found in a good way. (Also available as a crewneck.) It’s much softer than the similarly priced and factory-faded Trash Hoodie from Everybody.World, and I’ve been enjoying throwing it over my PJs first thing in the morning when I roll out of bed to make my coffee. Although it’s said to be made from a 20-ounce fabric, it’s about 200 grams lighter than the 13-ounce Trash Hoodie, so I’d guess it’s closer to a 12-ounce.

Black is known to prefer vintage tees to new ones, so it’s no surprise that his idealized version of a new T-shirt would come prewashed to a perfectly worn-in fade and texture. I wear a 38R jacket and found the large fit perfectly. The shoulder seams fell right at the outer edge of my shoulders and the hem right above my crotch — short enough to look neat untucked yet long enough to tuck if a look calls for it. Besides this charcoal fade, it comes in red, green, and blue. Blink and you’ll miss the tonal-matched embroidered H logo on the bottom left.

I have no complaints about this nice black T-shirt, but for the same price, I’d go with the Sunwashed version every time because the more neutral-tone fade is easier to layer. I appreciate that it comes in white (and also blue and charcoal), but if I wanted a plain white T-shirt at this price, I would likely get the Lady White Co LW101T instead.

Hanover Tote

It’s not that this isn’t a great tote; I just have to wonder whether everyone who snatched it up realized how big it was when they ordered it. At 15-by-18-by-5 inches, it’s about the same size as a large L.L.Bean Boat and Tote and can hold about a week’s worth of laundry — way too big for any kind of daily use. (It offers a mini-tote too, but no measurements are provided.) The canvas material is much less stiff than L.L.Bean’s, which makes it a bit more comfortable to carry. It also features a prominent American flag patch, which aligns with Hanover’s made-in-USA ethos but may give pause to some.

We are in the midst of a full-on denim-head revival, rivaling that of the Obama presidency, which is why I was excited to try these jeans made from deadstock Cone Mills denim, which ceased production in 2017. I got the lightwash fade in a size 30 and was impressed by their construction and material quality. The fade looks natural and credibly vintage — the subtly abraded hems and edges really sell it, and the suede brand patch with the belt pass-through has a luxuriously soft texture that should develop a nice patina over time. But the cut through the thighs was so slim that I could feel it constricting my circulation every time I sat down. Based on how these pants fit the models in the product photos, sizing up to a 32 would have likely helped achieve the more tapered fit I look for in a pair of jeans (see the made-in-USA vintage Levi’s 550s for reference), but that would definitely require a belt, since the 30 fit me well in the waist.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

The campaign represents a sophisticated, multi-faceted initial access broker operation targeting Adobe ColdFusion servers alongside 46 additional technology stacks across nearly 800 vulnerabilities.
The primary attack wave focused on 10+ Adobe ColdFusion CVEs, with researchers identifying just under 6,000 direct requests against ColdFusion infrastructure.
The threat actors operated from AS152194 (CTG Server Limited), a Hong Kong-registered hosting provider with documented associations to phishing infrastructure and spam operations.
Security researchers have identified the network as hosting FUNNULL CDN infrastructure targeting luxury brands.","Security researchers have uncovered a massive coordinated exploitation campaign where threat actors launched over 2.5 million malicious requests against vulnerable systems during the Christmas 2025 holiday period.

The campaign represents a sophisticated, multi-faceted initial access broker operation targeting Adobe ColdFusion servers alongside 46 additional technology stacks across nearly 800 vulnerabilities.

The primary attack wave focused on 10+ Adobe ColdFusion CVEs, with researchers identifying just under 6,000 direct requests against ColdFusion infrastructure.

However, deeper analysis revealed the true scope: two primary IP addresses operating from Japan-based hosting provider CTG Server Limited generated over 2.5 million requests across 767 distinct CVEs, leveraging approximately 10,000 unique callback domains for attack verification.

The threat actors deliberately timed the campaign for maximum impact, concentrating 68 percent of attack traffic on Christmas Day when security teams typically operate at reduced capacity.

This deliberate timing suggests a sophisticated threat actor with operational knowledge of enterprise security monitoring cycles.

The attackers used ProjectDiscovery Interactsh out-of-band callback infrastructure to verify successful exploitation attempts in real-time, enabling rapid identification of vulnerable systems suitable for follow-up compromise.

The campaign exploited critical vulnerabilities including CVE-2023-26359, a deserialization RCE affecting ColdFusion, which received 833 exploitation attempts.

CVE-2023-38205, an access control bypass, was targeted 654 times, while CVE-2023-44353 triggered 611 requests.

The primary attack vector employed JNDI/LDAP injection through WDDX deserialization, leveraging the JdbcRowSetImpl gadget chain to trigger remote code execution.

Beyond ColdFusion, the campaign demonstrates methodical reconnaissance across enterprise infrastructure.

Researchers at Greynoise identified 4,118 unique HTTP fingerprints and targeting of Java application servers, web frameworks, CMS platforms, Atlassian products, network devices, and surveillance systems.

Confluence OGNL vulnerability CVE-2022-26134 alone received 12,481 requests, while the legacy Shellshock vulnerability CVE-2014-6271 triggered 8,527 attempts.

The threat actors operated from AS152194 (CTG Server Limited), a Hong Kong-registered hosting provider with documented associations to phishing infrastructure and spam operations.

Security researchers have identified the network as hosting FUNNULL CDN infrastructure targeting luxury brands. This combination of abuse history and rapid IP space acquisition suggests limited abuse enforcement mechanisms.

Organizations operating Adobe ColdFusion servers should immediately apply security patches for CVE-2023-26359, CVE-2023-38205, and related vulnerabilities.

Security teams should implement network-based detection for JNDI injection payloads, OAST callback domains, and the identified threat actor IP addresses and JA4+ network fingerprints.

Continuous vulnerability scanning and monitoring of exploitation attempt patterns remain critical defensive priorities.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzGKViVlGuFSaAwvsLqTMQ0Hk66M87-Ct26wadZIX1kSmXUA4wqXEZQlmr4ulvD_8yuRocffm__8TqJDKta00uvZmOkA3vNnhwJsvKuPuz9P0TjIsQm2Fw7BDy_mepKZ6wiwzRVyfv-rMEzR-XZBYQ5kfu9t8Fy1qaIpjEBr6odbA-oQa-EP9h4TRkPjwd/s1600/Hackers%20Launch%202.5%20Million+%20Malicious%20Requests%20Targeting%20Adobe%20ColdFusion%20Servers%20%281%29.webp,N,,2025-12-29 11:13:54.203857

Despite initial fears of the sky falling, April’s bout of volatility following the announcements did not last long, and those who bought the dip were rewarded.

Equity markets seem comfortable with the view that the hit to growth, global trade flows and corporate margins will be modest at best, although it remains to be seen whether companies start to pass on any latent price increases in the coming year.

This was not the only story of a fascinating year, however.

Bonds welcomed cooler inflation and interest rate cuts, and looked forward to more of the same in 2026, while dollar weakness boosted commodities, as well as emerging equities.

However, the strength in gold and silver – and year-end weakness in cryptocurrencies – struck a discordant note in some ways. Both trends suggested that someone, somewhere was expecting trouble in 2026.

It is therefore worth thinking about what happened in 2025 and why, and whether five trends in particular can continue in the coming year and beyond.

1. Tariff and trade worries melted away

Global equity markets motored higher as Trump first delayed the imposition of tariffs until August, then struck individual deals with certain countries. It wasn’t long until he then backed away further in the autumn with a series of agreements with Latin American trade partners, as American voters grumbled about rising food prices.

Still, the Yale Budget Lab estimated that the effective tariff rate by November was 16.8pc, the highest since 1935. US government revenues from the levies jumped sharply enough for Trump to ponder publicly whether they could fund tax cuts for many Americans, although the Supreme Court continues to assess the legality of the reciprocal tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

If that court case fails to knock down the IEEPA tariffs, it remains unclear what the levies may mean for trade, corporate profits and prices in 2026. Any unexpected slowdown in growth, margin pressure or stickiness in inflation could therefore be a nasty surprise.

4. Oil slid lower

Even war in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, sanctions against large oil‑producing nations and the absence of any economic shocks could not help the oil price catch a bid. Brent crude peaked just north of $80 (£60) in January and then ground lower for the rest of the year.

This helped to put a lid on inflation, but the crude price slide persuaded investors to shun oil companies’ shares, in the view that hydrocarbon assets could be left stranded, with a much-reduced value compared to current expectations.

The stock market capitalisation of the S&P Global 1200 Energy sector is just 3.3pc of that of the overall S&P Global 1200 index, well below the long-term average of 7.7pc, let alone 2007’s peak of 13.8pc.

If Brent crude starts to rise again, for whatever reason, that could yet challenge this rejection of oil firms’ shares, and the narrative that inflation will remain modest.

5. Gold and silver shone

Gold and silver are both into their third bull markets since Richard Nixon withdrew the US from the gold standard and smashed up the Bretton Woods monetary system in the summer of 1971.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/money/2025/12/23/TELEMMGLPICT000453997965_17664987410050_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqUAa5Q-50pS4OZaLPIQPvsRWmn_S0fKyxy_Opkm8GcNU.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-12-29 10:14:51.433638

In his new role, Minoura will provide senior-level direction for Barclays’ investment banking activities in Japan.

His remit includes advising on major transactions, supporting cross-border deals, expanding the client base and strengthening relationships with existing clients.

Minoura has acted as a senior advisor to Barclays’ investment banking business in Japan since July 2024, where he has been involved in strategic planning and client engagement.

He brings more than four decades of experience in financial services to the role.

Prior to joining Barclays, Minoura held senior advisory and chair positions at Bank of America Securities Japan, where his responsibilities centred on client coverage and business development.

Earlier in his career, he spent 37 years at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, serving in several senior roles in Japan and overseas, including vice chairman and deputy president.

Outbound cross-border mergers and acquisitions by Japanese companies have been rising, supported by low interest rates, corporate governance reforms and a weaker yen, according to the bank.

Barclays Securities Japan Investment Banking head Yuzo Otsuka said: “Minoura’s appointment underscores our commitment to capturing growth opportunities in Japan. He has been an outstanding advisor and a terrific inspiration to our team. And now in his new capacity as Chairman, we will be able to deliver even greater value to our clients.”

Separately, in November, Barclays appointed Jean-François Mastrangelo as head of markets for Asia Pacific.

Based in Hong Kong, Mastrangelo is responsible for overseeing the bank’s global markets business across the region, with a focus on platform development, product expansion and client engagement.

Mastrangelo reports functionally to Adeel Khan, head of global markets, and regionally to Jaideep Khanna, CEO Asia Pacific.

He joined Barclays after nearly 20 years in global markets, most recently as head of equities for Asia Pacific at Société Générale, where he held senior roles in Paris and Hong Kong across structuring, trading and platform development.

About Johnson & Johnson At Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.","NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ (December 29, 2025) – Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the “Company”) today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Halda Therapeutics OpCo, Inc. (“Halda”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a proprietary Regulated Induced Proximity TArgeting Chimera (RIPTAC™) platform to develop oral, targeted therapies for multiple types of solid tumors, including prostate cancer, for $3.05 billion in cash.

“This strategic milestone underscores our commitment to redefining cancer treatment with breakthrough science and transformative medicines,” said Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson. “We are excited to formally welcome the talented Halda team to Johnson & Johnson and look forward to working together to achieve our shared goal of eliminating cancer.”

With this acquisition, Johnson & Johnson adds HLD-0915, a clinical-stage therapy for prostate cancer, building on the Company’s nearly two decades of innovation in this disease area. HLD-0915 is a once-daily oral therapy that uses a novel RIPTAC™ platform with a precision cancer cell-killing approach that can overcome mechanisms of resistance to treatment. Additionally, the Company adds several earlier candidates for breast, lung and multiple other tumor types, based on RIPTAC™ technology, to its leading oncology portfolio. The novel technology may also enable the creation of transformative targeted therapies beyond oncology.

“Johnson & Johnson continuously seeks new ways to meet patient needs and deliver innovative therapies,” said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine, R&D, Johnson & Johnson. “Now that we have finalized this acquisition, we will focus on advancing the potential of this promising pipeline of novel product candidates and harnessing the powerful RIPTAC™ platform to discover more molecules in oncology and beyond.”

The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. With the transaction now closing in 2025, Johnson & Johnson expects dilution in Q4 2025 and 2026 earnings. The total dilution to Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of approximately $0.20 is expected to split equally between 2025 and 2026 based on the latest estimates for the non-recurring charge related to Halda employee equity awards, financing and integration costs. Johnson & Johnson will provide commentary on full year 2026 guidance during the fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, January 21, 2026.

Summary

Global equities rose sharply on the back of strong corporate earnings, continued strength in spending on AI, and a dovish shift in U.S. monetary policy.

For the third quarter, the fund had a positive return but underperformed the benchmark index.

The fund's biggest individual relative detractor was Constellation Software, Inc., a Canada-based software company.

Within this positioning, we continue to lean into what we believe are high-quality, durable growth names.

As of September 30, the fund's largest sector overweight was in financials and communication services, while the fund was most underweight in information technology and industrials.

Quick Insights

GOIGX underperformed primarily due to unfavorable security selection in consumer discretionary, IT, and materials, partially offset by communication services and financials.

The fund is overweight financials and communication services, underweight IT and industrials, with regional overweights in the UK and Japan, and underweights in developed Asia-Pacific (ex-Japan) and emerging markets.

GOIGX maintains an equal-weight exposure to quality, capital return, growth, and valuation upside, leaning into high-quality, durable growth names as policy-driven uncertainty eases.

The RLUSD stablecoin has been approved for use across Africa to provide faster, cheaper, and easier access to the US Dollar. Furthermore, the token allows businesses and individuals to hold digital dollars safely. Once assets are tokenized through RLUSD, African users gain access to US market assets. Hence, this development aims to simplify payments, reduce costs, and support cross-border trade across the continent.

RLUSD Overview and Regulatory Framework

RLUSD is pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar and backed by cash and US Treasuries. The Bank of New York Mellon acts as the custodian for the reserves. The stablecoin is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, ensuring compliance and transparency. Monthly third-party audits confirm that all tokens are fully backed. RLUSD operates on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, increasing access to liquidity and financial applications.

The stablecoin achieved over $700 million in market capitalization within months of launch. Its regulatory framework makes it suitable for businesses and financial institutions in Africa. Additionally, Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple, said RLUSD is now used in payments, tokenization, and trading collateral. This structure provides predictability for cross-border operations.

Addressing Payment Challenges and Currency Stability

Cross-border payments in Africa often have high fees exceeding 8%, causing delays for families and businesses. RLUSD transactions settle within seconds, offering a faster alternative to traditional banking systems. The token also reduces the cost of sending remittances, which is essential for households relying on international transfers.

Currency instability in countries like Nigeria makes holding digital dollars appealing. Local currencies can fluctuate, eroding purchasing power. RLUSD provides a stable store of value, allowing businesses and individuals to plan expenses more efficiently. Thus, this stability supports SMEs in maintaining consistent salaries and supplier payments.

Integration with African Financial Platforms

Platforms such as Chipper Cash, Yellow Card, and VALR have integrated RLUSD into their systems. This enables businesses and individuals to access digital dollars directly through existing platforms. Consequently, the adoption facilitates treasury management, cross-border payments, and digital trading.

Chris Maurice, CEO of Yellow Card, noted that customers require stable digital assets for secure cross-border payments and financial operations. Essentially, RLUSD’s compliance with NYDFS standards ensures trust and transparency. These integrations also expand access to tokenized US market assets through RLUSD.

Use Cases Across Businesses and Commerce

RLUSD is being used for SME treasury management to protect against currency volatility. Businesses can hold reserves in digital dollars and manage budgets effectively. Nonetheless, merchant payments and e-commerce platforms also use RLUSD for international transactions.

The stablecoin is applied in tokenized asset trading and insurance programs. For example, Mercy Corps Ventures used RLUSD to automate climate insurance payouts in Kenya. Subsequently, fast, low-cost transactions make RLUSD practical for both enterprises and individuals. These features make it easier to conduct trade and manage financial operations across Africa.",https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ripple_Eyes_19_Trillion_Tokenization_Boom_as_Institutional_Adoption-2-600x411-1.png,N,,2025-12-29 05:59:32.375171

For decades, motorsport in India lived on the fringes of mainstream culture. It was admired for its speed and spectacle, but rarely understood, marketed, or positioned as part of everyday aspiration. In 2025, that began to change. Not because motorsport suddenly became louder, but because it became more visible, more human, and more relatable.

What shifted this year was not just participation, but perception. Motorsport started to move from being a technically dense, insider-driven space to one that intersected with lifestyle, youth culture, and modern storytelling. And that shift offers important lessons for marketers and brand builders far beyond racing.

One of the biggest changes in 2025 was how motorsport narratives were told. Instead of focusing only on machines and lap times, the spotlight expanded to include people, preparation, pressure, and purpose. Engineers, data analysts, pit crews, and young aspirants became part of the story. This made motorsport easier to understand and emotionally invest in, even for audiences who may never attend a race.

From a marketing perspective, this reflects a broader trend we’ve seen across categories: credibility now comes from access, not exaggeration. Audiences are far more interested in how something works, who it impacts, and what it takes to succeed, rather than being sold perfection. Motorsport, by nature, is imperfect, intense, and unpredictable and leaning into that reality has made it more engaging.

Digital platforms played a critical role in this evolution. Short-form video, behind-the-scenes content, creator-led storytelling, and community-driven conversations helped motorsport reach audiences it had previously missed. Importantly, this wasn’t about mass reach alone. It was about relevance. Motorsport content that performed well in 2025 didn’t try to be everything to everyone; it spoke clearly to those who cared about performance, engineering, and ambition.

Another important shift was experiential storytelling. Motorsport is not a product you can fully explain through ads or visuals alone it needs to be experienced. In 2025, we saw growing interest in on-ground exposure, immersive learning, and real-world engagement. From a brand perspective, this reinforces a simple truth: experiences build trust faster than campaigns. When people see effort, discipline, and pressure up close, they connect more deeply.

This insight extends naturally to education and skill-building ecosystems within motorsport. Over the past year, I’ve seen first-hand how young engineers and professionals respond when communication moves away from promise and toward proof. When the narrative focuses on real environments, real expectations, and real outcomes, it attracts serious intent. Initiatives like intensive bootcamps and global exposure models quietly gained traction in 2025 not because they were marketed aggressively, but because they aligned with what aspirational audiences actually value: authenticity and accountability.

For marketers, there’s a lesson here. High-performance categories don’t need louder messaging; they need clearer positioning. Motorsport’s growing visibility in 2025 came from narrowing the narrative, not broadening it. It spoke confidently about what it is and just as importantly, what it is not. That clarity helped it find its audience.

As we look toward 2026, the expectations will only rise. Audiences are becoming more discerning, and surface-level storytelling will struggle to hold attention. For motorsport and brands operating in similarly complex spaces the focus will need to shift toward depth. That means investing in content that educates without overwhelming, inspires without exaggeration, and invites participation rather than passive consumption.

We will also see stronger overlap between motorsport, mobility, and innovation narratives. As electric vehicles, data-driven performance, and advanced engineering become more central to everyday life, motorsport’s relevance will expand. This creates an opportunity for brands and institutions to position themselves not just as participants in a sport, but as contributors to a broader culture of performance and progress.

Ultimately, what 2025 showed us is that visibility is no longer about volume it’s about value. Motorsport found its moment not by chasing attention, but by earning it. If 2026 builds on that foundation with sharper storytelling, honest communication, and meaningful experiences, motorsport’s place in India’s cultural and brand landscape will only continue to grow.

And for marketers watching closely, the message is clear: when you respect your audience’s intelligence and invite them closer to the process, aspiration follows naturally.",https://erp.adgully.com/artical_image/3783142d3ba6812c29db70d28095b79d.jpeg,N,,2025-12-29 11:01:53.902430

Who will hit a $5 trillion market cap next? - Quartz,"Catherine Baab, qz.com",,,,,https://qz.com/nvidia-microsoft-apple-google-tesla-meta-market-cap,"It was a landmark year for corporate valuations, especially among the world’s most famous tech companies.

It may seem tautological, but the tech companies that have recently crossed into or flirted with a $4 trillion market cap are the most obvious candidates to hit the $5 trillion mark.","It was a landmark year for corporate valuations, especially among the world’s most famous tech companies.

Market cap milestones once considered mythical — $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $3 trillion, etc. — are now routine financial news. On one side, they’ve been driven by explosive growth in consumer tech, cloud computing, and AI; on the other, by simply massive inflows of capital from ETFs, money managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and the global investor class.

Of course, the sheer most eye-catching headline has already been written. In October 2025, Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation, propelled by its central role in powering AI workloads and tremendous demand for its chips. The achievement cements Nvidia’s role as a heavyweight of the current mega-cap era — a status that just a few years ago seemed out of reach for any hardware business.

Before we look at which company is likely to be the next in the race to the $5 trillion mark, let’s review who reached the $4 trillion threshold in 2025.

The $4 trillion club

Microsoft passed the $4 trillion threshold in the middle of the year, powered by accelerating cloud and AI services growth and strong enterprise demand for its AI-integrated software platforms. Apple also rose above $4 trillion late in the year — the third company in history to do so — on the back of device sales and services revenue. Late in the year, Google parent Alphabet briefly brushed the $4 trillion market cap mark, too.

Considered together with Nvidia, these four companies represent the frontier of size in the global stock market, occupying a tremendous chunk of market-cap-weighted indices.

What about the rest of the Magnificent Seven? Amazon, smaller than the very largest four, derives much of its $2.4 trillion valuation from Amazon Web Services and long-term bets in logistics and AI-driven commerce. But the stock lagged behind its Big Tech peers in 2025, moving sideways so that it’s set to finish the year with low single-digit gains.

Meanwhile, even sitting below the $2 trillion mark, Tesla, Meta, and the semiconductor and hardware maker Broadcom remain firmly in the upper tier of global market caps.

Who will be the next to $5 trillion?

It may seem tautological, but the tech companies that have recently crossed into or flirted with a $4 trillion market cap are the most obvious candidates to hit the $5 trillion mark.

Thus, Microsoft — with its vast cloud business, deep enterprise software penetration, and increasing AI integration — may be the most obvious of any contender. Continued multiple expansion alongside consistent earnings growth are likely to steadily push the stock higher. Ditto Apple. Its ecosystem generates enormous recurring revenue from services and hardware, and its ventures into AI-enhanced products could, at least in theory, prove to be future growth catalysts. If innovation accelerates in ways that reenergize — or simply meet? — investor expectations, hitting $5 trillion is within the realm of possibility.

It's a similar story with Alphabet’s strength in AI, plus its core business in search, YouTube, Android, and everything cloud. Few companies on earth boast such broad and defensible franchises. And as the investor story catches up, the company could break out to emerge as an even bigger winner.

Why scale begets scale

In the past, investor logic — invoking “trees don’t grow to the sky” and a loose reading of the law of large numbers — cast mega-caps as destined for slower growth. But the 2010s and 2020s turned that longstanding wisdom on its head, and a fresh reversal doesn’t look likely.

It’s simple. As companies reach multi-trillion-dollar valuations, index weight, passive ownership, and benchmark dominance don’t just reflect success — they arguably help to perpetuate it, making further gains more likely. Earnings still matter, yet they’re also amplified by the structure of contemporary capital markets.

The logic may feel circular, but new $5 trillion behemoths rarely emerge out of nowhere. The next entrant is far more likely to come from the ranks of the giants than from anywhere else.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2247717778.jpg",N,,2025-12-29 06:14:41.609577

What was once framed as a speculative or alternative asset class is now being discussed as core financial infrastructure, with direct implications for sustainable finance, capital efficiency, and long-term market resilience. Despite its continued growth, ADFW maintained a high signal-to-noise ratio, reinforcing Abu Dhabi’s role as a jurisdiction capable of scaling global finance conversations without diluting substance.

Digital assets featured prominently across both Asset Management and Fintech tracks, reflecting their transition from niche innovation to foundational market infrastructure. Institutional participants—including family offices, sovereign investors, and asset managers—no longer questioned whether digital assets belong in portfolios. Instead, discussions focused on how regulated digital infrastructure can improve transparency, liquidity, and capital allocation efficiency, all of which are central pillars of sustainable finance.

Demographic change and regulatory clarity are accelerating this transition. Younger generations are increasingly comfortable operating within digital-native financial environments, while jurisdictions such as Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) have provided the regulatory certainty required for institutional participation. At the same time, validation from major global financial institutions has reframed digital assets as a strategic necessity rather than an optional allocation. For sovereign wealth funds managing intergenerational capital, failing to engage with digital-native financial systems is increasingly viewed as a long-term fiduciary risk.

Tokenization emerged as one of the most consequential themes at ADFW, no longer treated as an experimental concept but as a practical evolution of capital markets infrastructure. Institutional focus is shifting toward tokenized equities, fixed income, and on-chain capital markets that enable continuous trading, faster settlement, and improved capital mobility. The growing adoption of stablecoins and regulated custody frameworks is reinforcing institutional confidence, allowing blockchain-based markets to operate within familiar risk, compliance, and governance structures.

While regulatory progress has been significant, institutional knowledge gaps remain the primary constraint on adoption, particularly among mid-sized banks and financial institutions. Many organizations lack internal mandates or specialized expertise to deploy digital asset strategies at scale. However, this gap is closing rapidly as competitive pressure from early movers intensifies. Market participants increasingly expect accelerated hiring, strategic partnerships, and consolidation, with traditional financial institutions acquiring digital infrastructure and capabilities rather than building them internally.

During the ADFW panel “Mapping Asset Allocation: Making Sense of Modern Portfolios,” the discussion highlighted a clear shift in how institutional investors are approaching digital assets—not as speculative outliers, but as components of modern portfolio construction. Speaking alongside Fai Hung Ma Co-Founder & Global CIO at GROW Investment Group, Stephen Shaya Managing Director at Akkad Holdings, Ali Sabanci Chairperson at ESAS Holding, and moderated by Yasmin Elmousthey Managing Director at Beacon Hills, XBTO’s Chief Commercial Officer, Karl Naim met with ESG News to offer a practitioner’s perspective on how institutional-grade digital infrastructure is converging with traditional investment disciplines.

In a post-event interview, Karl Naïm, Chief Commercial Officer at XBTO, commented: “As digital asset markets mature and volatility compresses over time, firms like ours have been focusing on active strategies designed to generate alpha—mirroring the evolution of traditional hedge fund markets,” Naim said. “Tokenized private debt issuance and increasing demand for Bitcoin yield solutions combined with regulated custody offerings further demonstrate how digital assets are becoming embedded within mainstream capital markets and part of corporate treasury conversations, rather than operating at their margins.”

From a sustainable finance perspective, the implications of this shift are material. Digital market infrastructure enables more efficient capital allocation, broader access to private and emerging assets through tokenization, and reduced friction and settlement risk across financial systems. These structural improvements strengthen market resilience and support longer-term investment horizons aligned with sustainability objectives.

ADFW 2025 reinforced Abu Dhabi’s position as a global hub for sustainable financial infrastructure, combining regulatory certainty, sovereign capital, and long-term policy alignment. As digital assets move from experimentation to execution, Abu Dhabi is increasingly where institutional finance and digital infrastructure converge at scale. For ESG News, the signal is clear: sustainable finance is no longer defined solely by disclosures or frameworks, but by the infrastructure that enables capital to move efficiently, transparently, and globally.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ADFW-Panel-Fai-Hung-Ma-Stephen-Shaya-Ali-Sabanci-Karl-Naim-Yasmin-ElmoustheyJPG-1024x683.png,N,,2025-12-29 11:14:02.545011

Fast growth brings new dangers According to Altman, AI models have improved at an extraordinary speed over the last year.
In response to these growing risks, OpenAI has announced plans to hire a Head of Preparedness.
As AI systems become more conversational and emotionally responsive, concerns have grown about people becoming overly dependent on them.
OpenAI believes this kind of structured oversight is essential as AI systems become more autonomous and capable of complex reasoning.","Artificial intelligence has long been seen as a game-changer, promising to make work easier, boost research, and improve everyday life. From helping people write emails to solving complex technical problems, AI tools are becoming smarter by the day. But now, a rare warning has come from within the tech industry itself. OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman has admitted that advanced AI agents are starting to pose serious real-world risks, especially around security, misuse, and their impact on people.

In a recent post on the social media platform X, owned by Elon Musk, Altman said AI systems are entering a more dangerous phase. While companies have become better at measuring how powerful AI models are, understanding how those powers could be misused is becoming much harder.

Altman explained that the industry is moving into unfamiliar territory. “We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need a more nuanced understanding of how those capabilities could be abused,” he wrote. He added that limiting the risks without blocking the benefits is a tough challenge, mainly because there are very few past examples to learn from.

Fast growth brings new dangers

According to Altman, AI models have improved at an extraordinary speed over the last year. Many of them can already perform tasks that once required trained professionals, such as coding, analysing systems, and solving technical problems. But this rapid growth has also brought new risks. AI agents are no longer just tools that follow instructions. In some cases, they can act more independently, which makes them attractive to attackers. One of the biggest worries is cybersecurity. Altman revealed that AI systems are now becoming skilled enough to spot serious software weaknesses.

While this ability can help companies fix security flaws faster, it can also be misused. If the same tools fall into the wrong hands, they could be used to break into systems more easily and at a much larger scale. “We are seeing models become good enough at computer security that they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,” Altman said.

This signals a major change in how AI threats are viewed. AI is no longer just a support tool. It can actively search for weaknesses, making cyberattacks quicker, cheaper, and harder to stop.

AI-driven hacking is already happening

Altman’s warning comes at a time when concerns about AI-powered cybercrime are rising around the world. Recently, AI company Anthropic revealed that its Claude Code tool had been misused by Chinese state-sponsored hackers. The attackers reportedly targeted around 30 organisations, including technology firms, banks, and government bodies. What worried experts most was how little human involvement was needed. Much of the attack process was automated, showing how AI agents can make sophisticated hacking easier than ever before. Cybersecurity experts warn that traditional defence systems, which are designed to respond to human-led attacks, may struggle to keep up with this new reality.

In response to these growing risks, OpenAI has announced plans to hire a Head of Preparedness. This senior role will focus on managing the dangers linked to advanced AI systems. Altman said the move is part of a broader effort to ensure that safety keeps pace with innovation. The Head of Preparedness will lead OpenAI’s internal framework to identify, assess, and reduce risks from powerful AI models. The job will include evaluating what AI systems can do, building threat models, and ensuring safety measures are strong enough to handle future challenges. The role will also involve close coordination across research, engineering, policy, and governance teams. OpenAI has stressed that safety cannot be treated as an afterthought and must be built into products from the start. Importantly, this role will help decide when and how new AI capabilities are released, especially if there is a risk of misuse.

Concerns go beyond cybersecurity

Altman also pointed out that the risks of AI are not limited to hacking and digital security. He said OpenAI had already noticed early signs of mental health risks linked to AI interactions as far back as 2025. As AI systems become more conversational and emotionally responsive, concerns have grown about people becoming overly dependent on them.

At the same time, AI chatbots have faced lawsuits and criticism over misinformation. Several reports have accused AI systems of confidently producing incorrect or misleading information, making it harder for users to know what is true. These problems highlight a bigger challenge. As AI becomes more human-like and persuasive, its influence on people’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviour becomes harder to predict and control.

OpenAI has said the new Head of Preparedness will pay special attention to high-risk areas such as cybersecurity and biological risks. In these fields, misuse of advanced AI could have serious real-world consequences. The role will also involve working with external partners and internal safety teams to ensure that risk evaluations stay relevant as technology evolves. OpenAI believes this kind of structured oversight is essential as AI systems become more autonomous and capable of complex reasoning. Altman described the role as demanding, involving difficult decisions in a fast-moving and uncertain environment. Candidates are expected to have strong technical backgrounds in AI safety, security, or threat modelling, along with the ability to balance long-term risks with rapid product development.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sam-altman.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 07:13:23.908790

≡ BANKRUPTCY UPDATE ≡

“The Debtor does not have sufficient available sources of working capital and/or financing to operate its business or maintain its property in the ordinary course of business without the DIP [debtor-in-possession] Facility and authorized use of Cash Collateral.”

That’s the situation in which Grand Slam Track finds itself, as noted in the 23 December 2025 Order issued by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Delaware. In a 21 December filing, the Chief Restructuring Officer, Nicholas Rubin, noted its financial situation, requiring a rescue loan:

● $143,126 in cash on hand

● $31.4 million in debt

● $5.3 million in secured debt to Winners Alliance

● $6.1 million in unsecured debt to Winners Alliance

● $7.0 million owed to athletes

● $13.0 million owed to suppliers and vendors

Winners Alliance is the commercial – for-profit – arm of the Professional Tennis Players Association, and was the primary funder of Grand Slam Track. It provided $13 million in start-up capital in return for equity in the venture in April 2024. According to the Rubin filing:

“The Company therefore retained PJT Partners (“PJT”) to conduct a formal capitalraising and strategic outreach process. The engagement contemplated a broad-based market check, including outreach to strategic investors, family offices, private equity sponsors, venture capital firms, and new entrants to the sports and entertainment investment space. Between January 2025 and March 2025, PJT contacted more than 150 potential investors on behalf of the Company and facilitated extensive diligence and management engagement, including the distribution of marketing and diligence materials, provision of data room access, and coordination of live management presentations.

“During this period, members of the Company’s management participated in more than 30 live pitch meetings with prospective investors, addressing topics including the planned structure of the inaugural 2025 season, projected operating results, capital requirements, and potential paths to scalability. Despite this extensive outreach, many prospective investors declined to proceed or deferred investment decisions, frequently citing the early-stage nature of the league, the absence of completed operating results from a full season of competition, uncertainty regarding the ramp-up of media and sponsorship revenues, and the lack of a committed lead investor.”

In March 2025, possible investor Eldridge Industries decided to wait on committing to Grand Slam Track until seeing the first meet in Kingston, Jamaica on 4-6 April, and thereafter declined to participate. That caused the financial collapse of Grand Slam Track.

The recap noted that the three meets in Jamaica, Miramar, Florida and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sold a total of 64,566 tickets with “merchandise sell-outs at each event.”

Winners Alliance continues to have faith in the concept, and in the 23 December Order, will provide further loans of up to $3.25 million, and will have first call on repayment. The loans are being made at a quite-sharp interest rate of 14.5%.

But that $3.25 million will not go to pay off vendors and suppliers, or for most of the athlete expenses. It costs money to be in bankruptcy and the Order included a 13-week budget from 19 December 2025 to 20 March 2026 of $3.03 million:

● $1.58 million in operating expenses

● $1.45 million of restructuring expenses

The operating expenses include $421,643 in salaries and does include $200,000 for “Racer Contract Guarantees,” about 2.9% of the remaining debts to athletes.

The next major step comes in January, per the loan agreement:

“On or before January 30, 2026, Borrower shall have filed a Disclosure Statement and a proposed Chapter 11 Plan, which shall provide that GST emerges reorganized with Michael Johnson and Stephen Gera remaining as officers of the Reorganized Debtor and be in form and substance acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion.”

Gera, a former Marine who served in Iraq and later worked with teams in the NFL and NBA, joined Grand Slam Track in January 2024 and has served as President and Chief Operating Officer. He and Atlanta 1996 Olympic icon Johnson began discussions about the Grand Slam Track concept in mid-2023.

The loans are due to be repaid, or possibly converted into equity, by 15 April 2026.

Observed: Winners Alliance is willing to spend some more money on Grand Slam Track to see if it can make it pay and is keeping Johnson in charge. It will be an uphill climb, for sure, but the Philadelphia meet showed that there is fan interest.

But Grand Slam Track cannot go forward without paying off its debts, especially to the athletes. That’s the key, and any future ventures are going to require cash-in-advance to athletes and vendors.

AMD wins major Alibaba MI308 chip order to challenge Nvidia H200

AMD is poised to score a rare win against Nvidia in China after reports said Alibaba plans to buy about 40,000 to 50,000 units of AMD's China-specific MI308 AI accelerators, a deal that could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and mark AMD's largest single China transaction since US export controls took effect. The potential order comes as Washington allows both Nvidia and AMD to resume limited AI chip shipments to China in the second half of 2025, reopening competition that had been largely frozen.

While Nvidia has secured approval to reintroduce its H20 and later the more powerful H200, Chinese customers have reportedly cooled on the H20 amid performance concerns and regulatory scrutiny. By contrast, the MI308, which offers higher memory capacity, lower pricing, and no known security objections, is gaining traction as a practical alternative for Chinese cloud and AI workloads. Neither Alibaba nor AMD has confirmed the reported transaction.

SMEE wins China lithography order, yet ASML still controls advanced-node tools

Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) has secured a CNY109 million, or about US$15.5 million, contract to supply a step-and-scan lithography system to a China government-linked buyer, highlighting Beijing's continued push to localize semiconductor equipment under tightening US-led export controls, while underscoring that advanced-node lithography remains firmly beyond domestic reach.

The tool targets mature process nodes between 0.18 microns and 90 nanometers, aligning with demand from automotive, power, industrial, and specialty chip production rather than cutting-edge logic manufacturing. The single-source, policy-driven procurement reflects China's priority on securing a stable supply for mature-node capacity that underpins much of its domestic semiconductor output.

US probes top SEA Nvidia buyer over chip smuggling

US authorities are investigating Singapore-based cloud provider Megaspeed International over concerns that Nvidia chips may have been diverted to China, a case that has drawn political attention as Republican Senator Tom Cotton urges tighter enforcement of US export controls. People familiar with the matter said the probe has not established any violations, and Megaspeed and Nvidia have denied wrongdoing, while regulators in the US, Singapore, and Malaysia say their reviews are ongoing.

Bloomberg's analysis of customs data shows Megaspeed has imported at least US$4.6 billion worth of Nvidia hardware since 2023, including large volumes of current-generation Blackwell chips, and rents computing capacity from data centers outside China to customers that include Chinese firms, a model generally allowed under current rules. US officials are examining Megaspeed's ownership and whether any chips were physically transferred into China without licenses, while Nvidia says repeated site checks found no evidence of diversion.

Samsung, SK Hynix reportedly hike HBM3E prices nearly 20% ahead of 2026 shift

South Korean memory makers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have raised prices for fifth-generation high-bandwidth memory by nearly 20% for 2026 deliveries, as demand for AI accelerators continues to outpace supply even as producers shift capacity toward next-generation HBM4, according to industry sources.

The increase for HBM3E chips defies the usual price softening ahead of a generational transition and reflects sustained orders from AI chip designers, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, which are preparing higher-memory AI processors for 2026. Continued demand is also being supported by Nvidia's planned resumption of H200 exports to China, which rely on HBM3E rather than HBM4, extending the lifecycle of the current standard.

TSMC's N-2 restrictions give Samsung US advanced chip an opening

Samsung Electronics is positioning itself to capture rising US demand for advanced chips as Taiwan's N-2 policy limits overseas deployment of TSMC's leading-edge processes and much of TSMC's near-term capacity is tied up by Apple and Nvidia, according to industry sources. Samsung has begun sample testing of its second-generation 2nm SF2P process with AMD and is working with Google on potential 2026 production, while its Taylor, Texas, fab is being lined up for 2nm mass manufacturing as early as next year.

By contrast, TSMC plans to reach 3nm volume production at its Arizona Fab 2 in 2027, leaving its US operations at least two generations behind its Taiwan base due to regulatory constraints. With Apple reportedly taking nearly half of TSMC's 2nm output and Nvidia planning to move 2nm production to TSMC starting in 2027, customers such as Qualcomm, AMD, and Google are increasingly evaluating Samsung as an alternative.

Google reportedly fires procurement execs amid HBM supply crunch

Google and Microsoft are intensifying efforts to secure high-bandwidth memory as production capacity at South Korean suppliers tightens, underscoring how AI-driven demand is straining the global memory supply chain, according to industry sources cited by Seoul Economic Daily and G-enews.

Major cloud companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have stationed procurement teams in South Korea to negotiate supplies of HBM, DRAM, and enterprise solid-state drives from Samsung and SK Hynix, whose advanced memory lines are nearing full utilization. Tensions have emerged as buyers seek long-term commitments that suppliers say they cannot meet, leading to stalled talks and, at Google, the dismissal of procurement executives after the company failed to lock in capacity for its in-house tensor processing units.

Samsung, SK Hynix reportedly accelerate HBM4 production to early 2026

Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are accelerating sixth-generation HBM production to February 2026, moving months ahead of earlier schedules as they race to meet surging demand for AI infrastructure, according to industry sources and South Korean media, including Seoul Economic Daily and TheElec.

The revised timeline positions Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix to become the first suppliers to deliver HBM4 at scale, tightening their grip on the AI memory market before rivals can catch up. SK Hynix plans to start volume wafer input using 1b DRAM at its M16 and M15X facilities, while Samsung is expected to launch full HBM4 production at its Pyeongtaek campus after receiving positive evaluations from Nvidia, according to sources.

“I think our win at UC San Diego was the start of it,” Johnson said recently.
I love how fast we play.” Lavin sees Johnson as the perfect player to run his team.
You have to see it in real time to fully appreciate it.” UC San Diego coach Clint Allard saw it up close.
Tigers update: Senior Justin Rochelin was the Big West Sixth Man of the Year last season while playing for UC San Diego.","University of San Diego opens West Coast Conference play on Sunday against Pacific, and point guard Ty-Laur Johnson predicts the Toreros “will shock some people” before the season’s over.

“I think our win at UC San Diego was the start of it,” Johnson said recently. “We put it together in that game. I think we’ve started to figure each other out. We’re a lot better than people think we are. We just have to prove it.”

Johnson and his teammates certainly showed what they can do on Dec. 19, when they upset UCSD on the Tritons’ home court. Three nights later, however, the Toreros traveled to Washington and were routed 86-56 by the Huskies.

“I’m not saying we’re a finished product,” said Johnson, whose play was instrumental in the victory over UCSD. “But we’re making progress. We’ve gone through a lot of changes and had a lot of injuries. We have a good idea (of) what we can be. And it’s better than what people predicted.”

One reason the Toreros could be better than predicted — and they were projected to finish ninth in the West Coast Conference — is Johnson. The 6-foot point guard came to Alcala Park this year after spending two seasons in the Atlantic Coast Conference – one with Louisville and one with Wake Forest, where he started the final 19 games of the 2024-25 season.

Why would the Brooklyn, N.Y., native leave the ACC for USD, where the Toreros struggled to a 6-27 record last season?

Toreros coach Steve Lavin was the main reason.

“I liked his history of developing and using small guards at UCLA and St. John’s,” Johnson explained. “I wanted to be regarded as more of a leader on and off the court. I wanted to play for a coach who could make the most of what I do.

“I have definitely found a spot here. I’m definitely learning from Coach Lavin. He helps me with a lot of stuff, using my speed to create space, working the pace of the game. I definitely made the right decision. I like it here and having the ball in my hands. I love how fast we play.”

Lavin sees Johnson as the perfect player to run his team.

“The point guard is the basketball equivalent of the central nervous system,” Lavin said. “They are critical to what any team hopes to achieve. Ty-Laur is exceptionally intuitive. He has a feel that is difficult to teach.

“He’s as quick and as fast as any player I’ve ever coached. He gets us out in transition. He plays defense as well as offense. He’s built more like a dancer — wiry, strong and tenacious. You have to see it in real time to fully appreciate it.”

UC San Diego coach Clint Allard saw it up close. And he made note of Johnson’s play — not just the last-second shot that upset the Tritons at home.

“They turned the ball over to Johnson to handle our pressure and he did the job,” Allard said.

Said Lavin: “That game against UC San Diego, it was his combination of speed, quickness and skill and feel for the game that set him apart. It’s the combination. He’s that ideal guard that can influence the game on both ends of the court. While he’s diminutive, the length, his foot speed and instincts … John Wooden once said the two most important things in basketball are quickness and balance. Ty has both.”

Lavin remembers his first contact with Johnson when the guard was in the transfer portal.

“We had conversations,” recalled the coach. “He told me how he saw his game. I remember sending him some clips on small guards I’ve coached, guys like Tyus Edney and Cameron Dollar. It was sending those clips of certain guards so that he could get a sense and a feel for what he might be doing here.”

It hasn’t exactly been smooth sailing for the Toreros. They enter WCC play with a losing record. They were crushed by San Diego State in an exhibition and again last week at Washington. Nine Toreros, including Johnson, have missed practice time or games due to injuries or sickness.

“The adjustment is hard, but not that hard,” Johnson said. “One thing that made it harder is that we had so many new players (eight transfers and five promising freshmen). … “Once you start practicing, you learn tendencies. I think we’re still figuring it out, but it’s coming together. It’s hard to get to know somebody when they’re out injured.

“I feel my team is unpredictable. When we are hot, we’re hot. We can shoot. We have to get more consistent. I think it’s just a matter of time. We improve every day. I think we’re only about 70% of what we can be.”

Said Lavin: “We’re seeing signs of what we can be.”

“It started with a great first half against USC. The difference in that game was their 18-2 run early in the second half. That, and Johnson lost some critical time with foul concerns.

“But we talk a lot about orchestrating where we’re ahead. I think we’re headed in the right direction. The Washington game was a learning experience. And this is a group that’s evolving into a different team than what it was when we first came together. Our upside is intriguing.”

And Johnson?

“He knows,” Lavin said, “and does.”

USD vs. Pacific

When: 3 p.m. Sunday

Where: Jenny Craig Pavilion

On the air: ESPN+

Records: Pacific is 9-4. USD is 5-7

Last time out: Three days after upsetting crosstown rival UC San Diego 82-80 on Ty-Laur Johnson’s last-second 3-pointer, the Toreros lost 86-56 at Washington. Guards Juanse Gorosito and Adrian McIntyre each scored 15 points for the Toreros while going a combined 13 for 21 from the floor. USD was outrebounded 46-28, with the Huskies having a 22-6 edge in second-chance points and a 44-16 advantage on points in the paint.

Series history: Pacific leads the all-time series, 17-12. But USD has won three of the last four meetings under head coach Steve Lavin and went 2-1 against the Tigers last year, including a win in the first round of the West Coast Conference Tournament.

Toreros update: Lavin has used the same starting lineup the past two games – Johnson, Gorosito and McIntyre at the guards and Vuk Boskovic and freshman Alejandro Aviles on the front line. Due to injuries or illness, only five Toreros have played in all 12 games and only Boskovic has started as many as 10. Twelve different Toreros have started. Johnson leads USD with an average of 12.9 points per game. He, Toneari Lane (10.7), Gorosito (10.3) and McIntyre (8.8) are USD’s four leading scorers.

Tigers update: Senior Justin Rochelin was the Big West Sixth Man of the Year last season while playing for UC San Diego. The 6-foot-5 guard has started all 13 games for UOP, averaging 6.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game. Forward Elias Ralph leads the Tigers with 17.1 points and 6.2 rebounds per game while shooting 41.3% from 3-point range. Guard T.J. Wainwright (13.2 ppg) and forward Isaac Jack (9.6 ppg, 6.2 rpg) are major contributors.

Next up: USD will host No. 7 Gonzaga on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Jenny Craig Pavilion.

The appeals process has become a parallel assessment system, in which new evidence is routinely introduced, and eligibility is effectively re-determined.
Biennial reviews of PIP and Work Capability Assessment criteria to ensure eligibility reflects modern society, technology, and additional costs.
A joint DWP–HM Courts & Tribunals Service case management system to improve transparency, performance monitoring, and accountability.
We need to restore parliamentary authority, improve accountability, and use technology to deliver a fairer, more sustainable system.”","This new report by Policy Exchange shines a light on an often overlooked part of the welfare system: the appeals process for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). It argues that we need to fundamentally reform our appeals process for health and disability benefits to raise decision-making quality, improve democratic accountability and ensure the support provided is both sustainable and targeted appropriately.

We have a system where more than 300,000 young people are currently supported by out-of-work benefits that carry no work-search requirement. This is around double the number five years ago. More than 3.9 million people now claim PIP, with over 1,000 people making a claim to PIP. Forecasts now show that one in eight people will claim a disability benefit by 2030.

The report demonstrates that these benefits are increasingly shaped by judicial reinterpretation rather than clear parliamentary intent. Over time, this has allowed the practical boundaries of eligibility to expand. The appeals process has become a parallel assessment system, in which new evidence is routinely introduced, and eligibility is effectively re-determined. At the same time, fragmented accountability across the Department for Work and Pensions, the Ministry of Justice and HM Treasury has weakened incentives to improve decision-making.

Key recommendations

The report calls for a reset of the appeals system, including:

Fundamental reform of Mandatory Reconsideration, transferring it from the DWP to the Ministry of Justice and empowering judicial caseworkers to correct errors, order fresh assessments, and use machine learning tools to improve consistency and quality.

Biennial reviews of PIP and Work Capability Assessment criteria to ensure eligibility reflects modern society, technology, and additional costs.

Granting the Upper Tribunal the power to issue suspended remedies, forcing Parliament to actively respond to landmark rulings.

A joint DWP–HM Courts & Tribunals Service case management system to improve transparency, performance monitoring, and accountability.

Moving Social Security Tribunals to a “virtual by default” model, with safeguards for digitally excluded claimants.

Reforming tribunal interpretation services so that foreign-language interpretation is ordinarily funded by appellants (with appropriate exemptions for BSL).

In a foreword to the report, Sir Robert Buckland, former Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, warns that Parliament has allowed responsibility for welfare eligibility to drift from lawmakers to the judiciary: “Parliament must end its practice of legislating on eligibility criteria in a vague and undefined way and reclaim responsibility from the courts. The scale of discretion that has been subcontracted to judges should concern all of us who care about the proper role of the justice system.”

The report author, Jean-André Prager, remarked: “The appeals system has become a substitute for good decision-making rather than a check on it. This report argues for a reset. We need to restore parliamentary authority, improve accountability, and use technology to deliver a fairer, more sustainable system.”",https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Social-Cover-50-1024x558.png,N,,2025-12-28 18:59:02.909105

Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max have also continued to add customers this year.
Media giants must walk a tightrope between pleasing Wall Street and pushing consumers toward free streamers, or apps like Instagram and TikTok.","YouTube and other free ad-supported services, such as The Roku Channel and Fox-owned Tubi, have become increasingly popular over the last two years, according to Nielsen's viewership data.

""For consumers, cost sensitivity is often a more important deciding factor than user experience,"" said Brandon Katz, a media analyst at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. ""Saving money outweighs the annoyance of terrible insurance commercials.""

As these free streamers eat up a larger chunk of viewership time on US smart TVs, they may be holding back the growth of services like Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max.

ADVERTISEMENT

Free-to-access services YouTube, Tubi, and The Roku Channel have grown their viewership by 53% from December 2023 through November, according to a Business Insider analysis of Nielsen data. Those three free streamers make up nearly 18% of all watch time on US TVs, and that doesn't include Paramount's Pluto TV, which Nielsen broke out individually until March.

In that span, major paid streamers' collective watch time is only up 5%. That includes Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, and HBO Max, formerly known as Max. (Paramount+ was included until March, when Nielsen stopped reporting its individual share. And HBO Max's viewership includes sister streamer Discovery+.)

That means free streamers are growing more than 10 times faster than their paid counterparts, though the bulk of that growth is driven by YouTube, which has become a force in Hollywood.

ADVERTISEMENT

Slower engagement growth is a troubling sign for paid streamers. Viewership is positively tied to pricing power and inversely correlated with cancellations, meaning that people who watch a streamer more often are less likely to cancel.

""Engagement drives churn down,"" said Hernan Lopez, founder of media consulting firm Owl & Co.

""It's not just about hours spent,"" he added, but also the frequency that viewers return to an app and the breadth of content that they watch.

Engaged streaming subscribers are also usually more receptive to price hikes, Katz said, since they likely place a higher value on the service than inactive users.

ADVERTISEMENT

""The goal is to offer customers enough attractive content that opening the app becomes a regular occurrence,"" Katz said. ""At that habitual usage point, streamers are able to reasonably raise prices without fear of a mass exodus of customers.""

For customers on ad-supported plans, higher engagement also translates to more ad revenue.

It's not all bad news for paid streamers. Streaming is an increasingly profitable business, thanks in large part to price hikes, which every major service (except for Prime Video) has implemented or announced in the past 12 months.

Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max have also continued to add customers this year. However, Peacock hasn't grown its subscriber base since the first quarter of 2025, and Netflix no longer reports its subscriber count on a quarterly basis.

The large gap between free and paid streamer viewership growth rates suggests that so-called stream-flation could be taking a toll. Media giants must walk a tightrope between pleasing Wall Street and pushing consumers toward free streamers, or apps like Instagram and TikTok.

Streaming giants Netflix and Disney each have creative ideas for driving engagement in 2026.

Netflix is turning to video podcasts in hopes of adding lean-back content that keeps subscribers engaged throughout the day. It's also been trying to use games as a way to create daily habits among its users.

Disney is taking a different tack by betting on AI-generated video through a new partnership with OpenAI. This AI initiative will enable fans to create short clips of Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse or Darth Vader, eventually within the Disney+ app.",https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/sHFktkuTURBXy85YWUyNzJhNS1kNTg1LTQ5NWUtYTc1MS00YTY1NzlmZjVmZmYuanBlZ5GTBc0EsM0Cdg,N,,2025-12-28 17:59:44.674757

“You’re probably going to go online, research it a little bit,” Jensen said, outlining the typical shopper journey.
Best Buy leveraged laptop consumer data to identify “upgrade readiness signals” to see which consumers would be interested in using Microsoft’s AI tool.
“We don’t want to just be in retail media,” Jensen said.
We’re a retailer and a media company.","RANCHO PALOS VERDES, CALIF. — Best Buy can tie almost all its transactions back to individual customers, an ability the company considers market leading that’s based on precise measurement and attribution across the complex consumer electronics purchase path.

“We have a 93% revenue identification rate. So what that means is 93% of our transactions we can tie back to a customer and that’s pretty compelling — and that’s market leading,” Jen Jensen, VP of Agency Partnerships for Best Buy Ads, told Beet.TV contributor David Kaplan at the Beet Retreat LA.

Combined with eight million paid loyalty members and database coverage reaching 80% of the U.S. population, this identification capability provides a measurement foundation that Jensen said separates Best Buy from competitors facing lower match rates.

Where research happens

Consumer electronics purchases involve extended consideration periods with repeated movement between online research, in-store evaluation, and final transaction channels, creating measurement complexity that Best Buy’s data infrastructure addresses.

“You’re probably going to go online, research it a little bit,” Jensen said, outlining the typical shopper journey. “You’re going to compare brands. Then you’re probably going to go into a Best Buy store. You want to feel it, you want to engage with it, you want to probably talk to a blue shirt, ask questions. You might buy it there, or you might say, ‘I’m going to go back online, do a little bit more research.’”

About 45% of customers return to Best Buy stores for pickup after online purchase, creating touchpoints that inform attribution models spanning weeks or months of consideration.

Microsoft Copilot takes off

Jensen pointed to campaign partnership with Microsoft to promote the software giant’s AI platform Copilot. Best Buy leveraged laptop consumer data to identify “upgrade readiness signals” to see which consumers would be interested in using Microsoft’s AI tool.

“We were kind of digging in and understanding when they are ready to upgrade? What are the use cases that will get them to upgrade?” Jensen said. “We built a pretty cool campaign that we brought to about nine brands. They all wanted in because they wanted to say the consumer was ready to upgrade to this new technology.”

Closing the loop with CTV

Best Buy’s work with over-the-top TV platform Roku combined first-party data precision with connected TV brand-building capabilities and emerging formats like buy-now buttons that bridge awareness and conversion.

“When you think of that plus a partner like Roku, for us, that’s really important because you can really precisely target. Then you can also have closed loop reporting, which we know everybody wants,” Jensen said.

The integration enables simultaneous brand storytelling and performance demonstration through formats that didn’t exist in traditional television advertising.

AI optimizes across Google ecosystem

Google’s Performance Max product enables optimization across the company’s entire product portfolio while leveraging Best Buy’s first-party data, creating more performant media through automated allocation.

Best Buy is also deploying AI within its app to create custom experiences, serving relevant laptop content and advertising simultaneously when customers shop specific categories.

“You can have more dynamic creative, you can have more relevance for the customer. You just get to better performance and then you can scale it much faster,” Jensen said.

Media company ambitions

Best Buy positions itself as a media company and retailer rather than limiting its identity to retail media network, pursuing offsite expansion including Social Plus product with Meta and Instagram that leverages first-party data.

“We don’t want to just be in retail media,” Jensen said. “We want to be a media company. We’re a retailer and a media company. We want to continue to find ways like with what we’re doing with CTV to leverage our first party data to get to that place where you can have this full funnel solution.”

Looking at Best Buy’s 2026 roadmap, Jensen said to expect new tools enabling advertisers to understand campaign performance, advancing measurement toward incrementality analysis and multi-touch attribution that answers persistent advertiser questions.

“If you are a consumer electronics advertiser, you want to come to Best Buy because of the data we have, the products and solutions that we offer,” Jensen said.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/100063-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 16:58:23.532587

The move highlights the extent to which issues around safety and risk management are beginning to be baked into the development of frontier AI, as opposed to a bolt‑on function. CEO Sam Altman has described the role as high‑level and difficult, which suggests that the hire will face complex, high‑stakes work starting on day one.

What the Head of Preparedness Role Covers at OpenAI

Preparedness at a frontier laboratory typically involves three layers: model evaluation, product safety, and organizational response. Expect tasks to range from red‑teaming for biosecurity and cyber misuse; stress‑testing models to predict social harms such as radicalization or self‑harm enablement; and building metrics that signal when a system’s contours have breached risk thresholds.

On the product side, this typically includes crisis interventions that foster safe‑completion behavior, increased identity and use controls for sensitive domains, and provenance tools that curtail AI‑generated misinformation.

At the organizational level, Preparedness drives tabletop exercises, incident response drills, third‑party audits, and cross‑company escalation protocols in line with models such as NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework.

Why the Timing of OpenAI’s Preparedness Hire Matters

OpenAI has gone without an individual lead for the better part of a year, after previous leadership reshuffles split the role among multiple executives, industry reporting shows. Re‑centralizing accountability is a sign of efforts to fortify security operations as models scale and new capabilities emerge at an increasing pace.

Altman has called the role both “critical” and, given its world‑saving stakes, “stressful” — a task that, much like a preparedness team, must predict low‑probability, high‑impact events while shipping useful protections that work for millions of users. That tension — between abstract risk and the actual behavior of products in the field — is now becoming the gravity well for AI policymaking.

Recent lawsuits raise the stakes for AI safety at OpenAI

Recent wrongful death lawsuits have claimed that ChatGPT helped pave the way for tragedies by encouraging delusional beliefs or not adequately deterring requests about self‑harm. Though the facts will be debated in court, the cases illustrate a difficult problem: generative models can create persuasive counterfeits in high‑stakes areas where even a tiny number of failures is unacceptable.

Mature preparedness involves combining technical interventions — for example, refusal policies, retrieval‑augmented safety responses, and specialized crisis prompts — with monitoring that helps identify unsafe conversations and route them into safer flows. It also requires post‑incident analysis, much as aviation now looks into near misses. That feedback loop is critical: when things break, the repair must measurably make it stronger overall.

The broader safety and policy landscape around OpenAI

The position will also interface with a rapidly developing policy landscape. The UK’s AI Safety Institute is releasing standardized capability and risk assessments for sophisticated models. In the United States, federal agencies are working to operationalize the White House’s AI executive actions, and NIST’s guidance is rapidly becoming a de facto baseline for risk in enterprise AI. The AI Act, meanwhile, will impose new obligations on high‑risk and general‑purpose models.

OpenAI also contributes to multi‑stakeholder initiatives like the Frontier Model Forum, which has focused on red‑team sharing and incident reporting. A competent Head of Preparedness is also likely to strengthen relationships with external labs, academia, and civil society for vetting evals, comparing benchmarks, and coordinating on responsible release practices.

Compensation and expectations for the OpenAI role

The job is based in San Francisco and pays a listed salary of $555,000 with equity.

The role also telegraphs a combination of experience and urgency: The hire will have to marry a security discipline with product pragmatism, leading cross‑functional efforts and communicating risk to the company’s executives and regulators alike.

Practicality rules over abstract principles. Candidates with experience running security operations centers, leading incident response for cloud platforms, overseeing medical or aviation safety programs, or shipping safety‑critical ML systems will have a significant leg up. Look for more mandate around scaling evals, beyond security controls or auditing functions, to address safety failures, and “ship gates” based on the success of a red‑team.

What success looks like for OpenAI’s preparedness lead

Success will manifest in fewer and less severe incidents, better refusal accuracy for dangerous situations, transparent post‑mortems, and evaluations published that can stand up under independent laboratory testing. It also requires clear thresholds for when to throttle, fine‑tune, or restrict features as capabilities mature.

OpenAI’s call for a Head of Preparedness recognizes the obvious: as models grow more capable, the cost of doing safety wrong rises. The right leader won’t just predict the edge cases — they’ll establish systems, culture, and accountability to catch them before they can harm users.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/featured_edited_1766941698.png,N,,2025-12-28 17:13:23.931142

The company is rolling out a new prompt-based video editor inside Adobe Firefly, along with additional third-party image and video models, including Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 and Topaz Labs’ Astra.

Until now, Firefly’s video tools were largely generation-only. If one part of a clip didn’t work, you had to regenerate the entire video from scratch. The new editor changes that.

You can now make precise, text-based edits to existing video clips, using prompts to tweak specific elements like colors, lighting, subjects, and even camera movement. Think instructions such as “Change the sky to overcast,” or “Zoom in slightly on the main subject,” applied directly to the clip instead of starting over.

Firefly also gets a timeline-based editing view, making it easier to adjust frames, audio, and other details in a way that feels closer to traditional video editors.

Under the hood, Adobe is expanding Firefly’s model lineup. Through Runway’s Aleph model, users can issue targeted visual instructions, while Adobe’s own Firefly Video Model now lets you upload a reference frame or a sample camera movement and ask Firefly to recreate that motion in your video.

On the quality side, Topaz Astra is being added for AI upscaling, allowing creators to enhance videos up to 1080p or 4K. And on the image side, FLUX.2 is coming to Firefly across platforms immediately, with availability for Adobe Express users starting in January.

Adobe is also introducing collaborative boards, hinting at a more team-oriented future for Firefly as it competes with fast-moving AI image and video platforms.

To drive adoption, Adobe is offering a temporary perk: subscribers to Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, and the 7,000- and 50,000-credit plans will get unlimited generations from all image models and the Adobe Firefly Video Model inside Firefly until January 15.

This update caps off a busy year for Adobe’s AI push. In 2025 alone, Firefly expanded from standalone image generation into a full cross-platform app with mobile support, subscriptions, and a growing ecosystem of third-party models.

And, with over 4,000 stores nationwide having some kind of grocery department, it's a common choice for grocery shopping on a budget. Although Walmart's reputation for affordability is well-earned, there's another grocery chain that tends to be even cheaper.

With around 2,600 American locations, Aldi doesn't have quite as many stores as Walmart, but shoppers with access to both have generally noticed that Aldi has lower prices, especially if you rely on its high-quality store brands. For instance, a 13-ounce package of Aldi's knockoff Chips Ahoy cookies currently costs $2.75. Walmart's corresponding cookie product? $3.00.

When it comes to variety of inventory and keeping products in stock, Walmart wins the day. It's a much larger company with significantly bigger stores, meaning more money to buy inventory and more space to keep things stocked. And some products are cheaper at Walmart. But saving the most money possible will mean some trips to Aldi as well.

Basic groceries tend to be more affordable at Aldi

When we put Aldi vs. Walmart in a grocery shopping comparison, we appreciated that Aldi had a good selection of fresh produce and individually-wrapped steaks. A three-pack of romaine lettuce hearts will currently run you $3.29 at Aldi, compared to $3.86 at Walmart. And for a seasonal comparison, butternut squash is $1.54/pound at Walmart, which sounds reasonable until you see that Aldi has the same for 89 cents per pound.

Beef is an essential grocery item for many American households, and Aldi has historically had cheaper beef than Walmart. The trend seems to endure as well: grass-fed New York Strip is currently $13.99/pound at Aldi (and the only kind it carries) compared to Walmart's $20.94/pound for the same.

But just because Aldi tends to be cheaper for groceries than Walmart doesn't mean that's always the case. Eggs tend to be more affordable at Walmart than Aldi, which can be critical for big families. A dozen cage-free white eggs at Walmart cost $1.97, compared to $3.55 at Aldi. And Great Value Italian Bread is less than half the price of its Aldi equivalent. It's another reminder to shop around for the absolute best prices possible, even if one store tends to have the less expensive prices.

The chaos started during the Christmas weekend, and its impact is still being felt, as thousands of flights were disrupted by a powerful winter storm. The storm, which caused widespread cancellations and delays, has forced these airlines to ground planes and scramble to rebook stranded passengers.

Delta, along with its counterparts like JetBlue and United, was hit hard, with hundreds of flights canceled and thousands of travellers left in limbo at airports across the country. This Christmas nightmare has led to a travel hell for many, making it one of the most challenging holiday seasons for both passengers and airlines.

As we move into Sunday, the new update shows that the situation remains critical, with little relief in sight. If you’re flying in the coming days, be prepared for more disruptions. Travel And Tour World urges readers to keep reading to understand the full impact of this travel nightmare and how these airlines are responding to the ongoing crisis.

The US is reeling from the impact of Storm Devin, a catastrophic winter weather event that has crippled airports and disrupted air travel during the peak holiday season. This storm has caused chaos across the country, with JetBlue, Delta, American Airlines, and United Airlines among the hardest-hit carriers. More than 1,800 flights have been cancelled, and 22,000 flights delayed, creating a nightmare for holiday travelers. From New York to California, the storm has affected flights nationwide, leaving passengers stranded in airports for hours. As severe weather continues to wreak havoc, these airlines are scrambling to rebook passengers, but the disruptions aren’t expected to end anytime soon. This article takes a deep dive into the airline cancellations and delays, shedding light on how this unprecedented winter storm is reshaping holiday travel in the United States.

JetBlue Hit Hard by Winter Chaos: Over 350 Flights Canceled

The winter storm Devin has wreaked havoc on JetBlue Airways, which has been one of the most affected carriers during this brutal storm. Over 350 JetBlue flights have been cancelled due to the extreme weather conditions sweeping through the Northeast US. Major hubs like JFK, Boston Logan, and Newark Liberty were particularly impacted, with hundreds of passengers stranded in terminals. According to Reuters, JetBlue quickly waived change fees for affected travellers, providing rebooking options to help them get home during the busy holiday season. Despite these efforts, delays and cancellations continue to mount. With snowstorms and freezing rain battering the Northeast, it’s clear that the airline is facing one of its toughest holiday seasons yet.

The storm didn’t just affect JetBlue’s operations but also brought travel chaos to major East Coast airports. JFK Airport, known for its high traffic during the holidays, had significant delays as JetBlue scrambled to accommodate rebooked passengers. As the storm raged on, passengers were left frustrated by long queues, limited services, and heightened tension. The situation remains challenging, with more cancellations expected as the storm continues.

Delta Airlines Struggles to Keep Up: Over 200 Flights Canceled

Next up, Delta Air Lines has been hit hard by the storm, with over 200 flights cancelled during the peak of the winter chaos. Like JetBlue, Delta also has a heavy presence in New York, Atlanta, and Detroit, which all saw widespread disruptions. Passengers reported significant delays and confusion at terminals as Delta tried to manage the high volume of affected travellers. In the wake of this disruption, Delta activated its flexible travel policies, allowing passengers to change their flights without incurring additional fees. However, with over 22,000 flights delayed nationwide, the airline’s efforts to rebook passengers have been limited by the sheer scale of the storm’s impact.

The cancellations and delays have been particularly concentrated at major Delta hubs such as Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, Minneapolis-Saint Paul (MSP), and LaGuardia Airport. Passengers were advised to check with the airline for real-time updates on their flights and expected wait times. Delta’s quick response to waive change fees is a crucial step to helping ease the burden on travellers, but the delays continue to affect their operations well into the holiday period.

American Airlines Faces Mass Disruptions

American Airlines was not immune to the storm’s wrath, with over 140 flights cancelled due to hazardous weather conditions. With severe snowstorms gripping the Northeast and the Midwest, American Airlines struggled to maintain operations during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. Major airports like Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) and Chicago O’Hare saw high numbers of cancellations and delays, with many passengers left stranded.

American Airlines was quick to respond with flexible rebooking options, offering customers the chance to change their flight schedules without penalties. However, given the large number of affected travellers, passengers were still facing long waits, extended processing times, and overcrowded terminals. The holiday travel surge was already a challenging prospect, but the storm made it much worse. For those lucky enough to rebook, many faced connections that were severely delayed, further disrupting their holiday plans.

United Airlines and the Storm’s Lingering Effects: 97 Flights Grounded

While United Airlines wasn’t as severely affected as some other major carriers, it still faced 97 cancellations as a result of the storm. As one of the top airlines in the Midwest, United Airlines operates many flights through airports like Chicago O’Hare, which experienced significant disruptions. The airline was also impacted by snowstorms and icy conditions in other parts of the country, particularly affecting flights to and from airports like Denver International and San Francisco International.

United Airlines took swift action to help passengers, waiving rebooking fees and offering flexible travel options to assist those who were unable to make their originally scheduled flights. While the storm’s impact on United was less intense compared to other airlines, it still created a ripple effect across the network, with thousands of passengers facing delays as they waited to board their rescheduled flights.

Storm Devin: A Travel Nightmare for Thousands of Passengers

Storm Devin has proven to be one of the most severe winter storms in recent memory. According to reports, the storm caused widespread disruptions across the Northeast, causing over 1,800 flight cancellations and leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded in airports. This storm doesn’t just affect the airlines; it also has a knock-on effect on the American economy, with travel spending declining as people delay or cancel their holiday plans.

In the wake of this storm, many airports, including JFK, Boston Logan, and Philadelphia International, experienced significant delays and cancellations. With limited staffing due to the holidays, managing this influx of affected passengers has been a monumental challenge. Passengers are advised to stay updated with their airlines and consider alternate routes if possible. The extent of the storm’s impact has left many questioning how the airline industry will cope with future weather-related disruptions.

The Holiday Travel Surge: A Look at the Bigger Picture

While Storm Devin may have caused major disruptions, it highlights a bigger issue facing the airline industry: the increasing strain on airports and air traffic during peak seasons. The holiday period is always a busy time, but the recent surge in flight cancellations and delays due to severe weather demonstrates how vulnerable the system is to such events. As the US continues to face unpredictable weather patterns, airlines must invest in more robust systems to handle such crises efficiently.

Airlines like JetBlue, Delta, American, and United are doing their best to mitigate these issues, but as the storm continues to wreak havoc, many flights are still up in the air — quite literally. The recovery process will take days, if not weeks, with some passengers still stranded or rebooking their flights at the last minute. This article serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of holiday travel and the importance of preparing for unexpected disruptions.

On December 16, S&P Global Ratings reiterated a B- Issuer credit rating for Strategy Inc (NASDAQ:MSTR), citing the company’s stable outlook.

According to the ratings firm, the establishment of a US$ reserve is a credit positive that affirms the company’s ability to mitigate liquidity risks associated with funding preferred dividend and coupon payments. The reserve is expected to prefund payments for 12 to 24 months before the company defers payments or sells Bitcoin.

While the company has lost about 40% of its market value due to a decline in Bitcoin prices, it maintains strong access to capital markets. It raised $700 million in November through a euro-denominated preferred stock offering. It has also funded its nearly $1.5 billion in reserves through the issuance of common stock.

Meanwhile, on December 5, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brett Knoblauch reiterated an Overweight rating but cut the price target to $229 from $560. According to the research firm, fears about the company are overblown, as it is not under any obligation to sell Bitcoin. Likewise, the company has enough cash to fund dividends for 21 months, with Bitcoin valued at $60.7 billion.

In den USA erhielten die Dänen eine Zulassung für eine oral zu verabreichende Variante des Abnehmmittels Wegovy. Es ist das erste Medikamente dieser Art, welches bereits im Januar seinen Marktstart feiern soll.

Damit ist Novo Nordisk der Konkurrenz einen Schritt voraus, was zu Wochenbeginn noch mit Kursgewinnen von mehr als sieben Prozent bedacht wurde. Am Freitag ließt die Stimmung an der Walltstreet aber wieder etwas nach. Der höhere Kurs konnte sich konsolidieren. Für weitere Kursgewinne reichte es indes nicht.

Immer schön vorsichtig

Eine Rolle dürfte dabei eine Einschätzung von BMO Capital gespielt haben. Dort blickt man eher nüchtern auf die jüngsten Neuigkeiten und warnt davor, dass der zeitliche Vorsprung vor der Konkurrenz nur von kurzer Dauer sein dürfte. Tatsächlich plant Eli Lilly derzeit damit, im Frühjahr einen Zulassungsantrag für eine Abnehmpille in die Wege zu leiten.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Novo Nordisk?

Novo Nordisk unter Beobachtung

Ankommen wird es nun darauf, dass Novo Nordisk seine Zulassung auch zu neuen Umsätzen und Gewinnen nutzen kann. Dabei bleibt manche Frage offen. Etwa, wie viele neue Kunden sich für das frische Medikament finden lassen und wie viele schlicht von Abnehmspritzen wechseln. Grenzenlose Euphorie kommt offenbar noch nicht auf und trotz der Erholung vor den Feiertagen bleibt der Chart ein eher trauriger Anblick.

BRENNAN: They're pulling back because incomes are not keeping up with inflation. But it's a very different story. When you look at the upper income brackets, I know you see data of actual transactions. Are people doing what they tell us they're doing?

MOYNIHAN: So- so we not only see it in the aggregate, we also see it in pieces. And so if you look in the aggregate, the amount spent through the Thanksgiving weekend, on you know, Black Friday and Cyber Monday through all the month of November and the first part of December, it's- it's up four- four and a quarter, four and a half percent versus last year's November. And so it's growing. And then if you look by terciles, three buckets of income levels, it's clear the people in the bottom income level, at lower income levels are spending a little faster growth rate, but still growing and in the middle and upper faster. So, you know, what they're telling you is, what they feel, what they're actually seeing, is spending is really solid, reasonably solid heading into the end of the year, and it's been kind of going along like that all of December. Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending they have good credit quality. They are employed, and wait- we can see wages growing in as people's paychecks come in at a 3% clip. So it's a- it's pretty solid right now.

BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper income brackets? Is it that K shaped economy some people talk about--

MOYNIHAN Our team puts the- looks at this. Yes, it the growth rate difference is higher, but all of- all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing.

BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?

MOYNIHAN: That's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.

BRENNAN: Why do you think people have sentiment that's low but spending that's higher?

MOYNIHAN: It's- you hear about it, you've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that- because we had a very, a very strange process from 20 through now, we had COVID lockdown, then we had all the stimulus, and we had high inflation, and then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, Here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's- they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times, and so they saw the inflation and 20 and 23 and 24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist, and it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into 26 having come through 25 the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at they think inflation keeps working its way down. But it's- it's what people feel, and you can't discount that. And it's also at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on. But, but it's, it's not widespread at four, you know, 4.6% unemployment in the last number they publish, that's still in the- in our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly,

BRENNAN: And what do you see then as the biggest risk to the economy?

MOYNIHAN Well, when you look out ahead, it's, it's it's the question wars is another thing that could really shake up the markets. But the real question is- is- will the consumer keep spending in the US? We have the US economy growing about 2.4% next year. We have in- but that's dependent upon a consumer that stays engaged. If the consumer becomes less engaged as we move into 20- from 25 into 26 and slows down their spending. That's going to slow down the economy. So that's a risk. You just don't see it anywhere now. The second risk is wars and other things that could go on that could create shocks to the market. And you know, then there's the usual things, cyber events and things like that. But the real risk is, will the Americans, if the companies of America employ people and pay them a little bit more, they will spend an economy in the US will be fine, and then you have these investments in the stimulus from the uh, the tax act, you have the stimulus from some of the investments coming in that are keep kicking in. And that's why our team went from one and a half percent, probably four months ago, to two and a half percent, 2.4% for 26 now, yeah.

BRENNAN: Okay, so in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system. It was a big concern, but Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?

MOYNIHAN: Well, I think- if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses--

BRENNAN: There was shock--

MOYNIHAN: --and medium size businesses--

BRENNAN: There was shock.

MOYNIHAN: They were shocked.

BRENNAN: There was shock on liberation day.

MOYNIHAN: The sheer size, the volume, the dollars, across the board, et cetera. What you say now, as times moved on, it's sort of a 15% on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the US, or won't commit to lowering their non tariff barriers and things like that. And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean--or foreign CEOs--you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be- drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15% to go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to- it's starting to de escalate, and that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15% here 17 different numbers. When you put China, China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case. And I think also between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly in the world, you can see sort of the end point here and now they've just got to (INAUDIBLE)- it's got to work through the system.

BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B of A is the largest small business lender.

MOYNIHAN: So we're the largest small business lender. If we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very- because rates have gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow a floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit? But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit, so they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern. It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So if you think across four policy regimes, tax-trade-tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation. You've seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability. How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable. They're here. So give me a set of rules and I'll go play with them. But I need to be clarified what the rules are.

BRENNAN: The labor scarcity issue, people just can't find folks--

MOYNIHAN: The- dependability and people who are probably not anything to do with what the policies are about feel- feel differently, and that's if they don't feel they can go to work, if they don't feel they can do things that that just has to resolve. And small businesses are generally most impacted because they don't have our wonderful research team to figure it all out and talk and talk to the big clients who have other teams to do it, and that's trickier. So I think, and by the way, the administration understands that they're working on it, they're trying to figure out how to get that part put together so it's clear what the policies will be and won't be, so that, or aren't, or, more importantly, aren't, really what the people that the ill settled down, but that that issue of labor was a 23 issue after the great resignation disappeared from small, medium sized businesses came back in literally because of where, where we are from this summer on.

BRENNAN: One of the other big factors, it seems in the jobs market, is this question of artificial intelligence. How much is B of A relying on AI to do things like predict loan defaults or identify risks?

MOYNIHAN: Well, so I think the way that the consumer would feel AI at Bank of America is Erica. So if you go on our mobile app- you there's a bot there. It's an agent. It's been there for many years. It does 2 million customer interfaces a day. So it's not small. 20 million customers actively use it. It can answer 700 questions. So that's real and been going on. And so that's the way a customer would feel it. If you're a corporate customer, you'd feel with Erica's embed in our cash pro- so your portal you go to as a company to make payments or FX transactions, and you want to ask questions, Erica is there. So that's- that you're asking about something different. We have used models for years about predicting defaults. So we do stress testing. Those are all models to predict the outcome. We have loss given defaults, default predictions. That's all there. Can these help us make us more informed? Yes, can they help different types of employees operate faster? Absolutely. So we're deploying across all our teammates AI, have access to AI tools. The- there are specialized AI tools in certain areas, but we think the highest best use near term is either discrete process application or in helping us build intelligent to high levels. But to interface to a customer, you have to have your data right. You have to have the controls right, because you can't give the customer the wrong answer, whether it's, I'm going to approve your loan or not, and that's why this will be a little- take a little more care to implement in customer facing business with trust, which is what financial services is.

BRENNAN: Well, I ask it because there's that question of how many human jobs get replaced, right? And when you look at that recent Business Roundtable Survey of CEOs, they predict that while there is spending on technology and AI, they're not looking at hiring going up. They see it actually reducing.

MOYNIHAN: So, so there's a couple things that is what's on people's minds, and that's when we talk to our teammates. We're saying, Hey, we're going to bring AI and make it more efficient, and then we got to produce more activity. And you don't have to worry. If you capture AI and use it in your day to day work, that's a great thing. And so it's not a threat to their jobs. But on the other hand, I think people are now assuming they're going to get benefits, and we'll see if they get those benefits. But you know, if you think from 1969 to 2019, it was 50 years, a lot of technology came in America employs twice as many people in 2019 as we did in 1969. So will this wind up? I don't know, and nobody really knows for sure, because we haven't ever had it. But on the other hand, there's a capability in our company. The commercial bankers are calling on commercial customers. If they get 10% more efficient, we may not add a lot to grow, but doesn't mean we're gonna take away and get the efficiency- we want to grow. We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent- the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think.

BRENNAN: So, it's a problem for the new college grad, but it's not necessarily a layoff that you're making, essentially.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah, well, we just hired 2000 plus new college grads in July, so it's- we didn't change the size of class- my advice to those kids, if you ask them if they're worried about, they say they're worried about- these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people. They came into our company. If you ask them, if they're scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I- says, harness it, and you shouldn't. It'll be your world ahead of you.

BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the mortgage business. You've got a big one. The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?

MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it. One is the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up. So that's slowing down that activity. The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country. Some single- you could have single family, multi small multi floor units, things like that. Or even more, bigger multi family, major cities, but there's a universal housing shortage, because for so many years it's been hard to get housing permitted, and so the advice I give to anybody is you're probably not going to see the 10 year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of three and but the tenure rate stays between four and four and a half, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than this today, but if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that is probably the solution. Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people 3% mortgage rates, that's not going to be changed. And by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession. So we shouldn't be cheering for 3% mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.

BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down is a good thing? You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.

MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market, because there's 60 million- there's 130 odd million households in America, half of them don't have a mortgage. This is this whole lock in question is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring- rental affordability is a question. Or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that. So it's a very complex thing, but simplistic- simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through. But we had a very different rate environment for a lot of years, and that's- that's hard for people to think about, because people under the age of 40, 2,3, 4, no, were not out working in an environment where we had a 3% Fed funds rate, which is more the norm than not.

BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie. Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The Treasury Secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake. Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But- but for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?

MOYNIHAN: I don't talk about client relationships, but look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And- and the administration knows that, Secretary Bessent knows it that guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30 year mortgage. Because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels, there are more advantageous to borrow. You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be okay, or a lot of years. So that guarantee is critical to U.S. getting fixed rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability, and then they've run the things pretty responsible since financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason. One of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them. And as soon as prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful all that, and I think- but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been. They're a great company. They're a iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.

BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May. For someone at home, how much does that job matter to the consumer. How do you explain that?

MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things. So the President's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. Presidents throughout- since the Federal Reserve, 100 plus years ago, was founded, have done that, it's not new. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's he should do it. There's- my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not- we're a country- we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer- all these people drive our economy. The idea that we are like hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get- since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy. That's what they're supposed to do. That went away number of years ago. It came back a little bit in COVID. They're a lender of last resort. They're there to stabilize markets and price- but other net you shouldn't know they exist quite frankly--

BRENNAN: --So you don't worry about all this, you know, handwringing of political interference with the Fed, once that new position is--

MOYNIHAN: --The market is a- will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed. And everybody knows that.

BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Trump accounts. They're trying to build generational wealth. The administration says by having these wealthy donors, state governments, employers put money in these tax advantage accounts for kids as an addition to the federal government putting some money into some of them, are you going to have a role in that program? And what do you think more broadly about expanding the number of people putting money in the stock market, in these index funds.

MOYNIHAN: So I think number one, if- at our company starting 2017 we- after the tax act from that year, a lot of companies gave their employees $1,000 bonus. We started doing something else the next year, which we kept going and I've gone since. So our 200,000 plus employees every year get an award of stock across the whole board, and that's built up to be s--

BRENNAN: --Many corporations do that, restricted stock.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah, but it's gone on for now. A lot of them did it once, didn't do it, but very few have done it that much. And that's like $6 billion of stock have gone into those employees. And so I believe in stock ownership by everybody. I believe in holding that stock and appreciating. And so we believe in that, we have a 401k, that people can invest, we have 7% match and all that stuff. These accounts, I think, are also good. The question is, you know, the parents have to make the contributions, and the government will put some money in, but the broader products available for parents, it'll be good to save. But I think we shouldn't- we should do this, but we also have to remember financial education. Because if you can get an education generally, in skills training, because if somebody could earn $10,000 more a year than they'd otherwise earn, or they can balance their budget and be cash flow positive to $10,000. That goes on for their, you know, from their first job, 21,18, all the way through 65 that is a lot of money. Where this for 18 years, will be a lot of money, but it'll be- it'll stop where that will go on forever. So we need this type of work. And I expose the equity markets underinvesting in America and all those things, very low cost where the index funds doesn- it had basis points where they were saying that's all the right way to do it. By the way, it was back to privatization, Social Security in those days and that stuff.

BRENNAN: Is this basically a way to do that? I mean, every baby suddenly has a stock market investment.

MOYNIHAN: It'll- I mean, we'll have to see. You and I won't be around 50 years, 60 years from now, maybe you will be, I won't be around 60 years from now to think about it. But it- you know- it'll, it'll do that. But equity investment by people holding that and having have to hold it so they can't churn it and sell it. And that's, that's a good thing. So I think it's a great product. I think it's wonderful that people are stepping up and contributing to it. We all have to think about an employer, because we have that stock program, which is several thousand dollars to employees. And, you know, we have our 401k match. And if we do this, how does that work? And stuff like that. But- and if you do it for kids, what do you do for the rest of people? You have this question that not everybody in our company has kids. And so if I put the match in for- if I put the money for people with kids, what I do with people without kids? So there's a little more complex, but it's a good thing, and I think we'll figure out how to participate and make it happen.

BRENNAN: So back in August, when we spoke, you talked about these allegations of banks playing politics and discriminating against conservatives. You pushed back pretty hard in that moment. But earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six page report. There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?

MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been- have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on. So if you read the website, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was that's not what was going- never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clear so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others. And we'll, we'll look at anybody who, who feels we- believe me, they- people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, 'you've closed my account, why?' And we can tell them. But I think people are forgetting the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And, and believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be a fail as a company, and therefore we're going to write you up.

BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration that kind of--

MOYNIHAN: --even–

BRENNAN: --social pressure you're saying--

MOYNIHAN: --20 years ago--

BRENNAN: 20 years ago, okay--

MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up, and then it's and then the second thing is that, that for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at 10,000 and you have two things, if it goes above that, you have to pour it down, if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972. That number would be 80,000 today, so what we thought was material then--

BRENNAN: --in terms of, like, suspicious transactions.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah, and so and so. There's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to- if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful. So there's sort of the ESG side of it, those things I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff. Because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter and then the reputation risk, which to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.

BRENNAN: because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House. But this issue the president himself really dug into and he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, it's- do you know what he's talking about?

MOYNIHAN: We- I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we--

BRENNAN: He said it on television, about you.

MOYNIHAN: I know that. People- if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television it- you know, I'd be rich. So at the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers. We have tens of thou- we have the biggest small business lender in the country period and stop. You know? And so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's, it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their, and their points of view. But look, some of these policies, we were pushed to places that we've been able to bring back to the center and America ought to feel good about that.

BRENNAN: And you think the things are copacetic now. You put this behind you with the White House?

MOYNIHAN: Yes.

BRENNAN: Okay, I'm getting a wrap over here on time. So thank you for making time for us.

MOYNIHAN: Happy Holidays, thank you.

BRENNAN: Happy Holidays to you.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/28/fffdff37-73c2-40f6-8544-0d8b49ea22a8/thumbnail/1200x630/0726b9fa400ed27ebdbd113efdbb7b4a/screenshot-2025-12-28-at-10-41-32-am.png,N,,2025-12-28 13:00:00.507985

In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), Vitarich said it has entered into a compromise agreement with AXA Philippines Life and General Insurance Corp. to settle its insurance claim under Civil Case No.
The company expects the settlement, which takes effect on Dec. 19, 2025, to have a material impact on liquidity and capital resources.
“The settlement will provide the company an estimated additional ₱196 million in net income and ₱267 million in net cash flow.” For the first nine months of 2025, Vitarich reported revenues of ₱9.17 billion, net income of ₱120.6 million, and earnings per share of ₱0.04.

In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), Vitarich said it has entered into a compromise agreement with AXA Philippines Life and General Insurance Corp. to settle its insurance claim under Civil Case No. 662-M-2014, entitled “Vitarich Corp. vs. Charter Ping An Insurance Corp. (now AXA Philippines).”

On May 31, 2023, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos City, Branch 15, rendered its decision, finding the insurer liable to pay Vitarich ₱247.62 million with interest, in addition to the amount previously awarded through a summary judgment.

The insurer filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA) and, without admitting any fault and to avoid a prolonged legal process, agreed with Vitarich to a settlement valued at ₱400 million.

The settlement, containing customary provisions mutually beneficial to both parties, was accepted by Vitarich President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ricardo Manuel M. Sarmiento, who has been authorized by the board of directors.

The company expects the settlement, which takes effect on Dec. 19, 2025, to have a material impact on liquidity and capital resources.

“The settlement will provide the company an estimated additional ₱196 million in net income and ₱267 million in net cash flow.”

For the first nine months of 2025, Vitarich reported revenues of ₱9.17 billion, net income of ₱120.6 million, and earnings per share of ₱0.04.

Revenues slightly declined by 0.5 percent year-on-year, primarily due to the continued drop in chicken prices, which also affected the valuation of biological assets, as well as the limited availability of day-old chicks (DOC) during the first half of the year.

This was partially offset by the company’s entry into the day-old pullet segment.

Gross profit rose to ₱1.12 billion, a modest 4.1-percent increase from the prior year, driven by favorable chicken prices during the early part of the year and improved production efficiencies in the feeds segment.

Operating income, however, dropped by 32.4 percent year-on-year to ₱240.2 million, mainly due to higher operating expenses (opex) arising from increased marketing activities, freight and handling costs, corporate events, and employee training programs.

""Walmart is slowly swapping from cardboard to plastic packaging with their pasta,"" the Redditor captions the image that shows the two packaging options side by side.

While switching from cardboard to single-use plastic may make the packaging lighter, it's still not ideal for the planet for a few reasons.

First, cardboard boxes are fully recyclable, and most municipalities process cardboard in their recycling programs. Recyclable cardboard is often made from post-consumer materials, and it has a high recyclable success rate of 70%.

Second, Walmart recently announced a shift toward electric trucks for some deliveries, helping to reduce its carbon footprint and decrease its production of carbon pollution. Shipping fully-recyclable containers on pollution-free trucks is better for the planet virtually 100% of the time.

Using plastic means dirty energy sources are still involved in the product, since plastic is a byproduct of dirty energy. And while some single-use plastic bags can be recycled, not all can. These flimsy bags often tear, making them not an ideal reuse candidate. Plastic is also a leading ocean polluter, poisoning wildlife and exacerbating the overheating of our planet.

Redditors were quick to blast the retail giant's decision. ""[Y]ou would hope the swap would be the other way,"" wrote one user.

""We are heading in the wrong direction,"" wrote another user.

One Redditor shared some insight as to why Walmart may have made the shift. ""I work in packaging,"" they wrote. ""There have been intermittent paper shortages since COVID.

Increased U.S. production doesn’t fundamentally change the picture, but it does increase the risk to Canada.”","This story is part of a selection of our top news from 2025 that we’re republishing during the holiday break. We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

With Donald Trump pledging a “Drill, Baby, Drill” agenda for fossil fuels that would pour an estimated four billion tonnes of additional climate pollution into the atmosphere, nervous private investors emerged early this year as a force that could impede the oil and gas industry from keeping Trump’s promise.

Their demands for bigger, faster returns on their fossil investments, coupled with heightened fear of declining oil demand and surging clean energy alternatives, had independent analysts and even some industry insiders concluding there’s no sudden oil boom on the horizon.

It isn’t that the industry didn’t want to ramp up production after the U.S. presidency changed hands Jan. 20. It’s that cautious investors might prevent them from doing that.

The U.S. fossil fuel industry spent US$219 million to elect the country’s next government, Yale Climate Connections reports, most of it on Republican campaigns. That was after Trump invited about 20 oil and gas executives to his Mar-a-Lago estate in April to present what one independent journalist called a “breathtakingly corrupt proposal: If they raised a billion dollars to help him retake the White House, he would roll back any policy they didn’t like when he took office.”

In the end, the election result was a bargain at one-fifth the price Trump asked the industry to pay. Not long after the dust settled on last fall’s presidential vote, the American Energy Alliance (AEA) declared itself pleased with Trump’s cabinet nominations.

“Throughout his campaign, President Trump expressed his unwavering commitment to American [fossil] energy, and his selections show how serious he is about unlocking our country’s resource potential,” AEA President Thomas Pyle said in a Nov. 26 statement. “He has chosen strong candidates to comprise his energy team,” all of whom “share a vision for energy dominance and economic growth.”

Those plans could pour an extra four billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere by 2030, Carbon Brief concluded last March.

Funnelling Cash Out of Production

But the industry’s behaviour is not matching up with its rhetoric. As far back as March 2023, with analysts predicting (as it turned out, over-predicting) $100-per-barrel oil and U.S. President Joe Biden urging companies to increase production, industry leaders were directing their record profits to investor dividends and share buybacks, diverting funds that would previously have been devoted to seeking out and developing new oilfields.

With shareholders basking in a $128-billion financial windfall, “oil executives who in years past were rewarded for investing in gigantic, long-term energy projects are now under the gun to funnel cash to investors who are increasingly convinced that the sunset of the fossil-fuel era is nigh,” Bloomberg Green reported at the time.

“At the heart of the divergence is growing concern among investors that demand for fossil fuels will peak as soon as 2030, obviating the need for multi-billion-dollar megaprojects that take decades to yield full returns,” the news story stated. “In other words, oil refineries and natural-gas fired power plants—along with the wells that feed them—risk becoming so-called stranded assets if and when they are displaced by electric cars and battery farms.”

Projections that oil consumption will peak this decade may have begun with the IEA, but the chorus of agreement now includes private energy analytics firms like Wood Mackenzie and Rystad Energy, as well as oil giants like BP and Exxon.

Against that backdrop, the June 2024 World Energy Investment report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) traced the decline in capital expenditures back nearly a decade. It said global investment in “upstream” oil exploration and extraction activity was set to fall to its lowest level since 2017, with state-owned oil corporations in the Middle East and Asia accounting for a far larger share of the total and the major private oil companies cutting investment by about one-quarter.

Among the world’s 30 biggest upstream oil producers, dividends and stock buybacks exceeded [pdf] capital spending in 2022 and 2023, with investment in exploration and extraction falling from more than 75% in 2015 to less than 50% of the total.

The same IEA report showed the world investing nearly twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels.

Borrow Billions, Hand It All Over to Investors

Now, some of the world’s biggest fossil producers are facing down a new layer of risk: with oil demand collapsing, prices staying stubbornly low, and investors still laser focused on short-term returns, four of the world’s five oil “supermajors” saw fit to borrow $15 billion to fund share buybacks between July and September, Bloomberg reported in late October.

With their quarterly profits at their lowest since 2021, down by half from record highs in 2022 and by 12% from the previous quarter, analysts said colossal fossils ExxonMobil, Chevron, TotalÉnergies, and BP wouldn’t have enough cash on hand to cover the dividends and share buybacks their investors were demanding. While Exxon and Chevron had “plenty of room to borrow to fund buybacks,” Bloomberg wrote, “the European majors have higher debt levels, allowing less room to manoeuvre,” with BP posting the worst financial performance based on its ratio of debt to capital assets.

“Borrowing to buy back shares isn’t uncommon in the oil business,” Bloomberg explained. “but a dimming outlook for oil prices next year means the cash shortfall is apt to continue over the longer term,” while investors’ expectations for immediate returns continue.

Another Day, Another Debt

Going deeper into debt to hand money over to shareholders “could be a good use of cash while companies have reasonably strong balance sheets,” Kim Fustier, head of European oil and gas equity research at HSBC Plc, told the news agency. “The question is, ‘How sustainable will it be?’”

“While it is common for companies to borrow to maintain dividends during lean periods on the premise of a cyclical recovery, it is quite another thing to do the same when the decline is structural,” agreed Guy Prince, a senior analyst on Carbon Tracker’s oil, gas and mining team, in a December 2023 analysis tracking the financial decline of 40 different petrostates—particularly Saudi Arabia.

“Falling oil demand will have varying impacts on companies,” he wrote. “However, for Saudi Aramco, with its self-imposed production targets (to shore up prices) and fixed dividend payments to the Saudi government to fund its fiscal spend (they need $80 a barrel), it is particularly painful.”

Over a nine-month span in 2024, Aramco’s financial position “has moved from net cash of $27.4 billion to net debt of $8.9 billion,” Bloomberg energy and commodities columnist Javier Blas wrote on social media. “That means in 2024 Aramco has spent ~$130 million daily that it didn’t have.”

The overall financial picture points to a rather less aggressive picture of the next four years of fossil fuel development than Trump’s and the industry’s chatter about making “American Energy Great Again”, just months after U.S. crude production set an all-time record under Biden.

Low Oil Prices Mean Falling Profits

It’ll be that much harder for Big Oil to deliver on all the big talk as long as it’s caught between two converging trends: jittery investors and relatively low prices driven by faltering demand for oil.

“Oil consumption in China—the powerhouse of world markets for the past two decades—has contracted for six straight months through September, and will grow this year at just 10% of the rate seen in 2023,” Bloomberg reported in mid-November, citing IEA analysis. Consistent with other recent analysis, a senior IEA official said it was possible that China’s oil demand had already peaked.

The result: global oil consumption will still rise this year, but at less than half the rate of 2023. And crude oil prices fell 11% between early October and mid-November.

“It’s not just the economy and the shift, the slowdown in the construction sector,” the agency’s head of oil industry and markets, Toril Bosoni, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s the transition to electric vehicles, high speed rail, and gas in trucking that is undermining Chinese oil demand growth.”

That shaky picture of future demand had the U.S. Energy Information Administration rolling back its 2025 price projection for West Texas Intermediate crude oil—from an estimate of $79.63 per barrel last September to $73.13 in October and $69.12 in December. Falling prices will only erode profits and available funds that companies are already redirecting from exploration and production to shareholder returns.

Those same price dynamics had the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries and its petrostate allies (OPEC+) balancing an “unpalatable choice” between the mounting financial pain of restraining production and the risk that bringing new oil supplies online would just drive down prices farther and faster, Bloomberg wrote in late November. By mid-December, the cartel was “gradually conceding defeat”, the news agency said, slashing its estimates of future demand growth and bringing them closer to the IEA’s—which Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman had previously dismissed as “La La Land” for its recent emphasis on net-zero scenarios.

California-based Chevron also announced a $2-billion capital expenditure cut, its first since the COVID-19 pandemic, in early December, a decision the Financial Times placed in counterpoint to Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda. That left Exxon as a major outlier, with announced plans to increase production by nearly one-fifth and continue boosting capital spending through the end of this decade.

Oil Producers Tap the Brakes

But even Exxon is throwing cold water on Trump’s pledge to drill everything, everywhere, all at once.

“I think a radical change is unlikely because the vast majority, if not everybody, is primarily focused on the economics of what they’re doing,” the company’s Upstream President Liam Mallon told a conference audience in late November. If Trump follows through on plans to open up public lands in the U.S. to oil and gas production, “You would be able to drill more, assuming you have the quality and met your economic threshold,” he added. “But I don’t think we’re going to see anybody in the ‘Drill, baby, drill!’ mode. I really don’t.”

“Maybe he has a magic recipe to push them to drill like mad,” added TotalÉnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne. But with companies committed to returning cash to shareholders, “it’s not only decisions by politicians” that will determine how much oil the U.S. produces.

The skepticism extended beyond the oil and gas executive suite.

“There is a recent media narrative that the second Trump administration will lead to a surge in U.S. oil production, with producers eager to drill and produce more when unincumbered [sic] by perceived Biden-era bureaucracy,” wrote Standard Chartered Bank Energy Analyst Emily Ashford in a post-election analysis. But U.S. oil production “has changed significantly since Trump first took office in 2017, and there are substantial barriers to rapid production increases within the time frame of a presidential term.”

Another take on that history is that, with U.S. production now at record levels, Trump can’t do much more because Biden has already given the industry pretty much everything it wants.

There are certainly steps Trump may try to take to boost the industry. But notwithstanding his campaign trail claims that U.S. oil production would have been “four, five times” higher if he had stayed in the White House after losing the 2020 election, Politico says oil companies “are already signaling they will pull back on drilling next year as crude oil prices sag.” They’re also “wary that Trump’s threatened tariffs will worsen trade tensions, driving up their costs and risking closing off foreign markets for their energy exports.”

Hazards Ahead for Canadian Oil

The global trends have Canadian politicians and analysts fretting that “three years of roaring oil prices” are coming to an end. “Both investors and companies have become used to these [high] prices,” Raoul LeBlanc vice-president at S&P Global Commodity Insights, told CBC in early November. “Whereas five years ago—let’s say 2017, 2018, and 2019—prices at $62 [a barrel] would have seemed fantastic, they don’t seem fantastic now.”

Echoing the analysis in the U.S., LeBlanc said the Canadian industry will still be expected to deliver strong returns to investors, even if it means cutting back on plans to increase production.

Around the same time, the Globe and Mail reports, University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe said Alberta will lose C$4.5 billion in its next fiscal year if oil prices stay at their present level, making future provincial deficits “a near certainty.”

The combination of rising population and falling oil prices had Premier Danielle Smith acknowledging her government might not be able to balance its budget after projecting a $2.6-billion surplus for 2025-26—and previously promising a personal income tax cut that would reduce provincial revenue by $1.4 billion.

“It is a serious problem,” she told media. “We have a number of different pressures coming our way. And we have to be honest with people about what we’re facing.”

Hadrian Mertins-Kirkwood, senior climate policy researcher at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said the Alberta oil sands could be uniquely vulnerable as global oil demand weakens.

“There is a real and growing possibility that demand for Canadian oil exports will fall sooner and faster than anticipated,” he wrote in a November 2024 special edition of CCPA’s ShiftStorm e-newsletter, “not only because of falling demand for oil in general, but specifically because the oil sands are among the costliest and most emissions intensive sources of oil in the world.”

Mertins-Kirkwood agreed with other analysts that Trump isn’t likely to deliver the dramatic production increase he’s been touting.

“You can claim ‘Drill, baby, drill!’ all you want, but that doesn’t change the long-term demand picture, which the oil companies are well aware of,” he told The Energy Mix in an email. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see an increase in new U.S. oil and gas investment under Trump, but it won’t be a dramatic change from business-as-usual for the industry.”

Either way, Mertins-Kirkwood sees serious jeopardy ahead for Alberta and Canada.

“Canada’s fossil fuel industry has assets currently worth half a trillion dollars, and those companies also hold hundreds of billions of dollars in debt. Any decline in production ahead of plan introduces a huge risk of stranded assets,” he wrote.

Even if countries fall short of their declared 2050 deadline to hit net-zero emissions, “We’re going to see a big risk of stranded assets in Canada within 20 years. Increased U.S. production doesn’t fundamentally change the picture, but it does increase the risk to Canada.”

It said global investment in “upstream” oil exploration and extraction activity was set to fall to its lowest level since 2017, with state-owned oil corporations in the Middle East and Asia accounting for a far larger share of the total and the major private oil companies cutting investment by about one-quarter.

Among the world’s 30 biggest upstream oil producers, dividends and stock buybacks exceeded [pdf] capital spending in 2022 and 2023, with investment in exploration and extraction falling from more than 75% in 2015 to less than 50% of the total.

The same IEA report showed the world investing nearly twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels.

Borrow Billions, Hand It All Over to Investors

Now, some of the world’s biggest fossil producers are facing down a new layer of risk: with oil demand collapsing, prices staying stubbornly low, and investors still laser focused on short-term returns, four of the world’s five oil “supermajors” saw fit to borrow $15 billion to fund share buybacks between July and September, Bloomberg reported in late October.

With their quarterly profits at their lowest since 2021, down by half from record highs in 2022 and by 12% from the previous quarter, analysts said colossal fossils ExxonMobil, Chevron, TotalÉnergies, and BP wouldn’t have enough cash on hand to cover the dividends and share buybacks their investors were demanding. While Exxon and Chevron had “plenty of room to borrow to fund buybacks,” Bloomberg wrote, “the European majors have higher debt levels, allowing less room to manoeuvre,” with BP posting the worst financial performance based on its ratio of debt to capital assets.

“Borrowing to buy back shares isn’t uncommon in the oil business,” Bloomberg explained. “but a dimming outlook for oil prices next year means the cash shortfall is apt to continue over the longer term,” while investors’ expectations for immediate returns continue.

Another Day, Another Debt

Going deeper into debt to hand money over to shareholders “could be a good use of cash while companies have reasonably strong balance sheets,” Kim Fustier, head of European oil and gas equity research at HSBC Plc, told the news agency. “The question is, ‘How sustainable will it be?’”

“While it is common for companies to borrow to maintain dividends during lean periods on the premise of a cyclical recovery, it is quite another thing to do the same when the decline is structural,” agreed Guy Prince, a senior analyst on Carbon Tracker’s oil, gas and mining team, in a December 2023 analysis tracking the financial decline of 40 different petrostates—particularly Saudi Arabia.

“Falling oil demand will have varying impacts on companies,” he wrote. “However, for Saudi Aramco, with its self-imposed production targets (to shore up prices) and fixed dividend payments to the Saudi government to fund its fiscal spend (they need $80 a barrel), it is particularly painful.”

Over a nine-month span in 2024, Aramco’s financial position “has moved from net cash of $27.4 billion to net debt of $8.9 billion,” Bloomberg energy and commodities columnist Javier Blas wrote on social media. “That means in 2024 Aramco has spent ~$130 million daily that it didn’t have.”

The overall financial picture points to a rather less aggressive picture of the next four years of fossil fuel development than Trump’s and the industry’s chatter about making “American Energy Great Again”, just months after U.S. crude production set an all-time record under Biden.

Low Oil Prices Mean Falling Profits

It’ll be that much harder for Big Oil to deliver on all the big talk as long as it’s caught between two converging trends: jittery investors and relatively low prices driven by faltering demand for oil.

“Oil consumption in China—the powerhouse of world markets for the past two decades—has contracted for six straight months through September, and will grow this year at just 10% of the rate seen in 2023,” Bloomberg reported in mid-November, citing IEA analysis. Consistent with other recent analysis, a senior IEA official said it was possible that China’s oil demand had already peaked.

The result: global oil consumption will still rise this year, but at less than half the rate of 2023. And crude oil prices fell 11% between early October and mid-November.

“It’s not just the economy and the shift, the slowdown in the construction sector,” the agency’s head of oil industry and markets, Toril Bosoni, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s the transition to electric vehicles, high speed rail, and gas in trucking that is undermining Chinese oil demand growth.”

That shaky picture of future demand had the U.S. Energy Information Administration rolling back its 2025 price projection for West Texas Intermediate crude oil—from an estimate of $79.63 per barrel last September to $73.13 in October and $69.12 in December. Falling prices will only erode profits and available funds that companies are already redirecting from exploration and production to shareholder returns.

Those same price dynamics had the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries and its petrostate allies (OPEC+) balancing an “unpalatable choice” between the mounting financial pain of restraining production and the risk that bringing new oil supplies online would just drive down prices farther and faster, Bloomberg wrote in late November. By mid-December, the cartel was “gradually conceding defeat”, the news agency said, slashing its estimates of future demand growth and bringing them closer to the IEA’s—which Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman had previously dismissed as “La La Land” for its recent emphasis on net-zero scenarios.

California-based Chevron also announced a $2-billion capital expenditure cut, its first since the COVID-19 pandemic, in early December, a decision the Financial Times placed in counterpoint to Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda. That left Exxon as a major outlier, with announced plans to increase production by nearly one-fifth and continue boosting capital spending through the end of this decade.

Oil Producers Tap the Brakes

But even Exxon is throwing cold water on Trump’s pledge to drill everything, everywhere, all at once.

“I think a radical change is unlikely because the vast majority, if not everybody, is primarily focused on the economics of what they’re doing,” the company’s Upstream President Liam Mallon told a conference audience in late November. If Trump follows through on plans to open up public lands in the U.S. to oil and gas production, “You would be able to drill more, assuming you have the quality and met your economic threshold,” he added. “But I don’t think we’re going to see anybody in the ‘Drill, baby, drill!’ mode. I really don’t.”

“Maybe he has a magic recipe to push them to drill like mad,” added TotalÉnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne. But with companies committed to returning cash to shareholders, “it’s not only decisions by politicians” that will determine how much oil the U.S. produces.

The skepticism extended beyond the oil and gas executive suite.

“There is a recent media narrative that the second Trump administration will lead to a surge in U.S. oil production, with producers eager to drill and produce more when unincumbered [sic] by perceived Biden-era bureaucracy,” wrote Standard Chartered Bank Energy Analyst Emily Ashford in a post-election analysis. But U.S. oil production “has changed significantly since Trump first took office in 2017, and there are substantial barriers to rapid production increases within the time frame of a presidential term.”

Another take on that history is that, with U.S. production now at record levels, Trump can’t do much more because Biden has already given the industry pretty much everything it wants.

There are certainly steps Trump may try to take to boost the industry. But notwithstanding his campaign trail claims that U.S. oil production would have been “four, five times” higher if he had stayed in the White House after losing the 2020 election, Politico says oil companies “are already signaling they will pull back on drilling next year as crude oil prices sag.” They’re also “wary that Trump’s threatened tariffs will worsen trade tensions, driving up their costs and risking closing off foreign markets for their energy exports.”

Hazards Ahead for Canadian Oil

The global trends have Canadian politicians and analysts fretting that “three years of roaring oil prices” are coming to an end. “Both investors and companies have become used to these [high] prices,” Raoul LeBlanc vice-president at S&P Global Commodity Insights, told CBC in early November. “Whereas five years ago—let’s say 2017, 2018, and 2019—prices at $62 [a barrel] would have seemed fantastic, they don’t seem fantastic now.”

Echoing the analysis in the U.S., LeBlanc said the Canadian industry will still be expected to deliver strong returns to investors, even if it means cutting back on plans to increase production.

Around the same time, the Globe and Mail reports, University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe said Alberta will lose C$4.5 billion in its next fiscal year if oil prices stay at their present level, making future provincial deficits “a near certainty.”

The combination of rising population and falling oil prices had Premier Danielle Smith acknowledging her government might not be able to balance its budget after projecting a $2.6-billion surplus for 2025-26—and previously promising a personal income tax cut that would reduce provincial revenue by $1.4 billion.

“It is a serious problem,” she told media. “We have a number of different pressures coming our way. And we have to be honest with people about what we’re facing.”

Hadrian Mertins-Kirkwood, senior climate policy researcher at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said the Alberta oil sands could be uniquely vulnerable as global oil demand weakens.

“There is a real and growing possibility that demand for Canadian oil exports will fall sooner and faster than anticipated,” he wrote in a November 2024 special edition of CCPA’s ShiftStorm e-newsletter, “not only because of falling demand for oil in general, but specifically because the oil sands are among the costliest and most emissions intensive sources of oil in the world.”

Mertins-Kirkwood agreed with other analysts that Trump isn’t likely to deliver the dramatic production increase he’s been touting.

“You can claim ‘Drill, baby, drill!’ all you want, but that doesn’t change the long-term demand picture, which the oil companies are well aware of,” he told The Energy Mix in an email. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see an increase in new U.S. oil and gas investment under Trump, but it won’t be a dramatic change from business-as-usual for the industry.”

Either way, Mertins-Kirkwood sees serious jeopardy ahead for Alberta and Canada.

“Canada’s fossil fuel industry has assets currently worth half a trillion dollars, and those companies also hold hundreds of billions of dollars in debt. Any decline in production ahead of plan introduces a huge risk of stranded assets,” he wrote.

Even if countries fall short of their declared 2050 deadline to hit net-zero emissions, “We’re going to see a big risk of stranded assets in Canada within 20 years. Increased U.S. production doesn’t fundamentally change the picture, but it does increase the risk to Canada.”",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trump-and-oil-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 11:01:35.109259

In the first nine months of 2025, global M&A activity was up 10 percent over what it was in the same period in 2024, despite the headwinds of geopolitical tensions and tariff policies that seemed to change every few weeks. The tech sector was especially busy with deal-making this year as companies looked to find a way to leverage the AI boom.

But some activity stood out from the rest. Here’s a look at the deals that made this year so unique.

Intel and the U.S. government

The Trump Administration surprised both the tech world and Wall Street in August, announcing that the federal government was taking a 10 percent stake in the chipmaker. (That was especially astonishing, as Trump had, just weeks before, strongly criticized Intel’s CEO on social media, saying he was “highly CONFLICTED and must resign.”)

The government picked up 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece, making it one of the company’s largest shareholders. The deal has already paid off, with the government’s stake now worth nearly $9 billion more than it paid for the stock.

Stargate

OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle, in January, jointly announced a massive AI data center project called “Stargate,” in which the companies plan to invest up to $500 billion over the coming years to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S.

Stargate, the companies said, will create 100,000 jobs. Plans were announced in September for five new AI data centers. Stargate will be set up as a separate company, which OpenAI said in a social media post “will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.”

OpenAI and Oracle

In September, OpenAI signed a contract with Oracle to purchase $300 billion in computing power over the next five years, one of the largest cloud contracts ever. The contact will begin in 2027, but it did draw some concern from some analysts, who noted the value of the deal was much greater than OpenAI’s current revenue and Oracle will need to take on substantial debt to build out the hardware and infrastructure for the project. News of the agreement sent Oracle stock up 43 percent when it was announced. (It has since lost all of those gains.)

Pepsi and Poppi

Founded in 2020, Poppi started as an experiment in Allison Ellsworth’s kitchen, an attempt to make gut-healthy drinks that tasted good. The probiotic soda quickly grew into a popular, nationally recognized brand during the pandemic, landing Poppi at No. 148 on this year’s Inc. 5000 list, with a three-year growth rate of 2,638 percent. In May, Ellsworth and her husband Stephen, who is also a co-founder, sold the company to Pepsi for $1.95 billion.

Prada and Versace

The news in April that Prada would buy Versace for $1.51 billion was the ending to a very long story. Prada began chasing the luxury fashion house during the pandemic, but the parties couldn’t make the deal work. When Versace parent Capri’s sale to Tapestry was scuttled due to antitrust concerns, Prada tried again and was able to negotiate a price that was lower than the $2 billion Capri paid for the brand in 2018. The acquisition closed earlier this month.

Dick’s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker

Dick’s Sporting Goods had a strong 2025, raising its full-year sales growth guidance last month to a range of 3.5 to 4 percent up from 2 to 3.5 percent previously. Its acquisition of struggling competitor Foot Locker in May for $2.4 billion gave it a competitive advantage in the Nike sneaker market as well as access to international markets and a wider customer base. Foot Locker will continue to operate as a standalone business, though Dick’s does plan to close an undisclosed number of stores to protect the company’s profits.

Sycamore Partners and Walgreens Boots Alliance

Private equity firm Sycamore’s $10 billion purchase of the pharmaceutical chain in March ended almost a century of Walgreens being a publicly traded company. Walgreens, at one point in time, boasted a market cap of nearly $100 billion, but changes to the healthcare industry, acquisitions of rivals and reduced margins on drug sales shrank that number precipitously. Sycamore has a history of buying distressed companies, with other holdings including Staples, Nine West and Talbots.

Keurig Dr Pepper and JDE Peets

Keurig Dr Pepper’s U.S. coffee business needed some help, so it made an $18 billion bet in August that the Dutch coffee and tea company could boost earnings. Keurig Dr Pepper owns Green Mountain Coffee (as well as Dr Pepper, 7Up and Snapple), which has seen sales decline in recent years. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, after which Keurig Dr Pepper will split its coffee and other beverage units into two separate companies, both of which will remain listed on U.S. stock exchanges.

The ChatGPT firm has announced it’s hiring a Head of Preparedness. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman said the position would work on mitigating the growing threat of AI being used aggressively by bad actors in the world of cybersecurity. He claimed we are now “seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.”

The CEO’s statements about LLMs posing growing risks to cyberdefenders are backed up by other firms in the industry. Last month, OpenAI rival Anthropic posted a report about how a Chinese state-sponsored group manipulated its Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration of “roughly thirty global targets,” including large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies, “without substantial human intervention.”

Altman called for candidates who “want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting-edge capabilities” while still “ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.” According to the job spec, other major risk areas the successful candidate is set to work on include “biosecurity.” In this context, biosecurity could mean advanced AI systems being used to design bioweapons, a risk more than 100 scientists from universities and organizations across the planet have warned about.

Whoever lands the new role will be expected to keep up with evolving AI risks, and oversee the company's ""preparedness framework as new risks, capabilities, or external expectations emerge.""

Though the compensation package on offer looks generous—north of $500k plus equity—it doesn’t look like a gig for the faint of heart. Altman said it is set to be “a stressful job” that will see the successful candidate “jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.”

There’s a good chance the CEO isn’t exaggerating when it comes to the position’s stress levels. Reports about burnout at the AI firm have been building for some time, as per reports from publications like Wired. Former technical team executives like Calvin French-Owen have posted first-hand accounts of a secretive, high-pressure environment, with a heavy emphasis on Twitter ""vibes"", alongside anecdotal reports of 12-hour days being plentiful on social media.

A home game against New Orleans on Jan. 7 might be the only one in which the Hawks are favored.
He finally staggered Young and Johnson to keep one on the court at all times, avoiding some of the bench unit disasters that have plagued the Hawks in previous losses.
It also offers more rest: Saturday was the Hawks’ league-leading 33rd game and they only have four back-to-backs after Jan. 3.","ATLANTA — The irony was hard to miss: The visiting coach in Atlanta Saturday night was New York’s Mike Brown, who was fired by Sacramento exactly one year ago to the day after his team lost a fifth consecutive home game.

Welp.

Quin Snyder’s seat hasn’t been rumored to be hot, but the Hawks lost their fifth straight home game and sixth straight overall on Saturday, 128-125 to the Knicks, as Nickeil Alexander-Walkers’s 3-point attempt rattled out just before the buzzer. That this losing streak has coincided with the return of Trae Young for the last four games — something that theoretically should make the Hawks significantly better — only adds to the local angst about this team.

Instead of moving up in the East hierarchy, as many expected at the start of the season, Atlanta is stuck in extremely familiar territory: jousting with the Heat and Bulls for positioning in the play-in tournament. This home losing streak began with two losses to Chicago, including one where the Hawks gave up a staggering 152 points. One way to prove you’re beyond playing your annual elimination game against the Bulls in April is to beat them in December.

Atlanta is now 15-18, in tenth place in the East, and the upcoming schedule offers few reprieves with games against the Thunder, Wolves and Knicks again. Eight of the next 10 games are on the road; eight of the next nine are against teams with winning records. A home game against New Orleans on Jan. 7 might be the only one in which the Hawks are favored. Yikes.

The Hawks haven’t always played badly in this stretch; they lost at the buzzer to a good Knicks team and were beaten by a phantom call in the second loss to the Bulls. The underlying stats still say they’re more an average team than a bad one — 16th in offense, 17th in defense, 18th in Net Rating.

But they also face-planted in a winnable, rested game against Miami and played no defense in the first loss to the Bulls. And more importantly, the expectations were for more this year after acquiring Kristaps Porziņģis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker in the offseason.

That said, the feeling internally after Saturday’s game was slightly different from what you might expect; Atlanta took encouragement after rallying from an 18-point deficit to briefly take the lead in the fourth quarter, coming on the heels of a team meeting after the moribund loss to Miami the night before.

“We had a real sit-down with the whole crew and said we need to be better,” said Alexander-Walker, “and I think you can feel it in the game, in the stretch where we were able to kind of stop the bleeding, we fought.”

“I was proud of how we competed,” said Snyder. “You would like to get a win because that’s affirming of how you played, but we did the things we need to do to be successful.”

“We told each other we need to be serious,” said Jalen Johnson. “A lot of guys spoke. I think it was a good sign.”

Snyder may have also finally landed on something that works rotationally after experimenting, mostly unsuccessfully, with his bench units for much of the year. He finally staggered Young and Johnson to keep one on the court at all times, avoiding some of the bench unit disasters that have plagued the Hawks in previous losses. Guards Keaton Wallace and Luke Kennard, who featured in some of the worst-performing units and have a minus-11.5 per 100 net rating as a two-man unit, combined for just eight total minutes over the last two nights.

“We had more urgency; we were more dialed in,” said Onyeka Okongwu of the Hawks’ rally. The 6-foot-8 center had 31 points and 14 rebounds despite giving up many inches.

“We need to challenge ourselves to play a whole game and not go through lapses.”

Alas, the Hawks face a size deficit every night without the 7-3 Porziņģis, whose POTS syndrome has him sidelined; he has only played 13 games this year. That and a season-ending injury to third center N’Faly Dante have left the Hawks bereft of size, an especially noticeable deficit against New York’s Karl-Anthony Towns and Mitchell Robinson. Atlanta is 27th in Rebound Rate, ahead of only Milwaukee, Sacramento and Washington, and their nightly Ls in the possession battle have made for a burdensome math problem.

The flip side of the Hawks’ tough upcoming schedule is that it gets Charmin soft starting in February, with a surfeit of Charlottes and Washingtons on the docket and only 10 road games after the All-Star break. It also offers more rest: Saturday was the Hawks’ league-leading 33rd game and they only have four back-to-backs after Jan. 3. But they may be down so bad by then that it won’t matter.

The tough schedule also raises the stakes for what might be next for this franchise, whether at the trade deadline or in the offseason. Atlanta has to make its deadline decisions without the benefit of seeing how many wins its soft late schedule might yield. Meanwhile, Young’s return has yet to impact the bottom line while perhaps detracting some from the electric Johnson, especially late in games. Young’s $49 million player option looms as a major hinge point for the offseason.

Both Johnson and Young have also been guilty of glaring defensive gaffes. Here’s Young standing at the free-throw line while Miami runs out for a lay-up in Friday’s fourth quarter:

Meanwhile, when Snyder lamented after the Miami game that the Hawks would stop a driver and then get beat on a back cut, it wasn’t hard to identify what play was on his mind. Here’s Johnson falling asleep on the weak side, something that’s happened way too often this year in what has otherwise been an All-Star-caliber campaign:

Porziņģis, of course, is another giant question mark. He’s an All-Star-caliber weapon when available, but on an expiring $31 million deal that could end up being an important trade chip at the deadline.

Atlanta still owes its first-round pick this year to San Antonio from the Dejounte Murray trade, so they have no incentive for a fire sale. But if this team can’t escape the gravitational field of the play-in tournament for a fifth consecutive season, it raises an important question for the front office as it tries to build around a young core, a likely high lottery pick from New Orleans or Milwaukee and … it remains to be seen what else.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/28003002/GettyImages-2252986226.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-28 08:58:23.038951

At the same time, the civil service has grown sharply, and chipmaker ASML has emerged as the fastest-growing private employer.

Defense employed 74,333 full-time equivalent positions at the end of last year, nearly 20 percent more than five years earlier. In the previous de Volkskrant survey, defense and the police were roughly equal at about 62,000 full-time jobs each. Police staffing has since risen by 5.5 percent to 64,618.

“The armed forces face the task of strengthening themselves at high speed,” a Defense Ministry spokesperson said. “It is therefore positive to see that there is a lot of interest in a job with defense.”

Ahold Delhaize ranks third overall and is the largest private employer, with about 97,000 workers in the Netherlands, equivalent to roughly 38,000 full-time jobs. That is 6,000 more than five years ago. The Ministry of Justice and Security follows with nearly 37,000 full-time positions, while Rabobank has about 31,000, a decline of roughly a quarter over five years.

Employment at ING and ABN Amro remained stable recently due to hiring for anti-money-laundering controls, but cuts are coming. ABN Amro has announced 5,200 job losses, nearly a quarter of its workforce. Pension administrator APG will cut 1,000 jobs, partly because artificial intelligence is taking over tasks in the financial sector.

The civil service expanded strongly, with central government employment rising from more than 125,000 full-time jobs in 2020 to over 157,000 last year. The Tax and Customs Administration employs more than 28,000 full-time workers, UWV nearly 20,000, and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management more than 16,000.

Industry employment continued to shrink at companies such as VDL and Philips, both below 9,000 full-time jobs, and at Tata Steel, which dropped below 10,000.

For others, it was a fitting conclusion to a year defined by circular upheaval: consolidation without clarity, innovation without confidence, and regulation without resolve.","With 2026 just days away, take a look at the major stories of 2025 - and their impact across the ad tech landscape…

Mergers old and new reshaped the agency landscape; regulators pushed back against the giants; and Google quietly admitted something few thought possible - that the cookie era might be here to stay after all.

Omnicom and IPG: The year’s defining merger

Last December’s news that Omnicom would acquire IPG sent shockwaves through Madison Avenue. The deal, worth an estimated USD$25bn, promised to create the world’s largest agency network - a marketing behemoth with combined billings dwarfing even WPP’s. Unsurprisingly, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stepped in, flagging concerns that the tie-up could limit competition across media buying, creative services, and data management.

For months, the transaction hovered in limbo. But a revised framework for “cross-stack ad competition” introduced midyear gave the merger new life. By late summer, the FTC cleared the deal, followed in December by unconditional approval from the European Commission. Almost immediately, Omnicom announced a sweeping restructure: 4,000 roles set to go before year-end as it moves to consolidate overlapping units and unify its data strategy under a single global platform.

Consolidation everywhere you look

The mergers kept coming. French-based Equativ sealed its long-discussed union with Sharethrough, forming one of the largest independent ad tech platforms outside the walled gardens. The combined group now boasts significant reach across CTV, programmatic, and supply optimisation.

Meanwhile, Publicis made headlines with its acquisition of Lotame. The move adds Lotame’s data reservoir - roughly 1.6 billion user profiles - to the Groupe’s increasingly ID-driven data stack. Publicis wasted no time folding those audience graphs into its Epsilon offering, pitching enhanced precision targeting just as fragmentation across identifiers reached new highs.

The battle for Warner Bros

In media, the year’s most extraordinary rumour mill centred on Warner Bros Discovery, which officially put itself up for sale. Both Netflix and Paramount Skydance made plays - and Netflix seemed to have the agreement in place. Paramount then lobbed in a USD$108.4bn hostile bid, aiming to outmuscle Netflix’s already massive USD$72bn offer. The board, though, recommended rejecting Paramount’s offer - but few expect this story to end before 2026.

TikTok survives again - with a new flag

Across the Atlantic, political drama continued to define TikTok’s fate. In September, a newly re-elected Donald Trump signed an executive order forcing Chinese parent company ByteDance to transfer US ownership to American investors. The move, framed as a national security measure, effectively prevented a TikTok shutdown in the States - and marked the culmination of a years-long tug of war over the app’s future.

ByteDance eventually reached a binding deal with groups including Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. If completed in early 2026, the agreement will create a separate joint venture for TikTok’s US business, finally putting the app’s legal limbo to rest - at least for now.

Google’s rough year in court

No year-in-review would be complete without Google’s legal woes, and 2025 delivered them in spades. The search giant faced a crushing verdict in April, when Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that it maintained two illegal monopolies across ad tech - one in publisher ad servers, another in exchange technology.

The decision unleashed fresh lawsuits from Magnite and PubMatic, both seeking damages for what they describe as years of exclusionary practices.

Yet the more draconian remedies - a forced breakup or Chrome divestiture - seem increasingly unlikely. Judge Amit Mehta spared the browser from sale in Google’s parallel search antitrust trial, and Brinkema has signalled similar hesitation in the ad tech case. Pending verdicts aside, the industry’s response has been pragmatic: frustration, but little shock. The perceived imbalance between regulators’ power and Big Tech’s legal muscle remains, for now, intact.

AI upends traffic and trust

While courts debated competition, the open web faced a different kind of existential challenge. As AI chatbots and search tools proliferated, referral traffic to publishers cratered. Appfigures and SimilarWeb both recorded steep double-digit declines in click-throughs to news sites across major markets, with much of that traffic diverted to AI-generated summaries.

Publishers responded with lawsuits, block lists, and pleas for licensing deals. Yet the scraping continued and 2025 became, by consensus, the year that open access content was effectively subsumed into large language model training data. One board member of the Independent Publishers Alliance estimated that Google’s new AI-powered search could push a third of its members into closure within a year.

What AI giveth in efficiency, it taketh away in discoverability.

The cookie that wouldn’t crumble

And finally, the year’s most unexpected twist: the third-party cookie lived to see another day. After half a decade of phased plans, pilot schemes, and developer summits, Google officially scrapped its deprecation timeline. Privacy Sandbox was quietly wound down, its core tools shuttered.

The decision, reportedly tied to both antitrust pressure and publisher backlash, sent shockwaves across the ecosystem. After years spent preparing for a “post-cookie world”, advertisers and platforms alike found themselves back where they started - albeit older, wiser, and more cynical about Google’s willingness to change its own rules.

For some, that retreat marked the end of an era. For others, it was a fitting conclusion to a year defined by circular upheaval: consolidation without clarity, innovation without confidence, and regulation without resolve.

Keep consumer launches and developer events separate Google's I/O and Apple's WWDC keep developer updates separate from their launch events, but they sometimes blur the line between the two.
So, for 2026, companies should totally keep the live demos.","In 2025, Google, Apple, Samsung, and everyone else who announced new tech products delivered beautifully curated keynotes that told us exactly what they wanted us to hear about the said devices.

I agree that Google went above and beyond this year for its Pixel 10 launch, delivering something that felt less like a Keynote and more like a massive production hosted by Jimmy Fallon. On the opposite end, Meta literally winged it with live demos of their new smart glasses. While the demos didn't go as planned, they stayed fairly realistic, which is what we, as consumers who pay a hefty price for electronics, would appreciate seeing.

If tech companies want launch events to matter in 2026, they need to stop giving us Keynotes that could have been emails or overcomplicating them to the point where we lose interest. Instead, they need to offer more clarity and a better understanding of how an average person seeking to buy a new anything will perceive and use these products.

Here's what I'd love to see change in 2026 — and what's worth keeping.

Give it to me straight — in plain English

Too often, companies end up explaining features the way they'd talk to engineers and not, well, us. We hear about ""tokens per second,"" model sizes, or how ""Siri now has a deeper understanding of your personal context.""

There's a ton of technical jargon, and not much about how those things show up in the real world. Launch events need to answer questions when explaining a new feature — It comes down to the basics: ""Why would I actually need it, when would I use it, and what problem would it solve?""

If I don't understand the practicality of a new feature and how it would help me in the real world, then what's the point of having some elaborate speech about it?

Take Google's Gemini, for instance: instead of telling me it's faster, smarter, and more ""multimodal,"" tell me whether Gemini can look at a photo I took and explain why it looks bad and how to fix it before I share it. Even Samsung and Apple end up using loads of jargon in their Keynotes.

Apple loves to show off those emotionally hitting polished stories — the Apple Watch saving a life, the iPhone shooting a fancy music video (with tons of extra gear, post-production edits, of course). Samsung often bombards viewers with so many features so quickly, with little guidance on which actually matter.

But they skip the messy part: regular people trying to use that same tech and ending up with a terrible photo, bad lighting, or just a picture that looks nothing like the ad. In 2026, I want to see companies balance those magical tales with what these features actually look like for a totally average user. Because great stories definitely make people care, but great explanations push people to buy the product.

Keep consumer launches and developer events separate

Google's I/O and Apple's WWDC keep developer updates separate from their launch events, but they sometimes blur the line between the two. For example, this year's I/O featured major product announcements, including the launch of Android 16, a demonstration of Gemini's multimodal capabilities, and a preview of a prototype of Google's XR glasses.

This mix at an event aimed just for developers is definitely cool. Google's probably trying to get more than just coders interested in I/O, but it's also leaving people confused about whether they should be glued to I/O or just watch the ""Made by Google"" for consumer-focused announcements. If you ask me, I'd say keep the two separate, don't overcomplicate it. That way, the audience knows what to expect at each event and won't miss anything of interest.

Keep the live demos — even if they fail

Both Google and Meta actually tried live demos in 2025, and sometimes, despite practicing it a zillion times before D-day, they don't go as planned. WiFi dropped, or connectivity lagged, leading to awkward pauses during a live show.

But that necessarily isn't failure. While people pick on these moments to criticize the company, make a ton of memes, they can also work to the company's favor. It showed us the reality that mistakes happen — especially with common issues like connectivity problems, and this to me comes across as more authentic and raw, rather than scripted videos.

It also gives companies a real-world moment to look at what works and what still needs work before a product reaches consumers.

So, for 2026, companies should totally keep the live demos. But they could try to swap out the celebrities for everyday people to make things more relevant for someone watching on their couch at home. You know, parents, students—those who don't care about the techy buzzwords but who will actually be using these cool new devices and features.

And just keep things simple, to the point, showing us how features will help normal people, rather than over-the-top shows with so much going on that people forget about it as soon as the show's over.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DyDo9YEbk6cWzp3Y9jRBvW-2560-80.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 12:13:32.249701

The Groq licensing agreement is a significant strategic move, reinforcing NVIDIA’s dominance in the AI inference market. By acquiring talent and access to Groq’s high-performance technology, NVIDIA is proactively neutralizing a potential competitor and widening its competitive moat.

NVIDIA will pay $20 billion to license Groq’s AI inference technology and hire key personnel.

The deal integrates Groq’s expertise in Language Processing Units (LPUs), enhancing NVDA’s capabilities.

This move is seen as a defensive strategy to address threats from specialized ASIC chip manufacturers.

But here is the interesting part. You are reading about this 1.0% move after it happened. The market has already priced in the news. To catch the next winner before the headlines, you need predictive signals, not notifications. High Quality Portfolio has flagged 5 new opportunities that haven not surged yet.

Trade Mechanics & Money Flow

Trade Mechanics: What Happened?

The trading mechanics on December 26th suggest a quiet, holiday-thinned market, with institutional players making targeted bets rather than a broad retail chase. The relatively low volume indicates a lack of aggressive, widespread participation, typical for the period between Christmas and New Year’s.

Trading volume was subdued at approximately 137-139 million shares, well below the daily average.

Options activity shows strong bullish sentiment, with significant open interest in calls at the $195 and $200 strike prices.

A large block trade of 26,000 calls expiring in September 2025 suggests institutional conviction in long-term upside.

How Is The Money Flowing?

The footprint of this move appears to be primarily institutional. The subdued volume combined with large, strategic options trades points towards smart money positioning for future growth rather than a retail-driven frenzy.

The quiet nature of the 1.0% move on low volume is characteristic of institutional accumulation.

Retail participation was noted, but the significant block trades in the options market indicate a larger institutional hand.

The stock closed near the psychologically important $190 level, setting up a potential test of higher resistance.

What Next?

FOLLOW. The next key level to watch is $200. This is not just a psychological barrier but also where a significant cluster of call option open interest resides. A decisive break above this level, particularly on increasing volume, would signal a continuation of the uptrend, likely forcing options market makers to hedge their positions and potentially creating a gamma squeeze that could accelerate the move higher.

I mean, was it because okay, Uncle Sam's going to get a taste, Brennan? Is it because Trump thinks, hey, for now at least Xi has leverage when it comes to where Earth? What's the reasoning there, do you think?

I think President Trump, you know, his his, he's not a career politician. He's he's been a business person and I I think he looks to corporate leaders as almost like a a shadow cabinet where I think he he wants to meet and and hear the views of if it's Tim Cook or Jensen Wong or, you know, you know, other corporate leaders, you know, as we've seen earlier this year that, you know, after the CEOs of Walmart and Target and Home Depot met with him, you know, the tariffs were kind of de-escalated.

You know, there's no mode to, um, a lot of these large language models in China where where the revenue is coming in is going to be on the cloud computing and that's where an Alibaba, 10 cent and Baidu, uh, really are going to be the main beneficiaries of AI via cloud computing.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1dIwZ9umUKkeBR05qYJyaQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/579bb7b0-e04a-11f0-b77f-6fbac1b262c8,N,,2025-12-28 05:58:47.894969

A major winter storm, Storm Devin, hit many parts of the Northeast and Midwest immediately after Christmas, leading to thousands of cancellations nationwide — although many U.S. airlines reacted to the storm in the best way possible for passengers.

Meanwhile, on Friday, December 26, American Airlines was forced to cancel 109 flights, one of the highest numbers of cancellations, according to FlightAware. This was in part due to its high number of departures compared to other carriers.

American Airlines has since issued a press release announcing a new flight schedule for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), which will provide “greater resilience and less adverse impact” in the event of bad weather. Here's a closer look at this new plan and how it will affect passengers.

American Airlines Reacts To 109 Cancellations With A New Flight Schedule

On Friday, December 26, American Airlines announced significant changes at its largest and busiest hub, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The carrier plans to invest millions of dollars to offer a smoother airport experience, enhance connections for travelers on layovers, and improve resilience in case of weather disruptions.

For years, American Airlines’ schedule at its Dallas hub has been divided into nine banks, a term referring to a group of flights operating roughly at the same time. Beginning in April, the airline will introduce a 13-bank structure, adding new time options. Changes to the schedule will become visible today, Saturday, December 27.

What does this mean for passengers?

American Airlines customers will be able to choose from more departures during ""highly desired"" time windows, as well as fewer early-morning flights. According to the carrier, this is ""especially good news for customers making morning connections through DFW.""

These changes will also help the airline recover better when bad weather hits.

“No other airline recovers from bad weather and irregular operations better than American, and the airline has demonstrated that time and time again,"" the company's press release states.

Now, the airline has stated that its new schedule structure will ensure it will ""recover even quicker and get customers on their way as soon as the weather clears."" American Airlines is also investing millions of dollars in remote deplaning capability, which will help the carrier divert fewer flights away from DFW.

American Airlines Canceled 3% Of Its Flights On Boxing Day

On Boxing Day, Friday, December 26, New York, along with many parts of the Northeast and Midwest, was hit by a heavy winter storm, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations. According to the latest advisory from the National Weather Service, published at 5:20 a.m. EST on Saturday, December 27, a winter storm warning will remain in effect until 10 a.m.

Delta Air Lines was the U.S. carrier with the most cancellations on Friday, with 254 flights canceled, representing about 7% of its scheduled departures for the day. JetBlue followed it with 232 cancellations, representing 23% of its total flights.

American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest only had to cancel 3% of their scheduled departures. The airports that were hit hardest were John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), which reported 159 and 107 cancellations, respectively.

At the moment, it seems that travel disruptions will continue today. Flight Radar reports 131 cancellations at JFK, 85 at La Guardia Airport (LGA), and 70 at Newark Liberty (EWR). For now, American Airlines has been forced to cancel 1% of its departures, for a total of 57 flights, while JetBlue is at the top with 159 cancellations. However, American, along with United Airlines and JetBlue, have responded in kind to passengers amid all the Storm Devin cancellations; the three told Reuters they have waived change and re-booking fees.

According to American Airlines’ press release, bad weather is a serious issue for the carrier, especially at DFW, where thunderstorms have recently forced the entire airport to pause. Apart from the new flight schedule at DFW, the carrier is also investing in a better airport experience for its customers and smoother connections.

American Airlines Is Focusing On Better Connections And Airport Experience

Apart from the new schedule, American Airlines has also announced a few other changes to make connections easier and improve the airport experience for travelers. The new schedule is now reducing extremely short layovers, leading to a less stressful travel experience.

In addition, the company launched an AI tool at DFW Airport in May 2025. This helps connecting passengers get to their second flight by ensuring pilots wait for them in case of delays, when possible. The company has recently announced it will now use this technology in five additional airports.

The press release also reminded passengers that American Airlines is investing in several projects at DFW airport. These include modernizing its airport facilities and adding extra piers, resulting in 31 new gates by 2030.

While American Airlines claims to be the best U.S. carrier at handling flight disruptions caused by bad weather, on December 27, it reported the same cancellation rate as United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Only time will tell whether this new schedule will make a real difference.",https://static0.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2233806869-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-28 04:57:54.001434

Ethiopian Airlines has marked a significant milestone by completing Africa’s first full strip-and-paint process on its Airbus A350-900 fleet, setting a new standard in aircraft maintenance on the continent. This achievement highlights the airline’s advanced maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) capabilities, reinforcing its leadership in operational efficiency and fleet durability.

Advancing Maintenance Capabilities

The full strip-and-paint procedure involves the meticulous removal of all existing paint layers, followed by a comprehensive repainting of the aircraft. This complex process is essential for preserving the structural integrity of the aircraft, enhancing its aesthetic appeal, and improving fuel efficiency by reducing aerodynamic drag. By investing in the necessary technology and infrastructure to perform such high-level maintenance internally, Ethiopian Airlines has significantly reduced its dependence on external service providers, thereby strengthening its competitive position within the aviation sector.

The airline’s technical team ensured that the process adhered to stringent international standards, underscoring Ethiopian Airlines’ unwavering commitment to safety and operational excellence. The Airbus A350-900, renowned for its fuel efficiency and cutting-edge technology, forms a critical component of the airline’s long-haul fleet. Maintaining these aircraft in optimal condition is vital to delivering a safe and comfortable experience for passengers.

Industry Context and Strategic Implications

This development occurs amid heightened industry scrutiny over quality and software issues affecting Airbus’s A320 family. While Ethiopian Airlines’ current focus remains on the A350-900, the broader concerns surrounding Airbus products may prompt competitors and regulators to intensify their examination of fleet maintenance practices. Such scrutiny could influence investor confidence, as apprehensions about potential operational disruptions and the impact on Airbus’s reputation may affect purchasing decisions and fleet management strategies across the global aviation industry.

Ethiopian Airlines’ successful execution of the full strip-and-paint process on both its Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-900 fleets places it among a select group of global carriers capable of conducting such advanced maintenance in-house. This strategic initiative aligns with the airline’s broader vision to expand its MRO capabilities, fostering greater self-sufficiency and resilience in an increasingly competitive market.

As Ethiopian Airlines continues to set new benchmarks in African aviation, its dedication to technical excellence and fleet reliability establishes a standard that resonates beyond the continent, influencing the global aviation landscape.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/3b2e79b53e074917bcb698077a8f77cb.avif,N,,2025-12-28 04:57:47.394202

The last week of December is infamously known for a spike in returns, with one out of every eight returns in the 2024 holiday season taking place between Dec. 26 and Dec. 31, according to Adobe Analytics. This year, the trend is expected to continue.

Between Dec. 26 and Dec. 31, returns are expected to rise by 25% to 35% compared with returns between Nov. 1 and Dec. 12, Adobe said, and it expects returns to remain elevated through the first two weeks of January, up 8% to 15%.

According to a report from the National Retail Federation, about 19% of online sales are expected to be returned in 2025.

But as shoppers head back to stores, they may find that some stores charge fees for returns.

Gift returns: Can I return items for free?

Most retailers, such as Amazon, Target and Walmart, have free returns for most items. For the holiday season, many of these retailers have an extended return window that expires in January.

Nordstrom and other department stores also do free returns, especially when done in person.

Return policies have gotten much tighter in recent years, with Marshalls and T.J. Maxx charging a fee for returns not made in person. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, owned by TJX, charge a $11.99 fee for mail returns.

Clothing stores such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Urban Outfitters, Zara and others charge a fee, ranging from around $5 to $7, for items returned by mail.

JCPenney charges an $8 fee for online returns by mail. Macy's waives its online return fee for Star Rewards members. For non-members, a $9.99 return shipping fee plus tax, where applicable, will be deducted from the refund.

Why it matters: Social media has been full of questions about what the unusual arrangement means for Groq employees — both those heading to Nvidia and those staying put.

Catch up quick: Groq and Nvidia on Wednesday announced a ""non-exclusive licensing agreement,"" with media reports accurately pegging the deal value at around $20 billion.

The companies said that Groq CEO Jonathan Ross and president Sunny Madra would join Nvidia, while Groq would continue to operate as a standalone company led by new CEO Simon Edwards (who had been CFO).

It's an unusual structure, but the latest in a recent spate of Big AI deals that seem designed to avoid tripping antitrust wires.

Behind the scenes: Most Groq shareholders will receive per-share distributions tied to the $20 billion valuation, according to sources.

Around 85% will be paid up-front, while another 10% is paid midyear 2026 and the remainder at the end of 2026.

Around 90% of Groq employees are said to be joining Nvidia, and they will be paid cash for all vested shares. Their unvested shares will be paid out at the $20 billion valuation, but via Nvidia stock that vests on a schedule.

There are also around 50 members of that group whose entire stock packages are being accelerated and paid out in cash.

Remaining Groq employees will also be paid for vested shares, plus will receive a package that includes economic participation in the ongoing company.

Any Groq employee — staying or leaving — with the company for less than one year will have their vesting cliff dropped, so they can get some up-front liquidity.

By the numbers: Groq had raised around $3.3 billion in venture capital funding since its 2016 founding, including a $750 million infusion this past fall at nearly a $7 billion post-money valuation.

Backers include Social Capital, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, Samsung, 1789 Capital, Cisco, D1, Cleo Capital, Altimeter, Firestreak Ventures, Conversion Capital and Modi Venture.

The company has never done a secondary tender for either employees or investors.
