Conclusion Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS is a high-stakes bet on the future of BPO.

By merging WNS’s domain-specific operational expertise with Capgemini’s AI and cloud capabilities, the deal aims to create a global leader in Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations [1]. This strategic pivot from traditional labor-centric BPO to AI-driven value creation is not just a corporate maneuver but a response to a broader industry shift.

Strategic Rationale: From Cost-Cutting to AI-First Value

The acquisition’s core logic lies in leveraging WNS’s Kipi.ai platform and Capgemini’s consulting prowess to deliver end-to-end intelligent operations. This integration is expected to unlock $100–140 million in annual revenue synergies and $50–70 million in cost savings by 2027, driving 4% normalized EPS accretion in 2026 and 7% in 2027 [2]. The combined entity’s focus on Agentic AI—systems capable of autonomous decision-making—positions it to address client demands for outcome-based solutions, moving beyond mere cost reduction [3].

Financial Implications and Shareholder Value

While the $76.50-per-share cash offer for WNS was met with a 14% stock price surge, reflecting investor optimism [6], the deal’s financial viability remains under scrutiny. Critics argue the premium paid may not fully justify WNS’s long-term value, with a class-action investigation probing potential board negligence [4]. However, Capgemini’s post-earnings stock rally—despite a Q2 2025 EPS miss—suggests market confidence in its AI and cloud strategies [5]. The projected EPS accretion and synergies, if realized, could validate the acquisition as a catalyst for sustained shareholder value.

Industry Impact: The End of Traditional BPO?

The Capgemini-WNS deal signals a paradigm shift in the BPO sector. Forrester analysts note that clients are increasingly prioritizing AI-first solutions, demanding partners that can enhance business outcomes rather than just cut costs [3]. This trend aligns with the Agentic AI market’s projected growth to $24.5 billion by 2030 [4], underscoring the urgency for BPO providers to innovate. Capgemini’s global footprint in high-growth regions like North America and Asia-Pacific further amplifies its competitive edge [1].

Risks and Realities

Despite the strategic clarity, challenges persist. Integration of WNS’s operations into Capgemini’s ecosystem will require seamless cultural and technological alignment. Regulatory hurdles, though largely cleared, remain a wildcard. Moreover, the legal scrutiny of the deal’s fairness could dampen investor sentiment if unresolved.

Conclusion

Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS is a high-stakes bet on the future of BPO. By anchoring its strategy in Agentic AI and intelligent operations, the combined entity aims to redefine the sector’s value proposition. While financial risks and integration complexities linger, the deal’s potential to drive EPS growth and industry transformation makes it a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI-driven business services.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 06:03:35.999099

Colgate-Palmolive has outlined a clear approach to sustainability, social impact and environmental targets across its 2024 Sustainability and Social Impact Report.

With a footprint in over 70 countries and a portfolio of mass-market goods, the company places its manufacturing responsibilities at the centre of its climate and ESG strategies.

Its programme is structured around three core pillars: supporting communities, reaching homes globally and reducing environmental harm.

Strategy embedded across manufacturing and supply chain operations

Colgate-Palmolive manages ESG risks through its Enterprise Risk Management framework.

This process identifies climate transition and plastic transition as critical issues within its global operations. However, it notes that these risks also provide opportunities to create new industrial solutions, enhance reputation and reinforce compliance with responsible business expectations.

The company has established a cross-functional ESG Reporting Task Force. This internal group ensures Colgate’s data and policies align with current and incoming ESG disclosure requirements.

The structure supports real-time alignment between investor, customer and regulatory expectations and the company’s operational priorities.

Materiality assessments shape Colgate’s approach, ensuring its business goals reflect stakeholder input.

Across operations, sustainability is embedded in risk management protocols, procurement procedures and product innovation cycles.

Metrics are tracked using widely accepted sustainability frameworks, including progress against 14 of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Ann Tracy, Colgate-Palmolive’s Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “Our sustainability efforts also help to strengthen our business. We believe that some consumers favour brands from companies that act responsibly and will recognise our leadership in this space and choose our brands.

“We are proud of our progress so far, but there is more work to be done. We strive to be better for the people who use our products and drive value throughout our business. Getting this principle right will result in reducing our impact on the planet.”

Materials, emissions and process targets

The report highlights targeted achievements across Colgate’s packaging, energy and resource programmes.

One of the centrepieces of its industrial sustainability approach is packaging. The company manufactures a recyclable toothpaste tube, now used across more than 70 global markets.

In North America, 95% of tubes are converted to recyclable formats and, by the end of 2024, 93% of Colgate’s packaging was recyclable, reusable or compostable.

Material sourcing has also evolved, with virgin plastic reduced by 25% from a 2019 baseline. At the same time, 21% of packaging content in 2024 was made from post-consumer recycled materials.

These actions align with 2025 targets set through the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Global Plastics Commitment, which includes:

A one-third reduction in virgin plastic usage

25% post-consumer recycled plastic content in packaging

Elimination of problematic or unnecessary packaging

The company continues to secure renewable energy agreements, aligning with a net zero carbon emissions goal set for 2040.

It is also addressing the physical and transitional climate risks across its factories, warehouses and distribution systems. Strategic alliances with the U.S. Plastics Pact, The Recycling Partnership and startups have also supported operational improvements across waste and emissions performance.

This work supports Colgate’s broader framework which includes efficient design, responsible sourcing and promoting circular manufacturing systems. The business continues to encourage internal and external behavioural change to reduce its environmental footprint across product lifecycles.

2030 and 2040 environmental goals

Colgate has confirmed two major climate targets across the next 15 years.

By 2030:

Move from annually sourcing 35% renewable electricity in 2020 to 100%

Cut Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Purchased Goods and Services by 42% against 2020 levels

Reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in operations by 42% from 2020

By 2040:

Reach net zero carbon emissions across its entire value chain, excluding optional Scope 3 categories per the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net Zero Standard

Cut Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% from a 2020 baseline, excluding Scope 3 categories 9, 11 and 12 and optional emissions per SBTi Net Zero Standard

Ann wrote on LinkedIn: “At Colgate-Palmolive, we're committed to reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We are driving social impact, helping millions of homes and preserving our environment.”

Supply chain systems and external partnerships

Colgate targets sustainable sourcing through its raw material suppliers, with a particular focus on palm oil and soy.

The company uses certified material streams, satellite-based geospatial monitoring and supplier engagement programmes to ensure ethical, transparent sourcing. The aim is to build a conversion- and deforestation-free supply chain while improving resilience across its sourcing network.

Water stewardship is another area of focus, supported through Colgate’s involvement in the CDP Water Supply Chain Program and localised outreach such as webinars in water-stressed areas.

To this end, the company promotes best practice in water risk management among its suppliers, ensuring downstream accountability.

Human rights initiatives run alongside environmental goals. Colgate partners with the Fair Labor Association to enhance labour standards and enforce responsible recruitment practices in its Malaysian palm oil supply.

It is also a member of industry alliances like the Forest Positive Coalition and prioritises recycled content in pulp and paper purchasing to lessen environmental impact.

These actions embed ESG into the company's procurement processes and manufacturing footprint, providing both risk mitigation and improved economic resilience for supplier communities.

TLG India, the Indian arm of French advertising giant Publicis Groupe, also alleged that during the Search and Seizure, legal counsels of Publicis were not allowed to interact with any of its employees or with CCI officials present during the raids.

The petition states, ""It is clarified that during the Search and Seizure at the premises of the Petitioner, CCI officials specifically sought presence of Anupriya Acharya and she was the focus of the Search and Seizure.""

Counsel for Publicis was also not allowed access to any document, rather, CCI officials during the Search and Seizure refused to speak to the counsel of the Petitioner or provide any information or details pertaining to the investigation.

The petition (seen by Storyboard18) states, ""If the counsel for the Petitioner were granted access to the CMM Warrant during the Search and Seizure, it would have pointed out the apparent mistake that there is no enterprise identified for the purpose of the investigation in Suo Motu Case No. 02 of 2024 as far as it identified the “Publicis Groupe” and not a legal entity/ person registered in India.""

The petition further contends that “Publicis Groupe” is neither a juristic person nor an “enterprise” under Section 2(h) of the Competition Act, 2002, and therefore cannot be subjected to investigation. TLG India has maintained that it is the correct legal entity that should have been named in the proceedings.

According to the petition, CCI officials prevented Publicis’ legal counsel from interacting with employees, accessing documents, or even reviewing the court warrant during the raid. The petitioner alleged that this denial of access prevented counsel from pointing out what it called a “fundamental error” in the CCI’s warrant, which named “Publicis Groupe” instead of a legally registered entity in India.

The petition comes against the backdrop of the CCI’s sweeping March 2025 probe into alleged cartelization and price-fixing in India’s advertising sector. The investigation has triggered dawn raids on several major advertising conglomerates including Publicis, WPP’s GroupM, Dentsu, Omnicom, Havas, Madison, IPG, and extended scrutiny to key industry bodies such as the Advertising Agencies Association of India (AAAI), the Indian Society of Advertisers (ISA), and the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF).

Publicis has become the first advertising major to formally challenge the regulator’s procedure in court. In July 2025, it urged the CCI to pause its probe until the company was allowed to review case documents, but the regulator pressed ahead, issuing summons to the company’s South Asia leadership and seeking details of contracts, revenue-sharing agreements, and other records.

In response to the petition, the Delhi High Court has issued notice to the CCI, asking the regulator to file its reply within two weeks. The matter is scheduled for further hearing on October 9, 2025, with the court directing that a copy of the prima facie opinion passed by the regulator in Suo Motu Case No. 2 of 2024 also be placed on record.

By merging WNS’s expertise in digital business process services (BPS) with Capgemini’s consulting and technology capabilities, the transaction positions the combined entity as a global leader in Agentic AI-powered solutions. This strategic move is not merely a consolidation of scale but a calculated bet on the future of enterprise AI, where automation, predictive analytics, and human-AI collaboration redefine operational efficiency and client value.

Strategic Rationale: Bridging BPS and AI Innovation

The acquisition’s core rationale lies in aligning WNS’s sector-specific BPS capabilities with Capgemini’s AI-driven consulting framework. WNS’s Digital BPS business, which generated $1.27 billion in FY2025 revenue, provides a platform for Capgemini to deploy its Resonance AI Framework—a three-pillar strategy encompassing AI Essentials (ACCESS), AI Readiness (ADAPT), and Human-AI Chemistry (ADOPT) [1]. For instance, WNS’s healthcare-focused solutions like Claims Trac and Subrogation-as-a-Service demonstrate its deep vertical expertise, which Capgemini can now augment with AI tools to deliver hyper-personalized services [2]. Similarly, in finance, the integration of WNS’s fraud detection platforms with Capgemini’s consulting expertise enables end-to-end workflow optimization, a critical differentiator in an industry demanding agility and compliance [3].

The acquisition also strengthens Capgemini’s presence in high-growth markets. WNS’s strong client base in North America and Asia-Pacific, coupled with its 18.7% operating margin in 2025 (compared to Capgemini’s 13.6%), signals immediate profitability accretion [4]. This financial synergy is further amplified by WNS’s recent acquisition of Kipi.ai, a generative AI platform for customer service, which enhances data modernization and analytics capabilities [5].

Synergy Realization: Financial and Operational Metrics

The transaction’s value creation is underpinned by ambitious synergy targets. Capgemini projects $100–140 million in annual revenue synergies and $50–70 million in cost savings by 2027, translating to 4% normalized EPS accretion in 2026 and 7% by 2027 [1]. These figures are not speculative but rooted in cross-selling opportunities. For example, WNS’s AI-driven platforms can be integrated into Capgemini’s Resonance AI Framework to deliver autonomous business processes, such as predictive maintenance in manufacturing or real-time claims processing in healthcare [2].

This deal, which includes a 28% premium to WNS’s 90-day average share price, underscores the growing demand for intelligent automation and the financial potential of M&A-driven synergies in a rapidly evolving market [1].

M&A-Driven Value Creation: A Win-Win for Capgemini and WNS

The acquisition combines Capgemini’s global consulting and technology expertise with WNS’s deep domain knowledge in digital business process services (BPS). WNS, a leader in Digital BPS with $1.2 billion in 2025 revenue and an 18.7% operating margin, brings a proven track record of scalability and profitability [1]. For Capgemini, this move accelerates its growth in the U.S. market, where WNS has a strong client base including United Airlines and M&T Bank [2].

Financially, the deal is projected to deliver immediate value. Capgemini anticipates normalized EPS accretion of 4% in 2026 and 7% in 2027, driven by $100–140 million in annual revenue synergies and $50–70 million in cost synergies by 2027 [4]. These figures highlight the power of M&A to unlock cross-selling opportunities and operational efficiencies, particularly in high-margin sectors like AI-driven BPO.

AI-Enabled Digital Transformation: The New BPO Paradigm

The strategic rationale extends beyond financial metrics. By integrating WNS’s recent acquisition of Kipi.ai—specializing in data engineering and analytics—Capgemini is embedding AI at the core of business operations. This shift from traditional BPO to “Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations” aligns with a broader industry trend of automating repetitive tasks and reimagining workflows for autonomy and efficiency [3].

The combined entity now offers end-to-end solutions that leverage AI to deliver superior business outcomes. For example, WNS’s AI capabilities, paired with Capgemini’s consulting prowess, enable clients to transition from cost-cutting to value creation through predictive analytics and real-time decision-making [5]. This transformation is not just about technology but about redefining enterprise operating models for the AI era.

Geographic and Market Expansion: A Global Footprint

Geographically, the acquisition strengthens Capgemini’s presence in North America and high-growth Asia Pacific markets, where WNS has a significant footprint. This expansion is critical as enterprises in these regions increasingly prioritize localized, AI-driven solutions to stay competitive [2]. The combined entity now serves over 700 clients, including industry giants like Aviva, creating a platform for sustained revenue growth.

Conclusion: A Strategic Win for Investors

Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS is a masterclass in M&A-driven value creation.

WORKERS at an insulating oil supplier in northwest England have ended a fortnight-long strike after agreeing a pay deal with Electrical Oil Services, ending the threat of shortages of a critical component needed to run the power grid.

Eight plant operators at the site in Ellesmere Port had been picketing for the second week in a row before the Unite trade union today secured a 3% pay increase. The pay deal will include backdated payments to January and will be followed by a further 1% increase from September.

Insulating oil is a critical component of the electricity grid as it is used as an insulator and coolant for transformers. Electrical Oil Services (EOS) sent a letter to customers last week warning them of “unforeseen supply disruption that may impact our ability to deliver on schedule”. TCE understands that Electrical Oil Services’ (EOS) most significant customers are National Grid and Scottish Power Electricity Networks, who operate transformers in northwest England, North Wales and the midlands, covering the regions closest to Ellesmere Port. Unite regional officer Andrew Johnson warned yesterday that insulating oil shortages would have been “bound to get worse” the longer industrial action lasted.

The Energy Networks Association, which represents network operators across the UK and Ireland, told TCE that throughout the strike period there was no disruption to the normal operation of the grid and that operators had contingency plans in place to deal with supply issues.

EOS said in a statement yesterday that network operators had “multiple sourcing options”, adding: “While the supply chain for recycled transformer oil is affected, EOS customers continue to be served reliably”. EOS, owned by refiner Haltermann Carless, supplies both regenerated and unused insulating oil, which is used to immerse the copper windings and cores of transformers to dissipate waste heat. It prevents oxidation in the cellulose-based insulators wrapped around the electrical conductors in the transformer. Insulating oil is a high quality electrical insulator but the buildup of contamination and moisture degrades its performance over time.

The importance of maintaining oil quality in transformers was brought into focus after a substation in West London caught fire leading to the temporary closure of Heathrow Airport in March this year. An investigation by the National Energy System Operator in June concluded the fire was most likely caused by moisture entering a bushing in the transformer which caused it to short circuit, creating sparks that ignited the surrounding insulating oil.

CVS Pharmacy will not provide the updated 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccines at locations in several states without a prescription, the company confirmed Friday. In a statement, CVS Health said it expects to receive shipments of the newly authorized vaccines in the coming days but will begin offering them only in states where it is allowed under current regulations.

""Based on the current regulatory environment, CVS Pharmacy is offering FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccinations"" in 34 states, the company said.

In 13 states and Washington, D.C., patients may still receive the updated vaccines but only if they obtain a prescription from an authorized prescriber. Those states are Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia.

CVS said it cannot currently offer the vaccines at all in Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico.

Walgreens, the nation's other major pharmacy chain, is implementing similar restrictions. According to The New York Times, Walgreens requires prescriptions in 16 states, though the specific states differ somewhat from CVS's list. The Times reported that Walgreens appears to require prescriptions in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Washington state, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

The shifting requirements have created widespread confusion about where Americans can access the shots, with the two largest pharmacy chains in the country navigating what legal experts describe as an extremely difficult regulatory environment.

COVID-19 vaccines remain widely recommended by health officials, especially for older adults and people with underlying conditions.

The announcement comes amid broader uncertainty about vaccine policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long criticized COVID-19 vaccines. In June, Kennedy fired every member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the body that makes binding recommendations concerning vaccine coverage and use.

Several states require pharmacists to provide immunizations in accordance with ACIP guidance. The committee has not yet met to recommend the updated vaccines, creating a legal gray area for pharmacy chains.

Legal experts said federal decisions are creating confusion for pharmacies to navigate. The biggest problem is that in some states, law prohibits pharmacists from administering vaccines that are not recommended by ACIP.

As of Thursday, the panel was not scheduled to meet for another three weeks. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chairman of the Senate's health committee, has called for the meeting to be ""indefinitely"" postponed, which could mean many people's access to shots will remain limited well into the fall.

A CVS spokesperson said the list of states where vaccines are available could change, depending on regulatory updates.

""We'll administer FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines in states where legally permitted at CVS Pharmacy and/or MinuteClinic to meet our patients' needs,"" the company said.

CVS will make the vaccines readily available nationwide if the advisory panel recommends them, according to a company spokesperson. In the 34 states where the company has not set limits, people can check a box when making an appointment online to attest that they meet FDA criteria, without a prescription or other documentation.

A vast majority of shots were given at pharmacies last year. The new restrictions signal that federal decisions could reduce access more than the limitations outlined on paper, as not everyone has access to a doctor to obtain a prescription.

COVID vaccination rates have fallen precipitously since the height of the pandemic. Just 23 percent of adults and 13 percent of children reported getting an updated COVID vaccine last season, according to The New York Times.

The fact that pharmacies are limiting access to vaccines when COVID infections are rising, as they do every summer, is ""really unconscionable,"" Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told The New York Times.",https://media.wusa9.com/assets/CCT/images/f1c5376a-992c-4cbc-9105-c18a424eb56a/20250819T202210/f1c5376a-992c-4cbc-9105-c18a424eb56a_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 01:02:55.886020

“The lab of the future will be a combined human and machine effort requiring new expertise and data stewards.","The field of drug discovery is inherently complex and plagued by high costs, long development times and high rates of failure. Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation have emerged as transformative tools to help tackle these challenges.

The pharmaceutical industry is embracing these technologies and rapidly advancing towards the lab of the future, with companies such as Sanofi, Formation Bio and OpenAI collaborating on AI-powered software to help accelerate drug development.

“There has recently been, in almost every large pharma company, strategic investments towards the lab of the future, which is really an automated digital lab,” Dr. Hansjoerg Haas, senior director and general manager of laboratory automation at Thermo Fisher Scientific, previously told Technology Networks. “The goal is to create fully connected end-to-end workflows that provide real-time, remote data access, advanced analytics capabilities and facilitated decision-making.”

The lab of the future is a transformation of current laboratories, which often have disparate, unoptimized operations and data, into highly efficient, intelligent and effective spaces. “The concept of the lab of the future isn’t new – we’ve been talking about it for 15 years. In many ways, those labs are already here,” said Lars Kristiansen, vice president of product innovation and strategy at Molecular Devices. “What’s changed is the convergence of technologies that were once siloed. Today, we’re enabling researchers to explore complex biology in ways that weren’t feasible a decade ago, layering in automation, AI and machine learning to create intelligent, adaptive systems. These capabilities are now embedded in critical workflows – especially in areas like human-relevant models – where speed, precision and insight are essential. It’s not just about futuristic labs anymore; it’s about how we’re reimagining what’s possible in the lab today.”

What are the defining traits of the lab of the future? Haas believes there are multiple core elements. “On the technology side, it's connectivity. Connecting whatever instrument platforms you have digitally. Then acceleration with robotics and automation platforms. Finally, utilizing AI and machine learning to deal with large datasets that are coming out of the lab and using them to support decision-making.”

Embracing AI throughout the drug development pipeline

A key component of the lab of the future is AI. With AI seeing an explosion in popularity and power, excitement among drug developers has been building over its potential in the pharmaceutical space. AI has found applications from target identification to enhancing clinical trial design by optimizing treatment schedules, participant recruitment and data accessibility.

In June, the US Food and Drug Administration announced the launch of its own AI tool, Elsa, a large language model designed to assist with reading, writing and summarizing. The agency has stated that Elsa is already being utilized to accelerate clinical protocol reviews, shorten the time needed for scientific evaluations and identify high-priority inspection targets.

“AI is a tool that can be applied to most things, but in the context of drug discovery and development, I think it will play a part in the final step of the process, which is from having results to understanding what the next experiment/decision is. With large datasets coming from multiple experiments, AI can support analyzing this data and subsequent decision-making,” explained Haas.

Another area where AI has already had a significant impact is screening. “We used to do large, million compound screens. Now we're using more focused libraries with innovation coming from the data science and AI field, utilizing virtual screens, computer-aided drug design and structure-based drug design,” Dr. Lesley Granberg, chief science officer at Nashoba Valley Life Sciences, previously told Technology Networks.

“A lot of the principles that are coming from computer science are now coming together with the screening world and making that more efficient so that we're not having to do wet lab screens of millions of compounds. We can do a 10 million compound virtual screen, narrow this down to a thousand hits, then do the wet bench work. So, we're saving resources, time and money. Essentially, all the buzzwords that people love to hear in the C-suite,” Granberg continued.

Whilst AI has the potential to accelerate many aspects of drug development, it is still dependent on high-quality data to produce meaningful results.

The Pistoia Alliance’s 2024 Lab of the Future survey found that barriers to utilizing AI are shifting from behavioral issues towards more content-related challenges. For example, only 35% of respondents cited cultural barriers and institutional resistance to data sharing, down from 48% in 2023. Whereas low quality and poorly curated datasets were cited as the number one barrier to AI implementation (52%).

Many experts agree that AI is most successful when used with a human in the loop. “The great side is what it's [AI] is allowing us to do and the speed it's allowing us to do it. The drawback that I do see is that it's only as good as the models that you feed it. So, you still need that human component, whether you're in healthcare or drug discovery,” stated Granberg.

Haas echoes these sentiments, “I emphasize that AI could provide decision support in what I describe as a lab in a loop, which still has humans in the loop. There's also this idea of the self-driving lab, where workflows and decision-making are fully automatic. Nevertheless, there will be a tremendous increase in data and, hopefully, decisions that drive better drug candidates.”

Robotics, connectivity and the future of pharma

Beyond AI, laboratory automation has the potential to eliminate the most repetitive tasks in a lab, such as liquid handling. With the power of today's technology, it's now possible to automate ever more complex processes, including entire workflows.

""I believe that on the hardware side, it's primarily about robotics. The purpose of a robot is to eliminate or reduce unproductive work from people's schedules. Furthermore, if a robotic system can be loaded overnight by an Autonomous Mobile Robot to start in the morning and then be left to perform tasks automatically, it is significantly more productive than performing those tasks manually,"" said Haas.

Hardware tools, such as robots, have started to incorporate AI and machine learning towards efforts to create “robotic scientists” and self-driving laboratories.

“On the software side, it's all about better management of the lab. This includes software tools like experimental design,” said Haas. “For example, how do I take my manual method and transform it into a digital method to be executed on an automated liquid handler? In addition, utilizing digital twinning by having your assets in the lab in a digital format, enables scientists to plan their workflows in a digital simulation before they run them in the physical world.”

Together, these technologies have the potential to improve laboratory operations, accelerate drug development and ultimately benefit patients.

""We have conducted some assessments. Using robotic platforms, you can achieve an acceleration between 4 to 6 times, and sometimes even up to 10 times, compared to manual operations. When automated data analysis is included, the acceleration can increase to between 40 and 100 times. This has a profound impact on the speed of finding and optimizing drug candidates,"" said Haas.

“The lab of the future will be a combined human and machine effort requiring new expertise and data stewards. In the next five to seven years, I believe there's a lot that's only going to be accelerated, and the tools in the lab will likely change again,” Kristiansen concluded. “Robotics, integrations and working with multiple partners – especially across complex biological systems – are becoming more seamless. The ability to orchestrate automation, AI and collaborative platforms in critical workflows is easier today, and I'm confident it will be even more intuitive going forward.”",https://assets.technologynetworks.com/production/dynamic/images/content/404131/pharma-is-embracing-the-lab-of-the-future-heres-how-404131-640x360.jpg?cb=20250829,N,,2025-08-30 05:07:06.629775

From optimizing supply chains to redefining customer engagement, AI is no longer a speculative tool but a strategic imperative. For investors, the question is no longer if AI will reshape retail but how to capitalize on the operational and financial transformations already underway.

Operational Transformation: From Pilot Projects to Enterprise-Wide Impact

AI adoption in retail has evolved from isolated experiments to enterprise-wide overhauls. By 2025, 42% of retailers have deployed AI agents, while 53% are actively evaluating use cases. The most transformative applications span three domains:

Marketing and Product Development:

Gen AI tools like Amazon's AI-powered image generation platform have revolutionized digital advertising. By converting basic product photos into immersive lifestyle visuals, Amazon reported a 40% increase in click-through rates for advertisers. Similarly, AI-driven “copilots” in software development—adopted by companies like Mercado Libre—have boosted engineering productivity by reducing task completion times by up to 60%.

In-Store and Back-Office Efficiency:

Swedish retailer Lindex's “Lindex Copilot” exemplifies how AI can streamline operations. Trained on internal sales and store data, the tool provides employees with real-time task guidance and personalized advice, reducing decision-making time by 30%. AI agents are also automating inventory management, enabling autonomous restocking and dynamic pricing adjustments based on real-time demand and competitor actions.

Customer Experience Reinvention:

Chatbots powered by gen AI are now central to customer engagement. Walmart and L'Oréal have deployed AI chatbots that manage shopping lists, offer styling recommendations, and resolve support queries in real time. These tools reduce order completion times by 50–70% and drive a 2–4% basket uplift—a critical margin booster in a competitive sector.

Strategic ROI: From Cost Savings to Value Creation

The financial impact of AI adoption is equally compelling. Early adopters are unlocking value through three mechanisms:

Quick-Win Efficiency Gains:

AI tools for marketing and software development deliver rapid returns. For instance, the cost of large language model (LLM) APIs is projected to drop by 80% in the next 2–3 years, making personalized customer engagement more accessible. A 2–4% basket uplift from AI-driven recommendations can offset these costs while boosting sales conversions.

Scalable Operational Agility:

AI agents enable retailers to respond to market shifts in real time. For example, an AI system analyzing weather patterns, competitor pricing, and inventory levels can autonomously adjust promotions to mitigate sales drops. This agility is critical in volatile markets, where traditional decision-making lags behind demand fluctuations.

Long-Term Margin Expansion:

Industry-wide, AI could add 1.2–1.9 percentage points to retail margins by 2025. This is achieved through reduced labor costs (via automation), optimized inventory turnover, and higher customer retention rates. Walmart's AI-driven shelf optimization, for instance, has cut out-of-stock incidents by 25%, directly improving revenue.

Investment Implications: Prioritizing AI-First Retailers

For investors, the key is to identify companies that are not just experimenting with AI but embedding it into their core strategies. Three criteria stand out:

Domain-Specific AI Integration:

Top performers focus on use cases with clear ROI, such as Lindex's in-store copilot or Amazon's advertising tools. Avoid companies with fragmented AI pilots that lack a cohesive vision.

Data Infrastructure and Talent:

Retailers must invest in data quality and cross-functional teams to scale AI. Mercado Libre's success with AI copilots, for example, was underpinned by a centralized team of data scientists and engineers.

Sustainability and Ethical AI:

As regulatory scrutiny grows, companies prioritizing responsible AI (e.g., bias mitigation in chatbots) will gain long-term trust and avoid compliance risks.

Conclusion: The AI-Driven Retail Renaissance

The integration of AI into retail is not a passing trend but a structural shift. By 2025, the sector's economic value could expand from $240 billion to $390 billion, driven by AI's ability to enhance margins, accelerate decision-making, and personalize customer interactions. For investors, the opportunity lies in backing retailers that treat AI as a strategic lever rather than a cost center.

Those who act now—by investing in companies with scalable AI architectures, strong data governance, and a clear vision for transformation—will be well-positioned to capitalize on the next decade of retail innovation. The question is no longer about AI's potential but about who will lead the charge—and who will be left behind.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 06:03:43.936810

This deal came on the heels of Capgemini's announcement last month to acquire business transformation services firm WNS for $3.3 billion, excluding debt to expand the range of AI tools it offers for companies.

Medtronic’s strategic initiatives in 2025, including inclusive leadership and transparent governance reforms, have bolstered investor confidence. The company’s alignment with ESG priorities, such as board diversity and ethical operations, has enhanced its appeal to socially conscious investors. Recent board appointments, including John Groetelaars and Bill Jellison, reflect a focus on shareholder-centric governance and operational efficiency.

Financial performance in Q1 FY2026 underscored Medtronic’s growth trajectory. Revenue increased 4.8% year-over-year to $8.6 billion, driven by a 50% expansion in the Cardiac Ablation Solutions segment. Innovations like pulsed field ablation (PFA) and robust performance in high-margin areas reinforced market credibility. Analysts highlighted the company’s ability to navigate supply chain challenges and margin pressures.

The formation of new committees, including the Growth and Operating Committees, signals a strategic shift toward prioritizing R&D, M&A, and operational scalability. These reforms align with investor expectations for clear, actionable leadership. Upcoming initiatives, such as the 2026 Investor Day, aim to maintain transparency in strategic and financial communications.

Medtronic’s recognition in ESG rankings, including the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and the “World’s Most Ethical Companies” award, further solidifies its market position. These accolades align with broader investor trends that link sustainability performance to long-term financial outcomes.

Even with nipocalimab’s retreat from arthritis, however, J&J continues to chip away at the disease.
Thursday’s mid-stage stumble marks a rare miss for J&J.
Otherwise, 2025 has been a good clinical year so far for J&J.","Johnson & Johnson’s FcRn blocker nipocalimab showed no significant therapeutic benefit in a mid-stage rheumatoid arthritis trial, pushing the pharma to discontinue its development.

J&J was testing nipocalimab plus an anti-TNFα therapy in the Phase IIa DAISY trial, enrolling more than 100 patients with moderate to severe and active disease who had already had prior treatment. The company did not provide specific data in its announcement on Thursday, only noting that DAISY “did not show sufficient evidence that the combination therapy provided significant added benefit over anti-TNFα therapy alone.”

Nipocalimab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the neonatal Fc receptor, in turn lowering levels of IgG. The biologic won the FDA’s approval in April for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis, carrying the brand name Imaavy. Aside from rheumatoid arthritis, J&J is continuing to test nipocalimab in other immunology indications, including Sjogren’s disease and systemic lupus erythematosus.

“We remain confident in the nipocalimab product having $5B+ potential,” J&J said in its announcement on Thursday.

Even with nipocalimab’s retreat from arthritis, however, J&J continues to chip away at the disease. In July, the pharma filed a supplemental submission to the FDA, seeking to add data to the label of its therapeutic antibody Tremfya, showing that it helps prevent the progression of structural damage in patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Tremfya, which targets IL-23, was approved for this disease in 2020.

Thursday’s mid-stage stumble marks a rare miss for J&J. The pharma also suffered a late-stage flop in March for its kappa opioid receptor blocker aticaprant. Results showed “insufficient efficacy” when it was used as a treatment for patients with major depressive disorder.

Otherwise, 2025 has been a good clinical year so far for J&J. The same month as its depression defeat, J&J reported that a combination regimen based on Rybrevant bested AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso in a late-stage trial of non-small cell lung cancer, leading to significantly better overall survival. Also in March 2025, J&J’s experimental IL-23 receptor blocker icotrokinra outperformed placebo and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Sotyktu in a Phase III plaque psoriasis study.",https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/122fc97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3864x2174+0+201/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F41%2F01%2F2b9d98594e9fbc53890443a22347%2Fistock-1396614976.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 21:04:58.323586

Consumer staples stocks edged higher while discretionary names struggled, with Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo grabbing headlines. All of this is playing out as US consumer sentiment drops and airline shares falter.

What does this mean?

Americans are pulling back on non-essential spending, creating a clear divide between must-haves and nice-to-haves. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund rose 0.7%, showing strength in companies like Kraft Heinz, which jumped 2.8% on plans to split its business. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index came in at 58.2 for August, missing forecasts and its earlier reading. That weaker confidence translated to a 1.2% decline for the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund and turbulence for travel stocks. On the corporate front, PepsiCo is betting big on Celsius with a $585 million investment, while Post Holdings raised cash by selling a pasta unit and greenlit a $500 million stock buyback. Spirit and Frontier Airlines, meanwhile, are in high-level talks as Spirit deals with the aftermath of bankruptcy, sending its shares down almost 3%.

Why should I care?

For markets: Staples stand tall as confidence falters.

Investors are leaning into staple stocks, which typically hold up better when times get shaky. Kraft Heinz’s uptick and PepsiCo’s Celsius stake show how steady demand for groceries and drinks is winning out. On the other hand, weaker sentiment spells trouble for discretionary sectors—especially travel and retail—as the market braces for softer consumer spending.

Cameron Watt of Intouch Insight talks at CSP’s Outlook Leadership conference. | W. Scott Mitchell Photography

Eighty-five percent of consumers have tried made-to-order food from convenience stores.

“And the really cool trend over the last few years is that more and more consumers are considering convenience as a legitimate competitor to QSRs,” said Cameron Watt (pictured), president and CEO of Intouch Insight, speaking at CSP’s Outlook Leadership conference Aug. 20. “It’s now 72% of people who view it as a serious competitor.”

7-Eleven, Irving, Texas, for example, has announced plans for 1,300 new stores to be developed in the United States between now and 2030 with a QSR foodservice focus, he said.

“So, this is absolutely the direction where things are going now,” Watt said.

Going mobile, but changing

Cars are the primary location for where customers eat the food they buy at c-stores—but things are changing, he said.

“What’s interesting with the trend is that there’s more [eating] in the store, and there is a decent amount they’re taking home,” Watt said, noting that 49% of consumers ate c-store food in a car while driving in 2024; that percentage, however, dropped to 38% in 2025.

Those eating in a parked car was 22% in 2024 and 27% this year, while those eating the food at their destination jumped from 18% last year to 22% this year. Meanwhile, 5% ate in the c-store in 2024, while 11% have done so this year.

More eating in the store and at their destination reflects “QSR restaurant competitor behaviors,” he said, noting that the increase “over the last couple years is partly because we’re building the ability for them to eat in the store where it may not have existed before, right, but they’re also taking home.”

These behaviors mean that the consumers “will come with us if we choose to go that direction,” he said. “That’s what the data is saying.”

Watt cautioned, however, not to forget that many still are eating in cars because “that affects your packaging,” he said. “It affects what you give them in the bag. It affects all the things you need to know because mostly it’s still in the car, and what are they eating: handheld items, which are absolutely what they’re taking away most of the time.”

Even breakfast, he said, lends itself “very much” to handheld delivery.

Breakfast, along with all other made-to-order meal categories consumers usually buy at c-stores, is up from 2024 to 2025—with the exception of the “other” category:

Sandwiches, wraps and paninis are up from 66% in 2024 to 79% in 2025

Breakfast items: up 44% to 51%

Hot meals: up 29% to 35%

Salads: up 20% to 25%

Soups: up 9% to 13%

Other: down 16% to 11%

“What that says is that people are more willing to try new and different food items at convenience stores as well,” Watt said. “Maybe they used to have a sandwich, right? It’s pretty good. Quality was good, it was hot, it was fresh, so then they tried a breakfast item, and then they’re willing to try the soup station. It builds on itself, the credibility, and we’re starting to get that credibility building.”

The top motivating factor for consumers to buy made-to-order food from a c-store, Watt said, is in the name. “Location, location, location, convenience,” he said.

And while the convenience factor hasn’t changed as the primary driver to buy c-store food—it increased from 61% in 2024 to 66% this year— the ‘promotions and discounts’ category has increased as a motivating factor from 7% to 11% in the same period.

QSRs and other restaurants for decades have used coupons, promotions, special offer and bundles, Watt said.

“That is their lifeblood,” he said, adding that as consumers see c-stores as a food option alternative to QSRs and other restaurants, promotions and discounts come into play.

“People are saying, ‘We’d buy that from a convenience store, too,’” he said.

“Now that they’re viewing you as a competitor, they’re looking at that,” he said. “So, promotions are starting to enter the picture a little bit more.”

The Food and Drug Administration has approved vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax for all seniors, but only for younger adults and children with health conditions.

In a statement, CVS said the pharmacy chain cannot vaccinate those even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico due to state laws and regulations.

""Based on the current regulatory environment,"" CVS said it's offering COVID-19 vaccinations in the following states: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

The FDA's decision to end emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine for children under 5 will limit vaccine choices for younger children, leaving the Moderna vaccine as the only vaccine available for those 6 months to 4 years old with at least one health condition.

By Damian Mann for Ashland.news

Rite Aid is the latest pharmacy to shut down in Ashland, and CVS Pharmacy is ready to set up shop at the same location in Tolman Creek Plaza Shopping center at intersection of Ashland Street and Tolman Creek Road, also home to Albertsons.

Locally owned Ashland Drug at 53 North Second St. in the downtown is the only other pharmacy available to Ashland residents and has seen a surge in business because of Rite Aid’s announcement.

A letter dated Aug. 18 from Rite Aid, which previously announced it was closing locations after declaring bankruptcy, informed local residents that it was ending operations at 2541 Ashland St. on Sept. 22.

Prescriptions with existing customers will then be available on Sept. 23 when CVS takes over.

A sign in front of Rite Aid has alerted customers that CVS is moving in.

Rite Aid’s letter thanked customers for their loyalty and stated the company was “sorry to tell you that we have made the difficult decision.”

“We know you have choices when it comes to pharmacies, and we appreciate that you entrusted us with your health,” the letter stated.

Grants Pass was another Southern Oregon city that will see a similar takeover. The Medford and Phoenix Rite Aids previously closed.

Chris Hernandez, owner of Ashland Drug, said he’s vowed to continue to keep his store open despite continued pressures on the few locally owned pharmacies in the state.

“We’re not going without a fight,” he said. “We’re only one of two pharmacies left at this end of the valley.”

Hernandez said he’s seen about 30% more customers recently because of Rite Aid’s announcement.

“It’s definitely increased our business, but it doesn’t mean we’re more profitable,” he said.

He’s increased payroll and installed new technology that counts pills faster to help fill orders for customers. The store continues to provide counseling to customers on their medications.

Hernandez said insurance companies continue to squeeze his reimbursement rates for medications.

In some ways, the squeeze on his profitability has gotten better, and in other ways its gotten worse.

“We have to accept what’s going on and hunker down,” he said. For instance, U.S. Veterans Affairs created a new insurance program for veterans that wiped out his slim margins on medications.

“It’s way off the profitability scale,” he said.

At the same time, Hernandez said he vowed to find ways to continue to help veterans.

“I still wanted to make sure I could take care of them,” he said. “I’ve got many friends and family who are veterans.”

As a result, he said he tries to work with veterans to get to a pricing level that helps them.

“It’s a tough situation for these guys (veterans),” he said.

Hernandez said that at one time in the 1980s Ashland had as many as five drug stores.

U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, has raised alarms about the squeeze on profitability at pharmacies by insurance companies and Big Pharma middlemen.

Wyden made a personal appearance at Ashland Drug in 2023 to highlight what he called a network of “unchecked” middlemen who set fees and hurt pharmacies to sustain the tremendous profits of the pharmaceutical companies.

“This pharmacy news from Southern Oregon is one more painful piece of evidence that demonstrates the urgent need for reforms that help to halt these closures and consolidations with solutions that tackle troubling practices by pharmacy benefit managers and more,” said Wyden, a ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, in an email response to Ashland.news. “The ongoing closures and consolidations of pharmacies in smaller towns like Ashland hurt consumers’ ability to have options for the prescription drugs they depend on as a key part of health care for them and their loved ones.”

Across Oregon, pharmacies have been closing, hitting rural counties the hardest, including the closure of the Ashland Bi-Mart pharmacy in 2021.

An analysis by the Associated Press last year found Oregon had the second fewest retail pharmacies per capita in the nation, second only to Alaska.

He insisted that trust must remain the foundation of marketing as artificial intelligence reshapes global brand engagement.

Gathering of Industry Leaders

Held on Victoria Island, Lagos, the forum, themed “Growth, Governance and G-AI: The New Trinity for the Nigerian CMO,” brought together top CEOs and C-suite marketing executives in an exclusive environment designed to shape conversations around the evolving role of marketing leadership.

Loerke’s Virtual Address

Although not physically present, Loerke joined the gathering virtually.

Guests and industry leaders watched him live as he delivered a thought-provoking keynote that underscored the centrality of trust in the marketing profession and the transformative force of artificial intelligence.

The Centrality of Trust

In his address, Loerke emphasized that in an era marked by global uncertainty, trust had become more vital than ever.

“In times like these, trust becomes even more important.

There are promises built on trust, but in today’s world, trust is in short supply.”

He noted that the advertising industry, both globally and in Nigeria, had long recognized its responsibility to protect and nurture trust, pointing to standards that safeguard consumers while still encouraging creativity and innovation.

“This commitment is not optional,” he remarked. “It is fundamental to ensuring that advertising continues to serve people, businesses, and society.”

AI as a Transformative Force

Loerke described artificial intelligence as one of the most powerful forces currently reshaping the industry, noting its “spectacular” growth and its ability to revolutionize marketing operations.

He cited efficiency gains, enhanced ideation, and more precise delivery as unprecedented opportunities AI offered marketers.

“Major brands around the world are already embracing these opportunities,” he observed.

“For marketers, AI turbocharges innovation and the ability to deliver accurate, convenient output.”

Balancing Opportunity and Risk

However, he also cautioned that AI’s rapid adoption came with serious challenges, including data privacy issues, intellectual property concerns, and ethical considerations.

Without human oversight, he warned, the explosion of data could undermine the progress made in responsible marketing practices.

To address this, Loerke revealed that by the end of the year, the WFA would release the first global Responsive AI Marketing Challenge, a framework aimed at ensuring that growth and governance evolve together.

“Because the trust of the consumer is a prerequisite for sustainable growth,” he added.

A Call to Marketers

Closing his remarks, Loerke urged marketing leaders to embrace the extraordinary opportunities that AI presented while remaining steadfast in protecting consumer trust.

“The speed of change may feel overwhelming at times, but I am convinced that we, as brand marketers, have what it takes to seize this opportunity responsibly,” he said.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCF3380-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 20:11:43.925217

Kraft Heinz has not yet commented publicly on the speculation.","(RTTNews) - Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC) is preparing to split itself into two separate businesses, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing people familiar with the matter.

The plan, which could be finalized and announced as early as next week, would divide the food giant into a grocery-focused company and a sauces-focused company.

The move follows months of strategic reviews. In July, Kraft Heinz confirmed it was exploring options for its grocery portfolio, including a possible spinoff of several iconic Kraft-branded products. That potential new entity could be valued at up to $20 billion, according to earlier reports. Executives said at the time they were working ""with urgency"" to evaluate alternatives.

By separating into two units, Kraft Heinz hopes to unlock greater value than its current market capitalization of about $33 billion. The sauces business would retain flagship brands such as Heinz ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard, while the grocery business would house much of the Kraft portfolio. However, the report cautioned that timing and details could still shift.

The company, created in 2015 through the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz orchestrated by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, has been under pressure to reinvigorate growth. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, exited Kraft Heinz's board in May.

The possible breakup comes after Kraft Heinz recently posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings, buoyed by steady U.S. demand for pantry staples and condiments. Shares rose about 2 percent in afternoon trading Friday following the report.

Kraft Heinz has not yet commented publicly on the speculation.

Go deeper: States where you can get a COVID vaccine at CVS following RFK Jr. changes","Changes around COVID vaccine access are causing confusion in Colorado and beyond just as the CDC is reporting a nationwide spike in cases and emergency room visits.

Why it matters: The uncertainty comes as the federal health agency struggles with its own internal chaos and fallout from a new COVID vaccine policy issued this week by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

The latest: As of Friday, due to the ""current regulatory environment,"" CVS is now requiring prescriptions for COVID shots in Colorado and roughly a dozen other states, said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault. Only people ages 5-64 with an underlying condition are eligible to receive the shot.

The pharmacy is offering vaccinations without a prescription in 34 states, and completely barring access in three.

Those lists ""may change at any time,"" Thibault said.

Following Kennedy's decision, The New York Times reported that Walgreens also restricted vaccines in more than a dozen states, including requiring a prescription in Colorado.

Context: Typically, pharmacists can administer vaccines once the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends them.

In past years, ACIP moved quickly after FDA approval. But this fall, the panel won't meet until late September — and may forgo recommending the COVD shot entirely.

Kennedy recently replaced the entire ACIP with numerous members who are vaccine skeptics.

State of play: The CDC this week is reeling from walkouts and resignations after Kennedy blasted staff and changed COVID vaccine guidance.

Still, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is sticking by his endorsement of Kennedy's nomination as Health and Human Services Secretary, 9News reports.

(KHC) is preparing to split itself into two separate businesses, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing people familiar with the matter.

By separating into two units, Kraft Heinz hopes to unlock greater value than its current market capitalization of about $33 billion.
The possible breakup comes after Kraft Heinz recently posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings, buoyed by steady U.S. demand for pantry staples and condiments.
Kraft Heinz has not yet commented publicly on the speculation.","Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC) is preparing to split itself into two separate businesses, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing people familiar with the matter.

The plan, which could be finalized and announced as early as next week, would divide the food giant into a grocery-focused company and a sauces-focused company.

The move follows months of strategic reviews. In July, Kraft Heinz confirmed it was exploring options for its grocery portfolio, including a possible spinoff of several iconic Kraft-branded products. That potential new entity could be valued at up to $20 billion, according to earlier reports. Executives said at the time they were working ""with urgency"" to evaluate alternatives.

By separating into two units, Kraft Heinz hopes to unlock greater value than its current market capitalization of about $33 billion. The sauces would retain flagship brands such as Heinz ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard, while the grocery business would house much of the Kraft portfolio. However, the report cautioned that timing and details could still shift.

The company, created in 2015 through the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz orchestrated by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, has been under pressure to reinvigorate growth. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, exited Kraft Heinz's board in May.

The possible breakup comes after Kraft Heinz recently posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings, buoyed by steady U.S. demand for pantry staples and condiments. Shares rose about 2 percent in afternoon trading Friday following the report.

Kraft Heinz has not yet commented publicly on the speculation.

For investors, the key question is whether the company can transform this $3.3 billion bet into a sustainable leadership position in Intelligent Operations—a challenge that will test its strategic agility and operational discipline in the years ahead.","Capgemini’s $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS, announced on July 7, 2025, marks a pivotal shift in the global business process services (BPS) landscape. By combining WNS’s domain-specific BPS expertise with Capgemini’s AI and consulting capabilities, the deal aims to create a leader in Agentic AI-powered Intelligent Operations [1]. This strategic move is not merely a consolidation of scale but a calculated response to the accelerating demand for AI-driven operational transformation.

Strategic Rationale: Bridging AI and BPS

The acquisition addresses a critical gap in Capgemini’s portfolio. While the company has long excelled in enterprise consulting and technology, its BPS offerings lacked the vertical depth and AI integration that WNS provides. WNS’s strong presence in high-growth sectors like insurance, healthcare, and travel complements Capgemini’s core strengths in manufacturing and financial services [5]. By embedding WNS’s AI-led solutions—such as its Kipi.ai acquisition—into its broader ecosystem, Capgemini can now offer end-to-end Intelligent Operations, from hyper-automation to generative AI-driven decision-making [3].

Financially, the deal is structured to deliver immediate value. Capgemini projects normalized earnings per share (EPS) accretion of 4% in 2026 and 7% in 2027 post-synergies, with revenue synergies of €100–140 million and cost synergies of €50–70 million annually by 2027 [2]. These figures are underpinned by WNS’s robust financials: an 18.7% operating margin in FY2025 and a 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in constant currency over three years [5].

Integration Challenges and Risks

Despite the compelling synergies, the integration poses significant risks. Cultural alignment between Capgemini’s European-centric model and WNS’s India-based operations could strain mid-to-senior management, echoing past integration issues in Capgemini’s iGate acquisition [4]. Talent retention is another linchpin: WNS’s key client partners and AI specialists must remain engaged to avoid operational disruptions and unmet synergy targets [2].

Financially, the 17% premium paid for WNS has already impacted WNS’s short-term performance. In Q1 2026, WNS reported a 9.5% year-over-year revenue growth but a net income decline to $21.8 million due to one-time acquisition costs [3]. Capgemini’s stock also dipped 5% post-announcement, reflecting investor skepticism about the financial burden of the deal [4].

Long-Term Implications for Stakeholders

For Capgemini shareholders, the acquisition represents a high-stakes bet on AI-driven reinvention. If successful, the combined entity could dominate the Intelligent BPS market, where AI and automation are redefining operational efficiency [5]. However, achieving the projected 7% EPS accretion by 2027 will require disciplined execution, particularly in cross-selling opportunities and AI tool adoption across 150,000 employees [3].

WNS stakeholders, meanwhile, face a dual challenge: preserving their brand’s reputation for agility while aligning with Capgemini’s global infrastructure. The proxy advisory support from ISS and Glass Lewis, along with unanimous board approvals, suggests confidence in the integration plan [1]. Yet, the August 29, 2025 shareholder vote remains a critical milestone for finalizing the deal [3].

Conclusion: A Strategic Leap with Conditional Rewards

Capgemini’s acquisition of WNS is a bold step toward redefining BPS in the AI era. The deal’s success hinges on Capgemini’s ability to harmonize cultures, retain talent, and deliver on AI-driven value propositions. For investors, the key question is whether the company can transform this $3.3 billion bet into a sustainable leadership position in Intelligent Operations—a challenge that will test its strategic agility and operational discipline in the years ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 19:19:47.740105

LOVINGTON — Commercial construction in northern Lovington is booming, and on schedule, Evelyn Holguin, Lovington Economic Development Corporation executive director, said recently.

The walls are up for the new Albertsons Market on the southwest corner of Highway 82 and North Main Street, and the site preparations between the Family Dollar and the new Albertsons is almost complete for a Wendy’s restaurant to be constructed, according to Holguin who updated city commissioners during a regularly scheduled meeting Monday.

“We wanted to let you know the Wendy’s site is almost complete,” she said. “I know the utilities are currently being installed now. We’re hoping to have it complete in September. Then once it’s done, it will be fully transferred over to the Wendy’s Corporation and then they will begin the building. We’re hoping to do a groundbreaking for the Wendy’s prior to getting started with the construction.”

“The plan (for Albertsons) as of right now, everything’s on target,” Holguin added. “They’re working on the interior. We’re hoping to hopefully be open by the holidays. But they (Albertsons) do have till March of 2026 to be completely open.”

Holguin said construction on the new Albertsons Market has gone smoothly, with only a few hiccups along the way so far.

“We’ve run into about two or three snags but they weren’t bad,” she said. “It was stuff that was fixable. We did have (an) issue where the engineers for the Albertsons and the engineers for the Wendy’s – (they) are actually two different people – their plans actually didn’t align correctly but we were able to figure it out. We were able to cut just a small piece off of the retention pond to make it work.”

Holguin said construction on a 10,000-square-foot shopping center is planned to begin construction in the summer 2026. The new shopping center is planned for the land behind the new Wendy’s.

“We’re currently working with the owner now to try to find and fill those spots,” Holguin said. “We could potentially have five tenants out there. We could have three. It just really depends what size tenants are looking for. We could have 10 if they’re looking for 1,000 square foot shops. It just really depends.”",,N,,2025-08-29 18:17:58.028311

U.S. regulators approved updated COVID-19 shots Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans — and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children.

The revamped vaccines target a newer version of the continuously evolving virus and are set to begin shipping soon. But it could be days or weeks before many Americans know if they’ll be able to get one, with access dependent on decisions by federal health advisers, health insurers, pharmacies, and state authorities.

CVS Health does not currently plan to offer the updated annual vaccine COVID-19 vaccine in more than a dozen states, citing the current “regulatory environment” after the updated shots receiving approval for high risk groups this week.

A spokesperson for CVS said in a statement that “based on the current regulatory environment,” the pharmacy chain will not offer COVID-19 vaccinations as normal in the following states and territories: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.

Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration approved the updated COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer for seniors and people with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. Moderna’s shot was approved for people in this cohort aged between six months of age and 64 years and Pfizer’s was approved for people between 5 and 64 years.

Prior to this, vaccinated people 6 months and older were eligible for at least one dose of either Moderna or Pfizer’s updated COVID-19 shots. Despite this narrowed indication, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Doctor Care Anywhere is the telehealth partner for Axa Health and is 50% owned by the insurer.
In 2024 Doctor Care Anywhere noted significant improvements in cost margins through introducing further categories of advanced clinical practitioners (ACPs) to undertake more consultations than doctors.
“Enhancements to the booking journey on the Doctor Care Anywhere app were also successfully implemented in the second quarter, significantly reducing the time taken to book appointments,” it continued.
Doctor Care Anywhere chairman John Stier, said: “Seema has significantly contributed to the progress of our business through a period of transformation.","Doctor Care Anywhere has delivered a profit for the first time after posting a £500,000 surplus in the first half of 2025, compared with a £2.7m loss in the same period of last year.

However revenue and the number of consultations conducted were down with reasons including Axa Health client losses and closing its secondary care pathway.

Doctor Care Anywhere is the telehealth partner for Axa Health and is 50% owned by the insurer.

Consultation volumes were 349,900 in H1 2025, down 12.2% on the same period last year.

The firm said this was in line with management expectations due to the impact of the closure of the Axa Health secondary care pathway in the second half of 2024, Axa client losses in 2024 which have now stabilised, and the mild UK winter in the first quarter of the year.

However activated lives were 1.2 million, up 13.7% on the previous period.

The firm added 61,100 lives in H1 2025 compared with the last six months of 2024, although this was slower than a year ago.

It attributed the decline rate of new additions as primarily due to lower marketing activity.

Revenue fell from £21.8m to £19.2m over the same period, with business as usual (BAU) revenue up from £18.7m to £19.2m.

When excluding the impact of closing the firm’s secondary care pathway, BAU revenue was 1.6% up.

Transformation programme

However, the medical group noted the completion of a major phase of its transformation programme focused on streamlining operations and reducing costs which was completed in the first quarter of the year.

It added these changes had enabled it to post profits and set it up for growing profitability in the coming quarters.

But the firm also pointed out that further “cost optimisation initiatives” were underway to identify additional opportunities to reduce the cost base and support the company’s long-term growth strategy.

In 2024 Doctor Care Anywhere noted significant improvements in cost margins through introducing further categories of advanced clinical practitioners (ACPs) to undertake more consultations than doctors.

These additions to the consultation service included pharmacists and paramedics, alongside its advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs).

As a result it increased the proportion of consultations performed by ACPs to 40%, with GPs still conducting the majority (60%).

With these initiatives continued to evolve in the first half of the year the provider noted.

In Q2 it further expanded this clinical model by onboarding mental health practitioners and physiotherapists, “enabling better alignment of patients with the most appropriate care pathways”.

It added these enhancements are expected to support improved patient outcomes while further reducing the company’s cost to serve over time.

“Enhancements to the booking journey on the Doctor Care Anywhere app were also successfully implemented in the second quarter, significantly reducing the time taken to book appointments,” it continued.

“These changes have vastly improved the patient experience and contributed to increased engagement, leading to an increase in appointments.”

CFO departure

At the end of July chief financial officer (CFO) Seema Sangar stepped-down after just over a year at the business, having joined in March 2024.

Niall Dore was appointed interim chief financial officer in her place.

Doctor Care Anywhere chairman John Stier, said: “Seema has significantly contributed to the progress of our business through a period of transformation.

“As chief financial officer of DCA she has successfully instilled and embedded strong financial disciplines and controls to support our ambitious development and growth objectives.

“We thank her for her contribution and wish her well in her future career.

According to the union group SEIU California, there are now 800,000 rideshare drivers in the state, and that’s one out every 24 California workers who are at least sometimes gig drivers. And Uber and Lyft have traditionally been notoriously resistant to giving them minimum wage guarantees or any form of job benefits.

You may recall the 2019 political battles over the gig worker benefits bill AB5, which Lyft and Uber fought against tooth and nail. And they effectively got AB5 overturned, for their companies, at least, with that Prop 22 measure in 2020 that let the rideshare companies classify their drivers as independent contractors who are exempt from any requirements for employee benefits.

So it’s kind of a shock to see the Friday breaking news that both Lyft and Uber are allowing their California drivers to unionize, according to the Chronicle. While the idea comes from a state Assembly bill called AB1340 that Uber and Lyft both initially opposed, Governor Gavin Newsom managed to negotiate some concessions to get the two companies on board.

“This is a historic agreement between workers and business that only California could deliver,” Newsom said in a Friday morning statement. “Labor and industry sat down together, worked through their differences, and found common ground that will empower hundreds of thousands of drivers while making rideshare more affordable for millions of Californians.”

But notably, food delivery drivers for apps like Doordash and Instacart are not included in the new arrangement. And it appears one of Newsom’s concessions he offered Lyft and Uber was to lower the insurance requirements that rideshare drivers have to carry.

Uber’s California head of public policy Ramona Prieto said in the same statement that the deal is “a compromise that lowers costs for riders while creating stronger voices for drivers — demonstrating how industry, labor, and lawmakers can work together to deliver real solutions that reflect how people live, work, and move today.”

It is fair to be cynical when an Uber executive tells you that any move the company made is going to “lower costs.” On top of that, drivers are allowed to refuse joining the union. So it’s also fair to be cynical whether these unionized drivers would have much power, because Uber and Lyft could simply hand more gigs to the non-unionized drivers, and replace the drivers cheaply if faced with the threat of any kind of strike.

“Anything that effectively promotes the right to organize for ride share workers is good public policy,” Stanford Law professor and former National Labor Relations Board chair William Gould told the Chronicle. But he added, “The fact that they have fought tooth and nail against protection for their own workers and now support this makes me have more than a measure of skepticism.”

It’s also unclear how benefits would be applied across a gig driver workforce where some are in the union and others are not. And who knows what kinds of benefits these drivers would ask for in collective bargaining. This is a different kind of unionization than we are generally used to seeing.

But it’s still something of a win for drivers. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas chimed in on the press release, declaring “While Trump is stripping workers of bargaining rights and rolling-back protections, California is fighting for lower prices and empowering working families. What a way to celebrate Labor Day weekend.”

There was one such clumsy firing incident at ANZ this week. An employee representative declared it ""disgusting."" Reuters reports that the bank is offering employees ""psychological counselling"" to help them cope with the trauma. They're still being fired, though.

At issue is the process. The Australian Financial Review reported that 300 senior people at the bank received an automated email informing them how to return their laptops. The email was sent prematurely and was supposed to follow conversations with the 300 employees on Thursday. Instead, it was the first they knew of their removals.

Worse things have happened. At UBS in 2012, traders in London famously found they were fired only when they arrived at the office and either their key fobs didn't work or their emails bounced back. At the time, those cuts were described as ""brutal"" and ""devastating"". Many of those affected convened in a nearby pub.

At ANZ, the recipients of the ""return your laptop"" email appear to have been working from home and therefore couldn't drown their sorrows in the Railway Tavern. Instead, they seem to have directed their anger to ANZ. Afflicted individuals reportedly asked senior executives whether there would be support, prompting the bank to provide them with the ""direct numbers"" of psychologists. Others emailed the head of ""talent and culture"" to inquire whether they were really being fired. The answer was ""yes.""

Separately, Citi's Andy Sieg has been accused of upsetting people too, allegedly by shouting, sarcasm and belittlement. Citi hasn't deployed supportive psychologists, but it has thoroughly investigated the allegations and is standing by Sieg, whom it says is a ""hard charging leader"" with a mandate for changing the wealth management business he runs.

Now Sieg himself is publicly refuting the allegations. In an interview with Fox News, Sieg said the stories about him weren't accurate. “What I’d say overall is change is hard, and we’ve been driving a lot of change across Citi and in our wealth business. That change is working, I’m happy to say,” Sieg declared.

He added that: “The quality of talent that has risen up inside Citi and joined our part of the business from outside has been phenomenal. So we’re moving ahead full speed.” The implication is that naysayers will not be missed.

Legislative deal gives California rideshare drivers the right to join a union, lowers insurance requirements

Analysts, on average, projected adjusted earnings per share of 74 cents on revenue of US$13.7bil.
“We feel confident about the fact that PCs will continue to grow,” Lores said.
“It all depends on the market from here,” chief financial officer Karen Parkhill said in an interview when asked about the profit forecast range.
Lores said HP has not seen “material” pulling forward of purchases.","SEATTLE: HP Inc gave a profit outlook for the current quarter that may beat expectations, showing firming demand for computers and interest in new machines that can run the latest artificial intelligence (AI) software.

Earnings, excluding some items, will be 87 cents to 97 cents a share in the period ending in October, the maker of computers and printers said on Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated 91 cents.

In the fiscal third-quarter ended July 31, HP reported sales climbed 3.1% to US$13.9bil. Profit, excluding some items, was 75 cents a share.

Analysts, on average, projected adjusted earnings per share of 74 cents on revenue of US$13.7bil.

Sales of personal computers (PCs) rose 6% in the quarter and the company expects “mid-single digit” growth to continue in the current period, chief executive officer Enrique Lores said in an interview.

Business customers are upgrading to machines with Microsoft Inc’s Windows 11 and new AI PCs, which now make up more than 25% of HP’s product mix, a milestone reached a quarter ahead of the company’s target.

Consumer PC sales were also better than expected last quarter, he said.

“We feel confident about the fact that PCs will continue to grow,” Lores said. “AI PCs and Windows 11 are going to continue to drive demand.”

The shares gained about 3% in extended trading after closing at US$27.11 in New York. The stock has declined 17% this year.

To cope with the impact of tariffs, HP has adjusted to build almost all of its products sold in North America outside China and also increased some prices, Lores said.

Still the industry is being buffeted by economic uncertainty and higher costs tied to President Donald Trump’s trade policies.

“It all depends on the market from here,” chief financial officer Karen Parkhill said in an interview when asked about the profit forecast range.

“All the signs that we’re seeing from a market perspective are strong, particularly in PCs, and we expect that to continue. Should there be some shock to the market, we could potentially be at the downside (of the forecast).”

Parkhill said improvements that lead to greater consumer demand for new PCs, which HP experienced in the quarter, could push the company “above the midpoint” of the profit forecast.

Revenue in the personal systems unit rose 6% to US$9.93bil. Commercial PC sales gained about 5% to US$7.04bil while consumer revenue rose 8% to almost US$2.9bil.

Lores said HP has not seen “material” pulling forward of purchases. In HP’s printer business, where revenue declined, the company is focusing on higher-priced and more profitable products in order to improve margins, he said. — Bloomberg",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/08/29/3492699.jpeg,N,,2025-08-29 16:17:53.564878

L’Oréal is committing over €150 million to enhance its manufacturing facilities in several Asian markets, including Vietnam and China.","As the retail landscape in Asia rapidly evolves, global brands are increasingly eyeing the region for their strategic expansion plans. A striking example is the decision by major cosmetics player L’Oréal to significantly ramp up its investment in local manufacturing capabilities, reflecting an acute understanding of the region’s unique market dynamics and consumer preferences.

Investing in Local Manufacturing

L’Oréal recently announced its commitment to invest over €150 million in its manufacturing facilities in various Asian markets, including Vietnam and China. This investment is not just about increasing production capacity; it’s a calculated move aimed at enhancing supply chain efficiency and ensuring that the company can quickly respond to the ever-changing trends that define the beauty industry in Asia. With products flying off the shelves at the speed of light, L’Oréal is positioning itself to capture the hearts—and wallets—of consumers who increasingly crave local and authentic experiences in their beauty regimes.

What makes this investment even more compelling is L’Oréal’s clear intention to incorporate eco-friendly practices within their production lines. By integrating sustainable technology, the brand is not simply keeping pace with consumer expectations but is actively setting the stage for a greener retail future in a region that is becoming more environmentally conscious.

Market Trends Fueling Growth

The move comes amid significant shifts in consumer behavior across Asia. In particular, digital engagement and e-commerce sales are skyrocketing, with beauty products becoming some of the most sought-after items online. L’Oréal’s decision to fortify its manufacturing presence underscores a broader trend among brands aiming to localize their offerings. This not only streamlines operations but also aligns products more closely with local tastes and cultural nuances, providing a personalized shopping experience that many consumers are now demanding.

Moreover, the beauty market in Asia is projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, bolstered by a diverse demographic and an influx of youthful consumers eager to experiment with new products and trends. With this pivotal investment, L’Oréal is not merely playing catch-up but rather, making a bold statement that it intends to lead in this dynamic marketplace.

Consumer Engagement at the Forefront

Brands like L’Oréal are also innovating in how they engage with consumers. Interactive campaigns on social media, coupled with influencer partnerships, are reshaping traditional marketing tactics. Rather than simply advertising products, L’Oréal is entering a dialogue with its consumers, which is often more effective. After all, in a world flooded with choices, who wouldn’t want to be engaged by the brands they love?

Furthermore, the ability to produce and distribute products locally allows L’Oréal to experiment with limited-edition launches tailored specifically for Asian markets. The idea of creating something exclusive that resonates locally adds not just value but a tantalizing element of desirability—because, let’s face it, who doesn’t love a product that feels tailored just for them?

A Bright Future Ahead

With these strategic investments and innovations, L’Oréal is well-positioned to thrive in Asia’s retail sector. By balancing local production with sustainable practices, and by engaging deeply with consumers, the brand is crafting a path that many others may soon follow. As the beauty industry continues to flourish, one thing is clear: the best is yet to come, and the sparkle of local engagement combined with a global brand ethos is set to dazzle Asian consumers.

Japanese advertising major Dentsu is exploring the sale of its international business, marking a potential end to its decade-long efforts to compete with global rivals such as WPP, Publicis Groupe, Interpublic Group of Companies, and Omnicom Group.

Dentsu has engaged Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley and Nomura Securities to identify potential buyers for its creative and media units outside Japan, with the sale potentially valued at several billion dollars.

The company's international operations have generated over $4.5 billion in net revenues but have not turned a profit, leading to a significant restructuring that includes the announcement of 3,400 job cuts and a revised expectation of an operating loss for the year.

Japanese advertising major Dentsu is exploring the sale of its international business, in what could mark the end of its decade-long effort to challenge global rivals WPP, Publicis, Interpublic, and Omnicom, the Financial Times reported.

The Tokyo-listed group has hired Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley and Nomura Securities to assess potential buyers for its creative and media units outside Japan. The sale could be worth several billion dollars, signalling a major shift for a company that has struggled to turn its overseas bets into sustainable growth.

Dentsu’s international push began in 2012 with the £3.2 billion acquisition of UK-based Aegis Group, followed by deals for US-based Merkle and London’s Tag Group. The strategy briefly made Dentsu the world’s fifth-largest ad holding company. But its global business has since lagged, weighed down by shrinking client budgets, intense competition, and disruption from AI-driven marketing tools.

Last year, Dentsu’s overseas operations generated more than $4.5 billion in net revenues but failed to deliver profits. In recent months, the group has lowered its full-year outlook, citing weak performance in Europe, the US, and Asia. It has already announced 3,400 job cuts as part of a restructuring and now expects to post an operating loss of ¥3.5 billion ($24 million) this year, compared with an earlier forecast of ¥66 billion in profit.

Sources said management has grown frustrated with the loss-making unit, which has dragged down Dentsu’s otherwise resilient domestic business. Rival ad groups and private equity firms are being seen as potential buyers, though no final decision has been taken. A formal plan is expected by year-end.

From grocery aisles to hardware stores, companies are warning that the cost of everyday goods is climbing again, driven by tariffs, tighter supplies and higher production costs.

Grocery bills drive stress for many families

An AP-NORC poll in August 2025 found nearly 90% of Americans feel stressed about the price of groceries, with more than half calling it a “major source of stress.” That’s a bigger worry than credit card debt, child care or student loans, according to the survey.

Inflation has cooled somewhat over the past year, but signals point to another round of increases. Food makers say they have little choice.

Food makers face rising costs

Hormel cited rising costs for beef, pork and nuts, while J.M. Smucker pointed to steep tariffs on Brazilian coffee beans.

At Hormel, interim CEO Jeff Ettinger said the company is working through the impact of higher commodity prices. He called inflation in inputs like meat and nuts the biggest drag on recent earnings, noting that Hormel’s “Transform and Modernize” initiative softened, but did not eliminate, the pressure.

Ettinger said he expects sales to keep rising in the fourth quarter, helped by the strength of Hormel’s brands. To offset costs, the company is taking “targeted pricing actions,” though he cautioned that profit recovery may not arrive until next year.

Price increases are not limited to groceries.

Ace Hardware, which operates more than 5,000 independently-owned stores across the United States, warned Wednesday that rising costs from tariffs and supply chain disruptions could lead to higher prices on tools, appliances and home improvement products in the coming months.

Retailers brace for tariff impact

As food makers grapple with higher costs, retailers face the challenge of passing some of these increases onto customers while maintaining loyalty.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon previously warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs are likely to drive up prices, emphasizing that the company cannot absorb the full impact of these additional costs. During an earnings call in May, he said Walmart has observed “stress behaviors” among shoppers, noting that many are becoming more selective and cautious in their purchasing decisions.

Costco highlighted that grocery items are particularly susceptible to tariff pressures, with food margins described as “very tight.” Company executives reported experiencing inflation on imported fresh products as a result of tariffs and stressed that the global supply chain remains complex and challenging.

At Kroger, leadership noticed that customers are stretching their food budgets, prompting the company to adjust sourcing strategies in an effort to minimize the effects of tariffs. Despite these efforts, the company acknowledged that fresh foods are likely to experience some cost pressures.

Tariffs hit millions of US goods

The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group, reported in July that about 75% of U.S. goods are now affected by Trump’s Friday, Aug. 1 tariffs. The group said the food industry is among the hardest hit, warning the added costs will ultimately show up in higher prices for customers.

The analysis shows the top five food imports facing tariffs are liqueurs and spirits, baked goods, coffee, fish and beer, together worth $46.5 billion in 2024. That means more than 1 in 5 food products brought into the U.S. carried an added cost before even reaching store shelves.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CLEAN-Retailers-warn-of-price-hikes-as-tariffs-and-commodity-costs-rise_Getty-Images_featuredImage_Fri-Aug-29-2025.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 16:17:10.809029

“It’s gotten me to where I am today so I’m actually thankful,” he laughed.

An emergency room nurse in Tennessee, Stalls lived with the chaotic, fluttering heart rhythms of atrial fibrillation (Afib) for years. He knew Afib increased his risk of stroke and heart failure.

“I was in and out of Afib. Mostly out. So I just tried to forget about it. But after a while I couldn’t sleep and I didn’t have enough energy to even play with our kids in the yard,” he said.

The Afib episodes became longer and more severe. Doctors twice shocked his heart back to normal rhythm but the irregular heartbeats soon returned. In the spring of 2016, doctors at the Memphis hospital where he worked performed an ablation using Medtronic cryoablation technology.

Life changing moment

The ablation changed Stalls’ life in more ways than one.

“I hadn’t fully realized just how much Afib had affected me until I started feeling better,” he said. “I could run and play soccer with the kids. I felt great and I still do.”

Doctors told him afterward that the first step in the procedure was to make a digital map of his heart’s electrical activity. They invited him to step out of the ER some time and watch a case. “I floated over to the lab one afternoon and watched from the control room,” he said. “I had no idea what the mappers were doing but it was cool. I remember thinking ‘I can do that.’”

So he did—turning the treatment for his heart problem into his life’s work.

Passionate about helping others

Stalls leveraged his nursing background and a recommendation from a doctor he knew at his hospital and got hired by a Medtronic competitor to become a cardiac mapper. The training took a year.

“It was intense. The hardest training I’ve ever taken,” he said.

Stalls spent the first five years of his mapping career at a Medtronic competitor. He mapped thousands of hearts and worked with dozens of electrophysiologists—including Dr. David Lan, the same EP who performed his ablation in 2016.

”David has mapped at least 100 procedures with me,” said Dr. Lan. “He’s an excellent mapper. He’s passionate about helping people. He’s a very hard worker and he’s always available. I’m very proud of him.”

Technology Leap

In 2024, Stalls began hearing from mapping colleagues about the Medtronic Affera™ Mapping and Ablation System and accompanying Sphere-9™ Catheter. He said word in the industry was the system would “be a game changer,” and the more he heard the more interested he became. He left the competitor, signed on with Medtronic and now maps with the Affera system.

“It’s really amazing. The system is intuitive, smart and simple,” he said. “The physician can insert one catheter (Sphere 9) just one time. It can map, ablate with either radio frequency (RF) or pulsed field ablation (PFA), and verify that we either got it right or have to ablate further. Other systems have to remove the catheter and put in another one for each of those steps. The Affera system is an incredible step forward.”

What do mappers do?

Today, his days start around 7:00 A.M. at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Staff prepares the electrophysiology lab while Stalls sets up his mapping equipment. The first patient is typically in the room by 7:30 A.M.

“Sometimes they ask questions and I can say ‘I’ve been in your shoes,’ and I can share with patients how ablation helped me,” Stalls said. “It’s a nice feeling to be able to help them that way.”

The procedure begins. The electrophysiologist (EP) inserts a catheter into the patient’s groin, navigates it into the heart and they begin “mapping.” Electrodes on the catheter measure the voltage and the electrical activation time on all the tissue they touch, creating a 3D image of the heart’s electrical activity in a rainbow of bright colors. “Each color tells us something. Purple means healthy tissue. Red means not so healthy. And a lot of things in between,” Stalls said.

The EP and mapper work together during the case while the EP identifies spots that require ablation. The procedure can take 45 to 60 minutes, with constant communication back and forth between the EP, the mapper and other members of the team. It’s a relationship built on experience and trust.

“Mappers usually work with a lot of different physicians,” said Dr. Lan. “So they see different techniques and bring that experience to provide the technical knowledge, supporting every physician to treat our patients. There’s a lot of teamwork.”

“The mapper needs to know electrophysiology and the mapping technology inside and out,” Stalls added. “Our job is to advise and consult and focus exclusively on the mapping and ablating technology. Sometimes I’ll see things the EPs don’t because they have to pay attention to several other things during the procedure.”

Hospitals are moving so quickly to the Affera system that some have the technology in place but not enough mappers to operate them. So experienced mappers sometimes travel to fill the void until hundreds of new, permanent mappers come online. Stalls mapped at hospitals in New York, Chicago, Cleveland, Austin, TX and Milwaukee in the last few months. No matter where he goes, he still keeps images from the mapping of his own heart on his phone—a regular reminder of where he’s been, and what’s ahead.

“I’m just really grateful,” he said. “I felt cursed by Afib but it’s turned out to be a blessing. When a patient comes in with Afib and leaves in normal rhythm, it’s just incredibly rewarding to be a part of something like that.”

Circuit Court of Appeals, No.","Walmart defeated an appeal by shareholders who said the world’s largest retailer defrauded them by failing to disclose that federal prosecutors were investigating its opioid-dispensing practices.

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said Walmart did not commit securities fraud by waiting until June 2018 to reveal it was being investigated, 1-1/2 years after the probe began and 10 weeks after a Texas prosecutor warned she intended to indict the company.

Walmart learned of the opioid probe after federal agents raided one of its stores, seeking records concerning two Texas doctors who were prescribing vast amounts of the painkillers.

The company was not indicted, but was hit with a U.S. Department of Justice civil lawsuit in December 2020. A trial is scheduled for November 2027. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has more than 5,000 Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacies.

Shareholders sued Walmart after ProPublica reported on the near-indictment on March 25, 2020.

Walmart shares fell 5.1% that day, wiping out about $16 billion of market value, and fell after the Justice Department announced its civil lawsuit.

In Friday’s 3-0 decision, Circuit Judge Anthony Scirica said “not everything is securities fraud,” and that while Walmart did not reveal the indictment threat it “did what it had to do” to avoid misleading disclosures.

“The complaint does not plausibly allege the investigations into Walmart constituted a liability or a reasonably possible liability, or that Walmart’s disclosures implied it was not under investigation,” Scirica wrote.

“Once the contours of the investigation were clearer,” he added, “Walmart disclosed it was under investigation, what it was under investigation for, and that it faced possible losses.”

Friday’s decision upheld an April 2024 dismissal by Chief Judge Colm Connolly of the Delaware federal court.

Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Walmart spokeswoman said the company was pleased with the outcome.

In November 2022, Walmart reached a $3.1 billion nationwide settlement of opioid claims by state, local and tribal governments.

The case is In re Walmart Inc Securities Litigation, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 24-1818.

A Retail-First Strategy: INIU and Best Buy’s Synergy

INIU’s partnership with Best Buy is not merely a distribution agreement but a strategic alignment with a retailer known for its tech-savvy customer base and robust third-party marketplace [3]. By placing its flagship products—such as the Pocket Pro 10K 45W Power Bank and the 20000mAh 18W PD 3.0 QC 4.0 USB-C Power Bank—in Best Buy’s physical and online channels, INIU gains access to a vast audience seeking high-performance charging solutions [3]. The Pocket Pro 10K, for instance, combines TinyCell™ Pro technology with a detachable USB-C cable and real-time power display, addressing the modern consumer’s need for compact, efficient, and user-friendly devices [5].

This partnership also extends beyond power banks. INIU’s electric scooters (KQi series) and e-bikes (BQi series) are now available at Best Buy, aligning with the retailer’s push into automotive tech and positioning INIU as a one-stop shop for urban mobility [2]. By leveraging Best Buy’s “Blue Shirts” staff for in-store support, INIU enhances customer confidence in its products, a critical factor in a market where technical specifications can be overwhelming [2].

Strategic Alignment with Market Trends

The U.S. fast-charging sector is being reshaped by two key forces: technological innovation and consumer demand for sustainability. INIU’s product lineup mirrors these trends. Its 45W and 18W PD 3.0/QC 4.0 power banks reflect advancements in fast-charging protocols, while the company’s focus on compact, high-energy-density designs caters to the portability needs of smartphone and tablet users [5]. Meanwhile, the integration of electric scooters and e-bikes into Best Buy’s inventory taps into the growing demand for eco-friendly urban transportation [2].

Market projections underscore the relevance of INIU’s strategy. The global consumer electronics batteries market is expected to grow at a 16.2% CAGR through 2033, driven by mobile phone and wearable adoption [2]. INIU’s emphasis on fast-charging capabilities—such as 45W output and AI-powered adaptive charging—positions it to capture a segment of this growth, particularly as consumers prioritize devices that minimize downtime [4].

Competitive Positioning and Challenges

While INIU faces competition from established players like Samsung and Xiaomi in the portable charging space, its Best Buy partnership offers a unique advantage: retail visibility. Unlike direct-to-consumer models, which rely on digital marketing, INIU’s in-store presence allows for tactile product demonstrations and immediate customer feedback—critical in a market where performance metrics (e.g., wattage, battery life) are key differentiators [3]. Furthermore, Best Buy’s third-party marketplace expansion, which includes categories like automotive tech and office supplies, provides INIU with a scalable platform to introduce new products without the overhead of standalone retail operations [3].

However, challenges persist. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures could impact production costs, while the entry of new EV charging players (e.g., IONNA, bp pulse) highlights the sector’s competitive intensity [1]. INIU’s reliance on Best Buy’s logistics and inventory management may also expose it to risks if the retailer’s third-party marketplace faces operational hiccups.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on Retail and Innovation

INIU’s U.S. expansion through Best Buy is a calculated move to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and mass-market accessibility. By aligning its product development with consumer needs—portability, speed, and sustainability—and leveraging Best Buy’s retail infrastructure, INIU is well-positioned to capture a growing share of the fast-charging sector. While challenges like supply chain volatility remain, the company’s strategic focus on retail partnerships and product diversification offers a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to a high-growth, innovation-driven market.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 16:18:28.501151

The transaction, aimed to split the company into two separate units focusing on grocery and sauces, respectively, could be finalized and announced as early as next week, the report said.

In July, the company was studying a potential spinoff of a large chunk of its grocery business, including many Kraft products, into a new entity that could be valued at as much as $20 billion on its own. Later that month, it said that it was ""working with urgency"" to evaluate strategic options for some of its brands.

The split would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, according to the Journal.

Kraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The company was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. Berkshire Hathaway left Kraft's board in May.

The Heinz ketchup maker, in late July, reported a quarterly results beat, helped by resilient demand for its pantry staples and condiments in the United States.

Shares of the company were up 2% in afternoon trading.

What does this mean?

A breakup would be a big pivot for Kraft Heinz, whose 2015 blockbuster merger was led by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital Partners. Nearly a decade later, the company’s $33 billion market value still falls short of early investor hopes. Executives reportedly think splitting into two businesses could unlock more value than sticking together.

Why should I care?

For markets: Breaking up for bigger gains.

Investors often welcome breakups when mergers haven’t lived up to the hype, and Kraft Heinz has trailed behind rivals and the wider market. That initial share price lift shows hope that streamlining might spark new growth or even catch the eye of larger buyers, especially as consumer goods giants search for profitable new segments.

BBWI’s Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics & Insights

The company reported adjusted earnings of 37 cents per share in the fiscal second quarter.

Net sales increased 1.5% year over year to $1,549 million and lagged the Zacks consensus estimate of $1,554 million.

Net sales for Stores - U.S. and Canada increased 4.9% year over year to $1.20 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 billion. Direct - U.S. and Canada net sales tumbled 10.1% to $267 million, missing the consensus estimate of $295.6 million. International operations’ net sales decreased 2.9% to $86 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.8 million.

Sneak Peek Into BBWI’s Margins

The gross profit increased 2.2% year over year to $640 million. Also, the gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 41.3% in the quarter under review despite a $16-million impact of tariffs, representing about a 100-basis-point headwind. The improvement was primarily driven by leverage in buying and occupancy expenses due to the exit of a third-party fulfillment center.

General, administrative and store operating expenses increased 9% year over year to $483 million. As a percentage of net sales, this metric deleveraged 220 basis points year over year to 31.2% in the quarter under review.

Bath & Body Works reported an operating income of $157 million in the fiscal second quarter, down 14.2% from the year-ago quarter. BBWI’s operating margin decreased 190 basis points to 10.1% in the quarter.

Net income was $64 million, down 57.9% from $152 million in the year-ago quarter.

Bath & Body Works’ Store Update

The company ended the quarter with 1,904 stores, wherein it operated 1,791 stores in the United States and 113 in Canada. In the fiscal second quarter, it opened 20 stores, all in off-mall locations and closed 16 stores, primarily mall-based.

Internationally, partners opened 14 stores and closed one, ending the quarter with 537 stores. BBWI reiterated that international expansion plans for fiscal 2025 remain on track, with at least 30 net new store openings planned.

BBWI’s Financial Health Snapshot

Bath & Body Works ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $364 million, long-term debt of $3.89 billion, and long-term operating lease liabilities of $912 million. Total inventory at the end of the fiscal second quarter increased 13.2% from the previous-year period.

In the fiscal second quarter, the company provided $145 million in net cash for operating activities. The company returned $42 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchased 4.1 million shares of common stock for $121 million at an average price of $29.14 per share.

Bath & Body Works’ Q3 Outlook

For the third quarter of 2025, Bath & Body Works expects net sales growth of 1-3% from that reported in the prior year. International performance is projected to remain strong, with system-wide retail sales moving up in the high-single digit and reported net sales up in the mid-single digit.

The company anticipates a gross margin of 42.2%, which includes approximately $40 million of tariff impact. These tariffs are expected to weigh heavily on the quarter, reducing margins by roughly 240 basis points due to shipments that were subject to the 145% China tariff between April 9 and May 13.

Selling, general and administrative expenses are forecast at 31.5% of net sales, reflecting higher healthcare costs, technology investments and other strategic spending. Based on these factors, Bath & Body Works forecast fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of 37-45 cents, whereas it reported 49 cents in the year-ago period.

Fiscal 2025 earnings per share are expected between $3.28-$3.53, whereas it reported earnings of $3.61 per share in fiscal 2024. The adjusted earnings per share guidance was raised at the low end, with the company expecting $3.35-$3.60, up from the previously mentioned $3.25-$3.60. This compares to adjusted earnings per share of $3.29 reported in fiscal 2024.

Capital expenditure for the year is planned to be $250-$270 million, focused primarily on real estate and technology. The free cash flow is expected to be $750-$850 million, supported by working capital improvements through its “fuel for growth” initiatives.

In terms of shareholder returns, the company has increased its full-year share repurchase plan from $300 million to $400 million, and will continue to pay out dividends. Management reaffirmed its expectation of consistent 1-3% net sales growth for the second half of the year, confident in its ability to mitigate tariff costs over time while maintaining investment in growth and margin expansion.

Also in 2024, PepsiCo reached 81% of convenient foods volume not exceeding 1.1 grams of saturated fat per 100 calories, besting the 75% target that the company said was first met in 2021.
“We’re continuing to evolve the nutritional profile of our best-selling brands,” PepsiCo said in the 2024 ESG Summary.
Dovetailing with PepsiCo’s nutrition strategy are increased efforts to become more transparent with product labels.
PepsiCo, too, said it will continue to update the label for its beverage portfolio in the United States and Canada to include the “Refresh then Recycle” call to action for recycling.","PURCHASE, NY. — PepsiCo Inc. is making strides in its nutrition strategy, led by reaching goals to cut beverage calories from added sugar and reduce sodium in convenient foods ahead of schedule.

In an update on its pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) sustainability and nutrition plan, the food and beverage giant said that through the end of 2024, it has achieved all three of its 2025 targets for lowering saturated fat and sodium in convenient foods and added sugars in beverages. The 2024 ESG Summary, released Aug. 28, outlined the company’s progress through the end of last year in its nearly four-year-old pep+ sustainability and transformation initiative, with nutrition falling under the “Positive Choices” umbrella.

Earlier than expected, PepsiCo said it hit a target for 67% of its beverage portfolio to contain fewer than 100 calories from added sugars per 12-oz serving and surpassed its 2025 sodium reduction goal, with 77% of convenient foods portfolio volume now not exceeding 1.3 mg of sodium per calorie. Also in 2024, PepsiCo reached 81% of convenient foods volume not exceeding 1.1 grams of saturated fat per 100 calories, besting the 75% target that the company said was first met in 2021.

“We’re continuing to evolve the nutritional profile of our best-selling brands,” PepsiCo said in the 2024 ESG Summary. “Our Positive Choices goals focus on accelerating the reduction of added sugars in our beverages, reducing sodium and saturated fat and increasing servings of diverse ingredients that we deliver in our convenient foods as we continue evolving our portfolio offerings to meet the varied taste and expectations of consumers.”

PepsiCo noted it’s also making headway on a pair of nutrition goals for 2030 that were announced in November 2023. By the end of this decade, the company aims to have at least 75% of its global convenient foods volume meet or be below category sodium targets and to deliver 145 billion portions of “diverse ingredients” annually in that product portfolio. Via the latter goal, each portion will provide about 10% of the suggested daily amount of a diverse ingredient — such as legumes, whole grains, plant-based proteins, fruit, vegetables, and nuts and seeds — to foster a “more nutritionally diverse diet,” PepsiCo said.

Through 2024, 44% of the global convenient foods roster met or was below category sodium targets, up from 36% in 2023, and 69 billion portions of diverse ingredients were delivered, up from 68 billion in 2023.

“We saw a slight year-over-year increase toward our diverse ingredients goal, and we remain focused on further advancing our progress,” PepsiCo said in the ESG Summary report.

Dovetailing with PepsiCo’s nutrition strategy are increased efforts to become more transparent with product labels. The company said its global policy is to comply with all relevant labeling laws and regulations in all markets where its foods and drinks are sold. For example, labels now reflect the conversion of Pepsi to lower sugar formulations in markets such as China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and India and the company’s US Lightly Salted product line as containing 50% less sodium than its traditional counterparts. PepsiCo, too, said it will continue to update the label for its beverage portfolio in the United States and Canada to include the “Refresh then Recycle” call to action for recycling.

“Pep+ is not a sustainability strategy; it’s an ongoing transformation that powers our whole business, from innovation to production, marketing to distribution,” said Ramon Laguarta, chairman and chief executive officer of PepsiCo. “When we rolled out pep+ in 2021, we knew it would be important for the long-term strength of our company. Since then, we have worked towards creating value for our shareholders, customers and communities while aiming to make PepsiCo more resilient and overcome systemic barriers that limit progress. I look forward to continuing this critical journey with our associates and partners, as we strive to prove that growth and sustainability go hand in hand.”",https://www.bakingbusiness.com/ext/resources/2025/08/29/0829-AdobeStock.jpg?height=635&t=1756475475&width=1200,N,,2025-08-29 17:16:30.988903

State law allows pharmacists to administer vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a group that counsels the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about who will benefit from which shots.

In previous years, the committee recommended updated COVID-19 vaccines within days of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approving them. This year, the committee doesn’t have any meetings scheduled until late September, and may not recommend the shot when it does meet, since Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed multiple members with anti-vaccine views after removing all prior appointees in June.

The lack of a recommendation also means that insurance companies aren’t legally required to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine without out-of-pocket costs. Most private insurers will cover the updated shots this year, though that could change in 2026, according to Reuters.

Initially, CVS said it couldn’t give the COVID-19 vaccine to anyone in Colorado or 15 other states, because of their ACIP-approval requirement. As of Friday morning, its pharmacies can offer the shots to eligible people who have a prescription, spokeswoman Amy Thibault said.

As of about 10 a.m. Friday, CVS’s website wouldn’t allow visitors to schedule COVID-19 shots in Colorado.

Walgreens didn’t respond to questions about its COVID-19 vaccine policy, but its website said patients need a prescription in Colorado. A New York Times reporter found the same in 15 other states.

The FDA this week recommended the updated shots only for people who are over 65 or have a health condition that puts them at risk for severe disease.

The listed conditions include:

Asthma and other lung diseases

Cancer

History of stroke or disease in the brain’s blood vessels

Chronic kidney disease

Liver disease

Cystic fibrosis

Diabetes (all types)

Developmental disabilities, such as Down syndrome

Heart problems

Mental health conditions, including depression and schizophrenia

Dementia

Parkinson’s disease

Obesity

Physical inactivity

Current or recent pregnancy

Diseases or medications that impair the immune system

Smoking

Healthy people technically still can get the vaccine, but would have to ask a health care provider to prescribe it off-label. An off-label prescription refers to one given for a condition the drug isn’t approved to treat, such as a blood-pressure drug prescribed to prevent migraines.

BoiseDev complete coverage

A judge in Ohio got the details on the “embarrassing” details of Rodney McMullen’s split from Kroger this spring, and has ruled that those details can stay private, for now.

But Boise-based Albertsons is still pressing to hear the details on his exit, and a hearing is set for next month.

As BoiseDev reported, attorneys in a dispute between singer Jewel and Kroger demanded to know about McMullen’s conduct, which prompted Kroger’s board to ask him to resign after a short ten-day resignation. Kroger said when announcing that McMullen had agreed to leave that he did something that was “inconsistent with Kroger’s policy on business ethics,” but didn’t provide further details.

Jewel’s attorneys argued that those circumstances could be key to their dispute. The judge ordered McMullen to provide a written answer that explained “the facts and circumstances relating to your resignation from the Kroger Co.”

The Cincinnati judge ruled that the details weren’t relevant to Jewel’s case, Bloomberg reported.

Albertsons’ arguments next

Attorneys for Albertsons also want to know the details of his forced resignation.

“McMullen micro-managed the merger from beginning to end, and his business ethics (or lack thereof) lie at the heart of this case,” the attorneys wrote earlier this summer.

Albertsons said the actions that led to McMullen’s resignation raise “significant concerns not only regarding his credibility, integrity, and compliance with the law, but also about his focus during the merger process and his ability to fulfill Kroger’s contractual obligations to Albertsons … Kroger has not explained why that conduct was so egregious that the Kroger board determined McMullen was unfit to serve as CEO and forced him out within 10 days of its discovery.”

Kroger said Albertsons’ actions in court showed Albertsons’ “desperation” and that it was the company’s “latest attempt to distract from its own misconduct during the regulatory process.”

ID37,S&P Global,2025-08-29 18:05:53+00:00,www.energyindepth.org,Methane Emissions Intensity in the Permian Basin Dramatically Decline - Energy In Depth,Mallory Smith,,,,,https://www.energyindepth.org/methane-emissions-intensity-in-the-permian-basin-dramatically-decline/,"According to S&P, methane emissions intensity in the Permian Basin has dramatically declined by more than 50 percent from 2022 to 2024.
In August of 2024, the United States reached a new monthly record for crude oil production at 13.4 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d).
The Permian Basin remains a cornerstone of that growth, accounting for nearly 50 percent of U.S. oil production and over 20 percent of U.S. natural gas output.
Despite this record production, the prolific basin is actively contributing to environmentally conscious progress in key areas like methane emissions intensity.
Progress like dramatic reductions in methane emissions intensity showcase that industry’s voluntary commitments and pledges to eliminate emissions can and do work.","The latest data from S&P Global Commodity Insights confirms what producers in the Permian Basin have long been showing: oil and natural gas assets can deliver record energy production while reducing emissions. According to S&P, methane emissions intensity in the Permian Basin has dramatically declined by more than 50 percent from 2022 to 2024. The decline is attributed to improved operations, upgraded equipment, and the utilization of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence.

Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights

Additionally, S&P’s recent data shows that since the end of 2022, absolute emissions in the Permian Basin have declined by 55.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf), which is equivalent to 28.2 million metric tons (MMT) of carbon emissions avoided. To put this reduction into perspective, the reduction is roughly the same as eliminating the annual emissions of an entire country the size of Lithuania, and greater than the greenhouse gas emissions from heating and cooling every home in California, as S&P notes..

Record production does not inhibit emissions reduction efforts

This impressive reduction comes amid record-setting oil production for the country. The United States has produced more crude oil than any nation at any time for the past six years in a row, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In August of 2024, the United States reached a new monthly record for crude oil production at 13.4 million barrels per day (MMbbl/d).

The Permian Basin remains a cornerstone of that growth, accounting for nearly 50 percent of U.S. oil production and over 20 percent of U.S. natural gas output. Despite this record production, the prolific basin is actively contributing to environmentally conscious progress in key areas like methane emissions intensity.

As Energy in Depth has previously analyzed, data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows that Permian methane emissions have fallen 32 percent since 2019, even as production surged 51 percent during the same time period. That’s a perfect example of how energy growth and environmental goals can go hand in hand.

Industry leads voluntary emissions reduction efforts

Notably, American oil and gas companies have been at the forefront of voluntary efforts, commitments, and programs to reduce methane emissions – which are exactly what lead to impressive declines in emissions like those reflected in S&P Global’s recent data.

Industry groups like the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership, The Environmental Partnership, ONE Future, and the Texas Methane and Flaring Coalition all work to bring together the country’s top oil and gas producers to work towards common goals like improving methane emissions reporting, ending routine flaring, and sharing of best practices for emissions detection.

Following the release of the latest S&P data, the Texas Methane and Flaring Coalition emphasized:

“Our members have consistently demonstrated a sincere and deep commitment to reducing the level of methane intensity levels—efforts that are clearly working.

Conclusion Kraft Heinz’s proposed breakup is a high-stakes bet on strategic clarity and portfolio optimization.","The proposed breakup of The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) represents a bold attempt to reverse a decade of shareholder value erosion and align with evolving consumer preferences. By splitting into two distinct entities—a grocery-focused business and a premium “Taste Elevation” segment centered on high-margin condiments and sauces—the company aims to unlock latent value through operational specialization and portfolio optimization [1]. This move mirrors broader industry trends, where conglomerates are dismantling to address divergent growth trajectories and investor demands for clarity [2].

Strategic Rationale: Focusing on High-Margin Growth

Kraft Heinz’s decision to spin off its grocery division—branded as a $20 billion entity—stems from a recognition that its core condiments business (Heinz ketchup, Grey Poupon mustard, Philadelphia cream cheese) generates superior margins and growth potential compared to underperforming staples like Oscar Mayer and Lunchables [3]. The grocery segment, while foundational, has struggled with stagnant sales and margin compression due to shifting consumer preferences toward healthier, premium, and transparent-label products [4]. By isolating these businesses, Kraft Heinz hopes to allow each to pursue tailored strategies: operational efficiency for the grocery unit and innovation for the condiments division [1].

Financial metrics underscore the urgency of this restructuring. Despite a 34.7% gross profit margin in 2024, operating income plummeted to $1.68 billion (6.51% margin) from $4.57 billion in 2023, reflecting rising costs and brand dilution [5]. The condiments segment, however, has shown resilience, with a 190 basis point expansion in adjusted EBITDA margins year-to-date 2025, suggesting its potential to outperform [6]. Analysts argue that separating these units could enable the condiments division to command a valuation closer to its high-margin peers, while the grocery entity might attract investors seeking exposure to everyday staples at a discount [1].

Precedents and Risks: Lessons from the Food Industry

Kraft Heinz’s proposed split aligns with a pattern of successful food-industry restructurings. Kellogg’s 2023 division into Kellanova (snacks) and WK Kellogg (breakfast) culminated in a $30 billion acquisition of Kellanova by Mars and a $3.1 billion sale of WK Kellogg to Ferrero, demonstrating how focused portfolios can unlock value [7]. Similarly, Conagra’s 2016 spinoff of Lamb Weston into a standalone entity allowed both companies to optimize their core markets [8]. These cases highlight the potential for spinoffs to enhance operational efficiency and investor clarity.

However, risks persist. Kraft Heinz’s high debt load (net debt-to-EBITDA of 7.18x) and a history of failed synergies post-2015 merger raise concerns about execution [5]. Skeptics warn that the grocery division’s underperformance could drag on the parent company’s valuation if the spinoff fails to revitalize brands like Oscar Mayer [9]. Additionally, regulatory hurdles and brand dilution—particularly if the grocery unit struggles to compete with private-label alternatives—could undermine the strategy [10].

Investor Implications: A Dual-Opportunity Play?

For shareholders, the breakup introduces a dual opportunity: a value-driven grocery entity and a premium sauces/spreads business. If executed effectively, the condiments division could capitalize on global demand for premium, functional, and health-conscious products, while the grocery unit might benefit from cost discipline and brand revitalization [11]. Analysts project modest revenue growth for KHC (0.41% CAGR through 2029) and EPS growth of 2.02% CAGR, though these figures hinge on successful integration and market acceptance [12].

The key question remains whether the split will address structural inefficiencies or merely repackage old challenges. With a 34.7% gross margin but declining operating margins, Kraft Heinz must demonstrate that its focus on premiumization and international expansion can offset the grocery division’s drag [5]. Investors should monitor the valuation uplift of similar spinoffs, such as Kellogg’s, to gauge the potential for a meaningful shareholder value boost [7].

Conclusion

Kraft Heinz’s proposed breakup is a high-stakes bet on strategic clarity and portfolio optimization. While the move aligns with industry trends and addresses operational inefficiencies, its success will depend on execution, debt management, and the ability to capitalize on premiumization. For investors, the split offers a chance to reassess the company’s value through two distinct lenses—a gamble that could either unlock hidden potential or expose lingering vulnerabilities.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 14:15:34.258763

The vehicle, developed in partnership with logistics company Grupo Marval, runs on hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources. Unlike diesel trucks, it emits no carbon dioxide and operates at noise levels below 20 decibels, making it quieter than conventional freight vehicles.

With a range of up to 750 kilometres and a load capacity of 49 tonnes, the truck mirrors the performance of a traditional diesel vehicle but is designed to reduce the environmental footprint of long-distance freight in Chile. Refuelling takes between 20 minutes and an hour, depending on the system, an important consideration given the country’s challenging geography.

Hydrogen ambitions in Chile

Chile has positioned itself as a potential global hub for green hydrogen, aiming to exploit its vast solar and wind resources. In 2023, Walmart Chile opened its first hydrogen plant at its Quilicura distribution centre in partnership with French energy company ENGIE. The facility produces 240 kilograms of hydrogen per day, avoiding an estimated 1,600 tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually.

The deployment of the truck is part of Walmart’s broader strategy to cut emissions in its transport operations. The company has set a target for 10% of its distribution journeys to be made with low-emission vehicles by the end of 2024, with plans to scale that to 40% by 2029. Globally, Walmart has pledged to become a “regenerative company” by 2040.

Alongside its investment in hydrogen, Walmart Chile is experimenting with double-deck trucks to improve freight efficiency and transitioning diesel-powered yard trucks and refrigerated trailers to electric models.

Hydrogen advocates see the fuel as particularly well-suited for heavy-duty freight, where battery-electric vehicles face limits in range and charging times. However, challenges remain, including infrastructure, costs, and the speed at which fleets can transition away from fossil fuels.",https://www.mobilityplaza.org/media/cache/640/bundles/app/images/42396/68b1a6650b2d3.png,N,,2025-08-29 15:17:42.585982

While Perplexity is still early in its monetisation efforts, advertising has been viewed as a natural next step to sustain its growth and fund its heavy AI research and infrastructure costs.

Before joining Perplexity, Patel co-founded the influencer marketing company Captiv8, where he served as chief revenue officer. Captiv8 grew into a leading platform in the creator economy space, connecting brands with social media influencers. In May 2025, the company was acquired by French advertising giant Publicis Groupe, underscoring the value of Patel’s work in building scalable ad solutions.

In a statement to Adweek, Ryan Foutty, Perplexity’s vice president of business, thanked Patel for his contributions and stressed that the company’s mission remains unchanged. “It’s been great to have Taz on our team, and we wish him all the best in his future endeavours,” Foutty said. He added that Perplexity is “driven by velocity and curiosity,” and continues to partner with leading marketers and merchants looking to shape the consumer experience for the AI era.

Patel’s departure raises questions about how Perplexity will steer its advertising and shopping initiatives as it advances, but the company has signalled that it intends to move full speed ahead. With the AI search market heating up and tech giants investing heavily in monetisation strategies, Perplexity’s ability to balance innovation with sustainable revenue will be closely watched.",https://www.businessupturn.com/usa/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-2025-08-29T223859.886.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 05:07:26.181635

Conclusion CVS Health’s strategic retreat from the ACA market is a calculated move to realign with its core strengths in pharmacy and MA.","CVS Health’s decision to exit the ACA individual insurance market in 17 states by 2026—impacting 1 million Aetna members—marks a pivotal shift in its strategic focus. This move, driven by rising healthcare costs and regulatory pressures, underscores the company’s pivot toward higher-margin segments like Medicare Advantage (MA) and pharmacy services. While the retreat raises questions about its short-term operational flexibility, the broader implications for the pharmacy sector and public health infrastructure are profound.

Financial and Operational Implications

CVS’s Q2 2025 results highlight its financial resilience despite the ACA exit. Total revenues reached $98.9 billion, an 8.4% year-over-year increase, with the Health Care Benefits segment contributing a 39.4% rise in adjusted operating income due to improved risk adjustment estimates and cost controls [1]. The company raised its 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to $6.30–$6.40, reflecting confidence in its ability to offset ACA-related losses through cost-cutting measures, including the closure of 250 brick-and-mortar pharmacies [2].

However, the ACA exit carries risks. Aetna’s ACA plans in states like California and New Jersey are being discontinued, with benefits for HMOs rolled back, including doubled out-of-pocket limits and eliminated perks [3]. This shift aligns with a $1.2 billion cost-reduction initiative and a focus on MA plans, which now include $0 premium options with expanded dental and vision benefits [3]. While MA’s growth potential is significant—accounting for 16% of U.S. seniors in 2025—the segment’s profitability depends on accurate risk scoring and managing rising claim costs [3].

Regulatory and Vaccine Distribution Challenges

Regulatory pressures are reshaping CVS’s operational landscape. State-level pharmacy regulations in 17 states (42% of its locations) have altered dispensing markups, directly impacting profitability [4]. Additionally, the Arkansas PBM-Pharmacy split bill threatens to dismantle the cost efficiencies of its integrated business model, a move that could ripple across the industry [4].

Vaccine distribution further complicates the picture. Federal regulatory delays in ACIP guidance for the 2025–26 COVID-19 vaccines forced CVS to hold off on administering updated doses in 16 states, including Arizona, Florida, and Georgia [5]. The FDA’s new restrictions—limiting vaccine eligibility to those over 65 and high-risk individuals—have fragmented access, complicating distribution logistics [5]. These challenges highlight the vulnerability of pharmacy chains reliant on federal-state coordination for public health initiatives.

Competitor Responses and Industry Trends

Competitors like Walgreens and Rite Aid are adapting to similar pressures. Walgreens is leveraging its pharmacy network to combat vaccine hesitancy through pharmacist-led education and expanded test-to-treat services [6]. Rite Aid, emerging from bankruptcy, is streamlining operations to focus on core pharmacy services, including vaccine administration [6]. Meanwhile, the industry is embracing AI and digital tools to streamline drug approvals and vaccine development, as seen in the FDA’s push for AI-driven regulatory processes [7].

The broader sector faces regulatory headwinds, including the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which is projected to reduce pharmaceutical revenues by 31% through 2039 [8]. Companies are pivoting to novel therapies and high-unmet-need areas, such as biologics and personalized medicine, to offset declining margins [8].

Strategic Resilience and Market Outlook

CVS’s strategic realignment appears to balance short-term risks with long-term opportunities. Its focus on MA and pharmacy services aligns with demographic trends, as the U.S. senior population grows and demand for chronic disease management rises. The company’s acquisition of Rite Aid’s prescription files and store locations further strengthens its market position [1].

However, regulatory uncertainty remains a wildcard. The FDA’s evolving approval processes and state-level PBM regulations could delay product launches or erode profit margins. For investors, the key question is whether CVS can sustain its cost-cutting momentum while navigating these challenges.

Conclusion

CVS Health’s strategic retreat from the ACA market is a calculated move to realign with its core strengths in pharmacy and MA. While the exit introduces operational and regulatory risks, the company’s financial performance and industry trends suggest a resilient path forward. For the broader pharmacy sector, the shift underscores the need for agility in an era of fragmented public health policies and evolving regulatory landscapes.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 18:19:05.925130

At least eight companies named M-Logistika are registered in Russia, according to data from SPARK-Interfax, with three located in Moscow and others in cities of St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Samara, Nizhny Novgorod, and Ufa. However, the specific M-Logistika company that has taken control of Air Liquide’s assets is not clarified in the presidential decree, The Moscow Times states.

Air Liquide, one of the world’s largest producers of industrial gases and cryogenic equipment, had operated in Russia since 1989. Due to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company decided to leave the Russian market in September 2022, transferring its business to local management.

Prior to the war, Air Liquide had strong ties with Russian metallurgical enterprises like Evraz ZSMK, Metalloinvest, and Severstal, according to The Moscow Times.

After the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, many foreign companies' assets in Russia were initially placed under temporary management by Russian companies or the state, and later resold. In April 2023, Putin signed a decree on the expropriation of foreign assets in retaliation for the confiscation of Russian assets in the US and other countries.

This week, Putin also transferred the temporary management of Chelyabenergoremont JSC, previously owned by Finnish energy group Fortum, to Rosimushchestvo, the Russian Federal Property Agency. Fortum’s Russian subsidiary, PAO Fortum, was handed over to Rosimushchestvo in 2023.

Fortum called the move a violation of international law and estimated its losses from the expropriation of its Russian assets at €1.7 billion. In February 2024, the Finnish company filed a lawsuit against Russia, seeking compensation for the seized assets, The Moscow Times reported.

Publication Date: August 29, 2025

HP’s latest earnings underscore continued strength in its Personal Systems business, supported by demand for AI PCs and the Windows 11 refresh cycle. Momentum in key growth areas highlights progress on HP’s strategy, even as Printing faces ongoing headwinds.

What is Covered in this Article:

HP Inc.’s Q3 FY 2025 financial results

Strong Personal Systems growth fueled by AI PCs and Windows 11 refresh

Printing revenue pressures offset by disciplined margins and portfolio shifts

Progress on cost mitigation, supply chain diversification, and cash flow delivery

Q4 outlook and FY 2025 guidance on EPS, margins, and free cash flow

The News: HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) reported its Q3 FY 2025 financial results with net revenue of $13.9 billion, up 3.1% year-over-year (YoY) and above consensus estimates of $13.74 billion. Personal Systems revenue was $9.93 billion, up 6% YoY, while Printing revenue declined 3.8% YoY to $3.99 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1%, down from 8.2% in Q3 FY 2024. Non-GAAP net earnings were $713 million, down 15% YoY, with non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.75, down from $0.84 in Q3 FY 2024, and slightly above the consensus estimate of $0.74.

“Looking forward, we remain confident in the strength of the PC market opportunity, and expect continued momentum from Windows 11 refresh and AI PC adoption,” CFO Karen Parkhill said. “We believe that the actions we are taking are the right ones to enable us to respond swiftly to near-term market dynamics, while continuing to invest for long-term profitable growth.

HP Q3 FY 2025 Earnings Lifted by PC Growth, Printing Remains Soft

Analyst Take: HP’s Q3 FY 2025 results highlight the company’s ability to sustain growth in a volatile environment, with Personal Systems once again offsetting softness in Printing. The quarter reflected tangible momentum in AI PCs and Windows 11 refresh, improved cash generation, and steady execution on cost mitigation measures. While margins remain under pressure from tariffs and a competitive pricing environment, HP’s strategic direction nonetheless points to resilient growth drivers in AI PCs, services, and innovation across hardware and software solutions.

AI PCs and Personal Systems Drive Outperformance

Personal Systems revenue rose 6% YoY, marking HP’s sixth straight quarter of growth.

Most notable here is that unit volume increased 5%. Perhaps most intriguing, however, is that consumer segment growth outperformed commercial segment growth: consumer units were up 8% while commercial units rose 3%. We feel that this was supported by a strong back-to-school season and continued corporate refresh activity.

Also, something to keep an eye on: The AI PC category saw double-digit sequential revenue growth and now represents over 25% of HP’s mix. (This is one quarter ahead of expectations.) In addition to the impending end of support for Windows 10, AI PC momentum is now also partly attributable to ecosystem transitions taking into account new on-device features (for example, Adobe and Zoom shifting workloads to take advantage of AI PC capabilities).

ASPs also benefited from premium product demand, delivering operating margins of 5.4% (+0.9 percentage points sequentially), consistent with HP’s long-term target range.

Together, these dynamics demonstrate that AI PCs and the overall premium mix are already reshaping HP’s Personal Systems performance.

Printing Faces Ongoing Pressures but Strategic Shifts Continue

Unfortunately, no surprises here: Printing revenue declined 3.8% YoY, with consumer printing down 8% and commercial printing down 3%. Hardware units fell 9%, highlighting soft demand in both consumer and office markets, especially in North America and Europe.

While competitive pricing and higher trade-related costs weighed on segment performance, the business managed to deliver a relatively strong 17.3% operating margin, consistent with guidance. While this still falls within the usual margin range (which tends to hover between 17% and 19%), we note that this lands near the bottom of the business unit’s cyclical fluctuations.

HP continues to prioritize higher-value segments such as Big Tank and subscriptions to improve long-term profitability, but thus far hasn’t managed to stick the landing for its ROI, TCO, and AI value propositions at scale. With near-term print demand remaining muted, HP’s margin discipline and portfolio shifts continue to maintain consistent profitability in the segment. Having said that, HP may need to revisit its messaging strategy if it wants to bring growth back to the segment.

Cost Mitigation and Supply Chain Diversification Underpin Resilience

We saw HP continue to execute on cost actions and supply chain diversification to offset tariff pressures during the quarter. Case in point: Nearly all products sold in North America are now manufactured outside China, with production ramping in Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, and the U.S. These actions enabled HP to mitigate the majority of tariff costs in the quarter, but selective pricing increases also provided some additional cushion. Caution on the latter, as pricing increases aren’t the kind of tactic that can be repeated QoQ indefinitely.

Additionally, we note that operating expenses were managed tightly under the company’s Future Ready cost program, which remains on track to deliver $2 billion in annualized gross run-rate savings by year-end FY 2025.

Together, these measures highlight HP’s operational agility in navigating trade headwinds while preserving investment capacity for growth.

Innovation and Portfolio Expansion Reinforce Long-Term Positioning

HP advanced its innovation pipeline in Q3 FY 2025 with several new AI-driven solutions. Top of mind: The EliteBook Ultra PC received recognition as a top AI PC for its design and productivity gains, while the OmniBook 5 introduced up to 34 hours of battery life for consumer use. The company also launched HP Dimension with Google BIM, a 3D video collaboration tool, and expanded its workforce experience platform to 40 countries.

In Print, HP introduced AI tools like NEO, an industrial chatbot to improve efficiency, and Build Workspace, an AI vectorization tool reducing drafting time by 80%.

Sustainability progress remained central, with 99% of home and office devices incorporating recycled content and U.S. operations now powered by 100% renewable electricity. While the current US administration has scaled back investments and interest in sustainability programs across its partner ecosystem, it is good to see HP maintaining its leadership in these areas, especially across global markets. These initiatives strengthen HP’s positioning as a leader in the future of work, while embedding innovation, sustainability, and green ROI across the portfolio.

Guidance and Final Thoughts

For Q4 FY 2025, HP guided non-GAAP EPS between $0.87 and $0.97, broadly in line with consensus expectations of $0.91.

The Personal Systems group is expected to benefit from holiday seasonality, continued AI PC adoption, and Windows 11 refresh, with margins projected within the 5–7% target range.

Print revenue is expected to follow seasonal trends with margins returning to the top of its 17–19% range, supported by supply volumes and disciplined pricing.

Full-year free cash flow remains projected between $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion, despite added costs from trade-related regulations.

With AI PCs gaining share, premium mix strengthening, and cost actions delivering results, HP looks fairly well positioned to extend its growth momentum into FY 2026 while navigating ongoing macro and trade uncertainties.

This collapse, driven by EU sanctions, the REPowerEU Plan, and the end of transit via Ukraine in early 2025, has forced Gazprom to pivot aggressively toward Asia. For investors, the question is whether this shift can offset Europe’s loss and sustain long-term growth—or if it exposes new vulnerabilities.

The European Exodus: A Structural Decline

Gazprom’s European market share has fallen from over 40% in 2021 to 11% by 2025 [2], with pipeline exports via TurkStream—the sole remaining major route—struggling to compensate for lost volumes. In Q2 2025, Gazprom delivered just 9.93 billion cubic meters (bcm) to Europe, a 50% drop from the same period in 2024 [3]. The EU’s rapid diversification, including LNG imports from the U.S., Qatar, and Norway, has rendered Russia a marginal player in its own once-dominant market. By 2027, the EU aims to fully phase out Russian gas [4], leaving Gazprom with a structural revenue gap.

The Asian Pivot: China as a Lifeline

China has emerged as Gazprom’s most critical market. The Power of Siberia 1 pipeline, operational since 2019, now delivers 38 bcm annually, with plans to expand to 48 bcm by 2027 through the Far East route [5]. In 2024, Gazprom increased deliveries to China by 36% year-over-year, driven by long-term contracts and infrastructure upgrades [6]. However, the proposed Power of Siberia 2 (PoS-2) pipeline—designed to add 50 bcm/year—remains stalled due to pricing disputes. Russia seeks gas prices near its former European rates (~$350 per 1,000 cubic meters), while China insists on domestic levels (~$60) [7]. This impasse highlights the financial risks of the pivot: lower margins in Asia compared to Europe, coupled with high infrastructure costs.

Financial and Geopolitical Risks

Gazprom’s financial resilience is underpinned by a 2024 net profit of $15 billion, driven by domestic sales and acquisitions like Shell’s Sakhalin Energy stake [8]. Yet, its Asian pivot faces headwinds. China’s energy strategy prioritizes diversification, including LNG and renewables, reducing its reliance on any single supplier [9]. Additionally, geopolitical tensions—such as U.S.-China competition and the Red Sea crisis—could disrupt energy security dynamics, complicating Russia’s role as a stable supplier.

For investors, the key uncertainty lies in Gazprom’s ability to secure new markets beyond China. While the Sakhalin-to-China pipeline (10 bcm/year by 2027) offers incremental growth [10], it cannot fully offset Europe’s loss. Moreover, Mongolia’s exclusion of PoS-2 from its 2024–2028 development plan underscores the geopolitical fragility of cross-border infrastructure [11].

Investment Implications: A High-Stakes Gamble

Gazprom’s long-term viability hinges on three factors:

1. Resolving PoS-2 negotiations to unlock 50 bcm/year of capacity.

2. Maintaining China’s demand amid its own energy transition and domestic production growth.

3. Managing costs in a low-margin environment, including a 7% reduction in 2025 investment budgets [12].

While the company has demonstrated operational flexibility—such as boosting production from Sakhalin-2—its financial model remains exposed to geopolitical and pricing volatility. For investors, Gazprom represents a high-risk, high-reward bet: a potential rebound in Asian markets could offset European losses, but unresolved disputes and China’s strategic caution may cap growth.

In conclusion, Gazprom’s rebalancing is a testament to its adaptability in a fractured global energy landscape. However, the path forward is fraught with challenges that demand careful scrutiny. Investors must weigh the promise of Asia against the shadows of geopolitical risk and financial constraints.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 13:34:56.675931

Severe aortic stenosis often reduces a patient's quality of life and limits their daily activities.
By advancing insights into the effectiveness of redo TAVR, the RESTORE study underscores Medtronic's commitment to improving solutions for complex cardiovascular conditions.
For more information on Medtronic, visit www.Medtronic.com.","Medtronic plc has announced it received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the expanded Redo-TAVR indication of the Evolut transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) system. This approval allows for the implantation of a new Evolut transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) inside any failed previously implanted TAV and follows CE Mark for Evolut PRO+, FX and FX+ systems.

The Redo-TAVR procedure is indicated for patients experiencing failure of any TAV, including but not limited to severe aortic stenosis, who are at high-risk for open-heart surgery.

“FDA approval for Redo-TAVR with the Evolut system marks a significant milestone in patient care, empowering physicians across the United States to offer a critical treatment option for patients with failing transcatheter heart valves who are at high surgical risk,” said Dr. Michael Caskey, MD, attending cardiothoracic surgeon at Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital in Phoenix. “This advancement also benefits patients considering a new TAVR procedure today, giving patients options for future intervention and has the potential to profoundly improve their long-term outcomes and quality of life.”

Severe aortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve leaflets become stiff and thickened and have difficulty opening and closing, making the heart work harder to pump blood to the rest of the body. Severe aortic stenosis often reduces a patient's quality of life and limits their daily activities. If left untreated, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis can die from heart failure in as little as two years.1

“The Redo-TAVR indication marks an important milestone for our Evolut TAVR systems, reinforcing our commitment to provide physicians with patient-specific solutions today, and for the future of TAVR,” said Jorie Soskin, vice president and general manager of the Structural Heart business within the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. “With a broader indication than other available options, this expansion, together with the launch of our RESTORE study build on our differentiated design and unparalleled evidence to advance solutions and elevate care options for heart teams and patients worldwide.”

RESTORE Study to further evaluate Redo-TAVR procedure

In addition to the FDA approval, Medtronic has launched the RESTORE study to evaluate the outcomes of Redo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients experiencing symptomatic bioprosthetic valve failure. This pivotal study will enroll 225 participants and follow them for up to five years, focusing on both immediate and long-term clinical outcomes. The study aims to assess 30-day procedural success rates, one-year freedom from mortality and stroke, and additional measures of safety, technical success, and quality of life. By advancing insights into the effectiveness of redo TAVR, the RESTORE study underscores Medtronic's commitment to improving solutions for complex cardiovascular conditions.

In native (i.e., non-prosthetic) aortic valves, Evolut TAVR systems are currently indicated for implantation in symptomatic severe aortic stenosis patients across all risk categories (extreme, high, intermediate, and low) in more than 120 countries in the world, including the European Union and the United States.

Shares of the company were down about 2 percent in extended trading.

Inflationary prices and uncertainty arising from the Trump administration’s trade policy have curbed consumer spending, challenging CEO Richard Dickson’s turnaround efforts to revitalize its brands.

For the quarter ended Aug. 2, Gap’s comparable sales rose 1 percent, missing estimates of 2.26-percent growth, while net sales rose slightly to $3.73 billion, almost in line with analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by LSEG.

In the quarter, net sales in its cheaper Old Navy and namesake Gap brands ticked up 1 percent each. But sales fell in its pricier brands Banana Republic and Athleta. Sales in the athleisure brand continued their decline, falling 11 percent.

“Dickson has delivered on his promise to reinvigorate the Gap brand, though it remains to be seen if or how he can do the same for Athleta, where sales continue to decline,” said Sky Canaves, analyst at EMarketer.

Gap, like rivals including American Eagle and Levi Strauss, has pushed its denim line with a new viral “Better in Denim” campaign featuring the global girl group Katseye to bump up sales.

The campaign comes weeks after American Eagle’s “Great Jeans” denim campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney.

The company now expects annual operating margin to be between 6.7 percent and 7 percent, compared with 7.4 percent in 2024.

The forecast includes a tariff impact in the range of 100 to 110 basis points, which translates to a hit of $150 million to $175 million.

Canaves said the company’s profit margins could deteriorate as the year progresses.

“Tariff impacts, combined with a heavily promotional environment during the holidays, squeeze margins further.”

Dell’s traditional PC business keeps shrinking while HP snatches market share, but skyrocketing AI server demand is setting up a much brighter future for the tech giant.

What does this mean?

Dell Technologies posted another rough quarter for personal computers, with revenue from consumer-focused products sinking 7% from last year as HP edged ahead, according to UBS Securities. Storage sales disappointed too, dropping 3% and missing analyst targets. Even so, overall earnings surpassed Wall Street’s expectations, almost entirely thanks to Dell’s surge in AI-optimized server shipments. Revenue from these servers jumped 165% year-on-year to $8.2 billion. Management responded by raising its fiscal 2026 AI server shipment goal by $5 billion to $20 billion, after already delivering half that amount in just six months. Still, Dell shares slid nearly 10% following lackluster third-quarter guidance, but ongoing strength in artificial intelligence keeps steering the company’s long-term strategy.

Why should I care?

For markets: Short-term pain, long-term payoff.

Dell’s nearly 10% share drop spotlights investor nerves about shaky PC and storage sales, despite promising momentum in AI. UBS Securities highlights that strong AI order flow could convince investors to look past consumer-side disappointment and focus on Dell’s potential to lead the AI hardware race. That tension leaves Dell at a pivot point: lagging in legacy products, but building real excitement around its future tech.

The bigger picture: AI shakes up the tech landscape.

The PC and storage arenas are starting to look maxed out, but global appetite for AI infrastructure just keeps climbing. Dell’s newly ramped-up guidance mirrors a big shift across the entire industry as companies double down on artificial intelligence.

GROCERY GRIPES These budget-weary moves come in the wake of a failed merger between Kroger and Albertsons.","THE top boss of Kroger has vowed to make two key improvements for shoppers amid a bombshell announcement.

As the grocery giant plots to slash nearly 1,000 workers, the CEO promised that the money saved will go towards bumping up the shopping experience for consumers.

A leaked memo from Kroger on Tuesday revealed that the grocer has plans to lay off hundreds of employees, with a little less than 1,000 workers to be impacted, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Corporate associates are the target of the reductions rather than in-store staff or those working in manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, per the source.

""In the past few months, we have all looked for ways to simplify the organization, shift resources closer to our customers, and focus on work that creates the most value,"" Kroger's interim CEO Ron Sargent said in the memo.

""These decisions are never easy, but we know thoughtful, yet difficult, choices are necessary to set our organization up for continued success.""

While the mass layoffs are devastating for the impacted employees, they will have positive implications for Kroger customers.

The company, which has employed more than 409,000 people since February, plans to reinvest the savings into other areas, including lowering grocery prices and opening up new stores, per the memo.

The money will also be allocated towards creating store-level jobs.

MONEY MOVES

The staff reduction is the latest in a series of cost-cutting tactics implemented by Kroger.

The company announced in June its intention to shutter roughly 60 underperforming stores across the next 18 months.

Kroger, which operates more than 2,700 locations across over a dozen banners, did not reveal which banners or stores would be impacted.

A Grocery Dive analysis of WARN notices, union announcements, and local news reports, however, has determined 39 locations that the retailer slated for closure this year.

At least 18 of these spots have already closed, with states such as California, Texas, Indiana, Virginia, and Georgia seeing Kroger closures this summer.

Over a third of the 39 Kroger stores at risk fall under the Kroger name banner.

The company is also plotting to close a number of stores under its Harris Teeter, Pick ’n Save, Fred Meyer, and Mariano’s banners.

It is unclear whether the shutdowns outlined by Grocery Dive are related to the 60 stores that Kroger announced in June.

The company CEO previously told investors that Kroger is working to axe underperforming stores and shift its focus towards locations that produce the highest value.

""We are reviewing our non-core assets and we’re aggressively looking for ways to reduce costs throughout the company,"" he said.

While Kroger is shutting a number of stores, the company is also planning to complete 30 store projects, which include new stores and major renovations, by the end of 2025.

GROCERY GRIPES

These budget-weary moves come in the wake of a failed merger between Kroger and Albertsons.

The two grocery giants had proposed a $25 billion merger, although it was ultimately blocked by a judge at the end of last year, prompting a legal battle between Kroger and Albertsons.

""With the Kroger-Albertsons merger off the table, Kroger is moving to reset its cost base and streamline operations,"" Arun Sundaram, analyst at CFRA Research, told Reuters.

""Many decisions were put on hold during the merger process, so it makes sense that we're seeing more major business decisions in recent months,"" he added.

ID17,CVS Health,2025-08-29 15:37:17+00:00,www.idse.net,CVS Will Not Offer COVID-19 Vaccine in 16 States Until ACIP Meets,Infectious Disease Special Edition,,,,,https://www.idse.net/Policy-Public-Health/Article/08-25/CVS-stops-COVID-shots/78068,"“We expect to receive the updated 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines in the coming days,” Ms. Thibault told Infectious Disease Special Edition.
“Legally, it makes sense,” said Paul Offit, MD, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
“They are following the law, which is that they give vaccines based on ACIP recommendations, and they don’t have an ACIP recommendation for this year’s newly approved COVID-19 vaccine.
“It was the premier public health agency in the world, but now its abilities have been tremendously diminished by large-scale cuts in personnel and in financial support.
He has no known training in medicine, scientific research or public health, making him the first CDC director in history not to have a medical degree, a PhD or both.","After two days of high-profile firings and forced resignations at the CDC, nationwide pharmacy chain CVS said it would be unable to offer this season’s newly approved COVID-19 vaccine to any patients—even if they meet the FDA’s more stringent requirements for immunization—in 16 states and the District of Columbia where pharmacists are not permitted to administer vaccines that are not recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), according to Amy B. Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS.

“We expect to receive the updated 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines in the coming days,” Ms. Thibault told Infectious Disease Special Edition. “We’ll administer FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines in states where legally permitted at CVS Pharmacy and/or MinuteClinic to meet our patients’ needs.”

Based on the current regulatory environment, which could change, Ms. Thibault said, CVS Pharmacy is offering FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccinations in Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming.

“Importantly, in all but three (Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico) of the other 16 states, our pharmacies can administer a COVID-19 vaccination, depending on the patient's age, with an authorized prescriber’s prescription,” she said in an email.

“Legally, it makes sense,” said Paul Offit, MD, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “They are following the law, which is that they give vaccines based on ACIP recommendations, and they don’t have an ACIP recommendation for this year’s newly approved COVID-19 vaccine. From the point of view of the pharmacies, the law would have to be changed to enable them to legally give vaccines according to recommendations from the AAP [American Academy of Pediatrics] or ACOG [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists], for example.”

Dr. Offit also noted that the new head of ACIP, Martin Kulldorff, PhD, has expressed strong views against COVID-19 vaccines. “He has pretty much said that he doesn’t think we should give these vaccines at all anymore. So therefore, we have no idea what is about to happen because everything that used to be true, which is that policy would be made based on good scientific data, is not true anymore.”

The move by CVS, especially if other pharmacies follow suit, could dramatically restrict access to the vaccine at the crucial early weeks of respiratory virus season in those states, which include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia, along with Washington, D.C. Between 2022 and 2023, more than two-thirds of COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered by pharmacists (approximately 40.5 million out of 59.8 million), a CDC report found (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2024;73[13]:286-290).

“Most adults get their vaccines from pharmacists,” Dr. Offit said. “The first COVID vaccines became available in December 2020, and by July 2021, we had vaccinated 70% of the U.S. population in a country that doesn’t really have an infrastructure for mass vaccinating adults. Pharmacies and pharmacists are the reason we could do that, but now they’re understandably backing away for legal reasons.”

The newly reconstituted ACIP panel is not scheduled to meet until Sept. 18-19, 2025, and even that meeting is uncertain: On Aug. 28, Sen. Bill Cassidy, MD (R-La.), the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, called for that meeting to be indefinitely postponed “until significant oversight has been conducted,” noting that “any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership.”

In June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members of ACIP and replaced them with a new eight-member panel, including several who have openly expressed anti-vaccine sentiments and/or been aligned with anti-vaccination efforts. One resigned before the first meeting, leaving seven members.

“We at SHEA [Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America] and all of my colleagues in academic medicine and public health are very distraught at the changes in ACIP,” said David Weber, MD, MPH, the president of SHEA. “We believe guidelines should be evidence-based and developed by experts, which the previous panel were. And in addition to removing the panel members, there were also a number of liaison groups that contributed their expertise to ACIP, although they were not voting members. That included SHEA, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and many other groups. All of those liaisons and their expertise have also been eliminated from the working groups, as far as I know.”

The CDC has been seriously damaged over the past several months, Dr. Weber said. “It was the premier public health agency in the world, but now its abilities have been tremendously diminished by large-scale cuts in personnel and in financial support. These cuts are going severely erode its ability to support public health in every state.”

Many questions remain about how people will be able to access vaccines in the upcoming cold and flu season, warned experts in a media briefing on Aug. 28 hosted by the American Public Health Association (APHA) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). “The cost for vaccines is already baked into the rates for this current calendar year, so there’s probably no reason for insurance companies to not cover the COVID vaccine for financial reasons,” said IDSA Vice President Wendy Armstrong, MD, FIDSA. “But the confusion will be at the point of service. For some pharmacists and nurse practitioners, if it’s not on the schedule, by law they’re not allowed to give it. So that might be a barrier. And then there are some physicians who for a variety of reasons don’t keep vaccines in their office; they’ll write a prescription and send you to the pharmacist for them to administer it. But can they still do that? This means that every board of pharmacy, every board of medicine in this country is probably going to have to bring this up as an agenda item to figure out how to ensure access to vaccines. So we may have 50 different state solutions to this.”

“We don’t know how it’s going to play out,” agreed Philip Huang, MD, MPH, the director of Dallas County Health and Human Services. “We have governmental supplies of vaccines for uninsured and underinsured children, an adult safety net program, and we also try to maintain some private stock to cover others in need. But we don’t know if they will tell us that we can’t give those vaccines now.”

Physicians could also face liability, Dr. Armstrong added. “Two days ago, Secretary Kennedy warned physicians that they could lose their medical malpractice protections if they don’t follow official federal guidance on vaccines, after several medical associations indicated that they would not follow the new recommendations.”

Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, the Regents Professor, McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health, and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, told Infectious Disease Special Edition: “The important thing is not just having vaccines; it’s vaccination. If we are not able to get vaccines into the people’s arms, we have a problem. We are watching vaccines become weapons, rather than what they have been and should be, which is tools for public health.”

Acting CDC Director Named

Late in the evening on Aug. 28, the Associated Press and the Washington Post reported that Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of HHS, had been named as acting director of the CDC. Mr. O’Neill, a former speechwriter for HHS in the George W. Bush administration, most recently worked for billionaire tech investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. He has no known training in medicine, scientific research or public health, making him the first CDC director in history not to have a medical degree, a PhD or both.

“There’s a lot of trouble at CDC and it’s going to require getting rid of some people over the long term in order for us to change the institutional culture and bring back pride and self-esteem and make that agency the stellar agency that it’s always been,” Mr. Kennedy said in a White House press conference on Aug. 28. “I’m very confident in the political staff that we have down there now, that they’re going to be able to accomplish that and ensure the confident functionality of that agency.”

Mr. Kennedy also inaccurately claimed that the CDC had listed abortion as one of the top medical accomplishments of the 20th century. “They said abortion is the one of the greatest medical accomplishments because it keeps small families,” he said. “Go to the website, look at it. Fluoridation—giving kids a toxin—and vaccines.”

The CDC’s actual list of “Ten Great Public Health Achievements — United States, 1900-1999” is (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1999;48[12]:241-243):

Vaccination

Motor vehicle safety

Safer workplaces

Control of infectious diseases

Decline in deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke

Safer and healthier foods

Healthier mothers and babies

Family planning

Fluoridation of drinking water

Recognition of tobacco use as a health hazard

‘Customers are getting real value out of AI. They have deployed it into real, difficult problems. There is a return on those investments,’ said Dell Vice Chairman and COO Jeff Clarke on the company’s second-quarter earnings call.

Dell Technologies scored record sales during its second quarter with sales of $29.8 billion, up 19 percent year over year, despite downturns in its storage and consumer PC businesses, problems that Jeff Clarke, Dell vice chairman and COO, has vowed to address going forward.

Even with the challenges in storage, traditional servers and PCs, Clarke said the company’s enterprise AI business is bigger than anything it has seen before.

“It’s the single largest number of customers that we sold to in a quarter,” he said on the company’s earnings call. “We now have eight consecutive quarters of quarter-over-quarter growth of the buyer base. The mix now is roughly 50 percent new customers and 50 percent returning customers. We’re seeing that across a broad base of segments, whether it’s tech firms, manufacturing firms, financial services firms, engineering firms, higher education, health care.”

He said among those AI customers, the number of proofs of concept are up, and the number of those proofs of concept heading to production are also up, all of which are positive demand indicators for Dell’s server, storage and networking businesses going forward.

“Customers are getting real value out of AI. They have deployed it into real, difficult problems. There is a return on those investments,” he said. “I would look at our own company as an example of getting [a return] on investment, of investing in AI infrastructure.”

Dell expects to see a better second half for the rest of its business, Clarke said, with seasonal trends taking hold that should lift its storage business to gains in the fourth quarter, which will help margin.

During the second quarter ended Aug.1, Dell’s Client Solutions Group, which includes its PC business, grew 1 percent year over year to $12.5 billion. On the commercial side, sales were up 2 percent to $10.8 billion, but consumer sales dipped 7 percent year over year to $1.7 billion.

Inside industry tracker IDC’s most recent report on PC shipments among the top five PC makers globally, Dell, at No. 3, is the only company that lost share amid a refresh of devices this year that has lifted Lenovo and HP Inc.

There are less than 50 days until Windows 10 loses support from Microsoft and goes “end of life.” When that happens, hundreds of millions of PCs will lose product support for their operating system, and about half of those devices have not been refreshed, Clarke said.

“We have every intention to grow. We have every intention to outperform the marketplace and take share,” he said of PCs. “That’s our goal. We have not done that consistently enough. That’s problematic. We are focused on doing so. I’m not happy with the share performance. We’re going to turn that around, and we’ve reflected that in our guide, where we believe our business will grow mid-single digits and will improve our operating margins.”

Dell has recently reorganized its PC business, placing Clarke at the helm, which Dell Titanium partner Bob Venero told CRN is a signal the company plans to get aggressive about winning back the market. Venero is founder and CEO of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Future Tech Enterprise.

While Dell trails Lenovo and HP in overall global PC market share, the company still holds No. 1 positions inside the PC category, ranking first in North America desktops and North America for commercial PCs, PC workstations and PC monitors.

The company also leads in x86 servers, mainstream servers and several storage categories.

Clarke said there is a massive refresh opportunity in the traditional server market with 70 percent of Dell’s installed base running a 14th generation server. Dell’s newest 17th generation server is able to consolidate those devices at a 7-to-1 ratio. Clarke also said that while demand for traditional servers has picked up globally, in North America—its most profitable region—it has slumped amid a slowdown in large accounts and in federal spending.

“We had demand growth in all other regions, but North America, our most profitable region, was challenged from a demand perspective,” Clarke said. “We saw that again continue from what we encountered in April—federal spending continues to be down. That had an impact on our overall demand for the quarter. … In storage, it was what I tried to describe earlier as large accounts, particularly in North America, particularly in months two and three, was slower than expected.”",https://www.crn.com/news/data-center/2025/media_14119c9e3204240f3a2d1c15cfe450f5819ce64ec.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-08-29 14:15:24.603777

Liberty Steel plans $70M investment: The company aims to boost operations at its Peoria plant and relocate its headquarters from Dallas, creating 700 new full-time jobs

Funding challenges amid lawsuit: Despite legal hurdles, Liberty is ramping up production with backing from BlackRock and pursuing additional grants and loans

Path to 700,000-tonne capacity: Liberty expects to reach near-full production capacity in the coming months, supported by strategic pricing adjustments and market recovery

The lawsuit adds a wrinkle to Liberty Steel’s plans to raise an additional $70 million to invest in capital expenditures at its Peoria factory and cover the cost of relocating its headquarters from Dallas, Texas, to Peoria, representing a new investment above the capital funding of its ongoing ramp-up of operations at the plant.

A steel buyer said the lawsuit “is a blow [but] is a small consideration in the big picture [of the company’s new investment plan].”

“If the [new] financing is true and the market doesn’t collapse after its massive runup [in wire rod prices over the past year], they could be in a good position and the billet bill [from ArcelorMittal] would not have to be fatal,” the buyer said.

The steel buyer said Liberty is continuing its process of ramping up operations at the plant with funding previously obtained from investors led by BlackRock, the company’s investment bank.

An industry source familiar with Liberty’s operations said, “They’re working through that process and as they ramp up, they will be in a better position to handle all their liabilities.”

The buyer attributed Liberty’s losses over recent years to the company’s strategy of pricing below its competitors in a market overwhelmed by imports.

Investors in the restart led by BlackRock inserted terms in the funding that require the steelmaker to maintain pricing closer to that of domestic competitors to make their operations more financially sustainable, the buyer said.

“We started buying from them to assure they survive,” the buyer said, noting that other consumers and distributors of wire and wire rod had done the same thing.

Liberty idled operations at its Peoria plant in September 2024 and restarted operations in March 2025 after raising capital to resume operations.

BlackRock did not respond to a request for comment.

The industry source said the company expects to reach an output closer to its capacity of 700,000 tonnes of production a year over the next several months.

Liberty Steel declined to comment on either the lawsuit or its investment plans.

ArcelorMittal Long Products, based in Contrecoeur, Quebec, did not immediately respond to a query for comment.

Liberty Steel revealed its new investment plan July 29 in testimony before a meeting of the Peoria County Board in its bid to gain approval for a $2.65 million loan from the county and ultimately their approval if its relocation plan would bring an additional 700 full-time jobs to Peoria.

The company also said it is applying for a $25 million grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

The move increases PepsiCo’s stake in Celsius to roughly 11%.

In a joint statement today (29 August), the companies confirmed PepsiCo would pay $585m for 5% convertible preferred stock.

Celsius has also acquired the Rockstar Energy brand in the US and Canada from PepsiCo as part of the new agreement.

Following the deal, PepsiCo will manage distribution in the US and Canada of the Alani Nu brand, which Celsius bought in February for $1.8bn.

PepsiCo continues to own Rockstar in its international markets.

The Gatorade maker also plans to select an additional director for Celsius’ board as a result of the deal.

“This agreement leverages the respective strengths of Celsius Holdings and PepsiCo to scale the combined energy drink portfolio with a more unified commercial strategy”, a joint statement from PepsiCo and Celsius said.

John Fieldly, chairman and CEO of Celsius Holdings, said, “Stepping into the role of PepsiCo’s strategic energy drink captain in the US is expected to be a pivotal milestone in our journey to shape the future of modern energy and grow our brands within a leading beverage distribution system.

“With a proven functional beverage portfolio and a stronger long-term partnership with PepsiCo, we believe that Celsius Holdings is well-positioned to deliver greater innovation, sharper execution and sustained brand growth. Together, we will reach more people, in more places, more often, with a total energy portfolio that offers options for every consumer and creates greater value for all our stakeholders.”

PepsiCo acquired a 8.5% stake in Celsius in 2022 for $550m. As part of the agreement at the time, PepsiCo was to take on the US distribution of Celsius’ products and was to become “the preferred distribution partner globally for Celsius”.

Ram Krishnan, the CEO of PepsiCo’s US drinks business, said the deal “marks the next step in PepsiCo reshaping its brand portfolio to position us for long-term growth”, and would generate “a stronger multi-brand energy portfolio that is better positioned to serve different consumer cohorts”.

The companies said the move gives Celsius “the opportunity to drive the strategic direction of a unified energy portfolio through seamless planogram design, SKU prioritisation and promotional execution”, while PepsiCo can “further scale and expand distribution, streamline commercial strategy, reach different consumer cohorts and better serve customers”.

Gross profit rose 5.9% year over year to $1.35 billion and surpassed our estimate of $1.31 billion. Meanwhile, the gross margin expanded 33 basis points (bps) year over year to 37.1%. This growth was primarily led by increased merchandise margin and leverage on occupancy costs from higher sales.

Meanwhile, the company’s sales have struggled over the past three years as price-sensitive shoppers put off big-ticket purchases.

CEO Corie Barry said customers had become more deal-focused and waited for shopping events such as Black Friday and back-to-school promotions, even though spending remained resilient.

“Big-ticket purchases are approached more carefully, though consumers continue to spend on expensive technology when there is a clear need or innovation,” Barry said on a post-earnings call.

On a media call with journalists, she said that the White House had been open to feedback from corporate America on the impact of tariffs.

Strong sales of Nintendo Switch 2 gaming consoles, which were launched in June, and a surge in demand for artificial intelligence-powered laptops and mobile phones helped reverse a sales decline during the quarter.

“Tariffs and a pullback in discretionary big-ticket categories remain a drag, and unlike general merchandise [retailers], Best Buy has limited fallback categories to absorb that pressure,” eMarketer analyst Suzy Davidkhanian said.

Selected energy efficiency measures could make quick wins

Producer countries need context-specific solutions

DHAKA, Bangladesh - The world's demand for fast fashion has allowed greenhouse-gas emissions to rise despite ambitions to decarbonise supply chains by 45% by 2030.

More than 600 fashion companies have adopted science-based targets for emissions reduction, compared with just over a dozen in 2019.

Yet the sector's emissions grew by 7.5% in 2023 from the year before, said a report last month by the Apparel Impact Institute (AII).

Aligning with the goal of limiting global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees Celsius under the Paris Agreement would require slashing fashion's absolute emissions from 0.944 gigatonnes to 0.489 gigatonnes in the next five years, according to the AII report.

The problem is that many brands pledge reducing their emissions intensity, meaning emissions divided by revenue or gross profit, so as they grow, they pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, said a recent study by the German think tank New Climate Institute.

Since making their pledges for decarbonisation, 40% of brands saw their emissions grow in absolute terms, according to an analysis by consulting firm McKinsey & Co.

In one case, emissions by the Singapore-based fast-fashion giant Shein Group grew by 18% in 2024, as it uses air freight rather than container vessels to ship its products the world.

More than half of apparel emissions take place upstream, in the fossil-fuel intensive processes of washing, dyeing and finishing in Asian textile mills.

That leaves brands seeking ways to reduce emissions by their suppliers in apparel production countries.

Brand in/action

Apparel makers can cut carbon emissions and reduce energy use by replacing fossil fuel-fired boilers with renewable-powered electric boilers for heating water and setting up rooftop solar panels in factories.

Small efficiency measures like recovering and reusing waste heat generated during heating water, plugging leaks and installing better insulation could provide energy savings of 5% to 18%, said a study commissioned by the United Nations' Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action.

More costly investments in energy efficiency - such as upgrading boilers and redesigning heat systems - could cut the sector's energy use by half, it said.

Most of these actions would need to take place in textile factories, but suppliers competing with one another to offer brands the lowest prices for their products have few resources available for decarbonisation investments.

Funding could come from banks or specialised funds.

Banks like HSBC are offering concessional loans to clients for projects like installing energy efficient water-heating equipment, and AII's fashion climate fund plans to secure $10 million from seven major funders including H&M Group and Lululemon by 2030 to fund affordable climate solutions for manufacturers.

Brands' participation in decarbonisation investments has been sparse. In a 2023 report, McKinsey said overall only 1% of brands had entered into shared investment with their suppliers.

Energy-efficient investments can have long pay-back periods of ten to 15 years, and suppliers making the investments would need long-term business commitments from brands, said a paper commissioned by the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action.

Country differences

Asian countries like Bangladesh, China, Vietnam and Cambodia, which account for 65% of global apparel production according to HSBC, have country-specific challenges to decarbonising textile.

While China's use of solar power and India's renewable energy capacity have grown, their textile mills still use boilers fired by coal - a big source of emissions.

Bangladesh has only a small share of renewable electricity in its national grid.

Brands like H&M are testing direct corporate purchases of electricity from renewable power producers in Vietnam, and in Bangladesh the company has been backing exploration of new technologies like wind energy and solar panels mounted on structures that float on water.

A major boost came from the high-profile launch of Nintendo Switch 2, which pushed June sales up nearly 10%—the retailer’s best month since March 2021, per Bloomberg Second Measure, which tracks US debit and credit transactions.

The results: The company topped expectations on both revenues and earnings:

Adjusted EPS fell 4.5% YoY to $1.28, beating analysts’ forecast of $1.22.

Revenues increased 1.6% YoY to $9.44 billion, above the $9.24 billion expected.

Despite the beat and Q3 sales trending toward the high end of its forecast, Best Buy reaffirmed its full-year guidance. The retailer expects revenues of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $6.15 to $6.30 (In May, it had lowered its profit outlook from prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.60). CFO Matt Bilunas cited uncertainty over potential second-half tariff impacts—on both consumers and the business—as the reason for caution.

Tough landscape: Best Buy faces persistent headwinds. Elevated interest rates and a weak housing market have weighed on appliances and other big-ticket items, while tariffs have raised costs and forced the retailer to hike some prices.

Still, CEO Corie Barry said on the earnings call that consumer behavior has been largely stable across recent quarters. Customers are “resilient but deal-focused,” which has helped drive traffic during promotions like the company’s July sales event.

Shoppers remain “thoughtful” about large purchases, she noted, but are willing to spend when needed or when new technology emerges.

DKS’ Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics & Insights

Net sales of $3.65 billion improved 5% year over year and surpassed the consensus estimate of $3.59 billion. The upside was driven by robust comps and healthy transaction growth. DKS continued gaining market share from online-only and omnichannel retailers.

Consolidated comps grew 5% year over year, backed by a 4.1% rise in average ticket and a 0.9% jump in transactions. Our model estimated comps to grow 2.7%. This reflects almost a 9.5% two-year comp stack and an 11.5% three-year comp stack.

DKS Records Higher Margins & Expenses

Gross profit rose 5.9% year over year to $1.35 billion and surpassed our estimate of $1.31 billion. Meanwhile, the gross margin expanded 33 basis points (bps) year over year to 37.1%. This growth was primarily led by increased merchandise margin and leverage on occupancy costs from higher sales.

The adjusted SG&A expense rate of 23.7% rose 110 bps year over year. Adjusted SG&A expenses, in dollar terms, grew almost 9.9% year over year to $864 million and were higher than our estimate of $848.1 million.

DKS’ Financial Health Snapshot

DICK’S Sporting ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. It had a total debt of $1.5 billion as of Aug. 2, 2025. Total inventory rose 7.1% year over year.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company repurchased 1.4 million shares under its share repurchase program for $299 million in the 26 weeks ended Aug. 2, 2025. It had $212.9 million remaining under its authorization as of the same date. DKS also paid $5 million in fiscal 2025 for shares repurchased in the prior fiscal year.

It paid quarterly dividends of $196 million for the 26 weeks ended Aug. 2, 2025. On Aug. 27, 2025, the company's board announced a quarterly cash dividend of $1.2125 per share on its common stock and Class B common stock. This is payable Sept. 26, 2025, to its stockholders of record as of Sept. 12.

During the second quarter, the company introduced one House of Sport location and four DICK'S Field House locations.

On May 15, 2025, DICK’S Sporting Goods entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Foot Locker, Inc., a leading footwear and apparel retailer, in a transaction valued at approximately $2.5 billion. The deal has already received shareholder and regulatory approvals, with closing expected on Sept. 8, 2025. Management highlighted this acquisition as a major strategic milestone that will create a global leader in the sports retail industry, broaden its consumer reach, and strengthen partnerships with top athletic brands. The company reiterated that the transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings per share in the full fiscal year post-close and to deliver $100-$125 million in cost synergies over the medium term, primarily from procurement and sourcing efficiencies. DICK’S Sporting also expects to leverage Foot Locker’s deep sneaker expertise and cultural relevance through its well-established portfolio of banners.

What to Expect From DKS in FY25?

DICK’S Sporting raised its full-year fiscal 2025 guidance following a strong second-quarter performance, which does not include acquisition-related expenses, investment losses or results from the pending deal to acquire Foot Locker. Management now expects comparable sales growth in the low single digits and earnings per share toward the higher end of prior guidance.

It projects net sales in the band of $13.75-$13.95 billion compared with $13.4 billion recorded last fiscal. The company expects comps growth of 2-3.5%, up from the 1-3% mentioned earlier.

DKS continues to envision earnings to be $13.90 to $14.50 per share compared with prior expectations of $13.80 to $14.40. Management anticipates gross margin expansion supported by favorable product mix, brand partnerships, and contributions from GameChanger and the DICK’S Media Network. Operating margin is expected to be around 11.1%, with a potential 10 basis points of expansion at the high end. Capital expenditures are planned at roughly $1.2 billion gross and $1.0 billion net, with $65 million to $75 million in pre-opening expenses concentrated in the fiscal third quarter to support the largest-ever rollout of 13 House of Sport and 6 Field House stores.

Without revealing data from the phase 2a Daisy proof-of-concept study, J&J said that after 12 weeks, Imaavy provided no added benefit when added to an anti-TNFα therapy in patients with refractory RA.

“Based on these findings, Johnson & Johnson has decided not to proceed with the clinical development of nipocalimab in combination with an anti-TNFα therapy for RA,” the company said in its release.

Despite the setback, J&J added that it is still “confident” that Imaavy can live up to the $5 billion-plus peak sales potential the company has pegged for the FcRn-blocking monoclonal antibody.

J&J is investigating Imaavy in a host of immunology disorders, including Sjogren’s disease (SjD). Last year, the company presented data from a phase 2 study that demonstrated the effectiveness of an FcRn blocker for the first time in SjD.

The results helped earn a fourth FDA fast-track designation for Imaavy, with the others coming in gMG and two maternal fetal diseases.

J&J picked up Imaavy as the primary piece of its $6.5 billion acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals in 2020.

The infused treatment isn’t the first FcRn binder on the market for gMG. Argenx got there first in 2021 with an FDA nod for its blockbuster Vyvgart. Two years later, UCB scored with its FcRn drug Rystiggo. Imaavy could become the top seller in the indication as it has the broadest label.

According to a report by The Financial Times, Dentsu has engaged Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley and Nomura Securities to gauge market interest in acquiring its international assets, which could fetch several billion dollars in a potential deal.

The decision comes amid a challenging global environment for the advertising industry, with Dentsu facing underperformance in its international markets. The company’s international operations, which include the US-based digital marketing consultancy Merkle and assets from its 2012 acquisition of Britain’s Aegis Group for approximately 400 billion yen, generated over $4.5 billion in net revenue last year.

However, regions outside Japan have struggled, with organic revenue declining by 8.9% in Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan), 3.4% in the Americas, and 2.4% in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) for the first half of 2025.

This contrasts sharply with Japan’s strong 5.3% organic revenue growth during the same period.

The company has not finalised any decisions but aims to formulate a firm plan by year-end, according to sources cited by The Financial Times.

During a recent post-results Q&A, Dentsu’s CEO, Hiroshi Igarashi, hinted at openness to “bold” structural changes, including potential partnerships or divestitures, to enhance competitiveness. “We are looking at various options to increase corporate value,” a Dentsu spokesperson told Jiji Press, emphasising that no decisions have been made.

The potential sale could attract interest from rival advertising companies, private equity firms, and other investment groups, with analysts pointing to players like Accenture Song, large independents, or private equity as possible buyers. However, industry observers note that competitors like Omnicom and IPG are unlikely candidates due to their focus on an impending merger set to conclude by year-end. Stagwell and MSQ have also been mentioned as potential suitors for specific assets like Merkle or regional networks, though a full takeover of Dentsu’s international business, valued at around $4.5 billion in revenue, may be too large for some.

This move follows a series of challenges for Dentsu, including an 8% global staff reduction announced on August 15, 2025, aimed at streamlining corporate and back-office functions.

The layoffs and potential divestiture signal a strategic pivot, with Dentsu likely refocusing on its stronger domestic market in Japan, where it remains a dominant player.

The potential sale could reshape the global advertising landscape, reducing competition for industry leaders like WPP and Publicis while offering opportunities for consolidators or financiers to acquire valuable assets.

Dentsu’s retreat from international markets underscores the difficulties Japanese agency groups face in sustaining global expansion, a challenge also seen with peers like Hakuhodo and ADK.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/bmi/media/media_files/2025/03/21/Ernep50MZH5rwWJg1HiP.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:34:00.946090

ID15,Cushman & Wakefield,2025-08-29 14:32:56+00:00,The Business Times,"Singapore mall landlords are adapting to changing consumer habits, but there's room for ...",Chong Xin Wei,,,,,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/singapore-mall-landlords-are-adapting-changing-consumer-habits-theres-room-new-approaches,"[SINGAPORE] In a difficult retail market, landlords of managed Singapore malls are adapting their strategies to the conditions, with moves such as flexible leases, tenant curation and marketing support.
But industry players say there is still room to explore new approaches to help retailers cope with changing consumer habits.
This meant rents for about 25 per cent of its mall space rose by roughly 3 per cent a year, and overall mall rent increased 0.75 per cent year on year.
A well-curated mall can boost tenant sales, which in turn supports higher rents, he added.
“The pandemic played a role in accelerating this shift, as both landlords and tenants faced unforeseen challenges,” said SRA’s Koh.","[SINGAPORE] In a difficult retail market, landlords of managed Singapore malls are adapting their strategies to the conditions, with moves such as flexible leases, tenant curation and marketing support. But industry players say there is still room to explore new approaches to help retailers cope with changing consumer habits.

High rents have long been a point of contention.

Rent takes up between 10 and 30 per cent of a retailer’s operating costs, said Ernie Koh, president of the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA).

“While landlords seek to maximise returns on their properties, tenants – particularly small businesses – often struggle to keep up with the ever-increasing costs,” he pointed out. “This situation has sparked debates on the sustainability of such pricing models in a highly competitive market, particularly as tourism recovers and rents approach pre-pandemic levels.”

Cushman & Wakefield data showed that prime monthly rent for Orchard malls in 2024 was S$35.83 per square foot (psf), just over the 2019 average of S$35.77 psf. In suburban areas, prime rent had risen to S$32.90 psf last year, from S$31.76 psf in 2019.

For many retailers, especially those in high-traffic or prime locations, the effect of even modest rent increases can snowball into a punishing tide when sales are flat or falling.

Major real estate investment trusts (Reits) have reported positive rental reversions, allowing landlords to renew leases or fill spaces at higher rates.

Leading suburban mall player Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT) reported positive reversions over the past five years, except in FY2021 when it was negative 0.6 per cent amid Covid disruptions.

In FY2024, FCT’s rental reversion rose to 7.7 per cent from 4.7 per cent in the previous year, with its malls posting positive reversions of 4 to 8.8 per cent, driven by active asset management and strong leasing demand.

CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT), Singapore’s largest landlord with 21 assets, posted an 8.8 per cent rental reversion in FY2024. This meant rents for about 25 per cent of its mall space rose by roughly 3 per cent a year, and overall mall rent increased 0.75 per cent year on year. This was “well within inflation levels”, explained Ervin Yeo, group chief strategy officer and commercial management chief at CapitaLand Investment.

Since 2018, tenant sales per square foot at CapitaLand malls have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 1.9 per cent, outpacing rental growth of 0.7 per cent, he noted.

Speaking with The Business Times, Yeo said that rent adjustments are a “trailing indicator” that surface only at renewal. What matters more, he stressed, is occupancy cost – the ratio of rent to sales – which has stayed below 20 per cent over the past decade for the group’s portfolio of malls.

Still, occupancy cost averages can mask disparities. “Averages can hide struggles in specific tenant segments,” noted RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan. “Landlords need to look at performance more granularly – by trade, category or tenant type – to identify where support or adjustments are needed.”

Recognising these disparities, CICT monitors occupancy costs by trade categories as each business type has different operating models and margins.

“This reflects the rental rebates, marketing support and flexible arrangements we (have) provided to help tenants manage costs,” added Yeo. “Ultimately, our goal is for our tenants to succeed, as their success is integral to the vibrancy and long-term performance of our malls.”

Support measures, tenant curation

A Starhill Global Reit spokesperson pointed out that food and beverage (F&B) tenants, in particular, continue to grapple with rising operational cost, manpower shortage and changing consumer patterns that have weighed on footfall and margins.

“These are industrywide challenges, and probably the best way forward is through a strong landlord-tenant collaboration to achieve a long-term sustainable solution,” the spokesperson added.

Starhill, which owns prime Orchard Road malls Wisma Atria and part of Ngee Ann City, works with underperforming tenants to help grow revenue, including through joint marketing efforts, sharing shopper insights, and operational support to boost visibility and sales.

CapitaLand leverages its scale to help tenants manage costs, including by negotiating bulk electricity rates.

Landlords are also now more intentional in curating their tenant mix, an approach that helps shoppers find what they want and discover new offerings efficiently, said Natarajan.

For instance, clustering F&B options in one area improves navigation, while placing complementary stores near each other – such as a department store next to an electronics store – spurs spending.

A well-curated mall can boost tenant sales, which in turn supports higher rents, he added.

While tourist numbers at Starhill’s malls are rising, spending has slowed, with people spending more on experiences and entertainment – a trend exacerbated by regional economic challenges, said the Reit’s spokesperson.

Wisma Atria, which counts Burberry and Emperor Watch & Jewellery among its luxury tenants, has shifted towards a “more balanced” trade mix, bringing in younger brands such as Vivaia, popular for its machine-washable shoes, and Chinese beauty brand Joocyee.

Since 2024, Frasers has brought on board more than 150 new tenants across its malls, about half of which are retail specialty concepts and the rest in F&B, said Adrian Tan, managing director of retail at Frasers Property Singapore.

New additions in its neighbourhood malls include Sinpopo Coffee at Tampines 1, and Putien Mama and Munchi Pancakes at Tiong Bahru Plaza.

Flexibility in leases

Curating the right mix is just one lever. Landlords are increasingly using flexible lease structures to help retailers find their footing.

“The pandemic played a role in accelerating this shift, as both landlords and tenants faced unforeseen challenges,” said SRA’s Koh. “Flexible leases, which allow for rent adjustments based on foot traffic or sales, are becoming more common in certain retail spaces.”

At CapitaLand, such arrangements have long been part of the toolkit, with some leases shorter in duration and sometimes carrying a higher turnover-rent component, noted Yeo.

“Flexible leases are not meant to replace traditional models, but rather to complement them,” he added. “It allows us to activate underutilised spaces, pilot new concepts and bring in new-to-market brands and fresh retail experiences that enhance shopper engagement and support the asset’s long-term competitiveness.”

Brands such as Beyond The Vines and Omnidesk started as pop-ups and are now permanent at Funan. Coffee bar Alchemist operated as a pop-up for 11 months before moving into a shared space with local fashion label Arcade Clothing at Funan.

Korean lifestyle brand Wiggle Wiggle, which held a pop-up at Plaza Singapura in March, is now exploring longer-term opportunities with CICT, said Yeo.

Frasers also offers shorter-term leases for new and emerging brands. Successful concepts can then transition to standard, longer-term leases, as seen with The JeJe Korea and Mondays Made at The Centrepoint.

“These arrangements extend beyond traditional shop units and apply across a variety of mall spaces, supporting a dynamic retail mix, allowing tenants to adapt and grow in line with evolving shopper preferences,” said Tan.

While flexible leases offer opportunities for experimentation, they are not without risk. Desmond Sim, CEO of real estate consultancy ETC and member of the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee, observed that lease flexibility and rent controls can affect a mall’s valuation.

“Property values depend heavily on the predictability of income during the initial term – typically the first three years – after which the income is capitalised for the remainder of the lease or into perpetuity,” he added. “Regardless of how long your mall has been operating, its value hinges on the stability of its income.”

Yeo said: “As our malls are mostly Reit-owned, maintaining income stability and delivering long-term value for unitholders remain key priorities. We balance lease flexibility with a solid base of long-term tenants to ensure resilience in our rental income.”

What else can be done?

Singapore’s retail sector needs to look beyond traditional high-traffic areas, pointed out SRA’s Koh. Mixed-use developments can offer a more sustainable environment for tenants and ease reliance on high rents.

Landlords can also tap underused mall spaces for pop-ups. Sim noted that retail is now a “very visual and experiential” business, where creative, immersive in-store experiences can drive sales.

CapitaLand has partnered Enterprise Singapore to invite local brands to showcase their most innovative store concepts. Winning concepts will receive up to one year of retail space – up to 4,000 square feet – at malls including Plaza Singapura, CQ @ Clarke Quay, and Funan.

The government can also provide incentives to boost spending at shops selling local brands or at neighbourhood malls, said Natarajan. But broader rent control is not feasible as prices are market-driven.

SRA’s Koh added: “The future of Singapore’s retail sector may rely on a new equilibrium, one that considers not just the interests of landlords but also the sustainability and vibrancy of the tenant ecosystem, ensuring that the retail landscape remains dynamic and diverse for years to come.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/a6db78e3f09b7a722c9b6d87e17b15e85a7d79558c267d499042e160cdb15f3b?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-08-29 12:35:47.014227

Also in 2024, PepsiCo reached 81% of convenient foods volume not exceeding 1.1 grams of saturated fat per 100 calories, besting the 75% target that the company said was first met in 2021.
“We’re continuing to evolve the nutritional profile of our best-selling brands,” PepsiCo said in the 2024 ESG Summary.
Dovetailing with PepsiCo’s nutrition strategy are increased efforts to become more transparent with product labels.
PepsiCo, too, said it will continue to update the label for its beverage portfolio in the United States and Canada to include the “Refresh then Recycle” call to action for recycling.","PURCHASE, NY. — PepsiCo Inc. is making strides in its nutrition strategy, led by reaching goals to cut beverage calories from added sugar and reduce sodium in convenient foods ahead of schedule.

In an update on its pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) sustainability and nutrition plan, the food and beverage giant said that through the end of 2024, it has achieved all three of its 2025 targets for lowering saturated fat and sodium in convenient foods and added sugars in beverages. The 2024 ESG Summary, released Aug. 28, outlined the company’s progress through the end of last year in its nearly four-year-old pep+ sustainability and transformation initiative, with nutrition falling under the “Positive Choices” umbrella.

Earlier than expected, PepsiCo said it hit a target for 67% of its beverage portfolio to contain fewer than 100 calories from added sugars per 12-oz serving and surpassed its 2025 sodium reduction goal, with 77% of convenient foods portfolio volume now not exceeding 1.3 mg of sodium per calorie. Also in 2024, PepsiCo reached 81% of convenient foods volume not exceeding 1.1 grams of saturated fat per 100 calories, besting the 75% target that the company said was first met in 2021.

“We’re continuing to evolve the nutritional profile of our best-selling brands,” PepsiCo said in the 2024 ESG Summary. “Our Positive Choices goals focus on accelerating the reduction of added sugars in our beverages, reducing sodium and saturated fat and increasing servings of diverse ingredients that we deliver in our convenient foods as we continue evolving our portfolio offerings to meet the varied taste and expectations of consumers.”

PepsiCo noted it’s also making headway on a pair of nutrition goals for 2030 that were announced in November 2023. By the end of this decade, the company aims to have at least 75% of its global convenient foods volume meet or be below category sodium targets and to deliver 145 billion portions of “diverse ingredients” annually in that product portfolio. Via the latter goal, each portion will provide about 10% of the suggested daily amount of a diverse ingredient — such as legumes, whole grains, plant-based proteins, fruit, vegetables, and nuts and seeds — to foster a “more nutritionally diverse diet,” PepsiCo said.

Through 2024, 44% of the global convenient foods roster met or was below category sodium targets, up from 36% in 2023, and 69 billion portions of diverse ingredients were delivered, up from 68 billion in 2023.

“We saw a slight year-over-year increase toward our diverse ingredients goal, and we remain focused on further advancing our progress,” PepsiCo said in the ESG Summary report.

Dovetailing with PepsiCo’s nutrition strategy are increased efforts to become more transparent with product labels. The company said its global policy is to comply with all relevant labeling laws and regulations in all markets where its foods and drinks are sold. For example, labels now reflect the conversion of Pepsi to lower sugar formulations in markets such as China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and India and the company’s US Lightly Salted product line as containing 50% less sodium than its traditional counterparts. PepsiCo, too, said it will continue to update the label for its beverage portfolio in the United States and Canada to include the “Refresh then Recycle” call to action for recycling.

“Pep+ is not a sustainability strategy; it’s an ongoing transformation that powers our whole business, from innovation to production, marketing to distribution,” said Ramon Laguarta, chairman and chief executive officer of PepsiCo. “When we rolled out pep+ in 2021, we knew it would be important for the long-term strength of our company. Since then, we have worked towards creating value for our shareholders, customers and communities while aiming to make PepsiCo more resilient and overcome systemic barriers that limit progress. I look forward to continuing this critical journey with our associates and partners, as we strive to prove that growth and sustainability go hand in hand.”",https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/ext/resources/2025/08/29/AdobeStock_457565965_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg?height=635&t=1756476579&width=1200,N,,2025-08-29 12:36:24.268323

Arvato has further expanded its e-commerce distribution center in Stryków, Poland, and installed an automated shuttle storage system with a capacity of up to 270,000 cartons. “It is currently the largest system of its kind in Central Europe and also the first time that we have implemented this automation technology at one of our sites in Poland,” says Lidia Ratajczak-Kluck, Managing Director of Arvato in Poland.

With both measures, Arvato is completing the expansion of the logistics site for H&M. A new hall with a high-bay warehouse has been built, in which self-propelled reach trucks are used for order picking from shelves up to 8.7 meters high. With the current expansion of 16,000 square meters, including the mezzanine areas, the Stryków site now has a total of 98,000 square meters of warehouse space, 31,000 square meters of which are mezzanine floors.

The logistical centerpiece there is a new KNAPP shuttle system, which occupies around 10,000 square meters of the newly created space. Products can be stored there on 16 levels along 15 aisles. The facility is equipped with 144 shuttles that move at speeds of up to 70 kilometers per hour. In conjunction with the conveyor lines, which cover around five kilometers, this enables even faster storage and retrieval. The main challenges in implementing the project included the integration of several IT and infrastructure systems, which required very precise coordination and cooperation between Arvato and the solution providers, as well as the implementation of fire protection regulations during the installation work. At the same time, staff were given intensive training in the new technology.

With the commissioning of the shuttle system, Arvato has now fully automated the entire goods receiving process in the warehouse, from the unloading ramp to the storage of goods in high racks or in the shuttle system. “We’re excited to celebrate the completion of the expansion of the online logistics center in Strykow, now enhanced with a higher level of automation. This expansion marks another step forward in our close collaboration with Arvato, which began in Poland in 2018. It’s a strong commitment to deliver an exceptional customer experience across the region in the years ahead, while adapting to advancements in available technology” says Nicolaus Fournarakis, Regional Sales & Warehouse Operations Manager, H&M. Within Arvato's global network, the site serves as a regional logistics hub, enabling fast deliveries to several markets in Central and East

Europe. Lidia Ratajczak-Kluck: “Poland is a growth market for us with very good conditions for strengthening our own international presence and that of our clients.” Arvato operates a total of 16 distribution centers with more than 360,000 square meters of warehouse space at seven locations in Poland.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Arvato_Opening_of_the_new_shuttle_system_for_H_M_in_Stry_kow.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 11:23:00.319209

In conclusion, HCA Healthcare and Boston Scientific demonstrate that geographic and operational diversification are not merely defensive strategies but foundational pillars for outperformance.","A survey by Roland Berger found that three-quarters of German hospitals posted losses in 2023, with the figure rising to almost 90% for public institutions. Hospitals are facing significant deficits, with some reporting losses of over 100 million euros. Despite this, the number of hospital insolvencies has not increased as sharply as expected. The management consultancy expects mergers and closures to become more common, with hospitals investing in outpatient care and digitization.

In a landscape marked by regulatory uncertainty and macroeconomic turbulence, healthcare companies are leveraging strategic diversification to navigate challenges and maintain resilience. Two prominent players, HCA Healthcare and Boston Scientific, exemplify this approach, offering valuable insights for investors navigating the healthcare and medical device sectors.

Geographic Diversification: A Buffer Against Volatility

HCA Healthcare and Boston Scientific have adopted geographic diversification as a core strategy to mitigate localized risks and capitalize on growth opportunities. HCA's Q2 2025 revenue of $18.6 billion was distributed across three regional groups: the National Group ($5.2 billion), Atlantic Group ($6.1 billion), and American Group ($6.5 billion) [2]. This segmentation helps HCA adapt to regional challenges, such as state-specific Medicaid reimbursement cuts or regulatory shifts. For instance, the Atlantic Group’s performance in the Northeast, a region historically affected by stringent cost controls, demonstrated 4.8% year-over-year growth.

Boston Scientific's geographic spread further illustrates this advantage. The U.S. contributed 30.7% of its Q2 2025 revenue ($3.224 billion), but the company also capitalized on emerging markets. The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region grew 15.4% organically to $790 million, and Emerging Markets rose 12.1% to $758 million [1]. This diversification not only cushions against U.S.-centric regulatory shocks but also taps into growth in underserved regions.

Operational Efficiency: The Engine of Margin Resilience

Operational efficiency is another critical factor driving resilience. HCA Healthcare achieved a 20.7% adjusted EBITDA margin ($3.85 billion) and $4.210 billion in operating cash flow in Q2 2025 [1]. These figures reflect disciplined cost management and a focus on high-margin services. Boston Scientific’s Cardiovascular segment, which accounts for 66% of revenue ($3.345 billion), achieved 23.2% organic growth by streamlining supply chains and accelerating product approvals [1]. Such efficiency is essential in a sector where pricing pressures and reimbursement delays are persistent headwinds.

Innovation as a Strategic Multiplier

Both companies are investing heavily in innovation to future-proof their growth. HCA’s AI-driven Enhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR) programs and EHR interoperability initiatives reduce hospital stays and improve patient outcomes, directly boosting margins [1]. Meanwhile, Boston Scientific’s partnerships with startups and its focus on digital innovation, such as the FARAPULSE™ Pulsed Field Ablation system, position it to address unmet needs in interventional cardiology and neuromodulation [3]. Notably, Boston Scientific’s EMEA expansion, including the Accurate Prime Valve, underscores its ability to tailor innovations to regional clinical demands [2].

Strategic Guidance and Investor Implications

HCA Healthcare’s raised 2025 guidance—$74–76 billion in revenue and $14.7–15.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA—reflects confidence in its diversified model [1]. For Boston Scientific, its 2025 innovation roadmap, emphasizing collaboration and R&D, signals a commitment to sustaining growth in a competitive landscape [3]. Investors should prioritize companies that combine geographic breadth with operational rigor and innovation, as these traits are increasingly non-negotiable in volatile markets.

In conclusion, HCA Healthcare and Boston Scientific demonstrate that geographic and operational diversification are not merely defensive strategies but foundational pillars for outperformance. As regulatory and macroeconomic headwinds persist, their ability to adapt, innovate, and scale will define their long-term resilience—and offer compelling opportunities for forward-looking investors.

The records repeatedly refer to the agency as “IPG Mediabrands India”, whereas the correct legal entity is Mediabrands India Private Limited.

This error is not just clerical but has had material implications. The misnaming highlights what insiders describe as a “pattern of ambiguity” in CCI’s investigation, which has led to unavoidable confusion among the companies under scrutiny.

The peition filed by TLG India Private Limited against CCI in Delhi High Court also highlights, ""Based on the limited availability of documents with the Petitioner and to the best of our knowledge we understand that “IPG Media Brands India” also does not refer to any specific legal entity registered in India.""

The flaws of CCI is not limited to IPG Mediabrands. French advertising giant Publicis Groupe’s Indian arm, TLG India Private Limited, has moved the Delhi High Court, challenging the CCI’s probe on similar grounds.

According to the petition (reviewed by Storyboard18), the proceedings were wrongly initiated against “Publicis Groupe”—a brand name and trademark—rather than any recognized legal entity. The company argued that “Publicis Groupe” is neither a juristic person nor an “enterprise” as defined under Section 2(h) of the Competition Act, 2002, and therefore cannot be subjected to investigation.

Publicis maintains that TLG India Private Limited is the appropriate legal entity to be named as the opposite party in the case. However, despite this clarification, CCI’s investigative arm, the Director General (DG), issued a summons to Anupriya Acharya, who holds the internal designation of CEO, Publicis Groupe South Asia. Publicis clarified that “Publicis Groupe South Asia” does not exist as a registered company; it is merely a corporate title for regional leadership.

The petition emphasized that “Publicis Groupe” is a commercial tradename, commonly used to describe the corporate group globally, but it does not correspond to any incorporated entity in India or France.

By contrast, rival groups named in the same Suo Motu case—such as WPP (through GroupM Media Pvt Ltd), Omnicom (through Omnicom Media Group India Pvt Ltd), Havas (through Havas Worldwide India Pvt Ltd), and Dentsu (through Dentsu Aegis Network India Pvt Ltd)—were all identified with precise, legally recognized Indian entities.

This unequal treatment, Publicis argues, undermines the legitimacy of the CCI’s actions. Any investigation initiated against a non-entity, the petition says, is “not valid in law.”

The petition comes in the backdrop of a sweeping CCI probe launched in March 2025 into suspected price-fixing and collusion among major ad agencies on publicity rates and discounts. The investigation followed dawn raids on leading advertising groups including Publicis, WPP’s GroupM, Dentsu, Omnicom, Havas, Madison, IPG, and also extended to industry bodies such as the Advertising Agencies Association of India (AAAI), the Indian Society of Advertisers (ISA), and the Indian Broadcasting and Digital Foundation (IBDF).

The procedural lapses in naming both IPG and Publicis have raised larger concerns within India’s advertising and media industry. Legal executives point out that inaccuracies in identifying parties can not only derail legal proceedings but also erode confidence in regulatory actions.

The court has listed the matter for the next hearing on October 9, 2025, and also ordered that a copy of the prima facie opinion passed by the regulator in Suo Motu Case No. 2 of 2024 be produced on the next date.

Regina: Good afternoon. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you’d like to ask a question during this time, simply press *1. To withdraw your question, press *1 a second time. Thank you. Parmeet Ahuja, you may begin the conference. Thank you.

Parmeet Ahuja: Welcome everyone to Agilent’s conference call for 2025. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO, and Rodney Gonzalez, Agilent Vice President and Interim CFO. Joining the Q&A will be Simon May, President of the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group, Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, and Mike Zhang, President of Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The press release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation, and information to supplement today’s discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today’s comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You’ll find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website.

Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or in financial metrics are year-over-year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth is adjusted for the impact of currency exchange rates and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past twelve months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. As a reminder, beginning in 2025, we implemented certain changes to our reporting structure related to the reorganization of our three business segments. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes and have provided the financial details on our website. These changes have no impact on our company’s consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company’s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Padraig.

Padraig McDonnell: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today’s call. Agilent delivered outstanding results of $1.74 billion in revenue in the third quarter, exceeding our guidance while continuing to transform our enterprise operating model in a highly dynamic environment. We also delivered $1.37 earnings per share in the quarter. Thank you to the Agilent team who has remained laser-focused on our customers and committed to our mission of advancing the quality of life. Our fiscal 2025 third quarter marks our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential core revenue acceleration, a testament to how we’ve evolved our enterprise strategy to be market-first and then realigned our businesses to our markets. For this fiscal year, we’ve gone from 1.2% in Q1 to 5.3% in Q2 and now 6.1% in Q3.

Q&A Session

Just as important, our two-year growth stack also is improving, showing that this is a durable momentum, not just a short-term bounce. The two-year stack is a summation of our growth over two consecutive years, providing a clear view of sustained performance by smoothing out short-term quarterly fluctuations. Given this strength, we are raising our fiscal 2025 full-year revenue guidance to the range of $6.91 to $6.93 billion, representing a core growth of 4.5% at the midpoint. This is a $150 million increase from our prior range at the midpoint and one and a half percentage points of additional core growth. A clear step up in our growth outlook heading into Q4. This upgrade reflects our confidence in delivering another step up of revenue into Q4 even as we absorb the impact of tariffs this year.

Momentum is broad-based and led by our two largest end markets, pharma and chemicals and advanced materials. In Q3, both grew 9% and 10%, respectively. In pharma, small molecule grew double digits fueled by demand in downstream QAQC and adoption of our Infinity Tree LC platform. GLP ones also continue to drive demand, both for our leading analytical lab solutions and the unique capabilities we bring with BioVet. In chemical and advanced materials, demand rebounded across all major geographies. This was supported by new investments in the semiconductor and chemical sector, with robust uptake in our GC and GCMS platforms. We also saw healthy contributions from our food and diagnostics and clinical end markets. And the academia and government end market returned to modest growth despite continued funding pressures in the US.

Environmental forensics was the only market to decline as changes in the US EPA led to some cautiousness on new capital spending. Despite this temporary headwind, our market-leading PFAS business grew low double digits globally during the quarter. Against the tough compare of nearly 50% growth last year. Demand outside the Americas continued to be excellent with broad-based growth in the low thirties. PFAS remains an excellent opportunity with strong, long-term demand drivers intact globally. Powering the strength of our execution is our Ignite enterprise operating model. This year, our value-driven approach to pricing delivered results that were twice the impact of last year. At the same time, we streamlined the enterprise by reducing management layers by more than 15%.

That didn’t just remove cost. It gave us speed. Making decisions faster and empowering our teams to be agile. We’re also taking a consistent enterprise-wide approach to manufacturing and procurement. These efforts already are delivering double-digit savings in key cost categories. And we see even greater opportunities ahead as we scale these practices globally. Our Ignite tariff task force has shown the power of the model in action. In a highly dynamic environment, we reorganized supply chains, shifted production across our global footprint, and implemented targeted pricing actions. Giving us confidence we can fully mitigate the impact of tariffs in 2026 at current rates. Ignite continues to be a differentiating growth driver for Agilent. It is proving that by embedding new tools, enhanced capabilities, and smarter ways of operating across the company, we unlock the full scale of our enterprise.

That means stronger performance today and resilience and growth for tomorrow. Innovation also continues to be a major driver. Our Infinity Tree LC platform delivered mid-teens growth with early adopters coming back for larger follow-on purchases based on superior performance and productivity gains. And the Pro IQ LCMS system is tracking well ahead of our launch forecast, winning key accounts at major pharma customers. The new system performance benchmarks open new app possibilities across pharma and biopharma, and are resonating strongly with customers, as evidenced by strong funnel growth during the quarter. Also, the newly launched DACO OMDAS family brings our gold standard fully automated pathology class platform to a broader range of lab sizes.

Capturing a new market segment and strengthening our diagnostics portfolio. Together, these platforms are not just driving near-term revenue, they’re continuing to build a foundation for sustained growth into FY ’26 and beyond. This growth is supported by a strong funnel, and accelerating customer adoption across our portfolio, demonstrated by an instrument book to bill above one for the last six quarters. Importantly, we expect Q4 to be our largest revenue quarter of the year, with core growth of 5.4% and revenue of nearly $100 million higher than Q3 at the midpoint of our guidance. Our sequential momentum and two-year growth stack remains solid. And combined performance of the second half provides a sound foundation as we look into FY 2026.

The growth we expect in Q4 is underpinned by healthy demand for key platforms, strong funnel conversion, and broad-based strength across our end markets. The latest industry data is evidence of our continued superior commercial execution with market share gains across all major geographies. The combination of strong top-line performance and stable operating margin means we have successfully delivered to our bottom-line commitments throughout the year. However, we did have higher expectations for margin improvement in the quarter. The increasing revenue growth also comes with additional tariff expenses and higher variable pay. We’ve invested in our commercial capabilities to support our growth now and into the future. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver significant sequential margin improvement as increasing revenue combined with additional Ignite benefits will result in accelerated profit leverage.

Rodney will provide some additional details in his remarks. Now let me tell you more about why our Q3 was so strong. Starting in our largest end market, pharma, we grew 9% during the quarter and continue to see steady improvements we referenced seven quarters now. This quarter saw a positive momentum in funnel conversion as lab managers are increasingly able to access and spend their available capital budget. There is reduced dependence on executive-level approvals that have slowed or stopped spending in the recent past. Our long-time lab-wide enterprise service relationships with large pharma allow us to capitalize on these improving conditions with deeper visibility into customer needs. Ensures we are in the right place at the right time, with the right solution when lab managers are looking to replace aging instruments and expand capacity.

In our second largest end market, chemical and advanced materials, we delivered 10% growth with broad strength globally. Growth was balanced between two submarkets. We saw increased capital investment from chemical customers and robust demand in advanced material space and investments in new semiconductor fab facilities globally continue to progress. Our market leadership in key product platforms for these markets position us well to capture this significant instrument replacement opportunity in a market that has seen several years of underinvestment investments. All our business segments delivered revenue growth that exceeded guidance for the quarter. The life science and diagnostics market grew 7% core growth was led by excellent low double-digit performance for LC and LC MS instruments, leveraging our recent Infinity Tree launch and focused LCMS solutions for key applications across both pharma and the applied markets.

LDG also saw another strong quarter from our CDMO business, NASD and BioVectra. NASD grew in the high twenties as we see continued growing demand for our RNA modalities in clinical and commercial programs. BioVectra also delivered on expectations while planned facility shutdown to work with a key customer to transition to a higher throughput process. In the applied markets group, growth of 5% was also ahead of expectations. Breaking down the performance our market-leading platforms, GC, GCMS, and spectroscopy delivered strong growth in Q3 with encouraging momentum in the chemicals and advanced materials. Food, and pharma markets. Geographically, all regions deliver growth led by Asia ex China, and EMEA. The geographic growth in AMG was driven by investment from supply chain reshoring, greenfield opportunities, capacity expansion, and replacement from our large installed base.

Also, our recent launch new products, including the 8850 GC, continue to ramp up ahead of expectations as customers are attracted by their exceptional performance superior lab productivity gains, and leading sustainability benefits. The Agilent CrossLab Group delivered 5% growth in Q3, better than we had guided. The CrossLab team drove mid-single-digit consumables, supported by our focus on e-commerce and digital. This was a strong result despite the $50 million tariff-driven pull forward of sales in Q2 that we mentioned during our last call. Services business grew mid-single digits led by strength in the applied markets in Europe. 90% customer satisfaction. Satisfaction. And meeting our vision of our customers to feel confident, valued, and inspired.

Lab activity remains strong, giving us confidence in the fundamental strength of this business. Plus the increasing pace of instrument sales for replacement of aging fleets and large where capital budgets have been reduced or withheld expansion for new capacity, and growing demand for automation, bodes well for CrossLab business into the future. It provides a cycle to generate customer lifetime value through connections of high-quality consumables, software, services, automation to maximize instrument utilization and overall lab productivity. Turning now to our geographic results, we saw broad-based growth. With all regions growing at least mid-single digits during the quarter. Our business in Asia ex China continues to capitalize on opportunities from reshoring of supply chain growing 10%.

And we saw increasing safety regulations across the region drive an excellent mid-twenties percent growth for our food markets. Within the region, India continued to lead the way with broad strength across our end markets resulting in 20% overall growth. We are seeing great success with the Infinity Tree as existing and new in pharma QAQC environments look to benefit from its productivity improvements. As the country invests to build domestic semiconductor, and EV manufacturing capabilities, we are seeing increased demand for our solutions in these markets. India is a strategic growth market for Agilent. As part of our increasing investment there, I visited India in July to open Agilent’s Biopharma Experience Center in Hyderabad. This center will bring together advanced lab technologies, efficiently.

expert training, and regulatory-ready workflows to help researchers scientists, and companies develop high-quality, life-saving medicines faster and more efficient In Europe, growth of 7% was also broad-based. With double-digit growth in pharma and food and high single-digit results in chemical and advanced materials and academia and government. In China, results continue to be stable as expected. Growing 4% during Q3. We saw some government funding flow to some of our academia and government customers during the quarter. Based on our interactions with customers and local officials, continue to expect a more meaningful stimulus impact towards the end of this calendar year primarily in our applied markets. In the US, the challenging conditions for biopharma spending and in academia and government space persisted.

Outside of those areas, we saw nice low double-digit growth in small molecule pharma and chemicals and advanced materials. Improved capital spending has driven instrument placements, leading to a 5% growth in the Americas in the quarter. We continue to meet the challenge presented by the dynamic environment for global trade. Tariff expenses were higher than our prior expectations as we saw a meaningful increase in shipment volumes and increased inventory to support Q4 growth. We continue to leverage our unique Ignite enterprise operating model to optimize our use of global production networks. Manage our diversified supply chain to optimize materials cost, and where required, make pricing adjustments to offset added cost. Leveraging Ignite, we still expect that we will fully mitigate the impact of tariffs either through avoidance or other offsetting opportunities in FY ’26.

And before I hand it over, I want to take a moment to introduce Rodney. Some of you might know him from a period where he led Agilent’s investor relations team. For those who do not, Rodney has been an integral part of the finance leadership team at Agilent for many years. He has been a principal accounting officer for the last ten years, We are also leading our FP and A team. I am delighted at how he’s been able to seamlessly step in and lead our finance organization while we conduct a thorough search for our next CFO. Rodney will share further details about our Q3 results and guidance for Q4 and the full year. Thanks, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone.

Rodney Gonzalez: In my comments today, I will provide additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as walk through the income statement, and cover other key financial metrics. I’ll then cover our updated full-year and fourth-quarter guidance, Q3 revenue was $1.74 billion above the high end of our guidance. On a core basis, we posted growth of 6.1% while reported growth was 10.1%. Currency had a favorable impact of 2.1% which was a point and a half better than what we estimated as part of our guidance. M and A contributed 1.9% in line with our expectation. Gross margins in Q3 came in at 53.1%, down year on year driven by currency, tariffs, and the impact of downtime to expand capacity at BioVectra as Padraig mentioned earlier.

Operating margin was 25.1% in Q3, and has been consistent across the year in increasingly challenging conditions. Ignite is enabling us to translate top-line growth into bottom-line results while we continue to invest in innovation and growth. As Padraig indicated, margins were below expectations. We’ve seen roughly equal impact from three areas. First, our higher revenue volume drove up net tariff costs as we shipped additional products and backfill logistics centers to support Q4 growth. Even while full tariff mitigation is still on track for FY 2026. Next, we increased variable pay expectations. Higher awards driven by stronger business performance, consistent with our pay-for-performance culture. Finally, we invest in incremental commercial spend required to support short and long-term revenue growth including for critical product launches and improving our geographical coverage.

For Q4, we are targeting a sequential operating margin improvement of approximately 230 basis points We expect most of this improvement to come from leveraging our fixed cost as we drive another sequential increase in volume. We are also getting meaningful contribution from both excellent margin conversion on the significant step up in CDMO revenue in Q4 and delivering another step up in Ignite benefits. With the partial offset due to higher tariff costs. Now moving below the line, we had $6 million of income, while our tax rate of 12% was as expected. And we had 285 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.37 That was at the high end of our expectations. And grew 4% from a year ago.

Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash was $362 million in the quarter, down versus last year as working capital was up on volume growth and tariff-related inventory build. We also incurred severance costs related to our organizational efficiency efforts, Additionally, we invested $103 million in capital expenditures. We purchased 85 million shares and paid out $71 million in dividends during the quarter. And we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.9 so we continue to have a very strong balance sheet. Now let’s move on to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $1.82 to $1.84 billion This represents an increase of 4.8 to 6% on a core basis and 7.1 to 8.3% on a reported basis.

Currency and M and A are expected to be 0.2 to 2.1% tailwinds, respectively. Also, to help you with your models, I want to provide you with additional details on expectations for growth in our end markets during the fourth quarter. In pharma, we’re expecting mid to high single-digit growth with stable to improving conditions. In chemical and advanced materials, we’re guiding high single-digit growth with another quarter of healthy capital investment expected. In diagnostics and clinical, as well as in food, we expect mid-single-digit growth Finally, we expect very low single-digit growth in environmental and forensics. And mid-single-digit decline in academia and government as those markets face a difficult compare for US federal spending at the end of the fiscal year.

Fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.57 and $1.60 representing leverage earnings growth of 7.5 to 9.6%. We expect a 12% tax rate $9 million in other income, and 284 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning to the full year, as Padraig mentioned earlier, we are raising our revenue outlook. We now expect our full-year reported revenue to be in the range of $6.91 billion to $6.93 billion This represents an increase of 4.3 to 4.6% on a core basis and 6.2 to 6.5% on a reported basis. Currency is now expected to represent a small headwind for the year, while we expect a 2% revenue impact from M and A. Our full-year EPS guidance is now $5.56 to $5.59, unchanged at the midpoint versus our prior guidance. And we continue to offset additional tariff costs across the second half.

This represents a year-on-year increase of 5.1 to 5.7%. For clarity, let me briefly summarize the updated tariff assumptions that we incorporated in our FY 2025 guidance. Based on the rates currently in place, we are now anticipating $20 million net cost for the year up from the minimal impact we guided in May. This increase is due to our better-than-expected revenue performance across the second half. As well as the 50% tariff increase on imports from Europe announced at the beginning of the month. Strong demand for our LC products that are currently produced in Europe until US-based production begins to scale later this quarter also amplifies the impact of the recent European tariff increase. Finally, for your modeling, we are now projecting an increase of other income and expense to $26 million in income.

Along with a 12% tax rate for the year and 285 million diluted shares outstanding. Now I’d like to turn the call back to Padraig for closing comments. Padraig,

Padraig McDonnell: Thanks, Rodney. These strong results are a testament to the progress we’ve made as a company over the past year. We are encouraged by the growth momentum we have created and look forward to building on that success next quarter and into the future. Thank you for your attention. Hand over now to Parmeet to kick off for Q&A. Parmeet?

Parmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Operator, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.

Regina: At this time, I’d like to remind everyone in order to ask Our first question will come from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.

Dan Brennan: Great. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just the first one on the margins since obviously top line really strong, but the margins were light as you kind spoke to them. Can you just unpack the three variables you kind of highlighted? Kinda how much are you spending? How much are you buying more inventory for yourself? How much was that a factor? You know, in question, you know, the topic number two and three, variable pain and spend. I’m just wondering, like, what the return on that is as as we think about the 4Q guide and we think about jumping off into 26% to that do some of those investments benefit you in ’26? So any any help on kinda unpacking those, and then I have a follow-up.

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. So first of all, you know, really committed to our long-term commitment goals around margins. And know, as tariffs along with related logistics costs were the biggest single impact that we had And the net impact in dollars will trend downwards at the start of ’26 and will fully mitigate tariffs ’25 And and I wanna kind of be clear that the headwind will peak in Q4. in ’26. But, to your question about, the area, so it’s higher tariffs driven by higher than expected volumes. Incremental commercial investment, and, higher variable pay in equal measure. Let me talk a little bit about the commercial investments and why we’re doing it. So you see the demand and the the revenues, the demand for a replacement cycles, and our markets are going up.

We’ve did a lot of work on our commercial org over the years and making it effective But now is the time to invest invest for this demand that’s gonna go into ’20 to make sure we can capture it and increase increase our market share, which we’re already doing on it. So I don’t know, Rodney, if you wanna give any more color on that, but that’s that’s how it breaks out.

Rodney Gonzalez: No. I think, Padraig, those are very good points in terms of why we were below our expectations for the quarter. When we look at it from a year-on-year basis, we were down about 230 basis points Again, the big thing was tariffs and and logistics related costs associated with those tariffs. And that total would be about 200 basis points on a year-on-year basis. It was pretty significant. On top of that, we saw unfavorable we saw the effects of currency. And also the effects of the, bio vector shutdown. So when you look at all those piece together, that’s why we saw our operating margins decline about 230 basis points year on year.

Dan Brennan: Got it. Okay. I know there’ll be a bunch of more questions there. But maybe just a second one, just on pharma. Super strong. I think I heard NASD growing kind of north of 20%. So can you just unpack a little bit on what the outlook calls for for kind of in the back half of the year and as we look ahead? And then know you gave some color on, you know, large pharma being strong, sounds like there’s still some headwinds with biologics. Maybe just some more color underneath of what you’re seeing in pharma. Kind of how we think about the pharma outlook from here.

Padraig McDonnell: No problem, Dan. I’ll I’ll kick it off, I’ll hand over to Simon about NASD. So pharma, you know, it’s our largest end market, grew 9% overall. Small molecule grew double digits, and that was really fueled by demand for downstream QA strong adoption, an increasing replacement of the Infinity Tree, which is now mid-teens in terms of growth. And what we’re seeing from the Infinity Tree is actually early adopters coming back for a larger which is really positive. On the biopharma side, we saw high single digits overall and, you know, ex NASD were flat, and that’s really around US biopharma spending continues to be muted, which was expected. But what we’re seeing really in the market is we’re not seeing any concerns translate into negative impact around MFN or tariffs at all, but we have we have early indications of a standard year end in terms of customer spend in pharma.

So customer budgets are have really started to normalize, and customers are asking for larger quotes to spend by the year end. And if you think about the three major drivers in pharma, really, you’re seeing three big areas, global redistribution of small molecule supply chain, which is a net tailwind for us, which is really important on on downstream. Manufacturing capacity investments, we’re seeing that in in Americas. Asia, and you and and then Europe driven by you know, blockbuster success and GLP ones, etcetera, but also macroeconomic conditions. And and, you you know, you do see capital budgets in biopharma remain conservative venture capital funding. But we do think over time as interest rates come down, that will be released steadily over time.

But on the NASD, part, I’m gonna hand it over to Simon.

Simon May: Yeah. Thanks, Padraig. I’d say for NASD we were very happy with the quarter overall, and we continue to be very happy with the momentum we see for NASD both as we move towards the end of the year and into 2026. As I think we mentioned in the script, we saw really robust revenue growth well into the 20s, for an ASD, It was also another really solid quarter with orders, And as we look at some of the macros that we’re seeing out in the field as well, it was very notable quarter in terms of some approvals and label expansions that we saw out in the marketplace. Which really just emphasized the confidence that we have. In this therapeutic modality and also our capabilities to capitalize therein. So as we put it all together, we’re happy with the momentum that we have coming into the end of the year.

I think we’ve said previously for the full year, we’re looking at high single digit, nudging double digit. I’d say we’re increasingly confident now where the double-digit full-year outlook is concerned. Bit too early to call FY ’26 but I’d say we’re also tentatively confident about the momentum carrying forward there in stay tuned for more over the coming weeks.

Parmeet Ahuja: Terrific. Thank you.

Regina: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Tycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. I want to probe a little more on the pharma comments just kind of reduce dependency on sign-offs that that you noted. I’m just curious, how widespread is that? Is that globally? Is it CDMOs, just large pharma? How much pent-up demand, I guess, do you think there is that could come through with this you know, change in in sign-off dependency?

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. No. We’ve really noted that across all geographies actually within particularly within small molecule, but in large pharma, of course, bio small to medium biopharma is slightly different in that regard. But what we’re seeing is, Tycho, is really that replace cycle that we’ve talked about. We’ve always talked about it being gradual. Moving ahead, and people are releasing budgets for it. I would say the velocity has improved in that. And we’re releasing larger quotes for the end of the year. So that’s always bodes very well for the for for the end of the year. And when you when you have, approvals not going to executive or even higher levels in the company that’s giving given into the hands of lab managers, or or site managers, that makes a big difference in momentum.

Tycho Peterson: Okay. And then a follow-up on PFAS Was that a little bit softer in The US? I know you talked about it being up 10% overall, but it it seems to imply that US was maybe down or or pretty soft the quarter. I’m just curious if there’s something going on there.

Padraig McDonnell: Sorry. Sorry. Maybe you can’t hear me now, but I’ll repeat that. So low double-digit growth overall in Q3, which is a solid result, 50% year-to-date growth remains a really strong opportunity. In Americas, we were down 20% and that was really around the US EPA changes that drove impact. No policy change that impacts the volume of testing, but uncertainty around CapEx spend. And increasing clarity around the EPA changes will will mean there’s a little bit of a question over Q4 and Q1, but overall, I would say, PFAS is going extremely well around, around the globe.

Tycho Peterson: Okay. Maybe just one last one. The commercial investments that you flagged, when when did you decide to move forward with those, and why they baked into into the guide?

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. So look at it. You know, you deal with what’s in front of you and where you’re see your momentum in terms of orders, and we had a you know, as we many years transforming our commercial organization into one centralized area globally. We have a number of product launches that are coming out, and we are way ahead of our ramp to volumes both on the Infinity Tree and, for example, on the ProIQ LCMS. So so it was really a dynamic situation and, come from commercial and experience over many, many years, you need to get investment in early when the when the market start to come back, and you have opportunities because it’s a very competitive place. We want to gain share not only in our accounts, but in competitor accounts. And we want to continue to raise our ability to have technical expertise in the field to really help with that.

Tycho Peterson: Okay. Thanks.

Regina: Our next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Rachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just wanted to push on 2026 expectations here. If we look at your fourth-quarter guide, the midpoint really implies around like a 5.5% organic growth rate at the midpoint And it looks like consensus is right around that number for next year as well. So can you just walk us through the moving pieces on 2026? Is taking that fourth-quarter number and rolling it into next year a reasonable starting point? Or are there things that we should be thinking of?

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. I’ll I’ll start off, I’ll hand it over to Rodney. I think, you know, of course, it’s too early to give out, any detail on the guide for ’26. But on the revenue side, let me talk about revenue and margins. And revenue, the second half of ’25 was most meaningful. Meaningfully stronger than the first and that provided really that provides a really positive indication momentum into ’26. And while while, of course, we need to remain mindful of the broader economic environment and more challenging comps, we do see this as a a solid foundation for for for growth. And on the margin side, you know, we’ve addressed many of the challenges in ’25 and tariffs being the largest and we expect tariffs to be fully mitigated within the year, and that should provide a tailwind And, of course, we have Ignite that’s gonna drive us forward on it. But, Rodney, I don’t know if you wanna give more color ’26.

Rodney Gonzalez: Yeah. I I yeah. Padraig, I think you know, you mentioned some of the tailwinds that we saw, particularly on the margin side, both as we continue to mitigate tariffs, we will see improvement from a margin perspective as we go into into ’26. I think the other thing is we’ll as as you mentioned, we’ll continue to see savings as associated with Ignite. One of the things we still need to be factoring in is what kind of cost increases we may be seeing from our from our suppliers. So that would be a bit of a tailwind that we’re still looking at.

Rachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then just as my follow-up here, I wanted to ask around budget slash assumptions. Padraig, you mentioned a little bit how pharma companies are putting in some larger orders before year that they have some more visibility on budgets overall. So are you embedding any budget flush assumptions into that fourth-quarter guide? Or would that be upside Thank you.

Padraig McDonnell: Yes. So I think we’re we what we’re seeing is quotes actually at this stage, not orders, for the end of the end of the year. And the early early, indications that it’s more of a standard year-end in terms of of budget flush. And I think it’s been quite a few years before since we’ve seen that, and everybody knows the history. In our markets. But customers are starting to budgets start to normalize and seeing larger value quotes is is is, what we see in it. So we’re we’re guiding with what we see at the moment.

Regina: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Michael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to touch on chemicals and advanced materials. Really, strong quarter there and kind of up on it being pretty broad-based. We’ve had some more mixed data points there, so that was a little bit of surprise. Could you just talk a little bit more about, you know, where you saw it geographically? Sort of what gives you confidence that there was no pull forward and that’s, that that’s a little bit more sustainable going forward?

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think, you know, it’s been, fantastic in terms of growth, 10% growth in Q3 broad-based 10% in chemicals and advanced materials. And our, you know, our strong position in our leadership in our platforms is really important, and our our really strong connection with customers But but really driven by three areas, I would say, Q3. I think, capacity growth from supply chain regionalization is very true for that. That market. Greenfield investments, by the way, in both broad chemicals and advanced materials, and actually replacement momentum. We’ve often talked about this, Aled, that it’s not only LC replacement cycles that are important, but we’re now starting to see replacement investments as we go forward on it.

And it’s driven, I would say, by you know, the chemical sector continuing to lead driving demand in downstream industries like semiconductor and, of course, energy growth in AFO, which is gonna continue, and The Americas, that’s gonna continue. So I think overall, I think we’re really pleased with results. We see that continuing. And we see that continuing particularly in in in in both of those areas as as we go forward.

Michael Ryskin: Okay. And then following up on, Rachel’s question just now and kinda taking it back to the margin topic. I think you quantified tariffs for third quarter. Could you remind us what the tariff hit is on the margin line for all of fiscal year ‘twenty five? And then when you talk about fully mitigating for next year, it’s just, you know, just making sure the simple math is we’re just kinda assuming that at a least that much is how much comes back next year, on the gross margin line. Is that the right way to think about when you talk about, you know, being able to offset for next year?

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. So I think, you’re thinking about it the right way. You know, I think we focus in three areas on the tariff side with mitigation, leverage an existing manufacturing footprint, around the globe, working with suppliers to relocate, manufacturing locations to minimize tariffs, and, of course, targeted pricing changes. And we see the most critical activities implemented by Q4 and ramping through ’26. But the key element of our mitigation that it will be implemented by the ’25 will ramp through ’26. So I think, Rodney, I don’t know if you wanna add any color to that, but how we see it.

Rodney Gonzalez: Yeah. Yeah. I I think the only other point, Padraig, is that, yeah, we recognized about $35 million We we were originally looking about $25 million in tariffs tariff costs in the third quarter. That’s up about $10 million and we expect the same level in the fourth quarter. So $70 million for the second half. And again, we have a lot of our actions. We are plan most of our plan mitigation actions will be implemented by the end of this quarter. And so we should start seeing that, those the impact to our our gross margins as we start moving into Q1 and through, through ’26.

Michael Ryskin: Okay. So $70 million for the year for ’25. Alright. Thanks.

Regina: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.

Patrick Donnelly: Thanks taking questions. Maybe just stay on that same topic there that Mike was on on the on the margin side. I guess, given that tariff piece, given Ignite, obviously, some temporary costs in this quarter impacting the margin, You know, Padraig, I know when we’ve talked in the past, you you’ve always kinda said, hey. There’s a reason we put the plus sign on on the margin algorithm for the out years. I guess, is next year setting up that it has that potential to be an out margin year given kind of the headwinds this year that will not recur next year? Just trying frame that you know, if if you are able to grow, you know, call it over 5%, it feels like it has that potential, but just wanna if that makes sense and and see if you could throw some numbers around it.

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. Look. There’s three really key tailwinds, I think. You know, Ignite continues to drive gains. We’ve we’ve delivered, a lot of gains over us Tariff mitigations will be will be higher and will ramp through the year. And the volume should be should be really a helper on it. So overall, I think, in good shape. Of course, it’s too early to guide on us. And to say what it’s gonna be, but Ignite is there for a reason. We put out a 100 basis points plus for a reason, and we still feel very, very good about that as we go forward. I will say, also, you know, if you look at Q4 margins Patrick, it’s something to be really clear about is that they’re expected to really increase versus Q3. We’re expecting a 200 basis point sequential margin improvement from Q3 to Q4 when Q2 to Q3 was flat.

And that’s going to be driven by leverage on sequential uptick in revenue in Q4, which we have good line of sight of. And I think while in the increase the while we while revenue increased sequentially, you you know, the full quarter tariffs along with currencies were headwinds that offset against it and the incremental Ignite savings But I I think for next year, we’re in we’re in good shape.

Patrick Donnelly: Okay. That’s helpful. And then I guess maybe just in the quarter, know, what you saw on on kind of the pricing side, it was definitely a question we get. I think people are just seeing the margins and wondering if pricing is a part of that. So if you could just talk about what you saw pricing versus volume in the quarter and expectations going forward, that would be helpful. Thanks, Padraig.

Rodney Gonzalez: Yeah. Rodney, you wanna take this one? Yeah. I’ll I’ll take this one. Yeah. We’re actually starting to see some more movement in our pricing. And for the quarter, we saw about a 100 bps improvement in pricing.

Patrick Donnelly: Okay. Thanks.

Regina: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.

Jack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask about how you think the trade tariff dynamics are influencing your customer buying behavior. Last quarter, you talked about the $15 million of consumable pull forward, dollars 15 million instrument push out. Did that play out as expected? And then just anything incremental that you saw in terms of stocking, destocking? Thank you. Yeah. I mean, Jack, thanks for the question. On that side, nothing. You know, we we we did talk about that pull forward in consumables last quarter, which worked itself out very, very quickly. And maybe I’ll ask Angelica to add more color on this in a in a second. But we have seen no pull forwards. We’ve seen nothing in terms of Scott’s stocking. We we’ve monitored that quite quite quite closely, so so nothing on that side. And I would say lab activity remains very very strong. But, Angelica, on the consumables side, maybe you can give some color.

Angelica Riemann: Yeah. Thanks, Padraig. Again, thanks, Jack, for the question. You know, as as Padraig has already said, we had the pull through in Q2, but we had mid-single-digit growth in Q3, which is no indication of any further pull forward. The lab activity we’re seeing is is continuing to support the demand here. No doubt about it. We had good growth across all of our end markets and across our regions. So we’re continuing to see strong lab activity, driving strong recurring revenue demands.

Jack Meehan: Great. And we expect that to continue. Okay. And then a unrelated question, was curious about the China diagnostics market, saw the reference to Daco ex China. A lot of questions around VBP and DRG just for the universe broadly speaking. Do you mind just reminding us what your exposure is to China Diagnostics and what, if any, you’re seeing in regard to those topics?

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. So, I mean, our exposure is is is very low in China in terms of diagnostics. It’s a very stable business as we go forward on it. But Simon, do you want to give some color on the the China story? With BBB? We’re not really being impacted by it.

Simon May: I think the long story short is that we’ve seen minimal impacts so far as we look at our diagnostic tools in China, we do see some local vendors there. But where Agilent’s product offering is concerned, we’re really serving more advanced staining applications, and I think we got a pretty esoteric product offering and menu there. So pressure, but I don’t think we’ve really seen that trickle through in a meaningful way.

Jack Meehan: Okay. You, guys.

Regina: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.

Vijay Kumar: Congrats on a nice line print here. Maybe on the top line question here. The I I think last quarter, in second quarter, there was some some instrument impact, if memory serves me. Correct. Did TQ benefit from from timing element here on on instrument side? The the sort of another related actually, that top line question is, you mentioned tariff rate. When when you say pricing benefit, are you including surcharges as part of pricing? Could that explain part of, what we’re seeing here in margins? How much of this core beef was was in a tariff surcharge related in in the instrument catch up from prior quarter.

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. No. The thanks, Vijay. Just a few points on on the instrument side. Firstly, I think we’ve seen a steady improvement in replacements. You know, total instruments grew high single digits. And LCMS grew, you know, low double digits, we’re very very pleased with LC and LC mass growth in the Infinity Tree, of course, where we’re seeing on the, you know, the replacement cycle of aging fleets. And, of course, new new sites. In terms of pricing and surcharges, that that hasn’t been realized yet. That takes a while to go through the system. You know, we we have a tariff task force that is second to none that’s run through the Ignite program here where we look at data analytics So we do it in a very structured way, but that takes time to go through. So we’ll see those pricing in Q and ’26 and beyond.

Vijay Kumar: That’s helpful. And and off of the topic on on fiscal twenty six common part, like one of your peer they sort of hinted at end market growth, perhaps being in in the low single digit range. Maybe with some share gains perhaps pointing to, like, four plus. How like, is that is that is that a reasonable framework on how we think about Agilent? Or are there any anything that’s unique? Whether it’s a chemical exposure or China, anything that’s not I mean, that makes Agilent different versus, you know, how some of your peers have commented about fiscal twenty Yeah. Look. And I think, you know, we feel very positive about ’26 across all of our markets. You see the momentum this time through applied and and the pharma side.

Driven by the top line. We think we’re going to see that continue. Over time. I think as you look at different areas, what makes us different? I think China, there’s gonna be a large stimulus order coming towards the end of the year where you’d highly successful in that in the past. We’ve kept very focused with our teams there. So we we expect China to kinda continually improve through ’26 And, of course, that that area is is really important. And and I think as well, CDMO mix is very different. You know, 20% growth in NASD. BioVectra, we prime the pumps for for for ’26. That’s gonna be a high grower, and some of the indications are are really really great on it. So I think that’s really important. And, you know, we’re you you you see our results in our chemical and applied materials.

You know, these are secular drivers we we have significantly high market share, and that’s gonna continue because of reshoring or fabs about where they’re being built. Of course, battery investments in EVs, technology, and that makes us, I would say, very differentiated as well.

Vijay Kumar: Understood. Thank you.

Regina: Next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.

Doug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for taking my questions. I want to start on guidance philosophy. So on on one hand, I I know you guys know that it’s particularly important to set financial targets at levels that are especially derisked. Given how difficult the last few years have been across the tool space. On the other hand, you clearly had a lot of strength in the quarter, and you seemingly have really strong momentum heading into year end. How do you balance momentum and strength with the goal of maybe skewing the error bars around your guidance targets to the upside? Maybe asked a different way, how would you describe your visibility on on hitting these targets heading into year end?

Padraig McDonnell: Heading into year end, we have very good visibility. You know? I think particularly on the order book and what we put out on our guide boat on on revenue and margins. I think ’26, you know, we we we don’t give out guidance. You know, Doug, on it, but you know, we do see that this positive momentum is not gonna just stop at the end of ’25. We’re gonna continue to see it. Now what that what that relates to GUIDE and, of course, a lot can happen between now and the end of our fiscal year in the in the the macro environment, tariffs, etcetera, So we will we’ll be giving guidance in the next half. But it’s it is it’s something we wanna be as as usual in Agilent, we wanna be very clear about what we’re putting out at the end of the year, and it’s clear and it’s achievable and going forward on it. So we’ll have more next quarter on that one.

Doug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you very much for that. And then the the next topic I wanna to talk about is capital deployment. So I I think your net leverage ratio was point nine times just under one How are you thinking about capital deployment? It seems like you’re feeling better about what you can control and and maybe even your ability to navigate some of the things that are outside of your control from a policy standpoint. So if that’s right, how does that impact your thoughts on M and A and or accelerating buybacks beyond dilution mitigation? And kind of related to that, how would you describe organizational readiness for something bigger given how how how many changes have occurred in leadership over the past year? Thank you.

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. So let me talk about the last one first because I think it’s a it’s a it’s a great point. If you see how Ignite is running inside and about how we’re being able to execute inside, I think that has usages beyond beyond Agilent if we if we do acquisitions in the future, whatever size they will be. So I think our readiness is extremely is extremely high on us. Our priorities are are not not overall changing, but we do expect M and A to be a more meaningful part of our capital deployment going forward. But I wanna be clear on three things, Doug, is it’s gonna be a disciplined approach that’s gonna be aligned to our pillars of our strategy so you won’t see any far far distant areas that are not linked to the strategy.

We’re gonna be focusing on growth opportunities and, of course, value to shareholders. So, so if you came into our our business development sections, we have a small list of very high-quality topics we’re talking about. But, also, internally, we’re investing back in the business. Invested heavily in digital this year. A new CRM system, new online capabilities, we’re investing back in commercials that that goes along hand in hand with that. So so I think it’s it’s gonna be a very disciplined approach, but we’re we’re, we’re we’re ready, as as we go into ’26. I don’t know, Rodney, if okay. That’s fine.

Doug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you again, Padraig.

Padraig McDonnell: Thanks, Doug.

Regina: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.

Puneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Padraig and team. Thanks for taking my questions. First one really on the momentum or a change in momentum, if you saw that between July and August, you are clearly pointing to a strong, you know, book to bill for the last couple of quarters, but just trying to get a sense of if there’s an acceleration in the near term. And and, obviously, you’re seeing a normal budget flush replacement cycle is working. So I just wanna get a sense of is there is there something you saw differently in August? And so and if you could double click on the pharma versus the side of the of of the end markets where you’re seeing more stronger pickup. Thank you.

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. So I think, you know, we definitely saw a pickup, and it’s reflected of course, in in the numbers that we’ve seen. We’ve we’ve seen a a pickup in quoting activity. We saw significant pick up in replacement cycle. Although it’s gradual over time, we did see that in July and August that people are replacing their systems aging fleets. And then, of course, this new greenfield opportunity that you see in both markets, pharma, and in, in chemical and advanced materials benefiting from that. So I would say that overall, really good. Our book to bill is greater than one that continues on that side. Our win rates are extremely good. Our market share gain, which a little bit offset a few months ago, we’re gaining across the board in in all plat in all platforms and geographies.

So, the it is it is it is positive. Now, of course, people have quotes for the end of the year, and we expect we we weight those quotes in terms of what we expect to come in, and that’s leading to more of a standard year-end CapEx area on it. So and and just to finish off, I would say, if you look at it pharma and and and chemical and applied or chemical and vast materials applied, actually the momentum in both of those major markets is pretty similar. You know, you got a replacement cycle starting on the plat replied side. Probably a lit bit later than the the pharma side, and then you’re you’re into well into the first innings of a replacement cycle on the LC side. So that’s what we’re seeing. But driven as well, you know, by adoption of our new platforms, you know, the the new LCMS the ProIQ, and the Infinity Tree really making a difference in customer spending patterns.

Puneet Souda: Got it. And then just a follow-up on China. Can you just elaborate a bit on what you’re seeing in their quarter in China in third quarter? And you talked about stimulus coming through. Maybe just give us a sense of the you know, is that driven by more quoting activity? Is that what what gives you that confidence and and, you know, sort of the magnitude of it? Thank you.

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. So I start off, and I’m gonna hand over to Mike on the stimulus topic, because he’s quite close to it. So, two of the largest end end markets, you know, led the results in the quarter. We saw small molecule continues to grow. We grew about 6% Biopharma grew mid-single digits, and we saw that through particular focus on innovative biopharma. Right? So ADCs, oligo or oligos and GLP ones. The CAM market in China grew low teens, and that was led in two areas. Petrochemicals continued to benefit from lower crude oil prices, so, that’s very beneficial to us. And, with advanced materials, China continue continues to build out the domestic semiconductor ecosystem, which is really important. There is a new development within China where there’s unleashing what is called a new quality product productive forces policy, which is around innovation and investing in innovation.

And that’s gonna be launched by central government that’s gonna increase the pace of innovation across, many industries. And we are extremely well poised to benefit from that because we’ve invested in a solution center and a lab productivity center that really fits in that. We’ve actually seen some of some of the orders or quotes for that. Going out. But, overall, I think, China’s stable. We see that kind of improving as we go into ’26 because of those drivers. But on the stimulus, Mike, do you want to talk a little bit about what you’re seeing right now?

Mike Zhang: Yeah. Greg, first of all, we have a very strong relationship with customers and we are working with customers very closely, continue to support a customer as they prepare for the investment. And we continue to build a strong funnel. Obviously, if, you know, it takes time to materialize, but we’re still very excited about the potential And, if you look at the track record, we have very strong and a high win, rate. So, so we are we’re very excited about that potential.

Puneet Souda: Okay. Thank you.

Regina: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.

Dan Leonard: Thank you. My first question is a clarification on the pricing front. Rodney, I think you said pricing was a 100 basis point year-over-year tailwind. But before you also mentioned that value-driven pricing was double the impact of the prior year. So can you help me reconcile those two comments? I thought pricing might have been a bit better a year ago. This is Rodney. No. It was about 50 bps last year. Year on year, and and as I said earlier, about a 100 bps this year. Okay. That’s square. Thank you. And then just my follow-up question here. I don’t think I’ve I’ve heard you talk so much about the replacement opportunity in the chemical market. Since the launch of the Intuvo, and that was a very long time ago. So can you maybe help frame that replacement opportunity that you’re alluding to, Padraig?

Padraig McDonnell: Yeah. For sure. I’m gonna bring in Mike here on on the AMG side to talk about that.

Mike Zhang: Yeah. First of all, as Padraig just highlight, we have a very strong market share in this market, and we have a very large installed base. Intruba certainly is, you know, a a great innovation, but we continue to evolve innovation that we have to find Intubers. We continue to put that into, you know, the current platforms And we are seeing a lot of momentums, as you can tell because the customer continue to improve the productivities, embrace embracing the new technologies. But I think what’s more important well, let me take, you know, the new GC we just launched as an example, like eighty fifty GC. It’s a perfect replacement by to advance the technologies and productivity sustainability that customer are looking for.

From us. So overall, I think, you have to, remember our strong position in the market, our very strong portfolios, our continuous innovation. But what’s more exciting that we have a strong pipeline innovation to drive as this replacement cycle continue to accelerate.

Regina: Mister Ahuja, I’ll turn the call back over to you.

Parmeet Ahuja: Thanks. Thanks, Regina, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that, we’d like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.",https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/25113524/A-insidermonkey-1695656122432.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 11:21:51.906278

ID6,AXA,2025-08-29 13:38:54+00:00,The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News,Adebisi urges insurers to match NIIRA 2025 with execution excellence,Anthony,,,,,https://guardian.ng/business-services/insurance/adebisi-urges-insurers-to-match-niira-2025-with-execution-excellence/,"The Chief Client Officer (CCO) of AXA Mansard Insurance Plc, Rashidat Adebisi, called on Nigeria’s insurance operators to match the landmark Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act (NIIRA) 2025 with disciplined execution, noting that the credibility of Nigeria’s insurance industry will not be judged by the size of its balance sheets alone but by how many Nigerians it protects.
It’s empowering us to do more and seeks to bolster customers’ confidence and trust in our industry,” she said.
“Policyholders can now have greater confidence that their insurer is not biting off more than it can chew,” she said.
‎ Addressing fears that consolidation could squeeze out smaller firms, Adebisi explained that mergers and acquisitions are a natural path to stronger, more stable players.
Now it is on us, the operators, to rebuild trust with our customers, invest in digitisation, and deliver inclusive products,” she concluded.","The Chief Client Officer (CCO) of AXA Mansard Insurance Plc, Rashidat Adebisi, called on Nigeria’s insurance operators to match the landmark Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act (NIIRA) 2025 with disciplined execution, noting that the credibility of Nigeria’s insurance industry will not be judged by the size of its balance sheets alone but by how many Nigerians it protects.

‎

Speaking on BusinessDay TV’s Morning Show, Adebisi said recapitalisation and risk-based capital standards represent an historic opportunity to reposition the sector but stressed that capitalisation or digitization reform without execution excellence will not change the customer’s experience nor boost investors’ confidence.

‎

While acknowledging the steep compliance requirements of the reform law, Adebisi drew parallels to Nigeria’s banking recapitalisation in 2004, which cut the number of banks from 89 to 25 but tripled industry capitalisation and deepened customer trust.

‎

“We must replicate that trajectory in insurance as well. The NIIRA presents before our industry an opportunity to play a major role in Nigeria’s ambitious $1tr economy because this is a reform that addresses issues around demand, supply and our operations dynamics. It’s empowering us to do more and seeks to bolster customers’ confidence and trust in our industry,” she said.

‎

On the introduction of a risk-based capital framework, Adebisi described it as “a customer protection tool first, and a regulatory tool second.”

By aligning capital buffers with actual underwriting risks, insurers will have to pay extra attention to product design, pricing discipline, and invest prudently. “Policyholders can now have greater confidence that their insurer is not biting off more than it can chew,” she said.

‎

Addressing fears that consolidation could squeeze out smaller firms, Adebisi explained that mergers and acquisitions are a natural path to stronger, more stable players. “Consolidation should not be seen as loss, but as rebirth for a stronger industry. We will see fewer but stronger insurers with the scale to invest in technology, improve claims turnaround, expand distribution, and compete regionally.”

‎

“Insurance penetration in South Africa is around 17% of GDP, in Kenya about 3%, and in Ghana close to 2%. Nigeria sits at less than 1%. If NIIRA is executed well, insurance could unlock long-term funds for infrastructure, provide risk cover for MSMEs, which make up more than 90% of Nigeria’s businesses, and strengthen investor confidence in the financial system”.

‎

“Regulators have given us the framework. Now it is on us, the operators, to rebuild trust with our customers, invest in digitisation, and deliver inclusive products,” she concluded.",https://cdn.guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Rashidat-Adebisi.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 12:33:52.521233

Reuters, which obtained an internal memo from Kroger, reported the affected personnel work within the company's corporate structure. Employees at stores, manufacturing plants or distribution hubs remain unaffected by the workforce reduction.

Kroger's interim CEO Ron Sargent stated in the memo, ""In the past few months, we have all looked for ways to simplify the organization, shift resources closer to our customers, and focus on work that creates the most value.""

He had held the role for more than a decade.

He previously served as the company's chief operating officer and later became board chairman. Sargent, who previously held the position of Lead Director, has temporarily stepped in to fill the role.

Kroger is set to shutter 60 stores within the next year, with some locations already having ceased operations.

""Together, these efforts are driving meaningful change–empowering people, strengthening systems and opening doors to a more inclusive sustainable future of work. As we look ahead, we will continue to build on this momentum, committed to a future that delivers opportunity, purpose and resilience for everyone.""

Sustainable supply chains

The report explores different ways HP has been integrating sustainability into its supply chains.

From 2019, CO₂e from product use is down 46%, now only making up 25% of HP's total.

HP is also embedding sustainability into society, helping build a brighter future for people around the world.

Since 2022, its digital equity accelerator has reached more than 9.1million people across nine countries.

It has provided digital/AI tools to underserved youth through YMCA Digital Hubs in order to help them gain skills.

Grant Hoffman, SVP, Global Head of Operations and Portfolio - HP Solutions, adds: ""Since 2019, we’ve achieved a 41% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 operational greenhouse gas emissions, driven by improved energy efficiency and increased adoption of renewable electricity.

""In 2024, 100% renewable electricity powered all HP operations in the US.""

By 2030, HP aims to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from global operations by 50% from its 2019 baseline. In its report, it shows that in 2024, it saw a 41% reduction, suggesting it is going to surpass its 50% goal.

It also aims to reduce HP value chain GHG emissions by 50% by 2030, also from its 2019 baseline. By the end of 2024, HP had seen a 27% reduction from 2019.

Driving circularity

Since 2019, HP has used more than 4bn pounds of reused, recycled or renewable materials in HP products and packaging.

It also focuses on repairing, recovering, reusing and recycling its products in order to extend product lifespan and reduce end-of-life impacts.

HP aims to reach 75% circularity for products and packaging by 2030, currently on 43%.

The company is dedicated to innovative recycling. It takes ocean-bound plastics and creates supply chain innovations, repurposing materials such as discarded fishing nets. These have then been used in products such as the HP EliteBook 1040 G11.

It is avoiding e-waste by ensuring circularity is built in. More than 85% of used devices which were collected by HP's ITAD service were able to be refurbished.

Moreover, the HP HOPE programme has provided more than 40,000 young people with refurbished devices, giving them access to technology whilst promoting circularity.

Grant adds: ""Every milestone we achieve in sustainability is a reminder of what’s possible when innovation meets responsibility.

""The newly released HP 2024 Sustainable Impact Report shows our progress toward building a cleaner, more circular future.

""Solutions such as HP Hope and our circular services are keeping technology in use longer, reducing e-waste while helping close the digital divide.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a940b9256eb71dfbe0501ed582b92908:a9a443aa05a1581e8efa7facca92c60c/1652747548760.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 11:23:11.359830

Each R30,000 team entry directly funds the donation of a Matrix ICR50 Limited Edition indoor cycle and contributes to the full upgrade of indoor cycling spaces at Velokhaya Cycling Academy in Khayelitsha and Songezo Cycling Academy in Masiphumelele. The goal is a R1.2m investment in improved sport infrastructure and, ultimately, the futures of young and ambitious cyclists.

Cycle for Change has been co-designed with the NGOs to ensure that the infrastructure donated is sustainable, maintained, and meets their needs. Plans include equipment installation, flooring, training for maintenance, and ongoing support, creating safe, year-round training environments.

“Cycle for Change is where innovation meets impact,” says Angelica Hackner, marketing manager for Matrix Fitness South Africa. “We chose Velokhaya and Songezo because their work reaches beyond cycling. Their after-school programmes promote resilience, teamwork, and personal growth. With a focus on life skills, academic support, mentorship, and competitive cycling, the academies equip youth to thrive both on and off the bike.”

The campaign also aims to tackle a common criticism of corporate social investment: the lack of longevity. By coupling fundraising with transparent reporting and formal partnership agreements, Matrix Fitness ensures every contribution can be tracked from installation to impact.

“Fitness should be accessible, purposeful, and transformative,” Hackner adds. “This campaign reflects our belief in showing up, listening, and investing in ways that are locally rooted and socially inclusive. It’s about building futures, not just hosting events.”

The Cycle for Change model highlights how experiential campaigns can deliver genuine brand engagement while creating tangible, measurable community benefit. Matrix Fitness is covering costs beyond equipment, including installation, training, and initial insurance coverage, while balancing brand visibility with maximum NGO exposure.

A strong PC refresh cycle is expected after Microsoft ends support for Windows 10 in October, as users and organizations seek to maintain security and access to the latest features, benefiting PC makers such as HP and Dell.

“We remain confident in the strength of the PC market opportunity, and expect continued momentum from Windows 11 refresh and AI PC adoption,” CFO Karen Parkhill said.

The results come as evolving US trade policies force PC makers to continuously rebalance supply chains, pass higher costs onto customers and manage increased pricing uncertainty.

CEO Enrique Lores said in an interview that HP has shifted nearly all North America-bound production out of China to Southeast Asia, Mexico and some US sites, retaining only a few insignificant, low-volume items there.

The company’s third-quarter revenue rose about 3 percent to $13.93 billion, handily beating analysts’ average estimate of $13.70 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

HP forecast fourth-quarter adjusted profit per share between 87 cents and 97 cents, roughly in line with analysts’ estimates of 92 cents. The company’s shares were down about 2 percent in extended trading.

Grey Goose told FOX Business that it has been the official vodka of the U.S. Open for the past 19 years.
Last year, over 556,000 Grey Goose Honey Deuces were sold, a 23.5% increase from 2023.

But for major brands: Grey Goose, Dobel Tequila, American Express, Ralph Lauren and other high-profile sponsors, it serves as a high-stakes contest for visibility and influence among tennis fans.

The moment fans step through the gates of the venue in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York, they are inundated with brands that have turned the tournament into a powerful lifestyle marketing stage, according to Shawn French, founder and host of ""The Determined Society"" podcast.

The brand activations surrounding New York's famed Arthur Ash stadium show how the U.S. Open ""has evolved into more than a tennis championship – it’s a luxury lifestyle platform where spirits, style and sport collide to reach a global, high-spending audience,"" French said.

DANIIL MEDVEDEV'S HEATED US OPEN OUTBURST FOLLOWING FIRST-ROUND DEFEAT RESULTS IN HEFTY FINE

Grey Goose's famed Honey Deuce drink, which had $12.8 million in sales in 2024, ""has become as recognizable as the tennis itself,"" according to French. Grey Goose told FOX Business that it has been the official vodka of the U.S. Open for the past 19 years. Last year, over 556,000 Grey Goose Honey Deuces were sold, a 23.5% increase from 2023.

At the tournament this year, Grey Goose has branded cocktail bars serving the drink in four locations throughout the venue. There are also several other carts located across the grounds that serve the Grey Goose Honey Deuce. For the first time ever, Grey Goose launched a limited-time bar pop-up at Grand Central Terminal, too.

Meanwhile, Dobel Tequila said it is back for its third year as the U.S. Open’s ""official tequila."" It is also the second year in a row that the Dobel Tequila Club, an elevated food and beverage space, has been open.

This year, the brand partnered with José Andrés Group’s Mexican restaurant concept, Oyamel, to serve exclusive food and cocktails. The menu features drinks such as the Ace Paloma, a mix of Dobel tequila, grapefruit soda, and fresh lime, as well as the Marg-Aryna, and Fritzy Spicy Margarita, drinks the company named after tennis stars Taylor Fritz and Aryna Sabalenka, who have become brand ambassadors. Sabalenka, in particular, has become known for buying drinks for fans at the U.S. Open.

Like Grey Goose, the company is extending its brand presence beyond the court. This year, consumers can also get a free Dobel Tequila cocktail at local restaurants or bars across the NYC metro area, barring some exemptions. At NYC metro area liquor stores, consumers can also get $20 off the purchase of certain bottles of Dobel Tequila.

Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren holds a significant presence as the official sponsor and outfitter of the U.S. Open, a role it has maintained since 2005. The brand designs the uniforms for tournament staff and the ball crew. However, it also has a handful of shops at the event, allowing fans to purchase the latest Polo Ralph Lauren U.S. Open apparel.

American Express has been one of the tournament’s major sponsors for over three decades, boasting a significant presence each year. Upon entry, fans are greeted with an immersive and interactive space with a variety of games and activities, according to the U.S. Open's website.

Dove is claiming the title of the U.S. Open's ""Official Underarm Sponsor."" The brand launched a national campaign leading up to the tournament and is activating on-site with a booth offering deodorant samples and photo opportunities.

Brand strategist Laura Burkemper, who spent two decades helping global brands leverage major cultural moments, told FOX Business that the U.S. Open is one of the most valuable platforms for brands like Dobel, Grey Goose, and Ralph Lauren to fuse sport, lifestyle, and cultural cachet in a way few other events can.

""What ties these activations together is the ability to transcend product and insert the brand into the culture of the U.S. Open itself,"" Burkemper said. ""Done well, sponsorship isn’t just about logo placement; it’s about creating rituals, traditions, experiences, and memories that fans want to repeat year after year. That’s what turns a two-week sporting event into a long-term brand equity driver.""

Dobel, Burkemper said, exemplifies how ""a challenger brand can punch above its weight.""

""By tying cocktails directly to star players like Aryna Sabalenka and Taylor Fritz, Dobel isn’t just selling tequila – it’s selling a shared championship moment,"" she said, adding that their ""Drinks on Us"" activation is a smart play as it extends beyond the stadium into bars and retailers across New York, letting tennis fans participate even if they aren't going to the event.

""That’s the difference between a sponsorship and a fully integrated brand play,"" she said.

Burkemper echoed French, saying that Grey Goose's Honey Deuce has become as synonymous with the U.S. Open as strawberries and cream have become at Wimbledon.",https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/08/0/0/dobel-dj-tequila-tennis-shirt-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-08-29 11:23:58.451739

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder causing inflammation, pain, and swelling in joints, typically the hands and wrists, and often on both sides of the body.

At 12 weeks, study results did not show sufficient evidence that the combination therapy provided a significant added benefit over anti-TNFα therapy alone.

Based on these findings, Johnson & Johnson has decided not to proceed with the clinical development of nipocalimab in combination with an anti-TNFα therapy for RA. No new safety concerns were found.

The U.S. drug giant remains confident in the nipocalimab product, having over $5 billion potential.

In March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Fast Track designation to nipocalimab for moderate-to-severe Sjögren’s disease (SjD).

Last year, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) for the investigational therapy.

The Phase 2 DAHLIAS study, presented last year, represented the first-ever positive results of an investigational FcRn blocker as a potential targeted therapy in SjD.

The study achieved the primary endpoint in the 15 mg/kg Q2W nipocalimab group, showing a greater than 70% relative average improvement in systemic disease activity at Week 24 compared to placebo and IgG reductions of more than 77%.

In April, Johnson & Johnson shared additional analyses of the Phase 3 Vivacity-MG3 study and the ongoing open-label extension (OLE), evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of nipocalimab in a broad population of antibody-positive adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).

Nipocalimab demonstrated a mean change in MG-ADL of -5.64 (p<0.001) after 60 weeks in the OLE for study participants receiving nipocalimab and SOC, and -6.01 (p<0.001) mean change for study participants who transitioned from placebo and SOC to nipocalimab and SOC.

""In terms of our projections going forward, they rely on the fact that we continue to see strong demand for AI PCs, strong demand for Windows 11.""
""The key thing behind the AI PCs is the fact that over the next quarters, more and more software applications are going to take advantage of the capabilities that the AI PCs have,"" he claimed.

Nvidia's latest AI PC boxes sound great – if you're a data scientist with $3,000 to spare Where does Microsoft's NPU obsession leave Nvidia's AI PC ambitions?","HP says AI PCs now make up a quarter of its sales, boosting revenue thanks to their higher price tags and the Windows 11 refresh.

The PC and printer maker said that its Personal Systems revenue was up 6 percent year-on-year to $9.9 billion during its financial third quarter ended July 31. This was driven in the commercial segment by the Windows 11 refresh and increased AI PC adoption, according to president and CEO Enrique Lores.

""We continue to shift our mix to higher value segments such as AI PCs, commercial premium and services,"" Lores said on a conference call to discuss the results.

The HP leader professed himself pleased with what he sees as accelerating demand for the AI-capable PC category, which he said grew in revenue by double digits since the last quarter.

""It has surpassed our expectations with shipments continuing to ramp, now reaching over 25 percent of our mix, a quarter ahead of our plan,"" he chirped. The company had previously said it wasn't expecting PCs with AI pixie dust to reach 25 percent before the end of the year.

HP sure hopes this is a real trend, and not just some blip in the figures. ""We think this is real demand because it's not only happening in the US, we are seeing this across multiple countries and across multiple geographies,"" Lores told one analyst. ""In terms of our projections going forward, they rely on the fact that we continue to see strong demand for AI PCs, strong demand for Windows 11.""

This is despite the lack of any real killer app that benefits from using the special AI hardware – Intel says an AI-ready PC should have a CPU, GPU, and an NPU (neural processing unit) inside – and HP's admission that AI PCs are costlier than a comparably specified standard PC.

""We are seeing an uplift in pricing of AI PCs compared to similar units that don't bring this capability,"" Lores said, adding that this equates to about a 5 to 10 percent price increase.

Of course, HP and the other major PC makers are forcing the situation somewhat by pushing more and more of these machines into sales channels, so that buyers find it harder to avoid buying an AI-capable unit, as The Register previously reported.

On the lack of a killer app, Lores claimed the industry is working on this, and software support is coming.

""The key thing behind the AI PCs is the fact that over the next quarters, more and more software applications are going to take advantage of the capabilities that the AI PCs have,"" he claimed.

He cited the example of Adobe and Zoom, which are shifting workloads locally to take advantage of the NPU, ""which means it will be faster and also it will reduce some of the cloud costs that they will be having,"" Lores claimed.

""We have seen security companies like CrowdStrike taking advantage of the ability to use the NPU to scan the memory faster, which means for many of their applications, this brings a significant advantage,"" he said, ""Also, Microsoft is doing a remarkable job continuing to improve the libraries that they offer to other companies, so they can do a lot of activities in the PC that before they had to do in the cloud.""

Research biz Gartner believes AI-capable kit will account for 31 percent of the total PC market globally by the end of this year, and could hit 54 percent next year. After that, it may become increasingly difficult to buy any PC that isn't AI-capable.

You DO see Windows 11 as an AI PC opportunity, say Dell and Intel

Please tell us Reg: Why are AI PC sales slower than expected?

Nvidia's latest AI PC boxes sound great – if you're a data scientist with $3,000 to spare

Where does Microsoft's NPU obsession leave Nvidia's AI PC ambitions?

However, the market watchers say that Arm-based laptops will expand to take a larger share of the consumer market, while business users unsurprisingly prefer to stick with x86 on Windows.

Gartner also expects to see many software vendors prioritize support for AI capabilities running directly on PCs – it puts the figure at 40 percent, up from just 2 percent in 2024 – including multiple small language models (SLMs) deployed locally on PCs.

How much of this software support will turn out to be a bit of AI injected into applications for marketing reasons rather than because it fulfills a genuinely useful purpose remains to be seen. Mozilla appears to be a recent example here.

Back to HP, and the firm's printer biz didn't fare as well as PCs, bringing in $4 billion in revenue, down 4 percent on the same period last year. The company blamed this on ""a slightly softer than expected office market and a pricing environment that remained competitive despite rising trade-related costs across the industry.""

Lores also said that enterprise and commercial businesses are prioritizing other areas – such as PC upgrades – above print, which is affecting sales.

Those rising trade-related costs refer to the Trump administration's tariffs and the uncertainty caused by its constantly shifting policies.

Lores said that HP is making good progress here in mitigating increased costs through pricing adjustments and supply chain diversification, and is dodging tariffs by not shipping kit made in China to the US.

""This quarter, as planned, nearly all products sold in North America are now built outside of China, helping to further reduce trade-related costs. We continue to ramp up production across Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, and the US,"" he said.

Ironically, chief financial officer Karen Parkhill revealed that HP's revenue grew by 11 percent in Asia-Pacific and Japan, with particularly strong personal systems performance in China.

Looking forward, HP still sees Windows 11 and AI PCs as where the money will be, driven by continued momentum in the PC refresh and the holiday season uptick in consumer spending coming in the next quarter.

""When we look at where are we in the cycle, our estimate is that slightly more than 50 percent of the installed base has been converted to Windows 11,"" Lores said, ""which is why I think the demand for PCs is going to continue in Q4. We projected that the growth of PCs will be mid-single digits for the second half and that there will be growth in fiscal year 2026."" ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/02/20/hp_vending_machine.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 10:13:33.975302

Dentsu Considers Selling International Business

Japanese advertising holding company Dentsu is considering strategic options for its struggling international business, including a potential sale, according to the Financial Times. Sources with knowledge of the deal say Dentsu is already sounding out potential buyers, including rival holding groups and private equity firms. Dentsu is also said to be considering less drastic measures including selling a minority stake in the international business.

Dentsu’s overseas operations have largely been built on the back of its surprise £3.2 billion acquisition of UK-based media agency Aegis back in 2012. Aided by further acquisitions, Dentsu International (the unit housing all of Dentsu’s business outside of Japan) has grown to reach net revenues of over $4.5 billion last year.

But the unit has faced negative organic revenue growth recently, in contrast to Dentsu’s continued strong performance in its home market. In the first half of this year, net revenue organic growth in Japan reached 5.3 percent, compared to negative rates of 3.4 percent in the Americas and 2.4 percent in EMEA.

Reach Puts Video Growth Plans Into Action

Piers North, the new chief revenue officer at UK new publishing group Reach, spoke about the company’s video ambitions, stating that increasing video output would be central to Reach’s growth ambitions. This week has presented a few examples of that strategy in action.

The company has announced the launch of ‘All Out Football’, a new standalone football-focused video brand on YouTube and other social platforms. All Out Football will run a weekly flagship show, release original documentaries on a monthly basis, and will also create content alongside independent football-related creators. Reach has secured Sky Bet as the exclusive commercial sponsor for the channel at launch.

Reports also emerged this week that Reach is planning a business-wide restructure, which will see more content pooled centrally and shared across Reach’s national and local news brands. The restructure is designed to avoid multiple Reach reporters from different publications doubling up on the same stories, in cases where reporting could be shared across multiple publications. Alongside this restructure, staff have been told to produce more video content and less text-only content, according to Press Gazette.

Netflix Continues Sports Push with World Baseball Classic

Netflix has struck an exclusive media rights deal with international baseball organisation World Baseball Classic to stream the 2026 World Baseball Classic for subscribers in Japan. The agreement marks the streaming giant’s latest move into live sports, following its partnerships with WWE and the NFL. Financial terms were not disclosed.

“We are committed to ensuring all fans – whether lifelong supporters or new to the game – can experience the tournament in a way that fits their lives today,” said Kaata Sakamoto, Vice President of Content, Netflix in Japan. “With Netflix already in millions of Japanese homes, we are excited to deliver a new kind of viewing experience that brings fans even closer to the action, the players, and the heart of the tournament, wherever they are. We look forward to working with leading Japanese partners to make the World Baseball Classic a true nationwide celebration, and to deliver innovative live entertainment for our members.”

Trump Pushes to Revoke ABC and NBC Station Licences Over “Bad Stories” About Him

US President Donald Trump is pushing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to revoke ABC and NBC’s station licences, due to the channels airing “bad stories” about him. Trump said the Disney- and Comcast-owned US broadcasters should be charged for using public airwaves. “Despite a very high popularity and, according to many, among the greatest 8 months in Presidential History, ABC & NBC FAKE NEWS, two of the worst and most biased networks in history, give me 97% BAD STORIES,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. “IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEY ARE SIMPLY AN ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND SHOULD, ACCORDING TO MANY, HAVE THEIR LICENSES REVOKED BY THE FCC. I would be totally in favor of that because they are so biased and untruthful, an actual threat to our Democracy!!!”

Fox Avoids Blackout on YouTube TV with Short-Term Extension in Carriage Negotiations

Google and Fox reached a “short-term extension” to their carriage agreement on Wednesday, partially resolving a standoff that saw YouTube TV threaten to drop Fox Broadcast Network, Fox News and Fox Sports from its channel lineup, days before the broadcast of highly anticipated college football games in the US.

UK Agencies Warn of Omnicom’s Post-Merger “Buying Powerhouse”

Earlier this month, Omnicom’s acquisition of rival advertising group Interpublic Group (IPG) received regulatory approval from the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). On Tuesday the watchdog published its full decision, revealing the concerns raised by the companies’ competitors over the impact of the merger between the holding companies. Chief among them was the ability of the merged entity to procure media at scale at lower cost, which smaller competitors warned could pressurise them to match the competitive rates the company will be able to offer advertisers.

Cindy Rose, the incoming CEO of UK-based holding group WPP, this week made her first address to the whole company since being awarded the job earlier in the summer, releasing an introductory video which circulated around the company (and was obtained by Adweek). In the clip, Rose warns that there’s “hard work ahead” and warns that “it won’t be easy” to continue the transformation of WPP, but said she’s confident in the group’s staff, creative work, and agency brands.

IPG’s Acxiom Partners with Magnite on Addressable CTV

Sell-side ad tech company Magnite and Acxiom, Interpublic Group’s data unit, have announced a partnership which the two say will allow advertisers to layer their first-party data, and Acxiom’s third-party data, directly on to Magnite buys. The two say the deal will help brands maximise working media in streaming, where Magnite has comprehensive coverage across the sell-side in the US. “Bringing together Acxiom’s vast and trusted data services with Magnite’s access to unique streaming inventory presents advertisers with a turn-key activation point,” said Martin Wexler, EVP of partnerships at Acxiom. “Magnite’s proximity to inventory helps drive improved match rates and reduces signal loss, enabling advertisers to activate with precision and augment performance across streaming and omnichannel media.”

Marketing and Advertising Internships Drop in the US

The number of intern positions available at US marketing and advertising companies has dropped each year since 2022, according to figures from employment data business Live Data Technologies shared with Adweek. As agencies cut costs and trim staff counts, it appears that internships are being cut too. Adweek reports that there’s also been a drop in demand for internships, particularly unpaid ones, alongside a general dip in young people working in the advertising and marketing sector.

IPG Staff Claim Saudi Aramco Work Broke Climate Pledge

Current and former staff working at agency group Interpublic Group say the business broke its own climate pledge in some of the work done for oil business Saudi Aramco, according to a report from the Financial Times this week. IPG announced a policy in 2022 that it would no longer support or engage in marketing or communications which seeks to extend the life of fossil fuels (a policy which it reworked last year to only cover trade associations and pressure groups). But two years ago, IPG helped plan a rebrand for Saudi Aramco, with former and current IPG staff telling Desmog that this work goes against the initial pledge. Those staff also claim that IPG ignored another element of its climate policy — to ensure that new energy clients are aligned with the Paris climate agreement — when it signed QatarEnergy as a client in April last year.

BURLINGTON, Mass. and FRISCO, Texas, Aug. 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP) today announced a strategic advertising collaboration with Disney Advertising that will redefine the connected consumer experience. The companies will deliver groundbreaking personalized experiences at every touchpoint of the consumer journey through a unique integration of fandom, media and shopper insights.

""This expanded partnership with Disney allows us to pioneer smarter, more meaningful connections with fans with the right message at the right moment,"" said Drew Panayiotou, Chief Marketing Officer at Keurig Dr Pepper. ""Dr Pepper's deep-rooted connection to college football, paired with Disney's unmatched storytelling and data capabilities, will allow us to turn attention into action and authentically integrate into culture, not interrupt it. We're excited to keep pushing boundaries and delivering one-of-a-kind brand activations that fuel sharper insights, create more shoppable experiences and move both our fans and our business forward.""

This significant evolution to the partnership between Disney Advertising and Keurig Dr Pepper builds on years of successful co-innovation between the brands. It kicks off with bold new activations with Dr Pepper® that keep its decades-long connection to college football modern and relevant – including creative sponsored content across marquee sports programming, augmented reality in-game integrations and precision marketing powered by retail and consumption data.

""Disney's collaboration with Keurig Dr Pepper takes the rich tradition of college football fandom to the next level, by combining our unmatched storytelling, multi-platform reach, and deep fan insights with Dr Pepper's decades-long connection to the sport,"" said Rita Ferro, President, Global Advertising, Disney. ""We're creating new ways for brands to live authentically within the moments fans love most. Together, we're proving that the most powerful connections happen when content, culture, and commerce work seamlessly to deliver truly memorable experiences.""

Initial elements of the evolved partnership include:

Expanded Content Integrations: Dr Pepper and ESPN's Pat McAfee will bring fresh energy to college football coverage through weekly integrations during The Pat McAfee Show's signature commercial-free hour. In addition, a new documentary-style social series will spotlight the 17-year legacy of the Dr Pepper Tuition Giveaway and feature behind-the-scenes stories of past winners—from their preparation and moment of victory to how their lives have changed since.

Mixed Reality Broadcast Innovation: As part of a trailblazing new brand activation, Dr Pepper's iconic Fansville series, the popular satirical episodic drama set in a fictional college town now entering its eighth season, will be integrated directly into live college football broadcasts for the first time ever using mixed reality. This dynamic innovation will allow fans to experience the drama of Fansville in real time—on the field, in the stands and across screens— transforming sport and story into one.

Strategic Talent Amplifications: Disney and Dr Pepper will continue delivering fan-first experiences throughout the season, tapping into ESPN's unmatched bench of talent. Dr Pepper, the originator and trademark holder of ""Playoffuary""—the term defining the pivotal stretch between the College Football Playoff Semifinals and the CFP National Championship game—will also collaborate with ESPN's on-air commentators to celebrate and elevate fan engagement around this signature period.

Precision-Powered Connections: KDP will unlock a powerful new audience intelligence capability by combining its proprietary insights and models with rich retail data and Disney's college football fan insights. This novel data integration aligns consumer behavior with rich audience signals that will allow KDP to deliver personalized content that resonates more deeply and drives measurable results.

Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP’s third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP’s President and Chief Executive, and Karen Parkhill, HP’s Chief Financial Officer.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today’s earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Enrique.

Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you to everyone for joining today’s call. Let me start by saying we made solid progress against our goals and key strategic initiatives in Q3. We continue to execute with discipline and focus, delivering on our commitments and advancing our ambition to be a leader in the future of work. Today, we will take a closer look at our third quarter performance, highlight some of our newest innovations, and discuss our Q4 outlook. Beginning with our performance, I am pleased to report that we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Q3. Top-line revenue increased 3% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in personal systems. This momentum was fueled by continued Windows 11 refresh, AITC adoption, and services growth.

Q&A Session

We also drove collective double-digit growth year-over-year and sequentially in our key growth areas. Our operating profit margins for both print and personal systems were in line with our guidance. A non-GAAP EPS was slightly above the midpoint of our guide, reflecting a sequential improvement of 6%. These results demonstrate our ability to execute our plan and adapt quickly to the evolving trade environment. We are on track to reach our future-ready growth annualized savings of $2 billion by the end of fiscal year 2025, which we expect will help drive continued improvements in operating profit. At the same time, we are making solid progress on our actions to mitigate higher trade-related costs, including manufacturing diversification, cost reduction, and pricing adjustments.

This quarter, as planned, nearly all products sold in North America are now built outside of China, helping to further reduce trade-related costs. We continue to ramp up production across Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, and the US. Most importantly, we have done what we said we could. We have demonstrated we can remain agile in responding to external pressures while staying focused on our long-term strategy. Now let me share more color on the performance of each business unit. In personal systems, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, above our expectations. We continue to shift our mix to higher-value segments such as AITCs, commercial premium, and services. We saw strong year-over-year growth in both commercial and consumer segments. Commercial performance was supported by the Windows 11 refresh and increased AIPC adoption.

We are very pleased with accelerating demand for the AIPC category, which grew revenue double-digit sequentially. It has surpassed our expectations with shipments continuing to ramp, now reaching over 25% of our mix a quarter ahead of our plan. Consumer growth was supported by a strong back-to-school season. In our key growth areas, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in advanced compute solutions. In services, momentum continued with strong revenue growth year-over-year, driven mainly by digital services and managed services. Yes, we did see softer demand in hybrid systems as companies are delaying some of their IT projects. Our installed base of active AIPC users is growing significantly and positioning us well for future AI-driven innovations.

We are seeing strong momentum in the AIPC ecosystem, with a number of software companies introducing solutions growing by double digits quarter over quarter. We are working closely with Microsoft and silicon providers to capture the opportunity created by the AIPC platform. Key ISV partners, such as Adobe and Zoom, are shifting workloads locally to take advantage of the NPU. We grew share in high-value categories, especially in premium segments. This includes year-over-year and sequential gains in PC commercial premium, consumer premium, and AIPCs. Last quarter, we committed to actions to return our personal systems operating margin to its long-term target range. I am pleased to report we achieved that, delivering an operating margin back into our target range.

Turning to print, revenue declined 3% in constant currency as expected. Our key growth areas in print continue to perform well and had strong growth year-over-year. While we continue to take actions to mitigate the increase in trade-related costs, we saw overall a more aggressive pricing environment. Demand in the office segment was slightly softer than anticipated, particularly across North America and parts of Europe. However, we maintained our share position in the office, and we continue to focus on profitable unit placements. In home, we maintain discipline in a competitive pricing environment. Supplies revenue performed as expected. Diving deeper into our key growth areas, consumer subscriptions had a strong ramp in new subscribers of our all-in plan.

We had key wins with workforce solutions in industries such as finance, manufacturing, retail, and public sector. We saw another quarter of strong growth in industrial graphics, with share gains year-over-year reflecting the strength of our portfolio. Now let’s take a closer look at recent innovations that are positioning us as a leader in the future of work. In Q3, we advanced our portfolio of AI-powered solutions that help businesses drive growth and employees achieve professional fulfillment. On the commercial side, our AIPC lineup received industry recognition. Our eBook Ultra was named top AIPC in the CRN Tech Innovator Awards. It was noted for its design, performance, and impact on productivity. Our workforce experience platform was recognized in the enterprise IT management category, praised for its ability to reduce digital friction and improve IT efficiency.

Since launch, the platform has been deployed in 40 countries, and we plan to expand to more than 30 additional countries in the coming months. We are redefining how people connect and collaborate. We introduced HP Dimension with Google BIM, a video communication tool that uses six cameras and AI to generate 3D video of participants designed to enhance remote collaboration. And we are excited to bring advanced AI capabilities to a broader audience with our Omnibook 5 notebook. For the prosumer, it delivers high performance and up to 34 hours of battery life, empowering customers to stay productive longer. In our print portfolio, we are integrating AI to drive intelligent automation and customer-centric design. HP Neo, an AI-powered chatbot for print, is helping print shops improve production efficiency.

In large format, HP Build Workspace, an AI vectorization tool, helps architecture, engineering, and construction professionals reduce drafting time by up to 80%. Responsible innovation and sustainability are foundational to our future of work efforts, and we continue to demonstrate meaningful, measurable impact. Today, 99% of HP home and office printers, desktops, notebooks, displays, and workstations incorporate recycled content. We have reached 100% renewable electricity across our U.S. operations, marking a significant step toward our net-zero goal. And in partnership with the YMCA, we’re establishing digital hubs that have already reached over 700,000 people worldwide, helping them succeed in the digital age. In addition, HP is pleased to support the White House initiative to advance AI education for America’s youth.

This is an important step toward equipping the next generation with the skills needed to thrive in the future of work. As we look ahead, we remain confident in the strength of the PC market in 2025. We expect the market to grow mid-single digits in the second half, with continued strong momentum from Windows 11 refresh and the AITC adoption. We believe these catalysts will continue to drive PC market growth in 2026. We expect the print market to decline low single digits in 2025 and at a similar level in 2026. However, our strategy is focused on protecting the operating profit contribution of the premium business to the company. We will continue focusing on reducing unprofitable units by shifting to big tank, increasing lifetime customer profitability through growth in our consumer subscription business, gaining share in higher-value office categories, growing our key growth areas, and maintaining cost discipline.

AI is also opening new possibilities to transform how we operate and compete. Beyond driving structural cost reductions, we see tremendous potential to automate additional workflows, streamline decision-making, and accelerate innovation across the business. These capabilities will help us reduce complexity and drive lower costs. You will hear more about this from us in the quarters ahead. Externally, we recognize there is continued uncertainty in the global trade environment. We have planned for today’s landscape and have proven our ability to respond quickly to any future changes. Through our actions, we have strengthened our operational agility and have full confidence in our ability to navigate evolving conditions. As we continue to adapt to this dynamic environment, engagement with investors is a top priority.

We are looking forward to sharing our long-term plans during our Investor Day in early 2026, where we’ll provide updates on our progress and explore the exciting opportunities ahead to advance our strategy. Before I close, I want to thank our employees for their dedication, resilience, and customer-first mindset, which have been key to our progress. We know what it takes to deliver results and be a leader in the future of work, and we are executing with focus. Now let me hand it over to Karen.

Karen Parkhill: Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with the progress we’ve made in the quarter to advance our strategy to lead the future of work while navigating an evolving market environment and delivering on our financial commitments. We drove another quarter of solid revenue growth, with continued momentum in personal systems fueled by AIPC and Win 11 refresh activity and strong performance in our key growth areas. In fact, we delivered double-digit sequential growth in personal systems, resulting in strong free cash flow in the quarter. In print and PS, we executed decisively on the actions we laid out to mitigate trade-related headwinds and are pleased with the meaningful progress we made in the quarter, including accelerating supply chain resiliency, cost reduction, and pricing action.

As a result, we were able to mitigate the majority of tariff costs in Q3 while delivering operating margins within our expected ranges for both businesses and non-GAAP EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Taking a closer look at the details of the quarter, net revenue was up 3% year-over-year, both nominally and in constant currency, with growth across all regions. In constant currency, Americas and EMEA each grew 1%, and APJ was up 11%, with particularly strong personal systems performance in China. Gross margin was 20.5%, down year-over-year with a higher mix from personal systems, increased trade-related costs, and unfavorable currency impacts. We offset those headwinds in part with disciplined pricing actions and cost management.

As anticipated, non-GAAP operating expenses were up year-over-year. We drove our future-ready cost plans and maintained strong expense management while importantly investing in growth with key strategic and go-to-market initiatives. All in, our non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1%, down year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Finally, with a diluted share count of approximately 954 million shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.75, and our GAAP earnings per share was $0.80, helped by favorable tax adjustments in the quarter. Now let’s turn to segment performance. We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of solid growth in personal systems, with revenue up 6% above our expectations on 5% unit growth and increased ASPs. We continue to shift mix toward premium categories while executing disciplined pricing actions to help mitigate cost increases.

Sequentially, revenue was up 10% and units were up 13% on seasonal strength and overall share gains. And momentum continued in our key growth areas, with strong performance in AIPCs, advanced compute, and workforce solutions, offset in part by softness in hybrid systems. We drove commercial revenue up 5% on 3% unit growth, with favorable pricing and a mix shift toward premium. Consistent with our strategy, we gained share in Windows-based commercial PCs as refresh activity fueled by Win 11 and AIPCs continued. Consumer revenue and units grew 8%, with strong performance in North America, along with China driven by gaming. And robust back-to-school seasonality and share gains drove consumer units up 34% sequentially. Importantly, as promised, we drove personal systems operating margin back into our guidance range at 5.4% with our planned mitigation actions.

Turning to print, our results reflect a slightly softer than expected office market and a pricing environment that remained competitive despite rising trade-related costs across the industry. In this dynamic environment, we maintained our focus on profitable unit placement, prioritization of higher-value categories, and disciplined cost management. We also drove strong performance in key growth areas, including double-digit growth in consumer subscriptions and strong performance in industrial, fueled by double-digit hardware growth. Looking at the details, print revenue declined 4% year-over-year, or 3% in constant currency, with market-driven hardware declines in both consumer and commercial. Supplies performed as expected, down 3% in constant currency, and we continue to drive market share gains and favorable pricing that partially offset installed base and usage headwinds.

And in line with our guidance, we delivered an operating margin of 17.3%, solidly within our target range and flat year-over-year. As we offset increased trade-related costs with pricing actions and cost reductions. Turning to our future-ready cost plans, we are pleased with the progress we have made to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness across the company. This includes leveraging AI capabilities internally to drive automation and optimization of processes to better support our customers, partners, and employees. We are well on track to hit our total program goal of at least $2 billion in annualized gross run rate savings by the end of our fiscal year. These incremental structural savings enable our continued investment in our key growth areas and AI innovation, as well as to help us to mitigate macro uncertainties.

Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated approximately $1.7 billion in cash from operations in the quarter and roughly $1.5 billion in free cash flow, in line with our expectations. We also improved our cash conversion cycle this quarter, driving days payable up with higher manufacturing activity. Lastly, we returned more than $400 million to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. As we signaled at the beginning of the quarter, our leverage ratio remained slightly above our target range, so in line with our stated framework, we limited our repurchase to offsetting stock compensation dilution. Of course, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as gross leverage remains under two times and there aren’t better return opportunities.

Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we will continue to focus on disciplined execution while maintaining the agility needed to respond to changes in a fluid environment. Our Q4 guide takes into account current global tariff rates as well as the market growth expectations that Enrique just covered. By segment, in personal systems, we expect Q4 revenue to be in line with prior year seasonality, driven by the typical holiday uptick in consumer, continued Windows 11 refresh, and AIPC adoption. And we expect personal systems margin to be solidly in our 5% to 7% target range, improving sequentially as the mitigation actions we have taken gain full traction in the quarter. In print, we also expect Q4 revenue to be in line with prior year seasonality and operating margin to be near the top of our 16% to 19% range, reflecting a higher supplies mix along with disciplined pricing and cost management, offset in part by increased trade-related costs.

We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $3 billion for fiscal year 2025, including approximately $400 million in cash restructuring charges for the year. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain consistent with prior periods. Of note, we appreciate the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will help keep our tax rate more consistent and enable continued investment and long-term growth opportunities. With all of this, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.97 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85. Looking beyond Q4, we expect continued momentum in the refreshed catalyst driving growth in the PC market, and we are confident in the measures we are taking to capitalize on opportunities in the print market and to protect operating profit.

I will share more on our fiscal 2026 outlook on our Q4 earnings call. In closing, we delivered solid results in the quarter while executing well against our strategic initiatives. We are confident that the actions we are taking are the right ones to enable us to respond swiftly to near-term market dynamics while continuing to invest for long-term profitable growth. With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.

Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question and answer session. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. We also ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow-up. And our first questioner today will be from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.

Steven Chin: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. This is Steven calling on behalf of Krish. I guess the first one for either Enrique or Karen, I was just kind of curious about the tariff-related cost in the quarter. Are you able to help quantify what the total impact was, whether it’s on a dollar basis or maybe in terms of impact to gross margins? And given all the actions you’ve taken, how much are you able to offset as opposed to having to absorb by the company?

Karen Parkhill: Thanks for the question, Steven. We made meaningful progress in the quarter with our mitigation actions, which included accelerating our supply chain to optimize driving cost reduction and taking pricing actions. And as a result, we were able to mitigate the majority of the tariff cost in Q3 while still delivering EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guide. As we’ve said, we do expect to fully offset these trade-related costs as quickly as possible. The full benefit of our mitigating actions really depends on the scope and can take a little bit of time. But, again, we expect to fully mitigate, you know, as quickly as we can.

Enrique Lores: I would say we are pleased with the progress we made. As we had said before, this quarter we completed the change of manufacturing on all products going to the US. The great majority of products going to the US are not built in China anymore. We also did additional cost actions, and we did selective price increases. Overall, we made good progress, and this is why we are confident in our ability to mitigate tariffs down the road as we will continue to execute on these plans.

Steven Chin: Great. Thank you for that. And as my follow-up, one question on the print business. I guess, anecdotally, just given the number of large enterprises around the world that have announced return-to-office initiatives so far this year, I guess I’m a little surprised that there weren’t any improvements to the outlook for the print business. I guess, can you talk about any expectations perhaps going into fiscal 2026 on whether some of these return-to-office initiatives might have a delayed growth impact into next year perhaps, or is there some different dynamic about return-to-office initiatives in terms of spending on supplies and commercial hardware? Thank you so much.

Enrique Lores: Yeah. Thank you. I think there are two dynamics that we need to have in mind. First of all, from an investment perspective, we are seeing enterprise and commercial businesses prioritizing other areas above print. For example, investments in AI or even investments in PCs. So we think that this has impacted in the short term the sales of print hardware in the office side. On the other side, when we look at pages printed, and as you know, this is the most fundamental variable to understand the health of the business going forward, we have not seen a deviation versus our plan. Which means that down the road, we will see the demand for printers come back because customers continue to print, and there has not been a deviation there, which is in line with the return-to-office assumptions that we were making.

So short-term impact on our hardware, but no impact on supplies, which means in the long term, the business will come back as companies will have to build new hardware to complete or to make sure that employees are having the right experience.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.

Irvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. This is Irvin Liu calling in for Amit. It’s great to see your momentum in your AIPC product category. I think the sequential 25% growth was rather notable. Can you help us understand whether AIPCs carry a higher ASP or margin profile versus non-AIPCs?

Enrique Lores: Yes. So let me confirm that we are very pleased with the growth that we are seeing in AIPCs. And not only of the category by itself, but also of how the ecosystem is being developed because eventually, the demand for the AIPCs is going to be driven by applications, and we are seeing more and more applications taking advantage of the new capabilities that AIPCs have. In terms of pricing, we can confirm the estimations that we had before. We are seeing an uplift in pricing of AIPCs compared to similar units that don’t bring this capability. And we maintain the assumptions that we had shared before of the 5% to 10% price increase driven by AIPCs.

Irvin Liu: Got it. And then I have one for Karen as well. As I look at your Q4 EPS guidance, I think the sequential or seasonal increase in EPS for Q4 is at, you know, 17¢ at the midpoint, and it’s higher than what we’ve historically seen. I’m just kind of curious whether this is going to be driven by any sort of margin benefits from your future-ready growth initiatives.

Karen Parkhill: Yes. Thanks for the question, Irvin. We are seeing good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. And in PS, we do expect sequential revenue growth in line with the prior year seasonality. And that’s really driven by the continued momentum in the Win 11 refresh and AIPC adoption, as well as we’ve got the holiday uptick in consumer that we expect to happen strongly. I’d say more importantly, though, we do expect the PS operating rate to continue to improve as we continue to work to offset the headwinds of trade-related costs and commodity costs. And in print, we also expect sequential revenue growth in line with prior year seasonality. And sequential operating profit improvement to the top of our 16% to 19% target range, and that’s really driven by seasonally higher supplies volume. So we’re confident in our Q4 guide.

Enrique Lores: And to complement that, we also will see a bigger impact of some of the actions we took around tariffs. Some of the new tariffs were put in place at the end of last quarter, beginning of this quarter, and this we will continue to mitigate as time comes.

Irvin Liu: Understood. Thank you for the color.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.

David Vogt: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe we go back to the PC market because I think, Enrique, you mentioned you expect normal seasonality in the PC market. And I guess what I’m struggling with a little bit is you’ve had incredibly strong growth the two quarters. And if I think about your business over the years, generally speaking, you don’t have that degree of strength for, call it, in a row sequentially. Can you just maybe expand upon what gives you confidence in this guide? And I think you also mentioned strength in, I guess, momentum into next year. And I know you mentioned AIPC and, obviously, some other Windows 11 refresh dynamics, but a little bit more color there would help. And I’ll give you my second question at the same time.

And so maybe you can just help us understand kind of the margin dynamic within print a little bit better. I know last quarter, you had the, grant. This quarter, obviously, mix and some pricing dynamics probably hurt margins. Can you maybe walk through kind of what’s going to reverse a little bit in the October quarter to help get us back towards the upper bound of that range from a print perspective? Thanks.

Enrique Lores: Okay. So let me take the first question, and Karen will take the second question. In terms of PC demand, I think there are different things to have in mind. First of all, Q4 versus Q3, in the consumer side, there is always an increase of demand driven by completing the back-to-school cycle and also preparing for holidays. And this always drives a sequential improvement. In the commercial side, we expect to continue to see two major drivers of growth. One is the Windows 11 refresh, and second is the AIPCs. In Windows 11, year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, we see an improvement in the funnel, meaning the funnel at the beginning of Q4 is higher than it was at the beginning of Q3, and also bigger than what it was at the beginning of Q4 last year.

And Windows 11 is playing a key role there. Second, what is also very important to assess long-term sales, when we look at where we are in the cycle, our estimate is that slightly more than 50% of the installed base has been converted to Windows 11, which means there is still going to be a positive impact not only in Q4 but also in the earlier quarters of next year. And this is why we think the demand for PCs is going to continue in Q4. We projected that the growth of PCs will be mid-single digits for the second half and that there will be growth in fiscal year 2026.

Karen Parkhill: And on the margins, we’re confident in our sequential improvement in print margins. In our Q3 print operating margin at 17.3%, was solidly within our guidance range and in line with our expectations. You know, we typically have lower supply sales in the summer months, and that can cause some seasonality in the margin. But as we look into Q4, we do expect the print margins to be at the top end of our range. And that’s reflecting some higher supplies volumes, as we saw very similar to last year, along with disciplined pricing and cost management. I know you also mentioned the grant last quarter. We did see a grant last quarter from the EDB that had a bit of a catch-up from the beginning of the calendar year to be booked in the quarter. But it is a multiyear grant, and we are continuing to receive that grant this fiscal year and into future fiscal years.

David Vogt: Great. Thanks, Enrique. Thanks, Karen.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. I guess, Enrique, or Karen, I know you spoke up quite a bit about print margins just now, but I normally think of print margins to be that volatile, but you just dropped 100 plus basis points on print margin sequentially, and it’s going to bounce back next quarter. And Enrique, you made some comments on sort of where you’re emphasizing and deemphasizing certain parts of the portfolio as well. So if you were to pull those together and we think and we fast forward beyond sort of fiscal Q4, are you thinking that the range for these print margins is sort of going to be in this long-term range that you’ve given because you seem to be tracking at the higher end even above the higher end in quite a few quarters. And some of the cost actions that you’re taking, should we just be calibrating towards a higher range for print margins?

Enrique Lores: Let me make a couple of comments. First, in terms of the changes quarter over quarter, what we are seeing this year is very similar to what we saw last year. As Karen mentioned before, the biggest impact in Q3 was driven by the mix of supplies, that was lower compared to Q2 and is lower compared to what we expect to see in Q4, and this really has a big impact. And again, we saw very similar performance a year ago. So we don’t think it’s out of what we have seen in previous cases. In terms of the projections long term, we are not changing our projections from what we have been seeing before. We continue to maintain the ranges that we have seen. As we have said before, having these ranges gives us the opportunity in a given country, in a given quarter, to be more aggressive placing units if this is what we decide to do because we see that they will be profitable units.

We have done this in the past, and we want to have the ability to do that without getting out of the ranges that we have. In terms of the actions that we’re taking for the print business going forward, they are very consistent with conversations we have had in the past, Wamsi. We are going to continue to drive in the consumer space to achieve more profitable units, especially big tank. We are going to continue to drive improvements to capture more lifetime customer profitability by shifting the business to subscriptions and services. We see opportunities to grow share in profitable office categories, and we see an opportunity to drive growth in the industrial side, but we have done in that we have driven in the past, we will continue to do.

And, of course, we are going to be very disciplined managing our cost structure and looking for any opportunity we have to improve productivity and increase efficiency. So it’s very consistent with the plan that you have seen us executing before. And we will continue to do that going forward.

Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Enrique. And if I have a follow-up just on PCs. If you look at industry expectations, there is below normal seasonality based on, you know, it’d be ODM builds or other things that in this third parties that we can look at. Below normal seasonal trends in the back half of this year and then even projections for a decline. You’re kind of saying something very different, which is, you know, sequentially consistent with prior years and then growth next year. So the implication here that HP is taking share? If you are, where is that coming from? Any particular regions, any particular players? And where is that success maybe coming from?

Enrique Lores: There are two comments. One is our projections are consistent with what we are seeing in the market. And we have seen strong commercial demand in Q3, have seen strong consumer demand. And as I mentioned before, we don’t think this is a pull-in of demand. We think this is real demand because it’s not only happening in the US, we are seeing this across multiple countries and across multiple geographies. In terms of our projections going forward, they rely on the fact that we continue to see strong demand for AIPCs, strong demand for Windows 11. And something I didn’t mention before is also the fact that we expect ASPs to continue to grow because of stronger demand and stronger growth in premium categories, which has been our strategy in the previous quarters and will continue to be going forward.

So answering your question on share, you know that our goal and our objective is not to grow share for the sake of gaining share, it’s to drive profitable growth. What we have been doing in the last quarters is growing share in the more premium segment of commercial consumer AIPCs, and this is going to continue to be our strategy going forward.

Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Enrique.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Michael Ng: Great. I just have two as well. One for Enrique on print and one for Karen just on capital allocation. Enrique, print, you guys have talked a little bit about the aggressive pricing environment, the demand in office. Softer than expected in North America and Europe. As you look out to, you know, the rest of this year and into next, was wondering if you could just talk about your expectation on those two things, pricing and the office environment, and whether you see that becoming better or worse in the next couple of months, in the next year or so. And then, Karen, I just wanted to ask for a clarification. Are we at the point from the gross leverage standpoint? I think you guys are below two now. Where you guys will return 100% free cash flow to shareholders as soon as next quarter?

And I just wanted to ask if you could clarify. When you guys talked about the revenue guidance for the segments, was that consistent with prior years? Or typical years? I feel like you may have said both. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you.

Enrique Lores: Okay. Let me start on the question on print demand. So at this point, what we are expecting or what we are building in the plans is a similar market behavior to what we have seen in Q3. Many of our competitors announced price increases as a consequence of the trade-related cost. What we have seen in the market is that these price increases didn’t materialize in the competitive space. So we are expecting that this aggressive price competition is going to continue going forward. We think it’s connected to the fact that the market was smaller, and therefore, there was more pressure on the price side. But as I said before, we think this is going to be temporary. We have not seen a change in the fundamental variable, which is the number of pages printed, which gives us confidence in the future.

And in terms of 2026, it’s early to give you a lot of detail. We will in the coming quarters, in the coming months, as we do more work to estimate what will be the demand for next year.

Karen Parkhill: Yep. And, Michael, on your second question on capital allocation, our leverage did improve from Q2 where it was slightly over 2.2x and improved in Q3 to just be slightly over two times, at 2.04 in Q3. And that was driven by improved EBITDA and the repayment of a debt maturity that we had in June. While it could remain slightly elevated, we do expect it to continue to improve in FY ’26. So we do anticipate more repurchase activity soon. And I would say, should we continue to operate at higher leverage levels, we would use cash to reduce debt as bonds mature. That would also enable us to repurchase stock as well.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Maya: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Maya on for Erik. Enrique, maybe if we start with you, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on your AIPC comments? When we speak to CIOs or channel partners, we don’t hear as much enthusiasm for AIPCs, but clearly, your comments prove otherwise. So can you just please unpack maybe the industries you see adopting AIPCs or regions that are particularly strong, and then what are the key use cases you’re hearing that are driving this AIPC adoption?

Enrique Lores: Yeah. And I think it’s really my comments are driven by what we see in actuals. As I said, in the prepared remarks, our mix of AIPCs today is more than 25%, and this is the goal that we had for Q4, for the end of the year. So we are one quarter ahead of our original target, which shows the demand that we see. I think the key thing behind the AIPCs is the fact that over the next quarters, more and more software applications are going to take advantage of the capabilities that the AIPCs have. And we have started to see it now, and we expect that it will continue. For example, we have now Adobe and Zoom that are taking advantage of the capabilities of running some of their applications software in the PCs, which means it will be faster and also it will reduce some of the cloud costs that they will be having.

We have seen security companies like CrowdStrike taking advantage of the ability to use the NPUs to scan the memory faster, which means for many of their applications, this brings a significant advantage. Also, Microsoft is doing a remarkable job continuing to improve the libraries that they offer to other companies so they can do a lot of activities in the PCs that before they had to do in the cloud. And finally, of our own AI applications, during the last month, we launched AI companion OpenAI, we launched a specific AI application in China. We continue to see month over month and quarter over quarter improvements in utilization. So we see clearly a gradual improvement. And as we said to many of our customers, if you are driving a refresh of your installed base, an AIPC you expect to leave two, three, four years and you expect your employees to use it for this time.

If you don’t want to be left out of the productivity improvements that over time are going to come, you should be considering buying an AIPC now, and this is what we see happening.

Maya: Great. Thank you. And then, you know, I know you mentioned that we’re a little over 50% of the way through the Windows 11 refresh. You know, if we think about the SMB category, do you see them adopting more of that twelve-month extended support that could come back and refresh in 2026? Or kind of how do the trends differ by underlying customer segments?

Enrique Lores: Yeah. I think it’s a good question. So first of all, when we look at the total conversion, we are behind what we have been in other years. You know, sorry, in previous refreshes, this is why we think this process is going to be extended. When we look at the penetration in enterprise versus SMB, this is very consistent with what we have seen before. The changes are in enterprise, and over time it takes in SMB. This is what is happening this year, which is very consistent with previous refreshes. So we see a bigger opportunity in SMB going forward, which, again, is very consistent with previous refreshes that happened before.

Maya: Great. Thank you.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alek Valero with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.

Alek Valero: Hey, guys. This is Alek on for Ananda. Thank you for taking my questions. Just very quickly on the poly business, is there anything that you could update us on? Are you seeing any noticeable pickup or increased certainty in enterprise and corporate spending?

Enrique Lores: Thank you. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that this was not a strong quarter for what we call hybrid systems. We have seen companies, especially in Europe, especially in the headset space, deprioritizing some of these projects versus PCs or versus AI. So we have seen an impact in the short term. We continue to think that this is going to be or this is a very important business for us going forward. And we continue to invest not only on the headset space, also in the video side. We announced a very innovative solution on 3D video collaboration that we did with Google. And we are going to continue to invest in this category. On the other side, on the gaming side, similar categories, we have seen very strong growth this quarter. This is driven by HyperX. So on that side of the peripheral space, we had a strong quarter.

Alek Valero: Very helpful. And just a quick follow-up. As part of your refresh initiative, is there any specific part of product lines that you are eyeing to refresh?

Enrique Lores: Is the question on PCs or really across the full portfolio?

Alek Valero: Yeah. Just across the full portfolio.

Enrique Lores: I mean, the answer is yes. Across the board, we continue to invest very significantly in R&D. Innovation is a key part of how we win and how we compete. And next year, there will be refreshes across the PC portfolio, both in the consumer side, in the commercial side, in the workstation space, and many of the key areas of printing. So lots of innovation is coming. We mentioned a bit of that of what we did in Q3, but the next quarters are going to be very exciting from an innovation perspective.

Alek Valero: Super helpful. Thank you, guys.

Enrique Lores: So I think it was the last question. So in closing, let me reiterate a few of the key points that we have been making. First of all, we are executing with discipline in an environment that continues to be dynamic. Second, we expect to continue to see momentum in the refreshed catalyst driving growth in the PC market. As I just mentioned, we are innovating to be a leader in the future of work, and we remain very energized by the opportunities that we see ahead. And before we wrap the call, I want to share that Orit will be moving to a new role as my new chief of staff. And I want to use this opportunity to thank her for her leadership as global head of IR. Her financial insight, sound judgment, and guidance have been invaluable to HP, to me, and to Karen, and we look forward to her continued strong contribution in her next role.

Chinese government agencies have unveiled a plan to stabilize the steel industry for 2025-2026, which involves reducing production and tightening control over companies in the industry. According to market estimates, steel output in 2025 will be less than 980 million tons, which is at least 25 million tons lower than in 2024 (1.005 billion tons). This was reported by SteelOrbis.

The document, developed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the Ministry of Commerce, and the State Administration of Market Regulation, does not set specific reduction targets. Instead, it refers to “precise regulation” of capacities, the closure of obsolete equipment, and support for high-tech production. The added value of metallurgy in 2025-2026 is expected to grow by an average of 4% annually.

In January-July 2025, steel production in China fell by 3.1% y/y – to 594.47 million tons, which means a drop of 19 million tons compared to the same period in 2024. Representatives of Chinese factories note that the rate of decline has slowed down compared to what was predicted at the beginning of the year, when there was talk of a potential reduction of 50 million tons.

The key areas of state policy will be to reduce overall steel production and implement “categorised management” of enterprises, i.e. the classification of plants according to efficiency and environmental standards, followed by regulatory measures.

One common misconception is that the best way to reduce an organization’s water footprint is to simply not use water on premise for cooling infrastructure.
However, data centers providers don’t have to go it alone.
Effective cooling solutions require deployment of cutting-edge real-time monitoring technologies, fluid management programs and local service expertise at global scale to help operators maximize cooling efficiency while minimizing impact.
Visit the Ecolab website to learn more about our innovative data center cooling solutions.","Today’s exponential increases in computing loads bring proportional increases in power and cooling demand. This makes efficient resource management not just an environmental issue but an organizational imperative. Resource scarcity is already disrupting expansion plans, increasing operational costs and threatening business continuity.

When evaluating any cooling method, data centers need to take a holistic approach to consider the direct and indirect impact of energy and other resources both on and off premise. Organizations need high-quality, efficient solutions at scale so that when workloads evolve, their cooling infrastructure can adapt accordingly.

Why water?

One common misconception is that the best way to reduce an organization’s water footprint is to simply not use water on premise for cooling infrastructure. In some regions and geographies, without more in-depth analysis, this approach may cause a facility to generate larger hydro and power footprints, based solely on the thermodynamics of water itself.

Water can remove more than 3,200 times as much heat as air. Depending on geography, climate and workload, air-cooled, waterless chillers can consume anywhere from 10–30% more power than their water-based counterparts. Think about taking your glove off when it’s freezing outside versus plunging your hand in ice water or jumping into a swimming pool when it’s hot outside versus sitting in front of a fan. In both cases, the water cools faster and more effectively.

Industry challenges

Answering the questions as to whether and when to leverage water as part of data center cooling infrastructure is not as straightforward as it would appear on the surface. However, data centers providers don’t have to go it alone. Collaboration with a cooling- and water-management expert can help data centers understand the complexity of their cooling systems and adapt to rapidly changing demands with confidence, enabling site staff to maintain focus on uptime and daily operations.

Whether a cooling system is being designed for greenfield or brownfield developments, a strategic approach to prudent use of alternative water sources in data centers can produce large gains in operational and environmental efficiency (see Figure 1 below).

Effective cooling solutions require deployment of cutting-edge real-time monitoring technologies, fluid management programs and local service expertise at global scale to help operators maximize cooling efficiency while minimizing impact. As an example, Ecolab’s current portfolio offers a variety of digital innovations to deliver data and actionable performance and operational insights in real time, such as:

Ecolab Water Quality IQ

3D TRASAR Technology for Cooling Water

3D TRASAR Technology for Adiabatic Cooling

Ecolab Water Track IQ

Critically, these digital tools deliver enterprise visibility to operational performance across a provider’s portfolio to help establish benchmarks as well as identify and scale best practices and continuous improvement.

Optimization at work

Using this approach, we recently piloted an AI-driven water conservation solution with Digital Realty in 35 of their U.S. data centers to help identify real-time operational inefficiencies in cooling systems and recommend actions for fast improvement. Once fully implemented, the solution is expected to drive up to a 15% reduction in water use, extend the life of equipment and avoid the withdrawal of up to 126 million gallons of potable water from local watersheds annually.

Time and again, we have demonstrated that prioritizing the health of businesses and planet don’t have to be mutually exclusive. With the right expertise, it is possible to design and manage cooling systems that are both good for planet and good for business. At Ecolab, we are proud to support this progress and remain committed to helping the data center industry harness the full potential of cooling and the technology it supports.

Toby at Made By Humans reveals that he’s been talking with other production companies to help them achieve certain shots or elements.
“We never planned on being partners with other production companies, that wasn't like our intention,” he laughs.","In the world of commercial production, AI is moving from hype to hands-on. While some see it as a threat and others are sceptical, there’s no denying that there’s been a quantum leap forward in generative AI video tech in recent months. And that has inspired a new breed (or generation, if you will) of production companies that are harnessing AI as their creative raw material.

Speaking to some of the new companies that have emerged in the gen AI video boom, as well as a fair few familiar names from the world of commercial production that have adopted and adapted, we set out to find out what generative AI is really doing for the world of independent production right now. And with that comes a caveat: given the breakneck speed at which the tech is moving, this may well be out of date within a month.

So buckle up!

The Tech, the Tech, the Tech

In the world of generative artificial intelligence, Kent Boswell of recently launched Australian production company AiCandy tells me the measure of progress for AI video is Will Smith eating spaghetti. It’s based on the acid-trip-gone-horribly-wrong nightmare fuel video from 2023, which sees the Fresh Prince sprout new fingers and merge with the noodles which writhe around his plate. The same prompt in 2025 creates something that’s shockingly advanced, much more realistic and stable - and far less psychically scarring.

Gen AI video platforms like Sora, Runway and Luma have released several major updates, and this May, Google released Veo 3 which allows for greater consistency and can generate native audio that’s synchronised with the video. This leap forward in technology has, in turn, created greater appetite for AI video from clients.

“There was definitely a tipping point a couple of months ago where although generative, AI video was a thing, it was nowhere near production-ready,"" says James Hilditch, founder and creative director at video production company BearJam, which has developed an AI offering. ""You could do fun things, and it might work for a shot or a quick moment, but actually that seemed that it suddenly just tipped over for us. Now the quality is good enough to put out.""

His colleague, Trey Farley, a director and creator and former camera operator, says that this evolution has translated into an upswing in the jobs coming in and interest from clients. Over the past two months he says it’s gone from ‘a trickle’ to a ‘steady flow’.

For a more visceral demonstration of how dramatically things have improved, just speak to the team at Silverside AI, the AI innovation lab spun out of agency Pereira O’Dell. In November last year, it helped Coca-Cola remake its classic Christmas campaign, 'Holidays Are Coming'. As one of the biggest brands to take gen AI advertising to the mainstream, it was a pioneer in the space . Founder Rob Wrubel chuckles at that word, recalling the fate of the pioneers on the Oregon Trail.

“Literally, they step out in Texas on the Oregon Trail, and all the pioneers get killed by hurricanes, arrows, whatever,” he laughs as he looks back on the reaction they had when they first popped their heads up. “So I do feel like we have had that pioneer spirit, like we'll figure out some way through this. Yeah, but it has been super fun and exciting.”

His partner in crime at Silverside, the inimitable PJ Pereira, chimes in. “When we started to do it, people said we were either crazy or idiots or traitors. Now they’re like, you are right.”

As much as many have been taken by surprise by the speed of AI video’s development, PJ says its trajectory tracks with what he expected to see given his experience with other advertising tech-driven revolutions, like digital.

The rate of improvement is exhilarating but challenging to keep up with. Jan De Loore at Belgian production company AiCandy (not to be confused with the Australian company of the same name) shares an example: earlier in the year, a project for Oxfam involved some labour-intensive, complicated lip sync challenges. And just weeks after completion, Google’s Veo 3 launched, with its advanced lip sync capabilities, rendering their technical efforts obsolete. “As soon as our production is finished, it happens that a new tool comes on the market, which could have halved our work efforts,” reflects Jan.

A New Gen-eration of Production Companies

As the technology has improved, allowing filmmakers to wield greater control and to produce shots with more polish, inevitably a new breed of production companies is popping up. Some are existing prod cos that have pivoted or have set up AI-specific labels or rosters. Companies like The Sweetshop have made AI available to all of the directors on their roster, allowing them to level up to become directors who are well versed in both traditional filmmaking and AI, as well as launching AI creative studio The Gardening Club, with a roster of AI artists. Imagine This launched a separate banner, Made By Humans about a year and a half ago, which includes a carefully curated roster of AI artists backed up by its production know-how. Kode, also in the UK, has been putting AI to work as a tool to improve productivity and lessen the financial and time burden of unpaid pitches.

Of course there are also companies that have spawned entirely from scratch in response to the AI gold rush. In Belgium, AiCandy emerged when motion graphics expert Jan won a prompt battle hosted by experienced film producer Hans. Since launching in January, it has had an explosion of interest from clients, and has worked on over 10 projects.

Meanwhile in Australia, another company bearing the same name, AiCandy, but completely unrelated, has recently launched, headed up by experienced commercial producer Kent and creative Marcus Tesoriero. The seeds of their company sprouted - where else? - over a beer at Cannes Lions 2024 as the pair saw the wall-to-wall AI panels and talks, and figured they didn’t want to be left behind and that their combined experience put them in a strong position to meet clients’ high expectations. Their phones, they say, haven’t stopped ringing since their launch at the end of July and they already have two projects greenlit.

“The reaction we’ve had since launch confirms we’ve identified a hole in the market,” says Kent. “We were certainly first to market in Australia, and arguably probably one of the first in the world. The offering is so unique… We’ve spent the last six months scouring all corners of the globe looking for the best AI film directors around the planet and we’ve got them signed exclusively to us here in APAC. It’s allowing us to go to market with an incredible offering, where we can guarantee we’re going to be able to create really compelling stories with beautiful film techniques that are highly crafted and going to engage the audience.”

AiCandy Australia's 2025 showreel

And then there are the exciting outsiders. If AI truly is a democratising force, it figures that we’d see companies pop up that have little previous connection to the advertising industry. That’s sort of true for Anima Studios, a company made up of four friends - Riccardo Fredro, Nick Montori, Ruggero Ghinzelli and Florin Smolevschi - from the same Italian town. While one of them is a sound designer who has worked for years in commercials, that’s not true of the rest.

Anima began life as a TikTok account for the friends to create, at first, AI images and, later, video of their sci-fi stories. Amassing over 600,000 followers, 4.4 million likes and tens of millions of views, they quickly found an audience. But as TikTok had no suitable monetisation options in Belgium and Italy, where the Anima crew is currently based, they had to find other ways to make money with their newly acquired skills. And so they’ve found opportunities in commercial production, as well as helping a major holding company visualise ideas in pitches - and they also create trailers for movie directors looking to generate funding for their film ideas. They’ve been doing the rounds in recent weeks with a spec ad for Lays, which has sparked interest and debate on LinkedIn.

Clients Are Coming

The tech’s getting there, the companies are eager, but what about clients? It’s no secret that there’s a divide between the brands that are proactively experimenting with and embracing AI and those who are continuing to avoid it. And speaking to these varied companies, another interesting trend comes to light: it’s start-ups and small-to-medium sized companies and organisations that are most enthusiastic, and least likely to be put off by legal grey areas of using open source gen AI platforms. They tend not to have the cautious legal teams of multinational brands. Jan at AiCandy in Belgium recalls creating a campaign for a major European car client only for an anxious legal team to suddenly pull it.

“We feel that it's mainly the smaller clients that are more prone to taking the risk and see the opportunities. They have always been limited by budgets, but now, with a rather low budget, they can create stunning commercials,” says Jan. “ They're not bound to agencies, no international legal restrictions and so on and so on. So they are more agile.”

Case in point, AiCandy's campaign for Belgian dairy brand Inex. Whatever its budget, it certainly didn't stretch to hiring stunt cows to jump out of helicopters.

What’s something James at BearJam has observed too. “I think smaller start-up brands are more comfortable. Perhaps they don't have in house legal teams that are saying, ‘hang on, let's just pause on this’. They're just like: this is great. We can do more, bigger stuff for our budgets. And I think they're happy to kind of just move quickly and get it done and not necessarily get too caught up in the usage rights and issues like that,” he says, though he notes he’s aware of major brands that are starting to push the envelope, so things are ‘gradually shifting’.

As we’ll see later, not all ads that use generative AI are 100% generative AI. The brands that made a PR play of being ‘first to market’ with gen AI video ads took a risk and were as much leveraging the power of conversation as they were the power of artificial intelligence. However, beyond the headline-grabbing controversies, a number of clients have been quietly making use of gen AI tech and talent to pull off challenging shots.

It’s also true that AI allows companies with more modest marketing budgets who would normally be limited to very domestic-scale ideas to embrace bigger, more outlandish concepts. While AI commercial production could represent a race to the bottom on cost, the other way to look at it is that it opens the doors for a whole new raft of potential clients .

“We’ve opened the door to brands and clients that possibly could never, in their wildest imagination, dreamt of having an advertising campaign because they couldn’t afford it. Now the can, which is fantastic,” says Kent of Australia’s AiCandy.

Storytelling is Everything

Anyone who’s followed the conversation around gen AI video will be familiar with the term ‘slop’ - low effort, poorly produced dross flooding social feeds. The companies we speak to have strong feelings about ideas, storytelling skills and filmmaking knowhow as crucial differentiators.

“I think it has major implications for the whole industry. I think we will be flooded with crap, so to speak, from now on, more and more. I think that's maybe one of the main issues going forward; how are we going to have our brands going to differentiate themselves, and how are they going to stick out?, “ ponders Jan. “I believe, at least for now, that, yeah, a good idea and vision is still crucial.""

Those producers and directors with extensive experience in film argue that a deep understanding of the language of film - the storytelling techniques, the technical specs, the aesthetics - is key to creating quality AI video.

Referring to a slide in their pitch deck, Kent says, “In theory, I could hand you the keys to an F1 fighter jet and go, ‘Hey, jump in, take it for a spin’. I know I would crash and burn. And so it's the same thing with AI. If AI is in the wrong hands, of people that don't understand film craft, don't understand film language, don't understand when to hold for that extra two frames, to drop that moment in comedy… it's just going to be vanilla.”

However, that storytelling ability may be found in surprising places. PJ Pereira is convinced that AI is breaking down the old boxes that creative people have been forced into. To demonstrate, he shares a provocation - is writing prompts for generative AI an exercise in copywriting (it uses words, afterall) or art direction (you’re trying to guide an image)? A conundrum, indeed, if the industry needs to cleave to those highly specific job roles.

PJ and Rob reveal that in their team at Silverside, they pull together a diverse range of specialists, and over time even the technologists have stepped forward to direct.

PJ refers to an editor who has joined the team. His storytelling has been honed over decades, sure, but he didn’t sit in the director ‘box’. “We hired an editor that has 20 years of experience in editing, and for 20 years the only thing that he was allowed to determine was where a shot starts and when a shot ends, and what goes before and after,” he says. “That’s the only thing that he can influence… the guy is a real filmmaker.”

Jan at AiCandy echoes that sentiment. “It opens up possibilities for people with another background, with no knowledge of filmmaking, and I see that as a positive, because it also applied to myself, “ he says. “I'm a motion designer. I made some films, but I'm not really a cinematographer, so I always had some ideas, but I cut myself off from the idea to produce these things, because I don't like large production crews. The thing I hate about film production and advertising film production is the fact that it's so hierarchical, and all tasks are split between several units and people, but now It's kind of any idea can be visualized and created.""

A Complex Production Challenge

Before delving into the realities of AI filmmaking, for most people the impression is that it’s as simple as button mashing a prompt onto a keyboard and popping out a fully formed film. But the realities are much more complicated.

Alongside the ability to tell a story and evoke and provoke emotion, there are some core ‘traditional’ producing skills that are also vital for good quality AI filmmaking.

For one thing, the workflows are often incredibly complex. Toby Walsham at Made By Humans shares a glimpse of a workflow of an AI shot, and it’s a filigree of lines and layers. Each AI video tool has its own strengths and weaknesses - and that changes with every update - and each project requires its own carefully considered stack of programmes and platforms.

“I think it’s very comparable to early VFX days,” says Toby, who spent a significant amount of time in the world of VFX before moving to live action. “It’s not everyone that can do it. There is definitely a misconception that everyone can be an AI artist. It isn’t the case. We signed people that we thought would be great AI artists and we dropped them since you need to be a storyteller and a creative, but also very tech savvy. AI is not just prompting and writing something amazing. It’s not copywriting.""

The producer’s ability to bridge the gap between brand and talent is another crucial skill which might be even more important with AI. That’s because generative AI - for whatever medium - is iterative. It’s a tool whose outputs are determined by probabilities. That means that it’s extremely rarely (dare we say, never) a case of inputting a prompt and finding the first output to be usable. Crafting shots that have consistency and that adhere to brand demands and creative standards requires not just creative talent but someone steadying the ship.

For the team at Kode, their explorations of AI have revealed just how crucial their very human skill of producing really is - and where it might sit alongside the radical new AI talent popping up.

“We’re acutely aware of the fact that there’s lots of talented individuals who know how to do the prompting and operating the tools, but they don’t all have the decades of experience that we do have within this market and within this category. We're great at finding and developing talent, pairing them with clients and agencies, and managing a strategic, creative and production process that sees good commercial results,” says Jack Goodwin, executive producer.

Which brings us to one of the most interesting tensions around the way that AI will play out in production. Is it a force that breaks down barriers and democratises filmmaking - or does it make that singular creative vision and production skill all the more important? And the answer seems to be: both? Kind of?

Anima is an enticing example of a company that’s emerged from pure creative passion. “We started crafting our own original content,” says Anima co-founder Riccardo Fredro. “So we realised, hey, this gives you the opportunity to tell stories and to do things that we always were passionate about, like science fiction or creating a musical artist and so on and so forth. And so we started exploring both the ad space and our own originals. And then along with it came other opportunities.”

A Race to the Bottom or Raising the Bar?

Cost is a misapprehension that everyone we speak to raises. Creating engaging stories with high production values and a high level of brand control requires skill, creativity, time and, yes, money. While they acknowledge that artificial intelligence can be used to churn out low quality, low cost assets (slop, see above), they argue that it can also be used to raise the creative bar.

The production complexities and time consuming iterations combined with the creative talent needed to create good film using AI means that it’s not necessarily cheap - however it might allow clients to get more from their budgets.

Small to medium clients might find they suddenly have access to big, outlandish ideas when previously their budgets limited them to simple, domestic-scale ideas. Big clients might find their budgets might stretch to more films and assets than their big budgets would previously achieve.

Toby reveals that while the budgets he was receiving last year were low, as the technology improves and confidence grows, he’s seeing more of those big six figure budgets up for grabs for AI producers and filmmakers.

Riccardo at Anima uses the example of a campaign for a consultancy where they were able to use AI to turn consultants into spec op spies. Far beyond the usual B2B marketing budget. “We wanted to give those same tools and that same access to that quality, also to smaller companies,” he says.

For the evangelists at least, they don’t see a race to the bottom, but a creative launchpad to the stars. “From our point of view it’s bloody exciting because we’re unlocking new opportunities that could never be done before because there have always been a myriad of reasons holding us back. Now there’s almost no excuse to not do the best work of your career now,” says Kent.

AI? Live Action? Why Choose?

One thing that becomes clear is that when it comes to deciding between AI or more traditional production methods, it’s not all-or-nothing. Many of the companies we’ve spoken to talk about stacking different methods and technologies and choosing the right tool for the job. So some heavily AI jobs still need a bit of old school compositing or colour grading - and some seemingly ‘trad’ jobs are actually making use of a sprinkling of AI to achieve challenging or budget-unfriendly shots.

Toby at Made By Humans reveals that he’s been talking with other production companies to help them achieve certain shots or elements. “We never planned on being partners with other production companies, that wasn't like our intention,” he laughs. “But a lot of production companies, and I think rightly so, are going, ‘we don't do AI because that's not our expertise, but telling stories is’, and they need partners like us.”

It’s become a cliché at this point to refer to AI as ‘just another tool’, but perhaps, once the hype has calmed that’s exactly what it will become. An option, just like stop motion or CG animation or live-action filmmaking.

Silverside hit the headlines with their 100% AI work but even these leaders in the field are now bringing together remote live action filmmaking with AI in a current job. Just as PJ is convinced that AI will blur or totally destroy the boundaries between job roles, perhaps we'll also see less of a distinction between work that's live action, animated or AI as techniques bleed into one another.

What Does the Production Model of the Future Look Like?

The million-and-a-bit dollar question is: what will the production company model look like in the age of AI? People are trying different things, and it’s unlikely we’ll end up with one standard approach. The likes of Made by Humans, the Australian AiCandy and The Sweetshop are betting on shifting the traditional prod co model of signing/repping directors to signing a roster of AI artists. At BearJam, they talk about pairing directors with AI artists, tailored to the requirements of a particular jobs.

However, those we speak to suggest that the gentlemanly way the industry approaches signing and repping directors in specific markets may not easily transfer over to AI artists who often transcend boundaries.

Then there are small nimble studios like Anima or the Belgian AiCandy, which take the whole project on, and can take on concepting and script writing functions. (Although check out their AI short 'Advertising Professionals in 2030' for a particularly bleak look at where they wryly suspect even the AI creators might end up.)

Then there’s the free-flowing ‘laboratory’ approach of the likes of Silverside, where different specialisms are brought together and invited to push into new spaces. PJ is all for breaking down models and structures in order to allow AI to truly liberate talent. “We industrialised the creative process and we somehow made ourselves believe that industrialising the creative process was a romantic idea, “ he says. “That’s dumb, That’s uncreative.”",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2025-08/AI-Piece.B3gU-cmS.png,N,,2025-08-29 08:05:44.675722

It rebranded the chain as Best Buy Express, and the stores sell mobile services, cellphones and electronics.

Those Canadian quarterly operations compare with the company's U.S. division, which generated US$8.7 billion in revenue, up a comparatively meagre 0.9 per cent versus the same quarter last year. Best Buy said that increase was primarily driven by comparable sales growing 1.1 per cent.

Overall, Best Buy generated US$186 million in quarterly profit, down from US$291 million in the same quarter one year ago.

Profit margins lagged in both jurisdictions though the U.S. division achieved a slight edge.

Best Buy's U.S. gross profit rate in the quarter was 23.4 per cent, down from 23.5 per cent in the same quarter last year primarily due to lower product margin rates, the company said. The same phenomenon was in place in Canada, where the gross profit rate was 21.8 per cent, compared with 23.9 per cent in the same quarter last year.

Barry was asked about the impact of tariffs on her business in the conference call with analysts.

""Some vendors are clearly communicating cost increases,"" she said.

""Some are adjusting promotions. Some are planning to potentially increase prices with new product introductions, which always happens in our space, and some are just not increasing them at all given these are very, very global supply chains.""

She added that what she saw in the quarter related to tariffs was what she expected.

""Those strategies, when they're all put together, are ensuring that those cost increases are much, much less than the overall effective rate of the tariffs because we're able to put so many of those other mitigation strategies into play.""

BIV asked Best Buy Canada president Mat Povse earlier this summer about the impact of tariffs on his business. Given that his business is in Canada and not in the U.S., his imports would not be subject to U.S. tariffs on foreign-made products. Instead, it would be subject to Canadian tariffs such as the Canadian retaliatory tariffs on the U.S.

Povse said that most of Best Buy Canada's imports come from Asia or Mexico and as a result they would not be subject to the retaliatory tariffs.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said last week he would get rid of many retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods starting Sept. 1.

Povse is slated to be a speaker at the Retail Council of Canada's Retail West conference in Vancouver on Sept. 25.

Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper slumped 9% after the opening bell on Monday.","Keurig Dr Pepper will buy the owner of Peet’s Coffee, Douwe Egberts and Kenco in an $18bn deal, then break itself in two, with one company selling coffee and the other selling cold beverages like Snapple, Dr Pepper, 7UP and energy drinks.

The agreement announced on Monday will essentially unwind the 2018 merger of Keurig and Dr Pepper and it arrives at a time when consumers are pulling back and the trade wars under Donald Trump threaten to send coffee prices soaring.

Trump imposed a 50% tariff this summer on most imports from Brazil – the world’s leading coffee producer – for its investigation of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally.

Yet Keurig Dr Pepper sees coffee and cold beverages as areas of growth that would be better navigated by independently operating companies. CEO Tim Cofer called it a “transformational moment” for the sector.

“By creating two sharply focused beverage companies with attractive and tailored growth propositions and capital allocation strategies, we are poised to generate significant shareholder value in both the near and long term,” Cofer wrote in prepared remarks.

But large chains like Starbucks are suffering. Same-store sales, a key barometer of a retailer’s health, has fallen for six straight quarters at the Seattle coffee giant and its shares have tumbled 23% since early March.

Dr Pepper Keurig is offsetting some declines with higher prices. In its last quarter, the company reported a 0.2% decline in coffee sales.

For Keurig Dr Pepper, the soon-to-be separated coffee business will have about $16bn in combined sales and the beverage business about $11bn, the companies said.

The companies expect to save about $400m over three years because of the merger.

The company that Keurig Dr Pepper is buying, JDE Peet’s, is based in Amsterdam, and also owns the brands L’OR, Jacobs, Pilao, OldTown, Super and Moccona.

Once the two companies are separated, Cofer will become CEO of the cold beverage business, which will be based in Frisco, Texas. Keurig Dr Pepper’s chief financial officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi, will lead the coffee business, which will be located in Burlington, Massachusetts. Its international headquarters is in Amsterdam.

Keurig Dr Pepper will pay €31.85 for each JDE Peet’s share, which is about 33% higher than the average price the shares have sold for over the past three months. Shareholders will also receive a previously declared €0.36 per share dividend before closing.

An affiliate of JAB Holdings, Acorn Holdings, and certain directors and officers holding 69% of JDE Peet’s voting power have agreed to sell their shares.

Following completion of the acquisition, expected in the first half of 2026, KDP intends to separate into two US-listed public companies: Global Coffee Co, a pure-play coffee business with about $16 billion in annual sales, and Beverage Co, focused on North American refreshment beverages with over $11 billion in annual sales.

The combined coffee business will operate in more than 100 countries, holding leading market positions in 40, and will encompass brands including Keurig, Jacobs, L’OR and Peet’s. KDP expects to save about $400 million a year within three years by combining operations, and to increase its earnings per share in the first year after the deal closes.

Beverage Co will retain brands such as Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, 7UP and A&W, as well as operations in Mexico and Canada. It will leverage a direct-store-delivery network and target expansion in high-growth categories such as energy drinks and functional beverages.

KDP CEO Tim Cofer will lead Beverage Co after the split, while current CFO Sudhanshu Priyadarshi will head Global Coffee Co. JDE Peet’s CEO Rafa Oliveira will remain in place until the transaction closes.

Global Coffee Co will be headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, with international headquarters in Amsterdam. Beverage Co will be based in Frisco, Texas.

Tim Cofer said: ""Today's announcement marks a transformational moment in the beverage industry, as we build on KDP's disruptive legacy by creating two winning companies, including a new global coffee champion.

Rafa Oliveira added: ""We are excited to join forces with Keurig to chart the future of global coffee by leveraging our combined portfolio of the world's most beloved coffee brands.

Speaking to ABC News, he maintained Australia Post was not handing out the collection cap yet.","Australia Post's chief executive has defended the postal carrier's decision to immediately halt most shipping to the United States, just four days before a tariff deadline on low-value packages arriving there came into play.

The federal government-owned national postal carrier notified business customers over email just after 7:00am AEST on Tuesday that it was halting most US shipping, effective immediately.

The decision took many of its business customers off guard, including Sydney-based company Mediband, which ships medical alert bracelets to hospitals and customers in the US.

""We got a letter at 7am in the morning notifying us that we could no longer ship,"" its managing director, Michael Randall, told ABC News on Thursday.

In an interview with ABC News on Friday, Australia Post chief executive Paul Graham maintained the postal carrier foreshadowed issues with postage to the US, ahead of its decision to immediately halt services on Tuesday.

""We did tell customers in advance that this was looming,"" he said.

Why Australia Post halted most US shipping

Australia Post's suspension of most shipments to the US follows the Trump administration axing the ""de minimis"" exemption.

Until now, parcels of goods worth less than $US800 ($1,230) were not taxed when they arrived in the US — an exemption relied upon by many Australian retailers to send items to the US duty-free.

This exemption was axed for China already in 2025, throwing retailers including Shein and Temu off guard.

Originally, this exemption was not supposed to end for the rest of the world until 2027. Yet last month, the deadline was brought forward to August 29, 2025.

""Until such time as the actual decision was going to be enforced, we ran the risk of actually going early and then the US government changing its mind again, which it has done before,"" Mr Graham told ABC News.

""It's been very difficult for our team members, but most importantly, difficult for our customers.

""Because there has been a degree of uncertainty around the whole tariff landscape for the US Is it on? Is it not on?

""Originally, we were told that the de minimis would not be removed until 2027 and then the system was brought rapidly forward, but we have to deal with that.

Australia Post is just one of many global postal services using traditional mail routes that have halted US shipping.

The issue for them is that they do not have systems in place that can deal with collecting and distributing the new taxes on low-value goods going into the US.

However, Mr Graham said Australia Post's commercial side of its business does have these logistics, but noted they were more expensive for customers to use.

He said they hoped to have all US shipping back ""within weeks, not months"".

""We're working night and day to implement this new solution,"" he said.

Private companies taking up Australia Post's market

Many private companies are pushing ahead with shipping to the US because they have systems in place to deal with the new tariffs on goods there.

Australia Post's Mr Graham spoke to ABC News on the day that its annual financial results were released, where the federally owned postal carrier warned about the loss of its business to private companies.

The results revealed a $18.8m profit in 2024-25, which was described as ""modest"". That was a vast improvement on the year before, when Australia Post lost $88.5 million.

The slim profit was based on continued growth in the parcels side of its business, by 4.3 per cent. The sending of letters and documents weighed on the overall result, haemorrhaging $230 million last year.

Even with parcels, Australia Post is warning about ""intensifying structural headwinds"", amid fierce competition from private couriers.

""We don't take any money from the government. We are fully self-funded. We have been focusing on strengthening our balance sheet,"" Mr Graham said.

Australia Post is mandated by law to send letters and to service regional and remote Australia.

Its chief executive says there will come a time when it reduces its letter services further, with it now delivering them every second day to households.

""The average household receives between one and two letters a week and sends between five and eight a year,"" he said.

As part of its results release, Mr Graham warned that Australia Post would need to work hard to avoid the fate of many postal services in other nations, which have required government bailouts. Speaking to ABC News, he maintained Australia Post was not handing out the collection cap yet.

Atlas Air and Etihad Cargo expand partnership

Atlas Air, Inc., a subsidiary of Atlas Air Worldwide, has announced a new long-term partnership with Etihad Cargo, the freight and logistics arm of Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates. The deal will see Atlas Air operate a newly delivered Boeing 777 freighter on Etihad Cargo’s behalf, strengthening the carrier’s network at a time of rising global demand.

From August, the dedicated aircraft will begin services linking Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi and Madrid, three key hubs across Asia, the Middle East and Europe. The routes have been chosen to address expanding demand for air cargo services, particularly in sectors such as e-commerce, pharmaceuticals, automotive goods and perishable products.

The Boeing 777F is capable of carrying over 100 tonnes of cargo. With strong fuel efficiency and proven reliability, the type underpins Etihad Cargo’s commitment to sustainable and efficient transport solutions across its expanding network.

The partnership is not new; Atlas Air and Etihad Cargo have a relationship stretching back to 2012, when Atlas first provided flight services for the Abu Dhabi-based carrier. The new agreement, however, deepens the collaboration and provides Etihad Cargo with long-term dedicated capacity to capture new growth opportunities.

Michael Steen, Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Air Worldwide, praised the renewal of ties, stating the partnership “reflects our strong value proposition and the trust we’ve built with customers over time.” He emphasised Atlas Air’s ability to deliver tailored capacity solutions thanks to its global scale and wide-body freighter fleet.

Stanislas Brun, Chief Cargo Officer at Etihad Airways, described the agreement as a “strategic step in scaling capacity and extending our global reach.” He highlighted the importance of aligning the airline’s growing passenger fleet with parallel growth in freighter capacity to sustain momentum, strengthen trade lanes and ensure reliable service worldwide.

The tariff effects on rated APAC corporations have been modest so far.

US tariff-related hits to credit quality in APAC will become more pronounced, and the tariffs pose downside risk to the 12 per cent of rated APAC corporate and infrastructure issuers S&P Global Ratings views as exposed to material tariff-related effects. S&P Global expects the tariff will unevenly hit Indian corporations. US tariff actions on APAC nations will remain fluid, with varying effects, it noted.

US tariff actions on APAC nations will remain fluid, with varying effects across countries and sectors. This creates uncertainty—and risk—for bondholders, the rating agency said recently in a report.

The indirect impact of potential weaker macroeconomic conditions poses a greater risk than the direct effect of tariffs levied on countries and sectors.

The auto sector in the region faces the most direct tariff impact. The chemicals and metals & mining sectors are most exposed to indirect effects, as these sectors are already facing structural and cyclical pressures.

About 80 per cent of the corporations S&P Global Ratings rates in APAC are investment-grade. They carry quite a bit of financial flexibility against immediate tariff impacts.

However, the indirect (or second order) effects could be pervasive. These include a global or regional slowdown, the report noted.

Tariffs may also amplify existing cyclical and structural pressures, such as overcapacity in China.

The risk of a sudden influx of cheap goods in regional markets to offset a loss of access to the US market also poses a significant threat to the region's steel, textile, apparel and chemicals sectors.

Additional import duties and measures by several countries in the region will further escalate risks for exporters.

“While the latest US tariff differential among Asia-Pacific countries has narrowed, we believe trade flows and supply chains will continue to reshape, and this presents a category of risk in itself,” said the report.

S&P Global expects the additional US tariff will unevenly hit Indian corporations. Exporters of capital goods, chemicals, automobiles and food and beverages will face the toughest adjustment. Pharmaceuticals and smartphones are insulated because of exemptions. But uncertainty remains especially for pharmaceuticals.

Expansion to further locations is now planned.

To accelerate its global expansion, Rebl has appointed Nicholas Tengelin – a seasoned executive from the automotive industry having held senior leadership roles at Volvo Cars, Hedin Mobility Group and Hogia – as its first external CEO. His mandate is to rapidly scale and industrialise Rebl’s position as the global leader in next-generation robotics.

ID22,JDE Peet’s,2025-08-29 09:57:32+00:00,www.bbc.com,Keurig Dr Pepper to buy Peet's coffee for $18bn - BBC,Natalie Sherman,,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4e7vp19p1o,"US drinks giant Keurig Dr Pepper has agreed to buy Dutch coffee firm JDE Peet's for €15.7bn (£13.6bn, $18.4bn) in the largest European acquisition in more than two years.
And Keurig Dr Pepper boss Tim Cofer said it was ""the right time"" for the transaction.
Last month, Keurig Dr Pepper executives told investors they expected growth in its coffee business to remain ""subdued"" this year, in part citing the hit from tariffs in the US, its most important market.
Jacobs Douwe Egberts merged with Peet's in 2019, creating JDE Peet's, which was taken public the next year.
It also owns about 4% of Keurig Dr Pepper.","US drinks giant Keurig Dr Pepper has agreed to buy Dutch coffee firm JDE Peet's for €15.7bn (£13.6bn, $18.4bn) in the largest European acquisition in more than two years.

The companies plan to split into two US-listed firms after the merger, with one focused on coffee brands including Douwe Egberts and L'Or - while the other will sell soft drinks such as Schweppes, Snapple and 7 Up.

Executives said the purchase was intended to create a ""resilient and diversified"" coffee business, forming a ""global coffee champion"" at a time when the industry is grappling with tariffs and high prices for coffee beans.

And Keurig Dr Pepper boss Tim Cofer said it was ""the right time"" for the transaction.

But shares in the firm sank more than 7% after the deal was announced amid concerns it was backing away from the strategy which created the US drinks behemoth - a merger between Dr Pepper's soda business and Green Mountain Coffee.

At the time, executives said they saw advantages in combining the distribution network, but it has struggled to deliver on that promise.

Last month, Keurig Dr Pepper executives told investors they expected growth in its coffee business to remain ""subdued"" this year, in part citing the hit from tariffs in the US, its most important market.

The new general soft drink business will be based in Texas and led by Mr Cofer.

Meanwhile the new merged coffee company, headquartered separately in Massachusetts, will boast a portfolio of brands representing $16bn in annual sales.

Executives said it would benefit from a global manufacturing footprint of more than 40 facilities.

Jacobs Douwe Egberts merged with Peet's in 2019, creating JDE Peet's, which was taken public the next year.

But the firm struggled to live up to expectations at a time when droughts in major coffee producing countries such as Brazil and Vietnam have driven up prices of raw coffee.

Earlier this year, it clashed with retailers in Europe over price increases, though it recently told investors it had resolved most of those disputes.

Situational awareness: Nvidia's results came after a scathing MIT report indicated 95% of companies see no return from their AI investments.","Nvidia closed the door on the Magnificent 7's earnings season with a whimper. But the results in total left investors overly bullish.

Why it matters: Nvidia's earnings results may not have been good enough for its own shareholders. But billions of dollars in AI spending commitments will be enough to sustain the broader tech rally, strategists say.

What they're saying: ""S&P 500 companies are dramatically increasing their capital expenditures on AI infrastructure,"" writes John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. ""This is a sustained investment trend, not a short-lived bubble.""

Nvidia's results speak to an accelerating AI growth story across the tech world.

By the numbers: Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet make up 40% of Nvidia's revenue, and those four make up 15% of the S&P 500.

The four companies have committed to spend over $360 billion on AI capital expenditure this year, according to their latest earnings results.

That kind of commitment will benefit Nvidia, as no formidable competitor has created equally powerful AI chips (yet).

Yes, but: It's not all bulls on the tech trade.

Dan Niles, tech investor and founder of Niles Investment Management, cautioned in a post on X that investors should be ""more broadly invested"" in the near term instead of simply buying into the Magnificent 7.

Nvidia's sales growth is slowing.

This quarter was also the lowest upside surprise for Nvidia's sales since the launch of ChatGPT.

Situational awareness: Nvidia's results came after a scathing MIT report indicated 95% of companies see no return from their AI investments.

Paul Meeks, head of technology research at Freedom Capital Markets, was ""shaken"" by the report, and added that market concentration bothers around AI him.

Bulls called the MIT report a sign of early adoption issues. Bears called it Wall Street's biggest fear.

What we're watching: Investors are bullish on the next 12 to 18 months for AI. The longer term picture is cloudier.

They Won't Stay Together For Long.,"JUAN CARLOS ARANCIBIA, Juan-Carlos-Arancibia, Investor's Business Daily",,,,,https://www.investors.com/news/peets-coffee-keurig-kdp-acquisition/,"In one of the largest buyouts in the U.S. this year, Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) agreed to acquire the owner of Peet's Coffee in a deal valued at more than $18 billion.
Keurig Combines With Peet's Coffee KDP owns Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and the line of Keurig coffee machines.
It also owns about 4% of Keurig Dr Pepper.
Keurig Dr Pepper stock fell more than 7% Monday morning.
Keurig Dr Pepper has a Composite Rating of 65.","In one of the largest buyouts in the U.S. this year, Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) agreed to acquire the owner of Peet's Coffee in a deal valued at more than $18 billion. KDP plans to eventually split the two companies into two publicly traded companies.

KDP will pay Amsterdam-based JDE Peet's shareholders 31.85 euros, or about $37, per share in cash. The offer marks a 33% premium to JDE Peet's 90-day volume-weighted average stock price. That translates to a total price of 15.7 billion euros, or around $18.4 billion.

JAB had acquired Peet's in 2012 for about $1 billion. In 2015, JAB acquired San Francisco-based Mighty Tea and folded it into the Peet's brand.

The acquisition of Peet's will unlock incremental operating and financial benefits, KDP said. That includes some $400 million in cost synergies over three years and earnings accretion expected to start in the first year of the combination.

After the acquisition closes, KDP plans to separate into two U.S.-listed publicly traded companies. One will make soft drinks. The other aims for the title of the world's No. 1 pure-play coffee company, and will include the Keurig and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters brands.

KDP will spin off the coffee company, which has about $16 billion in combined annual net sales. It will reach more than 100 countries, including 40 in which it is already the No. 1 or No. 2 company by sales.

The remaining company, with more than $11 billion in annual sales, will be a major player in the $300 billion North American soft drink market. Its brands include Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, 7Up and energy labels.

Keurig Combines With Peet's Coffee

KDP owns Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and the line of Keurig coffee machines. In 2018, the company then known as Keurig Green Mountain agreed to buy Dr Pepper Snapple Group, combining into its present-day business.

European investment firm JAB Holding holds nearly 70% of the voting power at JDE Peet's. It also owns about 4% of Keurig Dr Pepper. The firm led the original Keurig-Dr Pepper merger, the Wall Street Journal — which first reported on the KDP-JDE talks — reported Monday.

Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala called the acquisition ""a good deal,"" TheFly.com reported. A globally diversified operation makes sense with the coffee category innovating into new formats and channels. Plus, a stand-alone beverage business is likely to trade at a higher multiple. The firm has a buy rating and 41 price target on Keurig Dr Pepper.

By transaction size, the KDP-JDE Peet's deal would be the sixth-largest corporate buyout so far this year involving a U.S. company, according to data from S&P Global.

Keurig Dr Pepper stock fell more than 7% Monday morning. Shares are on pace for the largest decrease since March 16, 2020, when they fell 16.5%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock has erased nearly all gains for the year. Shares were nearing a 36.12 buy point but sank to the bottom of a shallow base Monday, finding support around 32.

Keurig Dr Pepper has a Composite Rating of 65. The parent of Peet's Coffee does not trade in U.S. markets.

“I am acutely aware that reforming the international business is an urgent issue.
A deeper look Rumours about a potential sale of Dentsu’s international business have been swirling across M&A circles for a while.
In many ways, the fate of Dentsu International is a test case for whether the traditional global agency models will makes sense,” Marsden said.
“The potential sale could attract interest from rival advertising companies, private equity firms, and other investment groups.","Japanese advertising giant Dentsu is reportedly exploring the sale of its international business, according to Financial Times sources. The move comes as the group evaluates strategic options, with potential buyers, including industry players and private equity firms, are already being approached.

While no final decision has been made, insiders say Dentsu aims to have a clear roadmap by year-end. Options under consideration range from selling a minority stake to a complete divestiture of its overseas operations. To manage the process, Dentsu has appointed Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley and Nomura Securities to identify potential buyers in what is expected to be a multi-billion-dollar deal.

Meanwhile, a Dentsu source told Jiji Press that no decisions had been made, adding that the group was still reviewing various options to boost its corporate value.

A potential sale could significantly impact Tokyo-listed Dentsu, founded 124 years ago, and its long-standing ambition to compete on the global stage with industry heavyweights such as WPP and Publicis.

Just two weeks earlier, Dentsu Group released its second-quarter financial results for FY2025, reporting a net loss of 79.9 billion yen (US$541.9 million). The group also announced plans to cut around 3,400 jobs (about 8% of its overseas workforce) as part of a restructuring plan aimed at struggling international markets. The cuts are expected to primarily affect headquarters and back-office operations outside Japan.

“As part of the reevaluation of underperforming businesses, we have completed the identification of underperforming markets and entities and have begun taking the appropriate countermeasures,” said global CEO Hiroshi Igarashi in the results announcement.

“I am acutely aware that reforming the international business is an urgent issue. We have recorded an impairment loss on goodwill in the second quarter. I deeply regret this situation and offer my sincere apologies on behalf of the company,"" he added.

A deeper look

Rumours about a potential sale of Dentsu’s international business have been swirling across M&A circles for a while.

M&A specialist Hattie Marsden, founder of TruWater Advisory added that in the past three years, Dentsu International has gone from being one of the most active acquirers in APAC of marketing services businesses, to having done no material publicly recorded acquisitions, signaling a shift in confidence of Dentsu HQ in the international business.

Pulling out the numbers, she shared that post COVID, in 2021 Japan surged back (+18% organic growth, record revenue, ~23% margin), pulling ahead again in profitability. And while international markets recovered slightly, the margins stayed much lower. A year later in 2022 while international drove top-line revenue (~60% of the group), it remained structurally less profitable (high-teens margin). Japan, though smaller in revenue (~40%), delivered far higher margins (mid-20s).

In the past two years alone from 2023 to 2025, Japan delivered nine straight quarters of growth and record profits, while international slipped back into negative growth across all major regions. Marsden explained these numbers bring the potential sale of Dentsu International into context that for years the overseas arm has delivered scale but struggled with margins, impairments and growth. Japan, in the meantime, has consistently outperformed on profitability. Marsden said:

Whether it’s good or bad ultimately depends on one’s perspective but selling would mean stepping back from Dentsu’s global dreams. On the plus side, it would enable it to focus back onto its core.

What this means for the wider business

If Dentsu International ends up being broken and sold in parts, Marsden said it could flood the market with agency assets, putting pressure on valuations in the short term. However, it could also spark a wave of strategic and private equity acquisitions, especially in CXM and digital.

“It could be the biggest shake-up in agency M&A since the rise of Accenture Song. Either way, if Dentsu really moves ahead, the ripple effects will be felt across holding groups, consultancies and private equity alike. In many ways, the fate of Dentsu International is a test case for whether the traditional global agency models will makes sense,” Marsden said.

It is also well known that the advertising industry is undergoing rapid transformation and faces significant challenges, prompting agencies to reshape their businesses for profitability and to capitalise on AI-driven opportunities.

“Consolidation and realignment trends continue, exemplified by Stagwell’s acquisition of ADK Global,” said Leela Nair, CEO of Ebiquity. In this context, Dentsu’s exploratory pivot—focusing on innovation and investment in Japan while exploring new ownership for its international assets—reflects a potential strategic, forward-looking response to limited net wins in Q1-Q3 2025, she said.

“The potential sale could attract interest from rival advertising companies, private equity firms, and other investment groups. Even if Dentsu sells, it will keep the Dentsu branded agency assets in Asia, to service important Japan based clients such as Toyota, Shiseido and the likes,” explained Nair.

Goh Shufen, founder of R3 shared that despite its struggles overseas, Dentsu played an important role in representing the Asian perspective, the Asian way of doing business, building brands and building relationships.

""Clients benefit from having global diverse options, it’d be better for all I if the buyer is from Asia,"" she said. When asked what the retreat indicates, Goh shared that Japanese brands have often relied on Dentsu to build their brands consistently overseas. ""Now they’d have to ramp up their own brand and agency management, something not as developed as other markets,"" she shared.",https://marketing-interactive-assets.b-cdn.net/article_images/industry-reactions-what-dentsu-s-reported-international-business-sale-signals/1756456267_dentsu%20.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 06:14:53.227338

By spotlighting seven high-potential sectors, the CIIE underscores how global and domestic players are leveraging policy support, technological advancements, and market demand to reshape industries. From AI-powered healthcare to sustainable smart mobility, the event reveals a strategic shift toward openness, sustainability, and digital empowerment.

Medical Technology and Healthcare: A Booming Sector with Global Partnerships

The medical equipment and healthcare sector is a standout at the 8th CIIE, driven by China’s aging population and rising demand for advanced diagnostics. The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has streamlined regulatory approvals, enabling “CIIE Babies” like Edwards Lifesciences’ INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve to enter the Chinese market within two months of their debut [1]. Similarly, Novo Nordisk’s weekly insulin formulation achieved “Zero-lag Simultaneous Approval,” demonstrating the CIIE’s role in accelerating global medical innovations [1].

The wearable medical device market, projected to grow at a 25.53% CAGR from 2025 to 2030, is fueled by AI-powered diagnostics and IoMT devices like blood pressure monitors and ECG machines [4]. These technologies are not only improving healthcare accessibility but also reducing hospitalization costs through remote monitoring. Policy support, including equal treatment for foreign firms in funding and taxation, further enhances the sector’s appeal [4].

Smart Mobility and Electric Vehicles: Powering a Green Revolution

The Automobile and Smart Mobility pavilion at the CIIE highlights China’s leadership in new energy vehicles (NEVs). In 2025, NEVs overtook ICE vehicles in sales, with BYD capturing 29.4% of the market and Geely Group seeing 124% year-over-year growth [4]. Michelin’s electric tire technology, introduced at the 2020 CIIE, now powers 30% of high-end electric vehicles in China, illustrating the expo’s role in commercializing cutting-edge mobility solutions [1].

Government policies, such as the 2025 Action Plan for Stabilizing Foreign Investment, are easing restrictions on foreign participation in smart mobility manufacturing [1]. Meanwhile, the World Intelligent Vehicle Conference (WIV) 2025 emphasized global collaboration in vehicle-road-cloud integration, positioning China as a hub for smart transportation innovation [3].

Intelligent Industry and Digital Transformation: AI and Green Tech Converge

The Intelligent Industry & Information Technology pavilion, themed “Innovation and a Sustainable Future,” showcases advancements in AI, integrated circuits, and low-carbon energy. Yuanli Technology’s decade-long investment of RMB 100 billion in AI-education integration exemplifies how digital tools are reshaping learning [1]. In manufacturing, AI-driven automation and smart factories are boosting efficiency, supported by the revised Foreign Investment Encouraged Catalogue, which prioritizes energy-saving and clean energy technologies [3].

The surgical robotics market, valued at over $8 billion in 2025, is another growth area, with 3D printing and AI enabling personalized medical solutions [4]. These innovations align with China’s broader goals of industrial modernization and carbon neutrality by 2060.

Trade in Services and Consumer Goods: Expanding Market Access

The Trade in Services section at the CIIE is gaining traction, with companies like Sony doubling their exhibition space to showcase integrated gaming and hardware solutions [1]. Cross-border e-commerce platforms and zero-tariff treatment for least-developed countries are enhancing inclusivity, as seen in Goodfarmer Fresh Fruit Trading Corp’s 150% growth after introducing New Zealand avocados at the 4th CIIE [3].

Consumer goods, including fashion and cosmetics, are also thriving. The Canada Consumer Products Pavilion at the 8th CIIE focuses on healthy-lifestyle products, reflecting shifting consumer preferences [2]. Policy measures like 155 new initiatives to expand healthcare and tourism services further open this sector [1].

A Platform for Global Collaboration and Long-Term Growth

The CIIE’s “spillover effect” is evident in long-term partnerships. Bayer’s seven-year participation has yielded 40 major agreements, while Nippon Paint secured 16 partnerships after its 2024 debut [1]. These success stories highlight the CIIE’s role in building networks and understanding China’s evolving regulatory landscape.

Conclusion

The 8th CIIE is a testament to China’s commitment to innovation-driven growth. By fostering collaboration between global innovators and domestic stakeholders, the event is accelerating the commercialization of technologies in healthcare, mobility, and digital industries. As policy support and market demand converge, the CIIE continues to serve as a gateway for foreign investment, ensuring that China remains a pivotal player in the global economy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 15:17:24.956018

Are you affected by this Walmart shrimp recall?","Walmart shrimp recall overview:

Who: Southwind Foods and Beaver Street Fisheries are recalling frozen shrimp products processed by PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, affecting multiple brands.

Why: The recall is due to potential contamination with Cesium-137 (Cs-137), a radioactive substance.

Where: The recall is active in multiple states across the United States, including Alabama, Arizona, Florida, and others.

The FDA has issued an urgent recall notice for frozen shrimp products processed by PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, an Indonesian firm, due to potential contamination with Cesium-137 (Cs-137).

Therecall affects several brands, including Great Value products sold at Walmart. The recall was initiated after the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detected Cs-137 in shipping containers at major U.S. ports.

The recall was announced on Aug. 21 by Southwind Foods LLC and on Aug. 22 by Beaver Street Fisheries LLC.

The affected products include various raw and cooked frozen shrimp sold between July 17 and August 8, 2025, in Walmart stores in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia.

According to the recall, the shrimp may have been prepared under insanitary conditions, posing a potential safety risk due to Cs-137 contamination.

“At this level, the product would not pose an acute hazard to consumers,” the FDA says.

Shrimp may pose long-term cancer risks, FDA warns

The FDA’s investigation into the potential contamination of shrimp products with Cs-137 is ongoing.

The radioactive substance was detected in a shipment of breaded shrimp, with levels measured at 68 Bq/kg, which is below the FDA’s intervention level of 1200 Bq/kg.

However, the FDA has expressed concerns about the long-term health effects of repeated low-dose exposure to Cs-137, which could increase cancer risk due to DNA damage.

“The agency continues to coordinate with CBP to prevent any contaminated products from reaching consumers,” the FDA said.

The FDA has recommended that consumers who have purchased the affected Walmart shrimp recall products should dispose of them immediately and not consume them. Retailers and distributors are also advised to remove these products from their shelves.

The agency is working with Indonesian authorities to address the root cause of the contamination and has placed PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati on an import alert to prevent further shipments until the issue is resolved.

For more information about the Walmart recall, consumers can visit the FDA’s website or contact Walmart directly through their customer service channels.

No illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled shrimp products so far. Walmart is not currently facing any legal action over the recall, but Top Class Actions monitors such recalls closely as they sometimes lead to class action lawsuits.

In other food recall news, DFA Dairy Brandsrecalled a limited quantity of Friendly’s Cookies & Cream Ice Cream on Aug. 5 due to undeclared soy and wheat allergens from a mislabeling error that could lead to severe allergic reactions.

Italian steel group Marcegaglia has begun the engineering phase of its new flat steel production project in Fos-sur-Mer, in southern France. The Mistral project involves the construction of a mini-mill, which will start production in 2028, according to Kallanish.

The equipment will be supplied by Italian company Danieli, which will provide comprehensive production facilities: scrap preparation, electric steel production, slab casting, and hot-rolled coil rolling. The new plant will be able to produce up to 2.1 million tons per year of stainless and carbon hot-rolled coils, covering about 30% of Marcegaglia’s needs for this product for its cold rolling complex in Ravenna.

The project involves the use of advanced technologies: a Danieli Fastarc Zerobucket furnace with continuous scrap loading and a preheating system, as well as adaptive Q-Melt control. This will ensure high energy efficiency and reduced CO2 and NOx emissions. The molten steel will be processed on two off-furnace treatment units and vacuum degassers.

The production equipment will combine a Stakel mill and a five-stand hot rolling mill in a single configuration. This approach will allow both stainless slabs from the Marcegaglia plant in Sheffield and carbon slabs from the new continuous casting machine to be rolled.

Particular attention has been paid to the environment: water and gas purification systems are planned, as well as the use of low-carbon nuclear energy. In June, Marcegaglia signed a ten-year memorandum with EDF to cover half of the future plant’s energy consumption.

The total investment amounts to approximately €800 million. After acquiring the former Ascometal Fos-sur-Mer site in 2024, the company renamed it Marcegaglia Fos-sur-Mer. Jacques-Yves Floc, former manager of ArcelorMittal Dunkirk, became the new director of the enterprise.

Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2026, following the completion of engineering work.",https://gmk.center/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mgg.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 05:07:41.968477

The American beverage firm Keurig Dr Pepper plans to buy JDE Peet’s, the European parent company of California’s gourmet coffee trailblazer, Peet’s Coffee, in an all-cash transaction worth about $18 billion.

Keurig Dr Pepper will be split into two independent companies, one of which will focus on coffee, according to a Monday release.

The new coffee company will be called Global Coffee Co. and will be publicly traded in the U.S., as will the beverage company, which will be called Beverage Co. Global Coffee Co. will have approximately $16 billion in combined annual sales and Beverage Co. will have more than $11 billion in annual net sales, the release said.

“Today’s announcement marks a transformational moment in the beverage industry,” said Keurig Dr Pepper Chief Executive Tim Cofer in a statement. “Through the complementary combination of Keurig and JDE Peet’s, we are seizing an exceptional opportunity to create a global coffee giant.”

Under the terms of the deal, Keurig Dr Pepper will pay JDE Peet’s shareholders 31.85 euros per share in cash, equivalent to about $37 per share. The value is a 33% premium to JDE Peet’s 90-day volume-weighted average stock price.

After the deal was announced, JDE Peet’s shares climbed more than 15%. Keurig Dr Pepper shares fell more than 10%.

According to JDE Peet’s half-year report released in July, sales for the company grew more than 19% over the past year.

Along with Peet’s Coffee, JDE Peet’s owns popular brands including Stumptown Coffee Roasters and German coffee name Jacobs. Peet’s Coffee has made a name for itself as a San Francisco-based destination that helped bring dark, gourmet coffee to American consumers.

After working at his father’s small coffee company in the Netherlands, Alfred Peet moved to the U.S. and in 1966 opened the first Peet’s Coffee shop in the Bay Area, near UC Berkeley.

“I came to the richest country in the world, so why are they drinking the lousiest coffee?” Peet used to say, according to the Peet’s Coffee website.

By 1971, Peet was training three young entrepreneurs and provided them with the roasted beans to open their new venture, Starbucks. There are now more than 220 Peet’s Coffee shops in California and more than 40 in other states.

After the acquisition closes, Global Coffee Co. will have the world’s most expansive coffee portfolio, the release said, including $1-billion-plus revenue brands Keurig, Jacobs, L’OR and Peet’s. The acquisition and split into two companies will unwind the merger between Keurig and Dr Pepper that closed in 2018.

“We are excited to join forces with Keurig to chart the future of global coffee by leveraging our combined portfolio of the world’s most beloved coffee brands,” said JDE Peet’s Chief Executive Rafa Oliveira in a statement.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba36706/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5339x2803+0+377/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2F81%2Fccf3973b48c887398af6846a606a%2Fgettyimages-2184631817.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 09:03:35.681302

Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP, Financials) is paying $18 billion to buy JDE Peet's, the Dutch coffee group behind brands like Douwe Egberts and L'Or and it's not just a takeover, it's a reinvention.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with KDP.

Is KDP fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

The plan? Split the merged giant into two U.S.-listed companies: one focused entirely on coffee (Global Coffee Co), the other sticking to soda and beverages (Beverage Co). Nestle the world's coffee king now has a new rival.

The numbers are big. Combined, the coffee business will have $16 billion in sales, almost neck and neck with Nestle's. The drinks unit will pull in around $11 billion. The split reverses Keurig's 2018 merger with Dr Pepper Snapple and signals a bet that coffee deserves its own stage.

There's a reason this is happening now: coffee prices are at record highs, Trump just slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian beans, and the supply chain is a mess. Keurig needs global scale, and JDE gives it that especially in Europe and emerging markets.

JDE stock popped 17%. KDP fell 7%. Wall Street sees upside but hates the complexity.

One twist: JAB Holding, JDE's controlling shareholder (and owner of Krispy Kreme and Pret), will exit majority control but keep small stakes in both companies.

The deal closes in 2026. The breakup follows soon after.

Burger King’s response

The brand clarified that:

No terms like “spicy”, “hot” or “chili” were used in its advertising.

“Taste on Fire” referred to flavour and flame-grilling, not heat.

The packaging was multipurpose, used across chicken burger variants.

ARB decision

The ARB considered Clause 4.2.1 of Section II of the Code of Advertising Practice (misleading claims).

It found that:

The product was clearly sold as the “Original Chicken Burger”.

No language or visuals suggested spice or heat.

Burger King’s menu explicitly labels its chilli-containing products.

The regulator ruled that the campaign was not misleading and dismissed the complaint. While Burger King is not an ARB member, the case shows how figurative marketing language can still invite scrutiny.",https://biz-file.com/c/2508/785519-1176x612.jpg?3,N,,2025-08-29 07:03:57.076645

Keurig Dr Pepper said Monday it is buying the owner of Peet's Coffee in an $18 billion (15.7 billion euro) . Then it will break itself in two, with one company selling coffee and the other selling cold beverages like Snapple, Dr Pepper, 7UP and energy drinks.

The agreement unwinds the 2018 merger of Keurig and Dr. Pepper. Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper fell 7% in early trading Monday.

Keurig Dr Pepper CEO Timothy Cofer said the separate coffee and beverage businesses would be more nimble and better able to focus on growth opportunities in their own markets.

""Following the separation, each stand-alone entity will lead its industry with a sharp strategic focus and with operating models that are finely calibrated to their unique categories and markets,"" Cofer said Monday during a conference call with investors.

The combination with Peet's parent JDE Peet's, which is based in Amsterdam, significantly expands Keurig's presence beyond North America, where it's known for its single-serve coffee machines. JDE Peet's owns the brands L'OR, Jacobs, Douwe Egberts, Kenco, Pilao, OldTown, Super and Moccona.

Cofer said the combined coffee business will generate $16 billion in annual net sales. The combined buying power will help the companies compete with other large coffee players like Nestle and Starbucks and take advantage of growing global coffee sales.

""We like, and I like, the coffee category. Why? It's huge. It's ubiquitous,"" Cofer said. ""Obviously, we've up to this point focused on North America. But the global data shows coffee is consistently growing on a volume basis above population.""

The merger could also help the company cushion the impact of U.S. tariffs. President Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff this summer on most imports from Brazil — the world's leading coffee producer — for an investigation of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally.

Meanwhile, sales of Dr Pepper's traditional soft drinks have been slowing as health-conscious consumers look for new alternatives. The newly formed beverage company, with $11 billion in annual sales in the U.S. and Mexico, can continue to pivot to its faster-growing beverages, like the energy drinks Ghost and Bloom.

The companies said they expect to save around $400 million over three years because of the merger, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

Once the two companies are separated, Cofer will become CEO of the cold beverage business, which will be based in Frisco, Texas. Keurig Dr Pepper's chief financial officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi, will lead the coffee business, which will be located in Burlington, Mass. Its international headquarters will be in Amsterdam.

The deal is the latest big maneuver in the food and beverage industry, which has been trying to keep up with changing consumer tastes.

By merchandise category, domestic comparable sales during the quarter increased in the entertainment segment, up 37.5% and in phones, up 3.8% year over year, Best Buy indicated, but declined in appliances, down 8.5%, consumer electronics, down 4.9%, and services, down 1%. Operating income was $251 million versus $383 million in the year-earlier quarter, while adjusted operating income was $369 million versus $381 million.

Best Buy reiterated its full year guidance for revenue of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion, comps of down 1% to up 1.% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.15 to $6.30.

During a conference call, Corie Barry, Best Buy’s CEO, stated that the company’s tariff mitigation strategies, including collaboration with vendors, had kept proportional price growth below the rate of duty increases.

She also said that Best Buy planned significant launches of small appliances for the holidays, including those with Breville and SharkNinja.

“These will feature expanded assortments to inspire at-home, baristas and chefs, and innovative health and beauty solutions,” she said.

Matt Bilunas, Best Buy CFO, added, “The sales growth resulted in a better-than-expected Q2 adjusted operating income rate. Our SG&A expense was as expected, and we saw some gross profit rate mix pressure from the strong growth in gaming and computing. For Q3, we expect comparable sales growth to be similar to what we just delivered in Q2 and the adjusted operating income rate to be similar to last year’s Q3 3.7% rate. We feel good about our Q2 results and are increasingly confident about our plans for the back half of the year.

I mean it’s always been Cracker Barrel like it is, so I’d like for it to stay like it is,” customer Sid Leist said during a visit Tuesday to a Cracker Barrel in Vicksburg, Mississippi.
Here’s how Lebanon, Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel got to this point and where it might go from here: Changes made Cracker Barrel hired Masino, a longtime Taco Bell and Starbucks executive, in July 2023.
Nostalgia factor Cracker Barrel acknowledged Monday that it should have done a better job with the new logo’s rollout.
Now, Murphy said, Cracker Barrel should reinforce the message that it’s not moving away from its values or heritage.","Like its namesake barrels that transported soda crackers until boxes replaced them, Cracker Barrel needed to change.

The restaurant chain’s new CEO, Julie Felss Masino, laid out the argument to investors last year: Cracker Barrel’s customer traffic was down 16% compared to 2019. Research showed consumers thought the brand fell short of competitors in essential ways, from the quality of the food to value and convenience.

“We are not leading in any area,” Masino said. “We will change that.”

But over the past week, Cracker Barrel’s attempted revamp hit a wall. The company saw severe backlash over its plans to modernize and simplify its nostalgic logo — including from President Donald Trump.

“I don’t like the changes. I mean it’s always been Cracker Barrel like it is, so I’d like for it to stay like it is,” customer Sid Leist said during a visit Tuesday to a Cracker Barrel in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

By that evening, Cracker Barrel had reversed course and said its old logo would remain. It features an overall-clad man — said to represent Uncle Herschel, a relative of Cracker Barrel’s founder — leaning on a barrel, with the words “Old Country Store” underneath.

Investors cheered the move. Cracker Barrel’s stock price rose 8% Wednesday to close at $62.33 per share. That was even higher than its closing price on Aug. 15, before it announced the new logo.

Here’s how Lebanon, Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel got to this point and where it might go from here:

Changes made

Cracker Barrel hired Masino, a longtime Taco Bell and Starbucks executive, in July 2023. She was chosen for her record as an innovator, with the hope that she would attract new customers to Cracker Barrel, which operates 660 restaurants in 43 states.

Masino introduced updated menu items, like Hashbrown Casserole Shepherd’s Pie, to increase Cracker Barrel’s dinnertime traffic. She also started remodeling the company’s dark, antique-filled restaurants, lightening the walls and installing more comfortable seating.

The changes appeared to be helping. Cracker Barrel’s fiscal third quarter, which ended May 2, was the fourth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth for the company.

Brand misstep

Richard Wilke, a former executive at the brand consultancy Lippincott who helped lead rebrands for companies like Delta Air Lines and Walmart, said Cracker Barrel’s existing logo is too detailed and fussy for the digital age, when companies have to think about how their brand appears in a smartphone app.

But Wilke said Cracker Barrel’s new logo, featuring just the company’s name in brown letters on a gold background, lacked character.

The logo’s rollout also seemed like an afterthought. In a press release about new fall menu items released Aug. 18, the company mentioned the new logo in the fourth paragraph.

Nostalgia factor

Cracker Barrel acknowledged Monday that it should have done a better job with the new logo’s rollout.

The company said it should have emphasized all the things that would remain the same about Cracker Barrel restaurants: the rocking chairs on the front porches, fireplaces in the dining rooms and vintage Americana and antiques scattered throughout.

The company said it would also continue to honor Uncle Herschel on its menu and on items sold in the country-style stores attached to its restaurants. But it was too late, and Cracker Barrel pulled its new logo the next day.

Next steps

Thomas Murphy, a professor of practice at Clark University School of Business, said returning to the original logo was a “positive course correction” given the intensity of fans’ response. Now, Murphy said, Cracker Barrel should reinforce the message that it’s not moving away from its values or heritage.

Murphy said Cracker Barrel can continue to “refresh” its stores, making them brighter and more welcoming to younger customers. But it doesn’t really need to “rebrand,” he said.

Wilke agrees that Cracker Barrel should stick with the old logo but continue to revamp its restaurants in the short term. Eventually, the company will have to adopt a simpler logo, he said, but it should design one that retains more of the brand’s heritage.

Political fallout

One difference with past corporate transformations — including a 2014 rebrand by Southwest Airlines to attract more business customers or Dunkin’ Donuts 2019 renaming to Dunkin’ — is the more divisive political climate.

Cracker Barrel caught heat not only from Donald Trump Jr. but from the president himself. On Tuesday morning, Trump said via Truth Social that Cracker Barrel “should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before.”

Later, Trump celebrated Cracker Barrel’s decision to drop its new logo.

Wilke said he wishes both Republicans and Democrats would stay out of brand decisions like Cracker Barrel’s. Rebrands are almost always about trying to attract new customers without alienating old ones, he said.

“This isn’t a political story,” he said. “If politicians now turn every company logo design update into a debate about being ‘woke’ or ‘anti-woke,’ we are headed into a damaging new era for corporate branding.”",https://imengine.prod.ltn.infomaker.io/?uuid=20bf086c-3f2c-44fe-800f-33db437c82cc&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-08-29 04:05:19.155907

Amid a decline in alcohol consumption, beverage companies are serving up collaborations and focusing on licensing as they work to tap into changing consumer behavior.

In many ways, these collaborations are an expansion of tried-and-true strategies that have been deployed across the category for many years. But they are now taking on a greater importance for alcohol companies as they adjust to a market more attuned to social media currency than standard TV commercials.

The turn toward increasing alcohol collaborations also comes in the face of a Gallup poll that showed that only 54% of Americans drink alcohol, the lowest percentage since the survey began in 1939. And even among those surveyed that drink, they are partaking less, Gallup said. Additionally, the World Health Organization reported that alcohol consumption in Europe declined by 0.5 liters per capita between 2010 and 2020.

In releasing earnings earlier this year, Molson Coors and Corona distributor Constellation Brands reported volume declines of 7% and 3.3%, respectively. Anheuser-Busch and Sam Adams parent Boston Beer Co. reported beer volume declines of 1.9% and 0.8%, respectively.

In an effort to keep their brands relevant in a market where people are drinking less, many alcohol companies released non-alcohol drinks. Other alcohol companies have paired their brand with food and beverage labels in order to connect with new consumers.

Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR), for example, has partnered with Campbell’s for limited edition products that features its ingredients, including the Beer Cheese with Potatoes & Chorizo soup and Beef & Beer Chili that will be available exclusively at Walmart. And then there is Sazerac’s Kahlua brand, which launched a partnership with Dunkin’ in August for Kahlúa Dunkin’ Caramel Swirl Cream Liqueur. It’s 16% ABV and a mix of toffee, vanilla, and caramelized sweetened milk blended with coffee and chocolate. Sazerac licensee B&G Foods also fields Southern Comfort, Fireball, and Buffalo Trace under a co-brand with grill maker Weber.

“There has been a lot written about the state of the alcohol business, particularly among younger people, so licensing can be a way to get to a new consumer who may not consume the alcohol as much but it gives them an opportunity to interact with the brand and the lifestyle it might engender,” said Rachel Humiston, VP of Client Services at Brandgenuity, which represents Sazerac for licensing. “We are seeing bigger extensions that will live on and then there are unusual combinations that will come in and out that may be unexpected but gets people into the franchise.”

The Corona brand, for example, recently launched pre-orders for limited edition baseball and slow-pitch gloves ($420) with licensee Absolutely Ridiculous innovation for Athletes (ARiA).

Because while revenue from the increase in brand collaborations may not make up for sluggish sales, they can be a cost-effective means for broadening brands’ audiences. And, once consumers are introduced to a franchise, companies can focus on retaining them and building brand loyalty.

“In a market where there is noise all the time and staying relevant in the pop culture conversation is important, collaborations are a far less expensive way of doing it than a huge marketing campaign,” said Debra Joester, President of The Joester Loria Group, which represents Constellation Brands (Modelo, Corona, Pacifico, Robert Mondavi, and other labels). “Sports, music sponsorships, and other events are part of a menu for staying pop culture and conversation relevant and making sure a brand doesn’t slip away.”",https://licensinginternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Campbells.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 06:14:43.060820

Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) reported robust financial performance for the second quarter of 2025, with revenue increasing by 10.1% year-over-year (YoY) to $1.74 billion, surpassing analyst estimates by 4.3%. The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.37 met consensus estimates, indicating a stable performance. Agilent also provided a strong revenue guidance for the third quarter, forecasting sales of $1.83 billion at the midpoint, which was above Wall Street projections. The stock price initially jumped 3.7% in the morning session before cooling down to a 4.3% increase from the previous close.

Revenue Growth and Guidance

Agilent's revenue growth of 10.1% YoY was driven by organic revenue, which increased by 6.1% YoY, significantly outperforming analyst estimates of 3.3% growth. The company's revenue guidance for the third quarter was $1.83 billion at the midpoint, which was 3.4% above analyst expectations of $1.77 billion. This positive guidance suggests that Agilent is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory in the coming quarters [1].

Operating Margin and EPS

Agilent's operating margin for the second quarter was 20.7%, in line with the same quarter last year, indicating a stable cost structure. The company's EPS grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 11.3% over the last five years, highlighting its improving profitability on a per-share basis. In the second quarter, Agilent reported adjusted EPS of $1.37, which was close to analysts' estimates. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects Agilent's full-year EPS to grow by 9.4% over the next 12 months [1].

Long-term Performance

Over the past five years, Agilent's total shareholder return, including share price appreciation and dividends, was 18.71%. This longer-term performance provides a sturdy backdrop for assessing the impact of recent news. In the past year, Agilent's share price climbed by 18%, closely aligning with broader market bullish trends, albeit underperforming the US market which had a 16.2% increase [2].

Conclusion

Agilent Technologies' strong Q2 2025 results, coupled with a robust revenue guidance for the third quarter, indicate a positive outlook for the company. The stock's price increase following the earnings report reflects investor confidence in Agilent's growth prospects. However, investors should consider the company's long-term growth trajectory and valuation before making investment decisions.

The company operates in four business segments: steel manufacturing, engineering, chemical & material, and system solutions. Its steel manufacturing segment manufactures and sells steel products, while its engineering segment offers industrial machinery, steel structures, and contracting services. Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel is expected to boost its production capacity and help it reach its 100 million ton target.

Nippon Steel Corp., a leading Japanese steel manufacturer, is making significant strides towards its long-term goal of achieving 100 million tons of annual crude steel production capacity. The company, following the acquisition of United States Steel Corp., is poised to leverage the combined strengths of both entities to reach this ambitious target.

In a recent interview, Vice Chairman Takahiro Mori expressed confidence in Nippon Steel's ability to reach the 100 million ton mark, stating, ""It’s only a matter of time"" [1]. The acquisition of US Steel, completed in June, has already shown positive signs of integration, with the joint venture ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Ltd. planning to scale up its capacity in India [1]. This expansion in India, along with other potential markets such as Southeast Asia, is expected to contribute significantly to Nippon Steel's overall production capacity.

Nippon Steel aims to boost US Steel's profit to around 250 billion yen by the 2028 fiscal year, with a ""100-day plan"" already in place for the American company [1]. The company anticipates that profit contributions from US Steel will bring it closer to its goal of achieving a 1 trillion yen business profit. Mori highlighted the potential for quick improvements at US Steel through cost-cutting measures and enhanced product consistency and quality [1]. Nippon Steel has dispatched around 40 staff to the US and plans to increase this number to 50 or more to facilitate these improvements.

Looking beyond the US, Nippon Steel has identified India and Southeast Asia as priority markets for further expansion and acquisition opportunities [1]. The company is also urging the Japanese government to expand its anti-dumping investigation into other steel products to protect the domestic sector. This proactive stance aims to safeguard Nippon Steel's position in the competitive global steel market.

Nippon Steel Corp. operates in four primary business segments: steel manufacturing, engineering, chemical and materials, and system solutions. The steel manufacturing segment focuses on the production and sale of steel products, while the engineering segment offers industrial machinery, steel structures, and contracting services [2]. The company's diversified portfolio positions it well to navigate the complexities of the global steel industry.

In conclusion, Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel marks a significant step forward in its quest to achieve 100 million tons of annual crude steel production capacity. The company's strategic plans and proactive approach to market expansion and cost optimization indicate a strong commitment to reaching this ambitious goal.

Title: HP Inc. Q3 Earnings: Mixed Performance Across Personal Systems and Printing Segments

HP Inc. reported Q3 earnings of 75 cents per share, in line with estimates, and revenues of $13.93 billion, up 3% year-over-year (YoY). The Personal Systems division saw a 6% YoY revenue increase, driven by commercial and consumer strength, higher average selling prices (ASPs), and momentum in key growth areas. The Printing business declined 4% YoY due to weakness in Supplies and Commercial Printing. HP expects non-GAAP EPS between 87 cents and 97 cents for Q4 and $3.75 to $3.85 for FY25 [1].

The Personal Systems division, which accounts for 25% of HP's revenue mix, delivered a 6% YoY increase, driven by a 5% rise in unit sales and a 5%–10% price premium for AI PCs. The segment's 5.4% operating margin reflects successful cost mitigation and strategic pricing adjustments [1]. The Windows 11 refresh cycle and strong back-to-school demand in North America and China further fueled growth. Key drivers include AI PC adoption, margin recovery, and geographic diversification, particularly in China and North America [1].

In contrast, the Printing segment reported a 4% YoY revenue decline, with hardware units down 9% year-over-year. Consumer and Commercial Printing revenue fell 8% and 3%, respectively, as enterprises redirected IT budgets toward AI and PC investments. Pricing pressures exacerbated the decline, with competitive dynamics limiting margin expansion. However, the segment's 17.3% operating margin highlights resilience, driven by high-margin subscription services and industrial graphics [1]. Stable page volume suggests underlying demand for printing solutions may persist, even as hardware sales wane.

HP's strategic initiatives aim to offset Printing weaknesses. Supply chain optimization, AI-driven innovation, and disciplined capital allocation are key. Nearly all North American products are now manufactured outside China, reducing exposure to tariffs and trade disruptions. AI partnerships with Adobe and Zoom create a sticky ecosystem, enhancing customer retention. Capital allocation discipline includes $1.5 billion in free cash flow and $400 million returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks [1].

For investors, HP's Q3 results highlight a pivotal inflection point. The Personal Systems segment's growth trajectory, anchored by AI PCs and Windows 11, positions HP to benefit from the broader tech upcycle. However, the Printing segment's decline, though manageable for now, raises questions about long-term sustainability in a market increasingly dominated by digital workflows. The mid-single-digit growth forecast for the PC market in H2 2025 offers a clear runway for HP's Personal Systems division. HP's forward P/E ratio of 12.3x (as of August 2025) appears undemanding relative to peers like Dell (14.1x) and Lenovo (10.8x), suggesting potential upside if PC momentum accelerates [1].

New York (CNN) — After days of intense backlash, most recently from President Donald Trump, Cracker Barrel is scrapping its new minimalist logo.

“We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain,” the company said in a statement.

“At Cracker Barrel, it’s always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family. As a proud American institution, our 70,000 hardworking employees look forward to welcoming you to our table soon.”

Last week, Cracker Barrel received a barrage of criticism when it unveiled its modernized logo, which got rid of the namesake barrel and the “old-timer” figure. Some loyal fans feared the 56-year-old chain was drifting too far from its bucolic roots, and the company’s shares (CBRL) nosedived more than 12% days after the announcement.

Trump congratulated the company on its reversal Tuesday.

“All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!,” he said on Truth Social.

A deputy White House chief of staff posted on X that he received a call from Cracker Barrel earlier on Tuesday, saying “they thanked President Trump for weighing in on the issue.”

On Monday, the struggling country-themed restaurant chain and roadtrip staple signaled that it had messed up with the minimalist logo, saying, “We could’ve done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.”

The company noted that its “old-timer” figure would return, a major point of contention online. Many people over the years believed the company’s ambassador Uncle Herschel was the figure seen leaning against the barrel in the logo. (The company refers to the figure as “our old-timer” in the logo created by Nashville designer Bill Holley on a napkin in 1977.)

Hours before Cracker Barrel walked back the minimalist logo, Trump posted on Truth Social that Cracker Barrel should return to its previous logo.

“Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll) and manage the company better than ever before,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Tuesday.

After Cracker Barrel announced its initial logo change last week, a social media firestorm began and the debacle quickly became another culture war topic stoked by right-wing influencers.

“WTF is wrong with @CrackerBarrel??!” Donald Trump Jr. posted on X. Right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk posted a side-by-side comparison of Sydney Sweeney’s controversial American Eagle ad and the original Cracker Barrel logo, with the new minimalist one and a woman who weighs more than Sweeney.

The drama was a setback for the chain’s $700 million transformation plan. The 56-year-old chain has new TV commercials, a redesigned menu and several new fall-themed foods.

“The way we communicate, the things on the menu, the way the stores look and feel … all of these things came up time and time again in our research as opportunities for us to really regain relevancy,” said Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino in 2024.

Shares of Cracker Barrel rose more than 3% in after-hours trading Tuesday upon the announcement.

“They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right,” Trump continued on Tuesday. “Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity. Have a major News Conference today. Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again.”",https://krdo.b-cdn.net/2025/08/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWV0NWE5aWkwMDAxMzU2bmYwcnpzdWs3-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZXQ1M3RjcTAwNWwyNnAzNGZlajdtaXo.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 04:05:24.005116

2025 RTIH INNOVATION AWARDS

E-commerce will be a key focus area at the 2025 RTIH Innovation Awards.

The awards. which are now open for entries, celebrate global tech innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world.

Our 2024 hall of fame entrants were revealed during an event which took place at RIBA’s 66 Portland Place HQ in Central London on 21st November, and consisted of a drinks reception, three course meal, and awards ceremony presided over by comedian Lucy Porter.

In his welcome speech, Scott Thompson, Founder and Editor, RTIH, said: “The event is now into its sixth year and what a journey it has been. The awards started life as an online only affair during the Covid outbreak, before launching as a small scale in real life event and growing year on year to the point where we’re now selling out this fine, historic venue.”

He added: “Congratulations to all of our finalists. Many submissions did not make it through to the final stage, and getting to this point is no mean feat. Checkout-free stores, automated supply chains, immersive experiences, on-demand delivery, next generation loyalty offerings, inclusive retail, green technology. We’ve got all the cool stuff covered this evening.”

“But just importantly we’ve got lots of great examples of companies taking innovative tech and making it usable in everyday operations - resulting in more efficiency and profitability in all areas.”

Congratulations to our 2024 winners, and a big thank you to our sponsors, judging panel, the legend that is Lucy Porter, and all those who attended November's gathering.

The company in May said that it had expected about $250 million to $300 million in tariff-related costs, but aimed to mitigate more than half of that amount.

The hit comes from the reliance the company has on countries that are under the radar of the Trump administration for hefty tariffs. As of 2024, Gap sourced less than 10% of its merchandise from China, which faces a 30% import duty. It sources less than 1% from Mexico and Canada combined.

CEO Richard Dickson in May had said the company expects reliance on China to be less than 3% exiting 2025, and for no country to account for more than 25% by end of 2026.

The company now expects annual operating margin between 6.7% and 7%, including a tariff impact in the range of 100 to 110 basis points. It logged a margin of 7.4% in 2024.

Gap continues to expect annual net sales to rise between 1% and 2%.

Its Old Navy and Gap brands posted significant gains in year-over-year visit in April and May before seeing visits taper in June and July, as consumers appear to have accelerated purchases to avoid anticipated price increases, according to data firm Placer.ai.

Gap, like rivals including American Eagle AEO and Levi Strauss LEVI, has pushed its denim line with a new viral ""Better in Denim"" campaign featuring the global girl group KATSEYE. The campaign came weeks after American Eagle's ""Great Jeans"" denim campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney.

Gap's second-quarter net sales rose slightly to $3.73 billion, in line with analysts' average estimates, according to data compiled by LSEG.

3 £22bn is the total amount of lending Barclays has available to lend and support business growth among Business Banking and UK Corporate Banking clients in 2025.","Over 60 per cent of tech businesses view the UK as a more attractive growth hub than other key markets

Barclays anonymised client data shows capital is being accumulated to support growth plans, as tech leaders cite intentions for substantial AI investment

95% of tech firms report a strong demand for AI products from clients

However, some barriers to investment remain, including high costs in the fundraising process and extensive regulatory requirements, as tech companies call for government support to overcome these hurdles

New research from the Barclays Business Prosperity Index reveals the majority of UK-based tech companies consider their home market as a more favourable destination for growth than other core international hubs.

Research among 500 technology business leaders1 reveals that 62 per cent consider the UK a more attractive location to grow and scale a tech business than mainland Europe, with 61 per cent favouring the UK over the Asia-Pacific region and 60 per cent preferring it to the United States. The UK’s strong market opportunities and customer base, access to a skilled and diverse talent pool, and faster-growing consumer take-up of technology products were the three key differentiators cited compared to other markets.

Interest in the technology sector continues to surge, with half of tech businesses (50 per cent) planning at least a 20 per cent increase in AI investment over the next 12 months and 95 per cent reporting increasing demand from clients for AI products and services.

This is supported by wider confidence in the economic outlook. More than three quarters (76 per cent) of tech firms report that the UK macroeconomic climate is giving their business a boost and a similar share (75 per cent) believe the political landscape will help support growth over the next three years.

Tech firms are taking action but call for support to address remaining barriers

More broadly, tech firms are committed to ongoing investment in their business. Seven in 10 (70 per cent) expect to commit more capital this year compared to last and by an average increase of 8.9 per cent.

Barclays’ anonymised client data2 comparing Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 also indicates strong investment intentions:

Cash inflows into technology businesses rose by 1.7 per cent, while overall cash balances in current accounts declined by 9.6 per cent

However, the tech sector had the highest increase in savings account balances, up 21.5 per cent, suggesting tech businesses are holding onto cash ready to deploy to support their investment plans

Meanwhile overdraft usage fell by 26.2 per cent, despite borrowing remaining relatively flat over the same timeframe

These figures reflects stronger short-term liquidity and a shift away from flexible, high-cost borrowing towards more structured financing, while also signalling greater confidence in cash flow stability and long-term planning.

The sector also remains highly outward-facing, with 95 per cent of tech leaders surveyed stating they engaged in exports during the period.

Despite plans for growth, some barriers to sourcing funding and investment remain. The most pressing challenges were cited as: high costs associated with the fundraising process (40 per cent, excessive regulatory requirements and compliance costs (36 per cent) and limited government funding and grants (33 per cent), resulting in hurdles for companies looking to scale and innovate in the UK.

To ensure the UK retains its position as one of the global leaders in technology innovation, 72 per cent of companies in the sector believe that government backing is crucial to support their long-term business growth. Namely, 44 per cent of respondents are calling for specialised funding programmes for the technology sector and 37 per cent believe the government should provide more robust support for businesses looking to attract international investors.

An additional 36 per cent would like to see enhanced tax incentives for equity investments to help stimulate greater private investment and innovation, alongside a further 36 per cent calling for government grants for start-ups and small businesses.

Helena Sans, Head of Technology, Media & Telecoms & Innovation Banking at Barclays UK Corporate Bank, said: “There’s a clear sense that the UK is holding its own on the global tech stage, with founders and leaders increasingly seeing the UK as one of the best places in the world to grow and scale.

“To keep up this momentum, we’ve got to break down the remaining roadblocks – including access to funding, attracting global investors, and building a stronger appetite for risk.

“That’s why at Barclays we recently launched the Innovation Banking team along with a bespoke £250m Growth Lending Fund, designed to support fast-growing tech businesses with the capital they need to scale confidently.”

Sheetal Shinh, Head of Innovation Banking at Barclays Business Banking said: “Access to finance is a key issue for tech businesses looking to scale. At Barclays, we’re backing these ambitions through our £22bn Business Prosperity Fund and tailored support for early-stage innovators. Whether it’s helping founders navigate their first funding round or connecting them to specialist advice, our Innovation Banking teams are here to unlock growth at every stage of the journey.”

Staffed 24 hours a day, the center brings together teams across Walmart’s operations to ensure communities and associates have support in times of crisis.

The unveiling coincided with 20 years since Hurricane Katrina, a disaster that forever shaped the company’s approach to emergency response.

When Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, Walmart’s rapid relief efforts became a turning point in both disaster response and corporate history. Trucks loaded with food, water, and medical supplies were some of the first to arrive in devastated communities. Federal leaders even studied Walmart’s strategy as a model for how to move aid quickly and effectively.

For Walmart leaders, those lessons remain central two decades later.

“It was absolutely amazing to see what can happen when so many people are focused on what they need to do to help a community, and it really changed the corporation going forward,” said Lee Siler, Walmart’s Director of Readiness, who at the time was working alongside the American Red Cross inside Walmart’s Emergency Operations Center.

The new GSOC is designed to build on that legacy. Unlike the company’s previous emergency center, the new facility monitors threats around the world, from tornadoes in Arkansas and Oklahoma, to typhoons in Asia. Staffed 24 hours a day, the center brings together teams across Walmart’s operations to ensure communities and associates have support in times of crisis.

Part of that work now hinges on weather forecasting.

“My role is really interesting. The intention of it is to always keep us ahead. We never want to be caught off guard by a forecast,” said Tom Bedard, Senior Manager of Emergency Operations and one of Walmart’s in-house meteorologists. “The neat thing about my role is that I get to fulfill that capacity while also working with these 10 Emergency Support Function partner teams… It allows us to always remain aware of what’s going on in the hazard environment and in Northwest Arkansas, all of us have had to deal with tornadoes a lot over the past two years, and having this capacity has been really helpful for us locally.”

The company’s leaders stressed that while technology has advanced, including new mapping tools, real-time data, and even artificial intelligence, the true strength of the new center lies in the people working behind the scenes.

“Speed becomes a component of what we do. Not days, not weeks but hours,” said Jason Jackson, Vice President of Global Security Operations Center. “The reality is, what makes this truly special out here is the company and our culture, but the people actually behind this wall that are working every day, day in, day out, on fulfilling that mission and how they work together, that’s the most inspiring part for me.”",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/KFSM/images/7e5f8dc1-5adb-4151-80db-b42140727e8a/20250829T031720/7e5f8dc1-5adb-4151-80db-b42140727e8a_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 03:09:43.127472

Privately held Mammoth owns men’s razor company Harry’s and women’s body care brand Flamingo. Coterie sells high-end disposable nappies popular with celebrities that are said to perform better than household brands but can cost more than twice the price.

Coterie has been working with investment bank Raymond James on a sale process, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

The company, which is profitable, generates more than US$200 million of annual revenue and close to $50 million of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), sources said. It could fetch a roughly $650 million valuation based on where other paper products companies trade, they said.

The discussions are still ongoing and a deal isn’t guaranteed, they said.

Mammoth declined to comment. Coterie and Raymond James did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In recent years, disruptor baby care brands like Coterie, Hello Bello and The Honest Company have sought to challenge legacy players like Procter & Gamble-owned Pampers and Kimberly-Clark-owned Huggies. Actors Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard founded Hello Bello while The Honest Company counts actor Jessica Alba as a founder.

The Richfield, Minnesota, company cited the potential impact of tariffs on its business and customers.
CEO Corie Barry pointed out that it was the highest growth for same-store sales in three years.
A combination of innovative products, like laptops with artificial intelligence capabilities, and a growing need to replace electronics, has helped to spur sales, Barry said on a conference call Thursday.
But the overall cost increases have been much less than the overall rate of the tariffs, Barry said.","NEW YORK — (AP) — Best Buy posted a solid second quarter that exceeded Wall Street expectations, but that was overshadowed by an outlook that has grown cloudy due to massive tariffs the U.S. is imposing on imported goods.

Company shares slid more than 6% Thursday after the company stuck to 2025 guidance it had issued earlier this year despite the big quarterly beat. The Richfield, Minnesota, company cited the potential impact of tariffs on its business and customers.

In Best Buy's most recent quarter, comparable sales, used as a barometer of a retailer's health, increased 1.6% with Wall Street expecting a slight decline. CEO Corie Barry pointed out that it was the highest growth for same-store sales in three years.

Best Buy's business had been hurt by online competition and also a return to more normalized spending on gadgets after a pandemic-induced splurge by Americans.

A combination of innovative products, like laptops with artificial intelligence capabilities, and a growing need to replace electronics, has helped to spur sales, Barry said on a conference call Thursday.

Customer behavior hasn't changed in the first half of the year, Barry said, in that they remain resilient. Shoppers continue to focus on deals and are attracted to known sales events like Black Friday and the company's July sales promotion.

“In the current environment, customers continue to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases and are willing to spend on high price point products when they need to, or when there is technology innovation,” she said.

The electronics industry can be particularly hard hit by tariffs because so many good are imported. But the overall cost increases have been much less than the overall rate of the tariffs, Barry said. Barry told reporters on a separate conference call Thursday that price increases were only applied to “a very small assortment” of products.

That's because its vendors are taking different strategies, from adjusting promotions to potentially increasing prices on new products.

Barry said in May that Best Buy was taking a variety of actions to offset tariff costs, including a push on its vendors to diversify their manufacturing.

Best Buy has little control over its sourcing because it relies on vendors. The company directly imports about 2% to 3% of the products it sells. China remains the No. 1 source for the retailer's products, but Best Buy estimates that the percentage of product cost those imports represent is now approximately 30% to 35%, down from 55% in March. That’s because vendors are expanding production outside of China. The U.S. and Mexico account for roughly 25% of its cost.

The reported net income of 87 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring costs and amortization costs, were $1.28 per share, which is 6 cents better than industry analysts had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

Sales rose to $9.44 billion and also handily topped expectations.

For the year, Best Buy stuck by revenue expectations in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion and a comparable sales range of anywhere from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%.

It also left profit expectations unchanged, forecasting per-share earns of $6.15 to $6.30 this year. Analysts expect $6.16 per share on revenue of $41.36 billion for the year, according to FactSet.

He pointed out that, for decades, previous mayors directed the school district to do way more borrowing without being bashed as reckless.
Closing the CPS deficit The debate over the municipal pension payment and loan consumed the budget process.","The Chicago Board of Education delivered a blow to Mayor Brandon Johnson on Thursday by approving a budget that does not guarantee the school district will make a controversial municipal pension payment — a move that could leave a $175 million hole in the city’s bank account.

The budget, approved by 12 of 20 board members, closes a $734 million deficit but does not include a loan, which the mayor’s office sought in order to cover the pension payment and other unexpected shortfalls.

Most of the mayor’s appointees and elected allies spoke against the budget but did not make moves to change it — and crucially, some unexpectedly voted in favor of the budget and tipped the balance.

The news is not all bad for Johnson: The budget does commit Chicago Public Schools to making the pension payment should it get extra money from the city or state. The whole school board and many community members committed to going to Springfield and demanding money.

That was Interim CPS CEO/Supt. Macquline King’s concession to the mayor. After having not said much publicly about her budget, King defended her spending plan Thursday at the top of the monthly board meeting.

“At the heart of this decision is a shared commitment to our students,” she said. “It’s about coming together to do what’s right for their future. Passing a budget means protecting our schools from further cuts, and unlocking the opportunity to focus fully on enhancing the quality of education throughout our city.”

The budget counts on a record $379 million in surplus funds from the city’s special tax increment financing, or TIF, districts. Senior mayoral aide Jason Lee suggested Wednesday that this money might not come through if the board didn’t commit to making the pension payment. He said CPS has never counted on so much TIF surplus funding in its budget.

TIF districts are zones across the city where some property taxes are set aside for economic development or infrastructure projects. The mayor, with City Council approval, can use unspent or unobligated money as a one-time fix for operating budget gaps. CPS gets 52% of TIF surpluses; the city gets about 23% and other taxing bodies get the rest.

Board members who supported the budget said they were confident the money will come through.

In fact, the city could approve an unprecedented TIF surplus that would give CPS even more than $379 million and cover the pension payment.

Board member Norma Rios-Sierra, appointed in District 3A, said she wants City Council members who came to the board meeting and urged against a loan to follow through and approve the TIF surplus.

“I hope that it’s true, I hope that they put their money where their mouth is, and when its time to vote on that city budget that allocates that enormous TIF that is going to save our budget and avoid big year cuts, I hope that they vote, ‘Yes,’ ” Rios-Sierra said.

She noted those funds are for development projects in neighborhoods, and taking that money is a “sacrifice” for those communities.

Johnson’s allies at the Chicago Teachers Union said the board’s approval of “this imbalanced budget will cost Chicago’s public school students,” warning that budget cuts would “be felt in our homes.” The union called on Gov. JB Pritzker and Illinois lawmakers to send more funds to CPS and vowed to head to Springfield for the fall veto session.

A yearlong CPS budget battle

This extended budget battle has seen Johnson’s former appointed board resign en masse and led to the district’s former CEO Pedro Martinez being fired last year.

The same conflict between the school district administration and Johnson arose this summer, even after the school board hired CPS CEO/Supt. Macquline King out of the mayor’s office.

The vote divided the board into two camps, aligned with or opposing the mayor’s wishes. In a twist, the mayor’s chosen leader, King, landed on the side opposing him. The CPS budget proposal she advanced, which did not include the pension payment or a loan, was the one approved Thursday.

Three of Johnson’s appointees and two elected allies ultimately voted in favor of King’s budget even though some of them expressed reservations. They made the difference in the vote.

Political opponents of Johnson had seized on the controversy, calling him reckless for wanting the school board to approve what they said would be high-interest borrowing akin to a payday loan.

Johnson fired back this week by saying the criticism had racial overtones. He pointed out that, for decades, previous mayors directed the school district to do way more borrowing without being bashed as reckless.

Johnson and his allies have said their top priority is making sure CPS doesn’t have to make massive harmful cuts to classrooms — even if that means borrowing money.

A loan might still be on the table. The CPS chief financial officer sent the board a memo earlier this week saying they can approve a loan in an emergency with only a simple majority vote.

Angel Gutierrez, elected in District 8A, referenced the memo, saying he would not be surprised if the board had to revisit a loan “just because the world around us is changing.”

“We have the ability to come back should we face a state of emergency as a district to borrow and come up with a plan,” he said.

But at the moment, many board members thought new borrowing was a bad idea.

Carlos Rivas, an elected member in District 3B, said he supported the spending plan because the district is already saddled with hundreds of millions in debt from previous borrowing and shouldn’t repeat those strategies.

“Its just not something that we as a board can afford,” Rivas said. That money “could be in our classrooms today but it’s not because we lose that in debt service per year.”

After the budget passed, board member Che “Rhymefest” Smith, elected to represent 10A, told a gaggle of reporters that “the students won today. The teachers won today. Balanced budgets won today.”

School district officials said the inclusion of the loan would have likely triggered a credit rating downgrade and could have made borrowing more costly this year and in the future.

Closing the CPS deficit

The debate over the municipal pension payment and loan consumed the budget process. But CPS faced a deficit outside of these factors in large part because CPS had used $2.8 billion federal COVID relief funding to hire thousands of teachers and other staff — and that money ran out.

This hiring was used to lower class sizes, help struggling students and support students with disabilities. CPS leaders said these staff members led to students bouncing back academically from the pandemic, and the district shouldn’t let them go.

To balance the budget, the district will refinance debt, repurpose and carry over some grants and make about $300 million in cuts. Some of those cuts have yet to be detailed, a point that board members criticized Thursday.

Among the cuts already announced: 500 custodians; 200 lunchroom workers; 100 crossing guards and fewer hours for Safe Passage workers, who watch over students as they make their way to and from schools.

To save $40 million, CPS canceled contracts with private custodial companies, who for decades had managed the cleaning of schools in the afternoons and evenings, and laid off all their 1,250 workers. CPS said it would hire 750 of those custodians to work for the district.

This transition spurred outrage from the private janitors and SEIU Local 1, the union that represents them. Many of them have cleaned the schools for decades and were upset that their years of service wouldn’t be honored if they moved under the district.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/96e8fa9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff8%2F67%2Fdc21f61543ceaa7dcca68d0bfeaf%2Fcpsbudgetvote-082925-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 00:03:19.011197

However, management said Best Buy would maintain its outlook for the coming year due to ongoing uncertainty around tariffs.
Best Buy in May had forecast yearly revenue of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion, below past guidance of $41.4 billion to $42.2 billion, and maintained those figures again Thursday.
As PYMNTS wrote recently, back-to-school spending is at record levels, with parents spending more than $1,200 per household and turning to financing to cover expenses.
“There are indications, gleaned from earnings season, that the momentum may continue, although spending may be allocated toward low-priced merchants amid promotional activity,” PYMNTS wrote, again pointing to the record back-to-school spending.","The electronics retailer released second-quarter earnings Thursday (Aug. 28) that showed sales growth of 1.6%, the highest rate in three years. Sales were driven purchases in several product categories, including computing, mobile phones, wearables, headphones and gaming, thanks to the release of Nintendo’s Switch 2.

However, management said Best Buy would maintain its outlook for the coming year due to ongoing uncertainty around tariffs.

“Given the uncertainty of potential tariff impacts in the back half, both on consumers overall as well as our business, we feel it is prudent to maintain the annual guidance we provided last quarter,” CEO Corie Barry said during an earnings call.

Best Buy in May had forecast yearly revenue of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion, below past guidance of $41.4 billion to $42.2 billion, and maintained those figures again Thursday.

Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas told analysts that the guidance takes into account projections that some consumers could hesitate to make purchases in the third quarter.

“So you oftentimes see a slowdown in business a little bit in October as people are waiting for those holiday deals to come,” he said.

“So our guidance would reflect the fact that we’re starting the quarter strong, feel good about the momentum, but also recognize that sometimes there is a little bit of a slowdown as you head into the deeper holiday season.”

The earnings call came amid the busy back-to-school shopping season, a critical time for Best Buy. Barry said the retailer had enjoyed “a strong customer response” to its sales events during the season. As PYMNTS wrote recently, back-to-school spending is at record levels, with parents spending more than $1,200 per household and turning to financing to cover expenses.

Best Buy’s earnings came the same day the Bureau of Economic Analysis published its second estimate for the second quarter of the year’s GDP, which grew 3.3% thanks to an uptick in consumer spending.

“There are indications, gleaned from earnings season, that the momentum may continue, although spending may be allocated toward low-priced merchants amid promotional activity,” PYMNTS wrote, again pointing to the record back-to-school spending.

Those patterns suggest “that items such as backpacks and dorm room essentials are non-negotiable for many families,” the report added, which in turns “signals an intent to spend that could last through August and into the fall.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Best-Buy.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 23:07:12.791736

Coinciding with UV Safety Awareness Month (July), skincare SaaS company Haut.AI launched the SPF Truth Booth, an interactive tool powered by its generative AI engine, SkinGPT. The platform is designed to educate consumers about the long-term effects of sun exposure by providing hyper-realistic simulations of how their skin could age with and without daily sunscreen use.

Haut.AI emphasizes the scientific foundation of the tool, which is trained on a diverse global skin dataset and validated dermatological research to project changes in texture, pigmentation and elasticity.

Anastasia Georgievskaya, CEO of Haut.AI, stated, ""Consumers are done with vague claims about product efficacy. They don't just want to hear about the science – they want to see it. SPF Truth Booth is more than just a digital filter. It combines generative AI with peer-reviewed science to create accurate simulations that make the long-term benefits of daily sun protection unmistakably clear.""

(KNWA/KFTA) — Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was in Northwest Arkansas for the ribbon-cutting at Walmart’s Global Security Operations Center in Bentonville.

The governor attended the ribbon-cutting for Walmart’s Global Security Operations Center held with the Bentonville-based retailer’s top officials.

The new facility serves as the command center for security and safety across Walmart’s global operations.

Vice president of the Global Security Operations Center, Jason Jackson, says it will allow teams to identify risks, coordinate emergency responses to major events like natural disasters and provide around-the-clock global monitoring.

“This 24/7 component, with all of the participants that we have, we’ve brought in our partner group on the daily, not just when we flex up as an organization. So I think that really grows our superpower in how we’re able to be more effective and more efficient,” Jackson said.

Walmart says the new center will help it get ahead of potential threats. Walmart says the center allows the retailer to be notified of 911 calls at any of its stores.

One example was given of a North Carolina store when a car was on fire in the parking lot. The team was able to zoom in on the fire through parking lot security cams. This allowed the team to see what was going on before store leaders were even notified.

New Keytronic Facility

The governor was also at a ribbon-cutting for the opening of a new Keytronic facility in Springdale that will replace the current one in Fayetteville.

This new facility is larger, which the company hopes will position it to take on more jobs as many companies look to bring their manufacturing back to the United States.

“Here in the U.S., this is where predominantly most of the demand is. We’ve seen kind of a shift of customers really wanting their product built in America,” Keytronic CEO Brett Larsen said.

(Reuters) -Gap on Thursday reported comparable sales below Wall Street estimates as customers pulled back on discretionary spending, and it said U.S. tariffs would squeeze its margins in the current quarter.

Shares of the company were down about 2% in extended trading.

Inflationary prices and uncertainty arising from the Trump administration's trade policy have curbed consumer spending, challenging CEO Richard Dickson's turnaround efforts to revitalize its brands.

For the quarter ended August 2, Gap's comparable sales rose 1%, missing estimates of 2.26% growth, while net sales rose slightly to $3.73 billion, almost in line with analysts' estimates, according to data compiled by LSEG.

In the quarter, net sales in its cheaper Old Navy and namesake Gap brands ticked up 1% each. But sales fell in its pricier brands Banana Republic and Athleta. Sales in the athleisure brand continued their decline, falling 11%.

""Dickson has delivered on his promise to reinvigorate the Gap brand, though it remains to be seen if or how he can do the same for Athleta, where sales continue to decline,"" said Sky Canaves, analyst at EMarketer.

Gap, like rivals including American Eagle and Levi Strauss, has pushed its denim line with a new viral ""Better in Denim"" campaign featuring the global girl group KATSEYE to bump up sales.

The campaign comes weeks after American Eagle's ""Great Jeans"" denim campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney.

The company now expects annual operating margin to be between 6.7% and 7%, compared with 7.4% in 2024.

The forecast includes a tariff impact in the range of 100 to 110 basis points, which translates to a hit of $150 million to $175 million.

Canaves said the company's profit margins could deteriorate as the year progresses.

""Tariff impacts, combined with a heavily promotional environment during the holidays, squeeze margins further.""

In May, Gap announced $250 million to $300 million in tariff-related costs and aimed to mitigate more than half of that amount while working to reduce exposure to countries struck with high tariffs on imports to the United States.

Last year, the panel voted to recommend updated Covid vaccines in June.
In 2023, it endorsed new Covid vaccines in September, just one day after the F.D.A.
Walgreens, the nation’s second largest pharmacy chain, did not respond to requests for comment about the availability of Covid shots at its stores.
Just 23 percent of adults and 13 percent of children reported getting an updated Covid vaccine last season.","CVS, the country’s largest pharmacy chain, is currently not offering Covid vaccines in 16 states, including Florida, New York and Pennsylvania, even to people who meet newly restricted criteria from the Food and Drug Administration.

Amy Thibault, a spokeswoman for CVS, cited “the current regulatory environment” as the reason the vaccine was not available in those states, or in the District of Columbia, emphasizing that the list could change. Legal experts said that federal decisions were creating an extremely difficult situation for pharmacies to navigate.

In some states, pharmacists are forbidden to administer vaccines that are not recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel.

Last year, the panel voted to recommend updated Covid vaccines in June. In 2023, it endorsed new Covid vaccines in September, just one day after the F.D.A. gave its approval.

But as of this Thursday, the panel was not scheduled to meet for another three weeks. And, after a slew of high-level resignations at the C.D.C., Senator Bill Cassidy — Republican of Louisiana and the chairman of the Senate’s health committee — has called for the meeting to be “indefinitely” postponed. That could mean many people’s access to shots remains hamstrung well into the fall, when infections from respiratory viruses normally spike.

CVS will make the vaccines available nationwide if the advisory panel recommends them, Ms. Thibault said. But since the panel hasn’t yet made a decision, the company is holding off in states where it believes its pharmacists need a C.D.C. endorsement.

Pharmacies have traditionally been a crucial access route to the Covid vaccine, accounting for a vast majority of shots given last year. The CVS move is a strong signal that federal decisions could reduce access more than the restrictions laid out on paper, and the confusion is likely to crop up at other pharmacies as well, legal experts said.

Walgreens, the nation’s second largest pharmacy chain, did not respond to requests for comment about the availability of Covid shots at its stores. But when a New York Times reporter tried to schedule vaccine appointments in all 50 states, the pharmacy’s website said patients would need a prescription in 16.

Requiring prescriptions for the shots would be a total change in practice, said Dr. Marc Sala, a co-director of the Northwestern Medicine Comprehensive Covid-19 Center in Chicago.

Experts are themselves divided on what pharmacies can do, but they agree that the choices are hard.

Whether last year’s C.D.C. recommendation still applies is ambiguous, said Richard Hughes IV, a vaccine lawyer who teaches at George Washington University Law School and worked for Moderna early in the pandemic. There is an argument that it does, and that pharmacists can administer the updated vaccines under it unless ACIP says otherwise, he said.

But Richard Dang, an associate professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California, said he believed the reformulated shots required a new recommendation.

In the states where Walgreens is requiring prescriptions, it appears to have judged that its pharmacists can perform the actual injections, but can’t determine the appropriateness of a vaccine for a particular patient. Those questions are legally separate, Mr. Hughes said.

Vaccine appointments also appeared unavailable at Walgreens in many states. That may, in part, reflect a supply issue, doctors said. But Walgreens’ note that patients need prescriptions in some states could signal confusion among pharmacists over whom they’re allowed to vaccinate.

“That may be pharmacies covering themselves while all of these unanswered questions are still up in the air,” said Dr. Shira Doron, the chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine.

Covid vaccination rates have fallen precipitously since the height of the pandemic. Just 23 percent of adults and 13 percent of children reported getting an updated Covid vaccine last season.

The fact that pharmacies are limiting access to vaccines when Covid infections are rising, as they do every summer, is “really unconscionable,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.

Making it more difficult to schedule a shot may discourage even more people from getting vaccinated, doctors said.

“It’s just raising more and more barriers,” Dr. Chin-Hong said. “It’s like an obstacle course.”

He added: “I don’t know anybody who’s not confused.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/28/multimedia/WELL-COVID-SHOT-STATES1-mvhg/WELL-COVID-SHOT-STATES1-mvhg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 21:05:30.844719

It will become the first production facility in the eastern U.S. for South San Francisco-based Genentech.
It will create more than 400 manufacturing jobs, with another 1,500 workers participating in the construction of the complex.
Roche began considering the possibility of building a new manufacturing site after it acquired Carmot Therapeutics and its portfolio of obesity candidates for $2.7 million in December 2023.
Roche’s other U.S. projects include a $550 million facility under construction on its diagnostics campus in Indianapolis that will produce glucose monitoring devices.","When it came to deciding where to build a new manufacturing facility for its ambitious metabolic drug program, Roche undertook a thorough search that included 12 high-tech clusters in the U.S. and “multiple properties in each,” according to the Swiss company’s High Volume Portfolio Lead Paul Bezy.

After all that, Roche settled on a familiar pharma manufacturing location: Holly Springs, North Carolina. In setting up shop there, the drugmaker will be joining a growing legion of pharma companies—including Amgen, CSL Seqirus, Fujifilm, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron—that are establishing a presence in the suburban town southwest of Raleigh.

“They run the government like it’s a business, from an efficiency and a speed standpoint,” Bezy said in an interview this week. “They understand what pharma companies need, and they seem to be specifically targeting this industry to create the right ecosystem, the right support system, for what it takes to bring a high-tech pharmaceutical facility online.”

Monday, Roche’s U.S. subsidiary Genentech broke ground on the $700 million plant, which is tabbed for operation in 2029. It is part of Roche’s plan to invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years to support its manufacturing and R&D operations.

The company unveiled its move to North Carolina in May. It will become the first production facility in the eastern U.S. for South San Francisco-based Genentech. It will create more than 400 manufacturing jobs, with another 1,500 workers participating in the construction of the complex. Sitting on a 100-acre property, Genentech will be able to expand the facility if needed.

Roche began considering the possibility of building a new manufacturing site after it acquired Carmot Therapeutics and its portfolio of obesity candidates for $2.7 million in December 2023. The Holly Springs facility will perform fill-finish duties for injected drugs.

“We’re a latecomer into this therapeutic area. It’s not a mystery,” Bezy said. “We’re coming in as a strong challenger. We’re in it to win it.”

The groundbreaking comes as several pharma giants rush to increase their ability to manufacture products in the U.S. in response to President Donald Trump’s effort to impose import tariffs on foreign-made medicines.

Last week, the industry gained more clarity with the confirmation of a 15% tariff on EU-made innovative drugs. Among the pharma giants that have revealed massive investment plans in the U.S. are AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novartis.

Sales on Walmart Marketplace rose 17% in its fiscal Q2 2026, according to the retailer’s latest earnings report. To build on that momentum, Walmart is adding faster fulfillment, in-store visibility and new AI-powered tools for its third-party sellers.

The retailer outlined the upgrades Aug. 26 at its annual Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit, spotlighting expanded next-day delivery, targeted fee cuts and a smart assistant for sellers. Walmart said it shaped the initiatives through seller feedback. They are designed to help merchants grow faster, operate more efficiently and reach more customers in the U.S. and abroad, it said.

“Walmart has become one of the fastest-growing ecommerce platforms by focusing on what matters most: integrity, seller success and delivering exceptional experiences for customers,” said Manish Joneja, senior vice president of Walmart U.S. Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services, in a prepared statement. “Everything we’re building — from smarter tools to expanded fulfillment and global reach — is designed to accelerate seller growth and empower sellers to serve customers while driving their businesses forward.”

Walmart is No. 2 in the Top 2000. The database is Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of North America’s online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales.

Walmart is also No. 8 in the Global Online Marketplaces. That database ranks the top such marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV).

Walmart Marketplace’s reach into stores

One of the most notable changes centers on Walmart’s stores. The retailer said it will begin showcasing marketplace items in physical locations, “blending the digital and physical shopping experience.” This is done via QR-code displays that direct shoppers to expanded assortments online.

Walmart has been testing the approach at its new Cypress, Texas, supercenter, which opened in April as what it called its first “store of the future.” The location features digital shelf labels, allowing customers to scan items, browse additional options online, request delivery through the Walmart app or schedule installation services.

The company said it’s now “bringing the extended Marketplace aisle into stores, starting with a few items on display.” Walmart did not disclose which stores will feature the new aisles or when the rollout could expand.

Joneja told Modern Retail the added in-store visibility will not come with a charge to sellers. He said Walmart chooses which marketplace items to highlight in collaboration with first-party merchants.

Walmart claims around 270 million customers visit its 10,750 stores weekly, a level of traffic that could extend marketplace visibility far beyond online channels.

Next-day delivery for marketplace orders

Alongside in-store visibility, Walmart is making moves in fulfillment to speed up delivery for sellers and shoppers alike.

The retailer said Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS), its logistics network, now offers next-day delivery in major U.S. metros, including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Houston and Atlanta.

This comes as use of Walmart Fulfillment Services continues to grow. Speaking on Walmart’s fiscal Q2 earnings call, chief financial officer John David Rainey said sales from the online marketplace increased 17%, in part because more third-party sellers are using the service. About 44% of marketplace volume now flows through Walmart Fulfillment Services, up 250 basis points from a year earlier, he said.

Walmart also pointed to cost advantages. Orders fulfilled through the service run about 15% cheaper per item compared with competing providers, based on the company’s internal data for the year ended June 30, 2025. Marketplace sellers using its fulfillment saw, on average, a 50% lift in gross merchandise value (GMV) on items tagged Walmart Fulfilled and 2-Day Shipping during the same period, Walmart said.

Sellers can also extend the service beyond Walmart’s site. Through multichannel solutions, merchants can use Walmart Fulfillment Services to handle orders from their own websites, social media shops, and other marketplaces, such as Amazon, eBay, Shein, and Temu, according to Walmart’s website. Sellers using WFS can also broaden their reach internationally, with access to customers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Chile, it said.

Enhanced tools for Walmart Marketplace sellers

Beyond fulfillment, Walmart said it’s adding new AI-powered tools for sellers.

For example, a new AI-powered listing tool lets sellers set up single or bulk items more quickly, which Walmart says can improve conversion rates. The company is also introducing a smart assistant that provides real-time support to sellers around the clock.

Other additions include a new seller advisors program. This connects merchants across categories and regions directly with Walmart leaders to share feedback and shape programs.

Sellers that ship their own products will also gain access to new automated shipping settings, allowing them to customize delivery promises by region. Meanwhile, an upgraded brand portal is designed to help merchants protect intellectual property and flag fraudulent listings, Walmart said.

The retailer is also debuting new fee incentives, which it says will help merchants compete during the peak shopping season and land more business:

0% referral fee on all qualifying toys

50% reduction on qualifying pet supplies

Up to 100% referral fee reductions on top-selling items across categories

Referral fees are the commission Walmart charges sellers per transaction, typically ranging from 6% to 15% depending on the category.

Seller growth

The new tools come as Walmart’s marketplace is expanding at its fastest pace yet.

Walmart’s marketplace crossed 200,000 active sellers for the first time in 2025, according to recent data from Marketplace Pulse. In the first five months alone, the platform added 44,000 new merchants, nearly matching the 59,000 added throughout all of 2024. That marks a 30% jump in seller count early in the year. At this rate, Walmart could add more than 100,000 sellers by year-end, almost doubling its growth from 2024.

Now, the company is opening up about stepping away from its care-at-home initiatives through Best Buy Health.

One of Best Buy’s fiscal strategic priorities for 2026 is identifying areas for cost reductions, to help fund investment capacity for new and existing initiatives and offset business pressures, Corie Barry, CEO of Best Buy, explained on Thursday during the company’s second-quarter earnings call.

“There are many ways we realize these efficiencies,” she said. “They are often achieved with the help of technology and analytics, through ongoing vendor partnerships and vendor selection throughout the enterprise, and by modifying existing processes or customer offerings. Other times, they are the result of us moving on from initiatives that aren’t generating the financial return in the timeline we had originally envisioned, such as the exit of our care-at-home Best Buy Health initiative.”

For a while, Best Buy stood out as one of the few retail giants still engaging with home-based care while many of its peers pulled back.

The company originally purchased Current Health back in 2021. Over the years, Best Buy also leaned on its Geek Squad services to power its care-at-home collaborations with companies such as Geisinger Health System.

Aside from Geisinger Health System, Best Buy also had a home-based care-focused partnership with Atrium Health in 2023. In 2024, the company implemented over 40 acute care home monitoring programs across the U.S. and U.K., monitoring more than 34,000 patients.

“The business that we have called active aging, our lively business or even just some of the care at home business, these remain very viable business models for the future,” Barry said on the company’s Q1 earnings call back in May. “Now the part that has been harder and taken longer to develop than we initially thought is some of the very discreet in-home health that we are providing in partnership with some of the health care industry.”

Johnson & Johnson MedTech has consistently opposed the court’s findings. According to a statement made earlier this year, the company maintained that its practices were “pro-competitive” and aimed at safeguarding both patients and product performance. It also noted that it was reviewing the verdict and weighing potential appeals. When approached again after the injunction was finalized, the company had not yet provided an updated response.

The case was originally brought forward by Innovative Health, an Arizona-based medical device reprocessor, which argued that Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster division violated antitrust laws by refusing to provide free support to customers using reprocessed Carto 3 catheters. Per statement, the jury sided with Innovative Health, leading not only to the damages award but also to the injunction designed to curb repeat offenses.

Industry response to the ruling has been mixed. While Johnson & Johnson MedTech continues to defend its position, the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors (AMDR) welcomed the court’s decision. The global trade group emphasized that hospitals and patients had borne the cost of what it called anticompetitive practices. According to AMDR’s statement, the verdict sends a clear message to major device manufacturers that the courts will take action against monopolistic behavior in the MedTech sector.",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Johnson-JJ-quarter-growth.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 20:13:35.016537

Shares of the top U.S. electronics retailer fell 5.7% in morning trading, as investors focused on a likely hit to the company’s margins due to higher tariffs on U.S. imports.

Several retailers, including Best Buy, have had to raise prices on some goods to absorb the hit from these steep levies.

Company executives said the price hikes were lower than the overall rate of tariffs, owing to its mitigation strategies.

Best Buy, which sources most of its goods from China, has also made efforts to diversify its supply chain and purchase more products from fewer partners to negotiate better terms in a bid to counter higher costs.

Meanwhile, the company’s sales have struggled over the past three years as price-sensitive shoppers put off big-ticket purchases.

CEO Corie Barry said customers had become more deal-focused and waited for shopping events such as Black Friday and back-to-school promotions, even though spending remained resilient.

“Big-ticket purchases are approached more carefully, though consumers continue to spend on expensive technology when there is a clear need or innovation,” Barry said on a post-earnings call.

On a media call with journalists, Barry said that the White House had been open to feedback from Corporate America on the impact of tariffs.

Strong sales of Nintendo Switch 2 gaming consoles, which were launched in June, and a surge in demand for artificial intelligence-powered laptops and mobile phones helped reverse a sales decline during the quarter.

“Tariffs and a pullback in discretionary big-ticket categories remain a drag, and unlike general merchandise (retailers), Best Buy has limited fallback categories to absorb that pressure,” Emarketer analyst Suzy Davidkhanian said.

Comparable sales for the quarter ended August 2 rose 1.6%, the biggest increase in three years. Analysts on average had expected a 0.52% drop, according to data compiled by LSEG.

On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.28 per share, compared with the estimates of $1.21 per share.

On Thursday, the Los Angeles-based company published its Q2 2026 results. Total net revenue for the quarter increased 6 percent to $772.9 million from $732.6 million in the same prior-year quarter.

The company’s Americas retail revenues decreased 1 percent. Retail comparable sales, including e-commerce, decreased 5 percent. Americas wholesale revenues decreased 11 percent.

Europe revenues increased 14 percent. Retail comparable sales, including e-commerce, increased 11 percent. Asia revenues increased 3 percent. Meanwhile, licensing revenues decreased 10 percent.

The company recorded GAAP net earnings of $6.2 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $10.6 million for the same prior-year quarter.

Carlos Alberini, Guess Inc. CEO, said the revenues delivered were ahead of the company’s expectations for the quarter.

“Our improved revenues were mainly driven by stronger than expected comparable store sales in our European business and in our Americas retail segment, which showed continued improvement in same store sales versus the prior quarter,” he stated. “During the period we managed margins and expenses well, which, coupled with the revenue growth, led to GAAP earnings per share within our range of expectations and better than expected adjusted earnings per share.”

Guess Inc. did not host a conference call in connection with the quarterly results. The company is also suspending its practice of providing and updating financial guidance for fiscal year 2026.

On Aug. 20, Guess Inc. announced that it was selling controlling interest to Authentic Brands Group (ABG), the global brand development company that also owns Champion, Lucky Brand, Nautica, Reebok and more.

ABG will acquire a 51 percent stake in a newly formed entity that will own and license substantially all Guess’ intellectual property and assume the majority of Guess’s product licensing agreements. The remaining 49 percent will be owned by Guess cofounders Maurice and Paul Marciano, Nicolai Marciano and Alberini.

Under the terms of the deal, Guess and its subsidiaries will be taken private and be wholly owned by the current management team. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026.

One positive: Walmart’s forward revenue estimate revisions took a big jump after last Thursday’s earnings.
Source: LSEG EPS and revenue estimates Earnings estimates moved very little after last week’s earnings report, but the revenue estimates have started to move higher again.
The tariffs and the workmen’s comp and one-time labor charges are likely to extend for another quarter, but by Walmart’s fiscal Q4 ’26 (January ’26 quarter), the operating expense and margin pressure should start to fade.","Last Thursday, August 21, ’25, reported their fiscal Q2 ’26 financial results (fiscal ’26 ends January ’26, so it’s essentially calendar ’25 results we are seeing), with a whiff on earnings per share, thanks to workmen’s comp and what are being called general liability claims, while revenue was a slight beat.

No question the charges around workmen’s comp and general liability reduced operating income from +4.5% – +5% y-o-y (year-over-year) growth to a -0.5% yoy decline. EPS missed by 11%, as actual EPS was $0.68, while the estimate was $0.76.

This is likely continue through Q3 ’26 per the conference call.

The tell prior to earnings was that annual fiscal ’26 EPS was reduced to 4% starting in January ’25 (or just after President Trump was elected) while the initial growth for fiscal ’26 from last year’s estimates about fiscal ’26 were looking for +10% – +11% EPS growth.

Operationally, Walmart’s results looked fine, meaning the new emerging growth areas (the revenue flywheel) like Walmart Connect and Walmart Advertising each grew 31% and 46% respectively, while average ticket grew +1.5% and traffic grew 3.1%. Per the conference call notes, Walmart grew grocery, health and wellness and. more importantly, general merchandise, yoy.

If you want to know that Walmart remains fine operationally, simply follow yoy sales growth vs yoy inventory growth. When inventory start to gets stacked up, cash-flow metrics start to suffer. In fiscal Q2 ’26, Walmart grew yoy sales over yoy inventory again:

For comparison, in calendar ’21 and ’22 when all of retail (including ) were hit with too much inventory coming in after Covid, Walmart’s stock price fell from $53 to the high $30’s.

One positive:

Walmart’s forward revenue estimate revisions took a big jump after last Thursday’s earnings. That’s a plus.

Source: LSEG EPS and revenue estimates

Earnings estimates moved very little after last week’s earnings report, but the revenue estimates have started to move higher again.

Valuation

Most shorts or more conservative long-only investors point to Walmart’s 35x earnings multiple for fiscal ’26, (as well as the comparison of the 4% expected EPS growth rate for fiscal ’26) and conclude the stock is overvalued, and with good reason.

However, Walmart’s cash-flow-from-operations (CFFO) is also pretty formidable, and at $95 per share, Walmart’s trailing-twelve-month (TTM) CFFO means WMT is trading at just 18x CFFO/PS, versus the 38x PE (earnings) multiple.

The cash-flow multiple isn’t cheap either, but it does allow readers to better understand the business.

In terms of earnings quality – comparing Walmart’s TTM CFFO to WMT’s TTM net income, here’s the excel spreadsheet that shows Walmart’s cash-flow in relation to net income:

Again, click-on and expand the spreadsheet, and look how free-cash-flow suffered from the inventory build in 2022, which was referenced above.

What’s interesting is that for the last 8 quarters, Walmart has averaged $2 in cash-flow from operations, for every $1 in net income.

Erin Lash, who plies her trade at Morningstar and is a very-good retail analyst, thinks WMT’s fair value is $64 per share, which is about 25% lower than where our valuation puts Walmart’s value.

The key metric for Walmart is the operating margin: assuming that the regular operating margin for the retail giant is 4.50% (this last quarter was 4.44%), and with the new flywheel revenue and supply-chain automation, let’s say “peak” Walmart operating margin is 6%, or a 150 basis point improvement. If we assume $700 billion in revenue, which is an additional $10.5 billion in operating profit, and assume 8 billion shares outstanding, that’s a $1.31 or 51% increase in EPS from TTM EPS of $2.53 (over time) with assumptions being no revenue growth and no shares repurchases.

Most consumer staples stocks trade at rich multiples, like a , Procter & Gamble, , etc. The trade-off traditionally has been the higher price (and valuation) is justified with consistent and dependable earnings growth that these stocks generate over time, or to put it in investing or statistical jargon, the low standard deviation around EPS and revenue generation. The world is always changing though: PG was hammered after 2008 after the consumer traded off from pricey dependable household brands to discount labels like Costco’s Kirkland. Look at Coca-Cola when Covid struck and the carbonated business to stadiums and ballparks and just about any sporting event just collapsed.

Even on a 12 – 14 month basis, looking into calendar 2026 as Walmart’s one-time expenses end and the tariff issues settle out, the path forward for Walmart looks ok, and given Walmart’s business model, the retailer wins with recessions.

Summary / Conclusion

At it’s core, Walmart is a merchandising juggernaut, pulling in good from suppliers and making them convenient to purchase for their customers, and in order to do this properly and maintain every-day low prices (EDLP) for their customers, they are have to run a very lean and low-cost operation. To long-term retail analysts, this isn’t really a surprise.

The tariffs and the workmen’s comp and one-time labor charges are likely to extend for another quarter, but by Walmart’s fiscal Q4 ’26 (January ’26 quarter), the operating expense and margin pressure should start to fade.

In our earnings preview it was noted that Walmart was trading at about a 10% valuation premium to where we had fair value for the stock and that was a fair call given the pullback in the stock. Walmart’s 200-day moving average is at $94.67 and below that the stock could test the April lows near $83, if seasonal weakness develops in September and October ’25.

It’s a long-term holding for us and remains a Top 15 holding for clients. In fact, I’d like to add more for clients if it trades below $90, but I don’t think it will.

None of this is advice or a recommendation, but only an opinion. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. All EPS and revenue estimates cited on here, are typically sourced from LSEG.com. None of this information may be updated and if updated may not be done so in a timely fashion. Readers should gauge their own comfort with market and account volatility and adjust accordingly.

Affirm stock rose amid 2026 guidance on a key growth metric that came in above expectations amid worries over Walmart (WMT).

The San Francisco-based company reported July-quarter earnings after the market close. A new product, the Affirm debit card, boosted Q2 financial results.

The company reports results using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. In the Affirm earnings report, the company reported a profit of 20 cents versus a 14-cent loss a year earlier.

Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted 12-cent profit.

Affirm said revenue climbed 33% to $876 million vs. estimates of $837 million. The company said gross merchandise volume rose 43% to $10.4 billion vs. estimates at $9.61 billion.

The company forecast fiscal 2026 gross merchandise volume ""above $46 billion"" versus estimates of 27% growth to $45.53 billion.

On the stock market today, Affirm stock rose more than 10% to 88.39 in extended trading.

Buy Now, Pay Later Leader

Affirm is one of the biggest providers of buy now, pay later installment payment services. With BNPL options, consumers pay off purchases in monthly installments, either with low interest or none at all. Also, Affirm's new debit card has been gaining traction.

In fiscal Q4, revenue from the Affirm debit card came in at $67.1 million, handily beating estimates of $58 million.

Further, AFRM stock had advanced 31% in 2025 before the release of fiscal Q4 earnings.

Affirm has garnered about one-third of its revenue from interest income paid by consumers. But Affirm's product mix has been shifting to more BNPL plans with no interest.

Instead, Affirm garners revenue from fees paid by merchants. Zero percent interest BNPL plans generally have lower margins than interest-bearing products. But zero interest plans attract higher credit quality consumers who usually buy bigger items at stores.

Affirm competes with Klarna (KLAR), Sezzle (SEZL), Block's (XYZ) Afterpay and PayPal Holdings (PYPL). Further, Klarna is expected to launch its initial public offering in September.

While Walmart (WMT) has shifted most of its BNPL payments to Klarna, Affirm has many other partners, including Amazon.com (AMZN) and Shopify (SHOP). Analysts say a new partnership with Apple (AAPL) could be material in 2026.

Affirm Stock: Technical Ratings

Meanwhile, AFRM stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 86, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

Further, Affirm stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. Its current rating indicates more funds are buying than selling.

On September 3, 2025, Harmit Singh, the company’s chief financial and growth officer, will engage in a fireside chat at the event, a platform historically used by retailers to signal confidence in their long-term trajectories [1]. This move, coupled with the company’s broader investor engagement strategy, reveals a nuanced approach to navigating the evolving retail landscape.

The conference participation is not an isolated event but part of a pattern. In 2019, Levi Strauss’s leadership team, including then-CEO Chip Bergh and CFO Harmit Singh, highlighted a $5.5 billion annual revenue milestone and a five-year transformation strategy centered on global expansion and supply chain modernization [2]. The 2025 iteration of the conference, however, arrives amid a more competitive and sustainability-conscious market. By securing a prominent slot, Levi Strauss is signaling its intent to reinforce its position as a leader in both traditional retail and ethical consumerism.

A critical component of this strategy is the company’s emphasis on environmental and social governance (ESG) initiatives. For instance, Levi Strauss’s joint action plan with Gap Inc. in Lesotho—addressing wastewater treatment and factory conditions—demonstrates a commitment to supply chain accountability that resonates with modern investors [3]. Such efforts align with the growing demand for corporate responsibility, a factor that could differentiate Levi Strauss in a sector increasingly scrutinized for labor practices and environmental impact.

The company’s investor relations infrastructure further amplifies its credibility. The webcast of the Goldman Sachs fireside chat, accessible via its Investor Relations website, ensures transparency and broadens the audience for its strategic messaging [1]. This approach mirrors its participation in other high-profile conferences, such as Citi’s Global Consumer & Retail Conference and UBS’s 2025 event, where Singh has engaged directly with analysts and institutional investors [3]. These interactions are not merely promotional but serve as forums for dialogue, addressing concerns about market saturation, e-commerce integration, and brand loyalty in a digitally driven era.

For investors, the key takeaway is Levi Strauss’s ability to balance growth with responsibility. While the company’s global footprint—spanning 110 countries—provides a robust foundation, its strategic focus on sustainability and operational efficiency positions it to capitalize on emerging trends. The fireside chat at Goldman Sachs, therefore, is not just a routine update but a calculated move to align stakeholder expectations with its vision for a resilient, values-driven business model.

Fresh data confirms the US economy is gaining steam, with upgraded growth and job numbers beating expectations, while Nvidia posted record-breaking results that still left Wall Street wanting more.

What does this mean?

After a shaky start to the year, the US economy picked up pace – GDP climbed 3.3% in the second quarter, beating both earlier estimates and economists’ forecasts. The labor market also impressed: weekly jobless claims dropped to 229,000, coming in better than both last week’s figure and analysts’ projections. Nvidia, meanwhile, reported its highest-ever quarterly revenue at $46.7 billion – up a massive 56% year-on-year – and also beat profit expectations, yet its shares slipped 0.8% as investors questioned how long the chipmaker can keep growing at this rate. Elsewhere, energy prices held steady, with oil hovering just below $70 per barrel, while Agilent Technologies jumped over 5% on strong results, and Cooper slid 13% after an underwhelming outlook.

Why should I care?

For markets: Good news isn’t always good enough.

Upbeat GDP and job numbers usually spark optimism, but investors are being choosy, looking for signs of ongoing growth before they pile in. Nvidia’s blowout quarter shows AI is still driving tech, but the muted response hints that sky-high expectations are already baked into valuations. Market action also shows investors shifting between winners and laggards: Agilent’s standout earnings drew in buyers, while Cooper’s forecast stumble led to sharp sell-offs and analyst downgrades.

The bigger picture: Cautious optimism shapes the outlook.

The recent surge across economic metrics signals resilience in the US, but investors still want to see whether leaders like Nvidia can deliver long-term. Stable oil prices hint at steady global demand, while the mixed response to corporate earnings shows markets care about quality as much as quantity. All told, strong data is encouraging – but today’s market wants more than just headline numbers before getting carried away.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FM3449802_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=dc2583cc5648f6bacf781779289ff377,N,,2025-08-28 18:16:21.237080

Bear Case Slowing Organic Growth: Organic sales grew under 2% sequentially, and guidance is on the cautious side—reigniting strong top-line growth could be a challenge.","Overview

Colgate–Palmolive (NYSE: CL) is a heavyweight in the world of everyday goods, split between two main engines: Oral, Personal & Home Care (think toothpaste, soap, and all the usual bathroom suspects) and Pet Nutrition (through its Hill’s brand, stocked by vets and specialty pet shops). The company’s reach is massive, selling trusted, branded products in over 200 countries. It leans on marketing muscle, innovation, and premium price tags to fuel sales. For full year 2024, Colgate racked up $20.1 billion in net sales and clocked 7.4% organic sales growth. As a classic consumer staple, Colgate sits in a slow-but-steady sector—one that doesn’t produce fireworks, but rarely fizzles, even when things get rocky elsewhere. Its direct rivals include Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and Kimberly-Clark, all jostling for market share with a mix of brand power and promotions, while navigating a maze of rising commodity costs and wild currency swings. Colgate stands out with its global toothpaste share (about 41.4%) and manual toothbrush dominance (about 32.2%), underpinned by its brand strength and ability to operate at scale.

Recent Performance

Colgate’s stock has had a tough twelve months: it dropped from $105.79 to $83.72, a fall of 20.9%, while the S&P 500 climbed from 5,592.18 to roughly 6,483.84—a 15.9% gain. This underperformance lines up with a bigger theme: investors have shifted away from defensive consumer staples toward riskier, growth-focused sectors. Colgate also faces its own headwinds—slowing organic growth, currency troubles, and a more cautious margin outlook after the company’s latest guidance.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Colgate’s growth story is steady, but the pace has eased off. In 2024, net sales were up 3.3% and organic sales rose 7.4%—not only beating the company's own 3–5% target but making it six years running above those targets. More recently, things have cooled: in Q2 2025, net sales grew just 1.0% and organic sales 1.8%, thanks in part to weaker private-label pet sales and currency headwinds. For full year 2025, Colgate expects organic growth at the low end of its 2–4% guidance, with its exit from private-label pet foods and higher raw-material costs (especially palm oils) weighing things down. The company is banking on science-backed product innovation, bigger pushes in emerging markets, digital marketing, and a new three-year productivity drive to keep growth ticking and boost efficiency.

Quality & Moat

Profitability and cash flow are solidly in Colgate's corner. An operating margin of 21.1% for Q2 2025—and margins north of 20% for all of 2024—show that Colgate can hold its ground, even when inflation bites. Morningstar hands Colgate a wide moat, calling out its dominant brands, big global reach, and marketing spend that sits around 12% of sales. The balance sheet is in good shape, with net debt to EBITDA at 1.59x (versus a market average of 1.41x) and an interest coverage ratio of about 15x (that’s $1.08 billion in operating profit versus $71 million in interest expenses in Q2). Free cash flow yield is a healthy 3.79%—higher both than Colgate’s five-year average (3.61%) and the market’s (1.97%). That gives the company fuel for dividends and share buybacks.

Valuation

Colgate trades at a forward P/E of 25.2×—bang in line with the S&P 500’s 25.6×—and its EV/sales of 4.06× sits right around its five-year average (4.07×) and below the market’s (4.40×). This puts Colgate at a modest valuation discount for its sector. Its free cash flow yield above peers strengthens its value case. Analysts’ consensus 12-month price target is $98.92—about 18% above the current share price of $83.72.

Market Sentiment

The analyst crowd leans moderately bullish: out of 12 analysts tracking Colgate, 7 rate it a Buy, 4 say Hold, and 1 says Sell, with an average target price of $98.92 (15.4% upside). Wells Fargo recently lowered its target to $83 (Underweight), but Edward Jones is more upbeat, maintaining a Buy due to Colgate's underestimated strategic shifts. Short interest is low, volatility is subdued (18.5% versus the market’s 26.8%), big investors still own plenty of stock, and insiders haven’t made any big moves. All in all, sentiment is steady for this consumer staple.

Key Risks

Foreign Exchange Volatility: Currency swings knocked 4.1% off Colgate’s top line in 2024, and there’s still pressure on both sales and margins from FX.

Commodity Cost Inflation: Raw-material costs—especially key fats and oils like palm kernel—continue to squeeze margins, as emphasized in recent 2025 management guidance.

Competitive Pressure: Private-label players and nimble niche competitors are winning ground in both personal care and pet nutrition, putting pressure on Colgate’s pricing power.

Growth Slowdown: Organic growth in Q2 2025 slowed to 1.8%, and full-year guidance now sits at the low end. Sustaining past momentum could prove tricky.

Tariff and Regulatory Risks: Shifts in trade policy or new tariffs could raise input costs or disrupt supply chains, especially in today’s geopolitical climate.

Financial Leverage Constraints: Colgate’s net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.59× is above the market average, which limits flexibility—and if business slows, it could pressure interest coverage.

Bull Case

Strong Brand Moat: Colgate’s top-tier brand positions in oral care (41.4% share) and manual toothbrushes (32.2%) help it defend margins and pricing.

Robust Cash Generation: A 3.79% free cash flow yield beats peers, supporting regular dividend increases and strategic share buybacks.

Valuation Upside: With a modest valuation discount (EV/sales around its norm) and an 18% upside to consensus price targets, there’s room for the share price to move up.

Productivity Program Catalyst: A new three-year, $200–300 million cost-savings drive could improve margins and free cash flow starting in 2026.

Defensive Stability: Low beta (0.27) and a core spot in consumer staples means Colgate tends to hold up well in bumpy markets.

Emerging-Market Growth: Exposure to fast-growth markets and product premiumization gives Colgate mid-single-digit organic growth opportunities.

Bear Case

Slowing Organic Growth: Organic sales grew under 2% sequentially, and guidance is on the cautious side—reigniting strong top-line growth could be a challenge.

FX and Inflation Headwinds: Currency volatility and stubbornly high commodity prices continue to eat into margins and squeeze sales.

Intense Competition: Private labels and smaller specialist brands are elbowing in, threatening Colgate’s turf in key categories.

Mature End Markets: Toothpaste and toothbrush markets are already saturated, so growth mostly comes from marketing and promotions, not more buyers.

Restructuring Charges: The upcoming cost-cutting program comes with $200–300 million in pre-tax charges through 2028 that may dent earnings in the short term.

Debt Service Risks: Leverage is above peer averages, which could become an issue if Colgate’s business hits a rough patch.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings: Due in late October 2025—will be key for tracking organic growth and margin improvements after early productivity moves.

Full Year 2025 Results: Slated for January 31, 2026—expect a fresh look at targets and commentary on tariff impacts.

Productivity Program Updates: Watch for mid-2026 investor day—should bring new details on cost savings progress.

Tariff Policy Developments: Any new U.S. tariffs could be a curveball for Colgate’s raw-material costs and supply chain efficiency.

Dividend Ex-Date: Likely coming up in early September 2025—worth noting for income-focused investors.

Investment Conclusion

Colgate-Palmolive checks plenty of the right boxes: strong defensive qualities, steady cash flow, and a brand reputation that’s hard to beat. Growth has downshifted to the low end of targets, with currency swings and commodity costs acting as persistent speed bumps. But Colgate’s small valuation discount, solid capital management, and its new drive for productivity could offer catalysts for patient investors. For those who want income and capital preservation, Colgate’s stability, rising dividend, and moderate potential for share price gains could be appealing. Growth-focused investors might choose to wait for more visible progress on margin improvement and emerging market strategy before getting involved.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-08-28 19:16:26.755883

Johnson & Johnson MedTech remains committed to upholding the highest standards in how we support customers and deliver critical care solutions.” Cardiovascular Business did reach out to Johnson & Johnson MedTech for an updated comment now that this injunction has been finalized.","Johnson & Johnson MedTech was already ordered to pay $442.2 million in damages for withholding clinical support to healthcare providers. Now the company has been hit with a permanent injunction designed to stop it from being a repeat offender.

The permanent injunction was signed Aug. 27, 2025, by Judge James V. Selna of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. It rules that Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster division—now known simply as Johnson & Johnson MedTech—is not allowed to hold back clinical support for its cardiac mapping devices when customers purchase them from a reprocessing company. In addition, the company is barred from implementing new technology that would stop any reprocessed devices from properly working.

The permanent injunction also rules that a Johnson & Johnson MedTech executive is required to report to the court every six months with a detailed breakdown of what the company is doing to ensure it complies with this order. That executive must also “certify, under penalty of perjury,” that Johnson & Johnson MedTech is still complying fully with the injunction.

This ruling will stay in effect for five years, though the court does reserve the right to shorten or lengthen it as needed to “reflect ongoing market conditions.”

Additional background information on this case

Arizona-based Innovative Health, a medical device reprocessing company focused exclusively on cardiology, filed the initial lawsuit after Biosense Webster stopped offering free support to customers using reprocessed Carto 3 catheters. The company believed the policy was in violation of both state and federal antitrust laws—and the jury for the case seems to have agreed.

Johnson & Johnson MedTech was ultimately ordered to pay $442.2 million in damages. Innovative Health was not done, however; the company then requested a permanent injunction that would prohibit the healthcare giant from restricting service based on whether or not a device is reprocessed.

Johnson & Johnson MedTech has publicly disagreed with the judge’s decisions every step of the way.

“We continue to believe our actions are pro-competitive and meet our responsibility to ensure patient safety and product performance,” the company told Cardiovascular Business in May. “We are carefully reviewing the verdict and evaluating all legal options, including appeal. Johnson & Johnson MedTech remains committed to upholding the highest standards in how we support customers and deliver critical care solutions.”

Cardiovascular Business did reach out to Johnson & Johnson MedTech for an updated comment now that this injunction has been finalized. The company has yet to reply.

Global trade group celebrates judge’s decision

The Association of Medical Device Reprocessors (AMDR), a global trade group focused on the reprocessing and remanufacturing of commercial medical devices, has shared a statement praising the permanent injunction.

“Hospitals and patients have long paid the price for Biosense Webster’s anticompetitive behavior,” said Daniel J. Vukelich, president and CEO of AMDR. “This ruling reaffirms that dominant device manufacturers cannot abuse their market power to prevent hospitals from delivering the best possible care at the lowest possible price to the most patients in need at the least cost to the environment. The verdict from the jury and the injunction from the judge both send strong signals to the MedTech industry that the courts are on alert and will not tolerate monopolistic conduct.”",https://cardiovascularbusiness.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/2025-08/istock-928158772.jpg?h=b8131c3b&itok=BeTmrpUK,N,,2025-08-28 18:17:47.006298

Walgreens, The Boots Group, Shields Health Solutions, CareCentrix and VillageMD will now operate as separate standalone companies, the company said in a press release issued Thursday.
Sycamore is acquiring the business in partnership with Stefano Pessina and his family, who have reinvested 100% of their interests in Walgreens, the company said.
John Lederer, a former director of Walgreens Boots Alliance and a Senior Advisor to Sycamore, has been appointed Executive Chairman of Walgreens.
“Today represents an exciting new chapter and a turning point for Walgreens,” Motz said in a statement.","Private equity firm Sycamore Partners finalized its acquisition of retail pharmacy giant Walgreens and plans to split the company up into five separate businesses.

Walgreens, The Boots Group, Shields Health Solutions, CareCentrix and VillageMD will now operate as separate standalone companies, the company said in a press release issued Thursday.

Sycamore is acquiring the business in partnership with Stefano Pessina and his family, who have reinvested 100% of their interests in Walgreens, the company said. Shareholders approved the deal in July.

The companies announced the $10 billion deal in March. Sycamore agreed to pay $11.45 per share for the company, an equity value of about $10 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. Walgreens said in a press release that accounting for debt and future payouts, the value could reach up to $23.7 billion.

Sycamore tapped Mike Motz as the new CEO of Walgreens, effective immediately.

Motz was formerly CEO of Staples US Retail, a Sycamore portfolio company. Prior to that, he served as president of Shoppers Drug Mart, the No. 1 pharmacy chain in Canada.

The PE firm described Motz as a ""seasoned leader with deep experience"" who brings a ""renewed focus on retail, a customer-first mindset and significant operational discipline to guide Walgreens into its next chapter as a private company.""

Motz replaces Tim Wentworth, who will continue to serve as an ongoing Director. John Lederer, a former director of Walgreens Boots Alliance and a Senior Advisor to Sycamore, has been appointed Executive Chairman of Walgreens.

“Today represents an exciting new chapter and a turning point for Walgreens,” Motz said in a statement. “As a private organization, alongside our dedicated team members, we are renewing our focus on our core pharmacy and retail platform, our stores and our customer experience—building on the progress that’s been made.”

Stefan Kaluzny, managing director of Sycamore, said, “Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., its companies and its dedicated team members play an essential role in the communities they serve around the world. We look forward to partnering with the management teams at each company, including Walgreens, The Boots Group, Shields Health Solutions, CareCentrix and VillageMD. As standalone companies under private ownership, they will build on their proud legacies to enhance the customer experience and deepen the trusted relationships they have earned with millions of customers around the world.”

With the completion of the acquisition, WBA's common stock has ceased trading and will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq.

In addition to their cash consideration of $11.45 per WBA share, shareholders will receive one non-transferable right to receive up to an additional $3.00 in cash per WBA share from the net proceeds of the future monetization of the company's debt and equity interests in VillageMD, which includes the Village Medical, Summit Health and CityMD businesses.

The PE firm aims to turnaround Walgreens as the pharmacy retail chain has financially struggled in the past few years, battered by headwinds that have struck the retail pharmacy industry as well as challenges at its VillageMD unit.

As part of its ongoing turnaround plan, Walgreens announced a plan last October to close 1,200 stores.

Sycamore Partners made it clear that it planned to sell the VillageMD business. When the deal was announced in March, the company said it is looking to all options to improve the financial performance of the primary care provider and will be forming a committee to explore various avenues.

The VillageMD portfolio includes urgent and primary care chain Summit Health-CityMD after VillageMD bought those assets in a deal worth close to $9 billion in 2022.

Walgreens' healthcare assets including primary care provider VillageMD; Summit Health/CityMD, a provider of primary, specialty and urgent care; CareCentrix, a post-acute and home care provider; and specialty pharmacy Shields Health.

In June, Walgreens reported a 7% jump in sales to reach $39 billion in its fiscal third quarter. The retail drugstore chain swung to a loss in the quarter, which ended May 31, reporting a loss of $175 million, or 20 cents per share, compared to earnings of $344 million, or 40 cents a share, during the same period a year ago. The healthcare segment's operating loss was $64 million in Q3.

For full-year fiscal 2024, Walgreens’ sales grew 6.2% to $147.7 billion, but the company racked up $8.6 million in losses, an increase of 180% compared to 2023. The waning value of the VillageMD business has dragged Walgreens' financial performance and contributed to the company's hefty $6 billion loss in the second quarter of 2024.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/Walgreens%20Village%20Medical%20in%20Chicago.png?VersionId=siTQOmtTWIakiCBqWm0vFUHXxgVo9ApX,N,,2025-08-28 18:16:46.534437

When news of the demise of Hostess reached consumers, many people began stocking up on boxes of the bakery's products.

The company, which manufactured Wonder Bread, Twinkies, Ho Hos, and Ding Dongs, eventually sold all of its products and disappeared from stores for many months until J.M. Smucker in September 2012 agreed to purchase the defunct company for about $5.6 billion.

More recently, major dairy company Borden Dairy filed bankruptcy in 2020 and 2022, and Dean Foods filed bankruptcy in 2019. Borden and Dean Foods sold their businesses in bankruptcy in 2020 but continued operating.

Borden products can still be found in stores and Dean Foods' product labels, such as Dairy Pure, Land O'Lakes, and Friendly's, can also still be found in supermarkets.

And now Hearthside Food Solutions, a major manufacturer of various snack and food products for distributors such as Mondelez Global, Kraft Heinz Foods, and Pepsico, on Nov. 22 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a restructuring support agreement that will hand 100% ownership of the company to its first-lien lenders.

Hearthside and 22 affiliates filed their petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston facing $2.1 billion in impending maturities of its first-lien revolver and first-lien term loan in November 2024 and May 2025, respectively, according to a declaration from Chief Restructuring Officer Robert M. Caruso.

The Downers Grove, Ill.-based manufacturer listed $1 billion to $10 billion in assets and liabilities in its petition, which includes $2.75 billion in funded debt obligations, $304.8 billion in lease obligations, and about $164 million in general unsecured debt.

Hearthside's annual revenue has grown from $145 million in 2009 to $3.3 billion in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, 2024, according to court papers.

The debtor's largest unsecured creditors include U.S. Bank NA, owed $364.8 million in 8.5% unsecured notes; Mondelez, owed $15.2 million; Kraft Heinz Foods, owed $3.6 million; and Pepsico, owed $3.4 million.

Hearthside cited operational challenges for its filing, including wage increases and inflation, industry headwinds, certain labor issues and transitions, and adverse publicity likely from the U.S. Department of Labor's investigation into alleged child labor law violations in 2023.

The debtor, owned by private equity firms Charlesbank Partners and Partners Group, executed a restructuring support agreement with its first-lien lenders and second-lien term lenders to deleverage its capital structure to eliminate $1.9 billion of its debt and secure $200 million in exit capital, according to a statement.

Hearthside seeks to obtain $300 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its first-lien lenders, which includes $150 million in new money and $150 million in converted first-lien loans on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The company has $212.9 million in cash on hand, which it hopes to tap during its bankruptcy case through approval of cash collateral use.

The first-lien lenders will receive a $825 million first-lien exit term loan and 100% equity in the reorganized company in exchange for its $2.1 billion in first-lien secured claims.

Second-lien term loan claims, owed $300 million, will receive their pro rata share of $18 million, senior unsecured note claims, owed $350 million, will receive their pro rata share of $21 million and general unsecured claims of about $164 million will receive their pro rata share of $2.4 million. All existing second-lien, senior unsecured notes, and general unsecured claims will be canceled.

The debtor expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2025.

However, the Printing segment declined by 4%, underscoring ongoing challenges in hardware demand. This performance reflects broader industry trends as the post-pandemic PC market evolves, with HP leveraging strategic initiatives to position itself for long-term growth.

Post-Pandemic PC Market: A Tale of Two Segments

The global PC market is rebounding, with Q2 2025 shipments rising 4.4% year-over-year to 63 million units, fueled by enterprise and education demand [4]. HP’s Personal Systems segment capitalized on this trend, reporting a 6% revenue increase to $9.9 billion, driven by commercial PC sales and AI-ready hardware adoption [3]. This aligns with the industry’s shift toward AI integration, with HP embedding AI into 44% of its notebook shipments—a move expected to capture a share of the $100 billion AI PC market by 2030 [4].

Conversely, the Printing segment faced headwinds, with revenue falling to $4.0 billion. This decline mirrors broader market saturation and shifting consumer preferences toward digital workflows. Yet, HP’s focus on sustainability—such as achieving 100% renewable electricity in U.S. operations—positions it to align with evolving corporate ESG goals [2].

Strategic Resilience: Supply Chains and Shareholder Returns

HP’s supply chain diversification is a critical pillar of its strategy. By relocating nearly all North American PC production outside China by mid-2025, the company mitigates U.S. tariff risks and enhances resilience [5]. This rebalancing, combined with $1.5 billion in free cash flow, enabled $422 million in shareholder returns via dividends and buybacks [1]. Such actions signal confidence in the company’s ability to navigate macroeconomic volatility while rewarding investors.

Challenges and Opportunities

While HP’s GAAP diluted EPS rose 23.1% to $0.80, non-GAAP EPS dipped 10.7% to $0.75, reflecting the Printing segment’s drag and higher R&D costs for AI integration [1]. However, the company’s acquisition of Humane’s AI platform and its focus on localized AI capabilities in enterprise PCs suggest a long-term play to differentiate its offerings [3].

Macroeconomic factors, such as digital transformation and supply chain resilience, further underscore HP’s strategic alignment with industry needs. The digital economy’s role in driving economic growth—through industrial upgrades and green technologies—positions HP to benefit from global sustainability efforts [1].

Long-Term Momentum: A Calculated Path Forward

HP’s Q4 guidance of $0.87–$0.97 in non-GAAP EPS, aligned with historical seasonality, indicates cautious optimism [1]. The company’s dual focus on AI innovation and supply chain agility—coupled with its 20.2% global PC market share—suggests it is well-positioned to capitalize on the post-pandemic recovery [4].

For investors, HP’s ability to balance near-term challenges with long-term innovation will be key. The integration of AI into hardware, combined with its sustainability initiatives, offers a compelling narrative for growth in a market increasingly defined by technological and environmental priorities.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-28 20:13:27.095401

On its first-quarter analyst call, Ron Sargent, interim CEO, implied the amount of stores set for closure is higher than normal because its annual store review was paused during the failed merger process with Albertsons.

“We’re simplifying our business and reviewing areas that will not be meaningful to our future growth,” Sargent said. “Unfortunately, today, not all of our stores are delivering the sustainable results we need. Also, important to note, we paused our annual store review during the merger process. To position our company for future success, this morning, we announced plans to close approximately 60 stores over the next eighteen months.”

He added, “We don’t take these decisions lightly, but this will make the company more efficient.”

Kroger Comes Under Fire For Continued Store Closures

So far, Kroger has reportedly announced closures for 39 locations and scores of articles have arrived detailing the related job and city tax losses, as well as threats to food access. Many appear to speculate whether Kroger could have done more to fend off the shutterings.

Indiana State Rep. Maureen Bauer, in a social media post, described the closure of a Kroger South Bend store as a “devastating loss.”

“For many families on the west side, this Kroger is one of the only nearby options for fresh, affordable groceries,” Bauer said. “Its closure deepens an already growing food desert, making it even harder for our neighbors to access the food they need to thrive.”

Illinois resident Kelly McDonald told the Journal Star about the closing of a her local Kroger store in Peoria, “I’m still coming in here — hoping the signs will be taken down and they’ll change their mind.”

Paul Montgomery, the mayor of Kingsport, Tennessee, was among those sending a letter to Kroger pleading for a store in his city to stay open.

“I think it’s important,” Montgomery told WJHL-TV. “We have a lot of citizens who use that store, and it’s important to them for their shopping as well as its economic development for our city.”

“After 45 years, I’m very devastated,” Deatrice James, a Kroger employee for 45 years, told News 5 WCYB regarding the closure of Kroger stores in Abingdon and Kingsport in Virginia. “I mean, we’ve done everything Kroger has asked us to do, we’ve made our employees our family.”

Her store held protests, guided by unions, that are also encouraging residents to sign online petitions to keep stores open.

“Kroger’s closures put profit over people, plain and simple,” Faye Guenther, president of the UFCW union, said in a mid-August press release following news of the closure of two stores in Washington’s Puget Sound region.

“Kroger is a large publicly traded company that is presumably maximizing return for their shareholders,” said Ben Zarlingo, councilman in Washington’s Everett City — an area seeing the closing of a Kroger-owned Fred Meyer location.

“I understand the need to make strategic business decisions, but when it negatively impacts our local families and hinders their ability to access the day-to-day basics they rely on, it’s my duty to speak out for them,” Zarlingo added.",https://retailwire.com/wp-content/uploads/Kroger-Workers-in-Indiana-Vote-to-Strike.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 17:16:45.260015

Company shares slid more than 6% Thursday after the company stuck to 2025 guidance it had issued earlier this year despite the big quarterly beat. The Richfield, Minnesota, company cited the potential impact of tariffs on its business and customers.

In Best Buy’s most recent quarter, comparable sales, used as a barometer of a retailer’s health, increased 1.6% with Wall Street expecting a slight decline. CEO Corie Barry pointed out that it was the highest growth for same-store sales in three years.

Best Buy’s business had been hurt by online competition and also a return to more normalized spending on gadgets after a pandemic-induced splurge by Americans.

A combination of innovative products, like laptops with artificial intelligence capabilities, and a growing need to replace electronics, has helped to spur sales, Barry said on a conference call Thursday.

Customer behavior hasn’t changed in the first half of the year, Barry said, in that they remain resilient. Shoppers continue to focus on deals and are attracted to known sales events like Black Friday and the company’s July sales promotion.

“In the current environment, customers continue to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases and are willing to spend on high price point products when they need to, or when there is technology innovation,” she said.

The electronics industry can be particularly hard hit by tariffs because so many good are imported. But the overall cost increases have been much less than the overall rate of the tariffs, Barry said. Barry told reporters on a separate conference call Thursday that price increases were only applied to “a very small assortment” of products.

That’s because its vendors are taking different strategies, from adjusting promotions to potentially increasing prices on new products.

Barry said in May that Best Buy was taking a variety of actions to offset tariff costs, including a push on its vendors to diversify their manufacturing.

Best Buy has little control over its sourcing because it relies on vendors. The company directly imports about 2% to 3% of the products it sells. China remains the No. 1 source for the retailer’s products, but Best Buy estimates that the percentage of product cost those imports represent is now approximately 30% to 35%, down from 55% in March. That’s because vendors are expanding production outside of China. The U.S. and Mexico account for roughly 25% of its cost.

The reported net income of 87 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring costs and amortization costs, were $1.28 per share, which is 6 cents better than industry analysts had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

Sales rose to $9.44 billion and also handily topped expectations.

For the year, Best Buy stuck by revenue expectations in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion and a comparable sales range of anywhere from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%.

It also left profit expectations unchanged, forecasting per-share earns of $6.15 to $6.30 this year. Analysts expect $6.16 per share on revenue of $41.36 billion for the year, according to FactSet.",https://www.mychamplainvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2025/08/68b04bf88ab1f2.52183513.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-28 19:15:58.178153

Gap is warning that profit margins will shrink this year, with another $250 to $300 million in tariff-related costs looming – even while new denim campaigns and steady sales give the retailer some breathing room.

What does this mean?

Tariffs are taking a bigger chunk out of Gap’s profits, pushing the retailer to lower its operating margin outlook to between 6.7% and 7%, down from last year’s 7.4%. Much of that strain comes from higher import duties on Chinese-sourced goods – which, even though they now make up less than 10% of Gap’s supply chain, still face steep 30% tariffs. Gap plans to whittle that exposure down below 3% by next year, and wants no single country accounting for more than a quarter of its sourcing by 2026, all to better weather trade policy twists. Even with these changes, tariffs are set to drag margins by about one percentage point this year. And while new denim launches have helped keep annual sales growth at a modest 1% to 2%, recent foot traffic has cooled off, suggesting shoppers are turning more cautious in the face of higher prices.

Why should I care?

For markets: Tariffs put retailer profits under strain.

Gap’s Q2 net sales hit $3.73 billion, right in line with forecasts, but comparable sales growth was just 1% – short of the expected 2.26%. That’s got investors focused on whether Gap can keep shrinking its reliance on China and control costs, given that tariff pressures aren’t letting up. The story goes beyond just Gap: competitors like American Eagle and Levi Strauss are facing similar headwinds, making margin management a key narrative throughout retail this year.

The bigger picture: Supply chain strategies reshape retail’s future.

Gap’s moves to reduce its dependence on Chinese suppliers and diversify its sourcing highlight the major shifts underway in global retail. With tariffs on Chinese goods lingering since the Trump era, retailers that can shift supply chains quickly may have an edge in staying competitive and resilient as trade policy and globalization evolve.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L4N3UK1K5.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=9a57d320b2b388f52313babee38a3032,N,,2025-08-28 17:17:45.673965

This move marks a significant milestone in the company’s long-standing commitment to cleaner ingredients and responds to growing consumer demand for transparency and natural alternatives in food products.

The new versions of these iconic candies will be made without Food, Drug & Cosmetic (FD&C) synthetic color additives, which are commonly derived from petroleum and have faced increasing scrutiny from health advocates and regulators.

Mars Inc. stated that the reformulated products will feature natural coloring agents. However, the company has not yet disclosed the complete list of replacements or the timeline for transitioning its entire portfolio.

The company initially pledged in 2016 to remove all artificial colors from its products but reversed course after discovering that many consumers globally do not perceive artificial colors as problematic in confectionery products.

According to the company, many customers did not perceive synthetic dyes as problematic, which complicated the transition.

Mars Inc. has since taken a cautious approach, emphasizing consumer preference and technical challenges in finding natural alternatives that meet safety, taste, and shelf-life requirements.

However, recent regulatory pressure, particularly from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and initiatives like “Make America Healthy Again”, has accelerated industry-wide reform.

Several states, including California and West Virginia, have already moved to ban certain synthetic dyes from school meals, citing potential health risks such as hyperactivity and neurological effects in children.

Mars Inc. emphasized that its approach is science-led and consumer-focused, noting that all products will continue to meet FDA safety standards.

The company is working closely with regulators to ensure that the new formulations are both effective and scalable across its global supply chain.

The shift positions Mars alongside other major food manufacturers, such as Kraft Heinz, Grupo Bimbo, and the American Bakers Association (ABA), that have recently announced similar plans to phase out artificial dyes.

Industry analysts view this as part of a broader trend toward clean-label innovation, where ingredient simplicity and health-conscious branding are becoming central to consumer loyalty.

The transition away from artificial dyes remains challenging in the confectionery industry due to difficulties in replicating the vibrant colors consumers expect from candies like Skittles and M&M’s. Factors such as limited natural dye supply, stability, price, and taste impact the pace of change.

Mars’ 2026 launch of naturally colored options for key candy brands represents a measured but significant step toward meeting consumer demand for cleaner ingredients while balancing the technical complexities of confectionery production.",https://millingmea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Skittles.png,N,,2025-08-28 17:17:34.762061

Positive Points

HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of growth, with top-line revenue increasing 3% year over year.

The company achieved double-digit growth in key growth areas, including AI PCs and advanced compute solutions.

HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) successfully mitigated higher trade-related costs by diversifying manufacturing and implementing cost reductions.

The Personal Systems segment saw a 6% revenue growth year over year, driven by strong demand for AI PCs and Windows 11 refresh.

HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) is on track to achieve $2 billion in future-ready gross annualized savings by the end of fiscal year 2025.

Negative Points

Print revenue declined 3% in constant currency, with a softer-than-expected demand in the office segment.

The company faced a more aggressive pricing environment in the Print business, impacting profitability.

Gross margin decreased year over year due to a higher mix from Personal Systems and increased trade-related costs.

The Print segment experienced market-driven hardware declines in both consumer and commercial categories.

HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) noted that some companies are delaying IT projects, affecting software demand in hybrid systems.

Q & A Highlights

Q: Can you quantify the impact of tariff-related costs in the quarter and how much was offset? A: Karen Parkhill, HP Inc's Chief Financial Officer, explained that they made significant progress in mitigating tariff costs through supply chain optimization, cost reduction, and pricing actions. They managed to offset the majority of these costs in Q3, delivering EPS slightly above the midpoint of their guidance. Enrique Lores, HP Inc's CEO, added that most products sold in the US are now manufactured outside China, which helps mitigate future tariff impacts.

Q: With many enterprises announcing return-to-office initiatives, why hasn't there been an improvement in the Print business outlook? A: Enrique Lores noted that enterprises are prioritizing investments in areas like AI and PCs over Print, impacting short-term hardware sales. However, the number of pages printed remains stable, indicating that demand for printers will eventually return as companies need to ensure employees have the right tools.

Q: Do AI PCs have a higher ASP or margin profile compared to non-AI PCs? A: Enrique Lores confirmed that AI PCs carry a 5% to 10% price increase over similar non-AI units. The demand for AI PCs is driven by applications taking advantage of their capabilities, and HP is seeing strong growth in this category.

Q: What gives you confidence in the continued strength of the PC market, given recent strong growth? A: Enrique Lores highlighted the ongoing Windows 11 refresh and AI PC adoption as key drivers. The funnel for Windows 11 is improving, and with only slightly more than 50% of the installed base converted, there is still significant potential for growth. Karen Parkhill added that they expect sequential revenue growth in line with prior-year seasonality.

Q: How do you view the future of Print margins given recent volatility? A: Enrique Lores explained that the Q3 margin decline was due to lower supplies sales, a seasonal pattern similar to last year. They expect Print margins to be at the top end of their range in Q4, driven by higher supplies volumes and disciplined pricing. Long-term, they aim to maintain their current margin ranges while focusing on profitable unit placements and cost management.

Meanwhile, the B2B tech sector as a whole is being reshaped by AI-driven automation and vertical-specific SaaS solutions [4].
This contrasts with many B2B SaaS companies, which often trade short-term growth for long-term value [5].
Its ability to convert innovation into high-margin revenue, combined with a disciplined approach to capital allocation, positions it as a rare example of sustainable growth in the B2B tech space.
For investors seeking exposure to companies that thrive in regulated, high-impact industries, Intellego represents a compelling case study.","Intellego Technologies has emerged as a standout in the B2B tech sector, with Q2 2025 results showcasing a 296.9% year-over-year revenue surge to SEK 217.1 million and an operating margin of 70.7%—a dramatic improvement from 38.4% in 2024 [1]. This performance, coupled with a revised full-year outlook projecting revenue of SEK 700 million and operating profit exceeding SEK 400 million [2], underscores a trajectory of sustainable momentum. For investors, the question is whether this acceleration reflects a unique confluence of innovation, regulatory tailwinds, and operational discipline, or if it is a flash in the pan.

Financial Resilience and Strategic Positioning

Intellego’s financials defy typical SaaS benchmarks. While most B2B SaaS companies aim for EBIT margins between 3% and 5% [5], Intellego reported a 66% EBIT margin in Q2 2025 [1]. This outlier performance is driven by its focus on UV disinfection technologies, a niche yet high-margin sector. The company’s liquidity—SEK 200 million in available cash [1]—further insulates it from volatility, enabling reinvestment in R&D and global expansion.

The revised full-year guidance reflects confidence in scaling this model. By leveraging partnerships with industry leaders like Henkel and Likang [1], Intellego is positioning itself to capitalize on the U.S. UV LED sterilization market, projected to grow from USD 1.2 billion in 2024 to USD 5.8 billion by 2033 [6]. Regulatory clarity, particularly the FDA’s new 510(k) requirements for medical-grade UV-C devices [3], is creating a barrier to entry for competitors while validating Intellego’s product safety and efficacy.

Regulatory Tailwinds and Market Dynamics

The U.S. regulatory environment is a critical catalyst. The FDA’s mandate for whole-room microbial reduction devices to undergo rigorous testing [3] aligns with broader trends in 2025: stricter ESG reporting, AI governance, and data privacy compliance [4]. For Intellego, this means its UV-C solutions—already in demand for healthcare and industrial applications—are gaining credibility in markets where safety and compliance are non-negotiable.

Meanwhile, the B2B tech sector as a whole is being reshaped by AI-driven automation and vertical-specific SaaS solutions [4]. Intellego’s focus on niche, high-growth areas like UV disinfection mirrors this trend, avoiding the commoditization risks faced by broader SaaS players. Its ability to navigate regulatory hurdles—such as the FDA’s delayed approval of its HAI Solutions de novo application [1]—demonstrates operational agility, a key trait for long-term sustainability.

Sustainability of Momentum

Critics may question whether Intellego’s margins are sustainable, given the high R&D and capital expenditures typical of tech innovators. However, its cash flow from operations (SEK 67.1 million in Q2 2025 [1]) and low debt profile suggest a business model that prioritizes profitability over aggressive scaling. This contrasts with many B2B SaaS companies, which often trade short-term growth for long-term value [5].

Moreover, the company’s valuation—trading at just 6x EBIT [2]—presents an attractive risk-reward profile. In a sector where multiples often exceed 15x EBIT [5], Intellego’s undervaluation relative to its growth trajectory and margins offers a margin of safety for investors.

Conclusion

Intellego’s story is one of strategic alignment with regulatory and technological megatrends. Its ability to convert innovation into high-margin revenue, combined with a disciplined approach to capital allocation, positions it as a rare example of sustainable growth in the B2B tech space. For investors seeking exposure to companies that thrive in regulated, high-impact industries, Intellego represents a compelling case study.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 03:09:38.216799

President Trump's tariffs and trade restrictions are causing significant harm across multiple sectors of the U.S. economy, with the potential for price increases and reduced competition affecting American families, according to a Yahoo Finance analysis. The costs of new import taxes have surged from $7 billion before the administration to approximately $30 billion and may rise to $50 billion per month. Data from the IndexBox platform corroborates this trend, showing a marked increase in import costs across affected industries.

An examination of second-quarter earnings calls revealed that tariffs are negatively impacting profits and forcing price hikes in at least seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. The Consumer Discretionary sector (XLY) saw General Motors (GM) cite a $1.1 billion profit hit, while Ford (F) expects a $2 billion impact for the year. Companies like Deckers Outdoor (DECK), Home Depot (HD), and TJX (TJX) announced plans to raise prices. In Consumer Staples (XLP), Walmart (WMT) reported continually increasing costs, and Kraft Heinz (KHC) foresees a 1 to 1.8 percentage point reduction in profit margins.

The Energy sector (XLE) felt the strain, with SolarEdge (SEDG) anticipating a 2 percentage point margin cut and Sunrun (RUN) estimating losses of $1,000 per customer. Health Care (XLV) companies were also affected; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported a $200 million profit hit, and Medtronic (MDT) cited $185 million in costs. Industrials (XLI) faced substantial headwinds, with Caterpillar (CAT) expecting up to a $1.5 billion annual profit drain and Deere (DE) projecting a $600 million impact.

The Technology sector (XLK) incurred major costs, with Apple (AAPL) reporting $800 million in tariff-related expenses. Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) each cited $5.5 billion and $800 million in lost sales, respectively, due to new export restrictions on China. In Materials (XLB), companies like Dow (DOW) and International Paper (IP) reported that tariff uncertainty contributed to soft sales and earnings that fell short of expectations.

While some firms, such as steelmaker Nucor (NUE), have benefited from reduced import competition, many economists argue the widespread damage from higher costs and less competition outweighs the gains for a small number of protected industries.

Despite the widespread corporate impact, the U.S. stock market continues to reach record highs. This divergence may be attributed to the powerful performance of big tech stocks, the fact that large-cap companies earn a significant portion of revenue overseas, or the possibility that the full effect of tariffs on stocks has yet to materialize. It is also notable that global stocks excluding the U.S. have outperformed American shares this year, suggesting trade policy may be a factor in the relative underperformance.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/blog/insights/deere-862923.webp,N,,2025-08-28 17:17:40.767613

ID21,Instacart,2025-08-28 19:39:13+00:00,CNBC,The rewards and risks of Amazon's push to add fresh groceries to same-day delivery,"Paulina Likos, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/the-rewards-and-risks-of-amazons-push-to-add-fresh-groceries-to-same-day-delivery.html,"The company's new push to add fresh groceries to its same-day delivery service in select markets, where Prime members can already buy non-perishables and all kinds of other items, is no experiment.
He is also vice president of the company's worldwide grocery stores, which also include the Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go brands.
Amazon Fresh launched brick-and-mortar locations starting in 2020, and currently has more than 60 stores, according to the company .
Wall Street analysis In its announcement, Amazon said it expanded its same-day delivery service to include ""thousands of fresh grocery items.""
While thousands may sound like a lot, Wells Fargo said, ""Prime same-day grocery selection looks somewhat limited.""","Amazon is rewriting the playbook for grocery delivery. The company's new push to add fresh groceries to its same-day delivery service in select markets, where Prime members can already buy non-perishables and all kinds of other items, is no experiment. It's a calculated bet on logistics that enables customers to order eggs and baked goods at the same time as T-shirts and picture frames and get everything delivered together. By further enhancing its same-day fulfillment hubs, the e-commerce and cloud giant is aiming to narrow the gap with traditional grocers while setting a new standard for convenience. ""Our north star here is we want to continue to make grocery shopping easier, faster, and more affordable for our customers,"" said Jason Buechel, CEO of Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market. ""Now, under one roof, you have the opportunity for customers to get all the things they've always been purchasing from our same-day facilities and adding perishable groceries to that as well,"" Buechel told CNBC in an interview. He is also vice president of the company's worldwide grocery stores, which also include the Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go brands. What's at stake Amazon announced on Aug. 13 that Prime members in more than 1,000 cities and towns can now get free delivery on perishable groceries and any other items available for same-day delivery. Orders under the $25 minimum would incur a $2.99 fee. Amazon plans to expand to 2,300 markets by year-end, with further expansion slated for 2026. If available in your area, the new options will be served automatically to Prime members who are logged into Amazon's website. This enhanced service is different from the fresh food and grocery items already available from Whole Foods Market and other partners. The existing service fills orders at local stores that are then picked up and delivered by local drivers. That model is not going away. But some of that ordering, particularly smaller orders, could shift the new paradigm of fresh foods warehoused at same-day delivery fulfillment centers According to Buechel, Amazon's ability to roll out the new service at scale comes from expanding and retrofitting its existing same-day facilities or smaller, specialized sites designed to pick, pack, and sort in-demand items for rapid delivery to customers within a short driving radius. ""What we've done is extend upon our already existing infrastructure … adding in some specialized capabilities that will allow us to support perishable groceries,"" Buechel said. Those capabilities include creating a temperature-controlled environment to support product freshness of perishable groceries. Buechel also highlighted ""specialized training programs for our employees that are helping them support the cold-chain processes required in a perishable environment."" On the day of the announcement, Amazon stock rose more than 1% while delivery competitors like Instacart and DoorDash dropped 12.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Walmart , which has a major grocery presence, and pure-play grocer Kroger also slipped 2.3% and 4.2% that day. The market's initial reaction signaled Amazon's latest move could pose a competitive threat. However, early analysis from Wells Fargo and others suggests Amazon's ""share capture could be slow,"" pointing to ""points of friction,"" such as a limited assortment of fresh options, wide delivery windows that frustrate customers, and the need for continued investment to build out the service. Still, Buechel pointed to encouraging early adoption. He noted that 70% of customers who used the new service at its initial launches in Phoenix, Orlando, and Kansas City, Missouri, were first-time perishable buyers, and more than 20% returned within the first month to make additional purchases. ""It really showed us the unmet demand that we had with our customer base and that we as Amazon are a trusted partner for our customers in being able to deliver this offering,"" he said. Years in the making Amazon has been building toward this grocery expansion for years. Amazon Fresh debuted in 2007 in Washington state, promising delivery within a two-hour window. Over time, that offering has scaled to meet growing customer demand. Amazon Fresh launched brick-and-mortar locations starting in 2020, and currently has more than 60 stores, according to the company . In 2017, the company deepened its grocery footprint with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, bringing a trusted brick-and-mortar brand under its umbrella. Whole Foods stores currently are up to more than 535. When customers shop Amazon Fresh on Amazon's website, those orders are filled separately from the same-day delivery infrastructure, using grocery fulfillment centers or an Amazon Fresh store or a Whole Foods, depending on which is closer. Today, tens of millions of shoppers turn to Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods for their full range of grocery needs while also using Amazon's platform to shop local and specialty retailers. Amazon has become one of the largest grocers in the U.S., generating $100 billion in annual gross sales from groceries and household essentials. While those early moves laid the foundation for Amazon's grocery ambitions, it's the company's network of same-day fulfillment centers that have become the real engine of its rapid delivery strategy. These same-day fulfillment centers have ""really made a difference"" in Amazon's push to expand grocery delivery, said Marc Wulfraat, founder and president of MWPVL International, a specialized supply chain, logistics, and distribution consulting firm. Wulfraat estimates that roughly 76 same-day fulfillment centers have been retrofitted with coolers and freezers to enable the fresh groceries to be stored in the same locations as all the other same-day items. Wall Street analysis In its announcement, Amazon said it expanded its same-day delivery service to include ""thousands of fresh grocery items."" While thousands may sound like a lot, Wells Fargo said, ""Prime same-day grocery selection looks somewhat limited."" The analysts added, ""While Amazon is likely to expand its offering over time, it may initially struggle to become a regular grocery option for consumers without a broader basket."" Wells Fargo estimates grocery could be a drag on Amazon's operating income with each percentage point of U.S. market share potentially costing $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually due to thin margins. While crediting Amazon's logistics strength and Prime as competitive moats, the analysts said that grocery's ""margin profile"" and ""operational complexity"" warrant investor caution. Wells Fargo has an equal weight rating on Amazon and a price target of $245 per share on the stock. MoffettNathanson takes a similarly cautious view. They said the number of SKUs, or stock keeping units, ""falls well short of what the consumer ultimately needs, tens of thousands of items."" The analysts' grocery industry research shows that the average grocery store carries 32,000 items, underscoring ""Amazon's difficulty in strong-arming their way in"" the grocery market. The analysts stress that ""selection needs to increase by orders of magnitude. Otherwise, this remains a limited top-off use case."" MoffettNathanson has a buy rating on Amazon and a price target of $263. Amazon seems to recognize its initial same-day limitations, saying the new service is designed to ""complement Amazon's existing grocery delivery offerings — including Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and a variety of local grocery and specialty retailers on Amazon.com."" Bottom line We see the grocery expansion as a bold step given the industry's complexity and razor-thin margins, but meaningful disruption across the sector will take time to unfold. If any company can make such a power move, it is well-funded Amazon, which also boasts financially strong businesses in advertising and the cloud. For now, we view this as a long-term story with Amazon gradually pressuring traditional grocers as it refines its offerings and expands selection. We also have confidence in Amazon's decades of logistics and Whole Foods' expertise to give customers a one-stop shop, same-day solution for all their essential needs. We continue to maintain our buy-equivalent 1 rating on Amazon shares and a $250 price target. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AMZN. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

""Everything we're building -- from smarter tools to expanded fulfillment and global reach -- is designed to accelerate seller growth and empower sellers to serve customers while driving their businesses forward,"" Joneja said.

One new way Walmart Fulfillment Services is supporting its Marketplace sellers is by expanding next-day delivery coverage to more major metro areas, including Little Rock, Columbus, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, San Antonio and Orlando, Fla.

“We’ve long admired MDI and how, for over 90 years, they have supported independent grocers with essential expertise, infrastructure, and scale, so that they can thrive and grow. It’s a privilege to team up with MDI and their retailers to enhance the guest experience with the adoption of Instacart’s platform,” said Nick Nickitas, general manager of independent grocery and mid-market retail partnerships at Instacart.

“Together we’ll empower leading local grocers to deliver a seamless, flexible way to shop while preserving the local connection that sets them apart in the communities they serve.”

According to the release, Storefront Pro gives MDI’s independent retailers “advanced customization capabilities” and “robust control” over digital storefronts, including access to data and analytic tools powered by Instacart’s technology to help spot growth opportunities.

These grocers also get access to fulfillment technologies and new retail media capabilities through Instacart’s Carrot Ads.

Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has found the importance of data tools for grocers. It shows that more than 65% of grocery and retail merchants lack access to real-time supply chain data, even though more than 7 in 10 say such data is critical for business decisions, underscoring a significant operational blind spot.

“The lack of data readiness also impacts a retailer’s ability to innovate, expand their customer base and even manage their supply chains efficiently, leading to potential issues like excess inventory costs,” PYMNTS wrote earlier this year, adding that the research “emphasizes that becoming data-ready requires addressing both organizational silos and technical limitations to not only survive but thrive in an increasingly competitive market.”

Meanwhile, Instacart said earlier this month that its shoppers were ordering more often — and more carefully — as digital tools reshape how value is presented and perceived on the platform.

CEO Fidji Simo said the company is seeing “a meaningful shift in consumer behavior,” as order volume increased on weekdays and earlier in the day. “That’s very encouraging in terms of the utility we’re providing,” she told analysts on the earnings call.

“Consumers want to feel confident they’re getting good value,” Simo said. “And we’re helping our retail partners deliver that.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Instacart.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 16:14:54.261778

Blue Bell directed consumers to return affected ice cream to the place of purchase for a refund and offered consumer support at 979-836-7977 or consumerrelations@bluebell.com.","Several major food recalls of products sold at Walmart have been issued in August, with federal officials warning people not to consume the items sold in select stores across half the country.

The impacted products include salads, ice cream and potentially radioactive shrimp.

Why It Matters

Undeclared allergens and potential radioactive contamination pose different but serious public-health concerns. Allergens such as sesame, soy, almond, walnut and pecan can trigger anaphylaxis in susceptible people, and repeated exposure to low levels of cesium-137 can increase the risk of cancer.

What To Know

The following three products sold at select Walmart stores in 23 states have been recalled:

Taylor Farms Honey Balsamic Salad Kit

On August 26, Taylor Fresh Foods announced a voluntary recall of Taylor Farms Honey Balsamic Salad Kit 6/8.3oz because some kits contained Asian Sesame Ginger dressing instead of the intended Honey Balsamic Vinaigrette, introducing undeclared sesame and soy allergens.

The company said the affected packages had code dates beginning with ""TFRS"" and ""Best If Used By"" dates through September 4, 2025, and had been distributed to stores in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.

Newsweek emailed Taylor Farms for comment.

Blue Bell's Moo-llennium Crunch Ice Cream

On August 22, Blue Bell Creameries voluntarily recalled a limited number of Moo-llennium Crunch half-gallon cartons that were mistakenly packaged in Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cartons.

The company said the error introduced undeclared almond, walnut and pecan and that affected cartons bore code 061027524 on the lid. Blue Bell said the affected distribution covered Alabama, Arkansas, the Florida panhandle, northwest Georgia, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and southwest Virginia. Consumers were instructed to return the product for a full refund.

Newsweek emailed Blue Bell Creameries for comment.

Radioactive Shrimp Warning

On August 19, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised the public not to eat, sell or serve certain frozen shrimp imported from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati after authorities detected cesium-137 in shipping containers linked to products from the Indonesian company.

The FDA said multiple distributors and retailers removed or recalled product lots and that affected distributions included states such as Alabama, Georgia, Ohio and Texas.

The FDA placed the Indonesian firm on an import alert and coordinated with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and foreign regulators.

Manufacturers and retailers said they had removed or restricted sales of the affected lots and advised returns or disposal. The FDA said it would maintain heightened screening and had placed the Indonesian supplier on an import alert to block future shipments until compliance was verified. The agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection continued coordinating with Indonesian authorities to investigate the source of contamination.

What People Are Saying

A Walmart spokesperson previously told Newsweek regarding the shrimp: ""The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have issued a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores. We are working with the supplier to investigate.""

What Happens Next

Consumers who purchased the recalled Taylor Farms salad kits were advised to contact Taylor Farms' consumer line at 855-455-0098 for questions or obtain refunds at point of purchase.

Blue Bell directed consumers to return affected ice cream to the place of purchase for a refund and offered consumer support at 979-836-7977 or consumerrelations@bluebell.com.

For the shrimp advisory, the FDA recommended disposal of affected shrimp and consultation with a health-care provider if consumers believed they had been exposed to elevated levels of cesium; the agency said the levels detected in samples were below the Derived Intervention Level and unlikely to pose an acute hazard, but it cautioned that prolonged exposure could increase long‑term cancer risk.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2711297/walmart-logo.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 15:14:55.727922

StockStory’s Take

Agilent’s third quarter was shaped by robust demand in its pharmaceutical and chemicals and advanced materials end markets, which management cited as primary drivers behind the company’s double-digit revenue growth. CEO Padraig McDonnell highlighted that investments in semiconductor and chemical sectors, as well as strong adoption of the Infinity Tree LC platform and Pro IQ LCMS system, contributed to this momentum. Management also pointed to improved capital spending by customers and a gradual replacement cycle for aging lab instruments as factors supporting the quarter’s performance.

Looking ahead, Agilent’s outlook is underpinned by expectations of continued strong demand in pharma and advanced materials, as well as further traction for recently launched products. Management emphasized that upcoming investments in manufacturing capacity and commercial capabilities will support future growth, while efforts to mitigate tariff-related costs are ongoing. CFO Rodney Gonzalez noted that the company expects sequential margin improvement in the next quarter, supported by planned operational efficiencies and the full implementation of Agilent’s Ignite program.

Key Insights from Management’s Remarks

Management attributed the quarter’s growth to a combination of strong customer demand in key end markets, successful new product launches, and ongoing operational initiatives aimed at supporting scalability and resilience.

Pharma demand rebounded: Agilent saw 9% growth in its largest end market, pharmaceutical, driven by stronger downstream quality assurance and control (QAQC) activity and increased adoption of the Infinity Tree LC platform. Early adopters returned for larger purchases, indicating customer satisfaction with product performance.

Chemicals and advanced materials strength: The chemicals and advanced materials segment grew 10%, with management citing increased capital investment in the sector and robust demand from semiconductor and energy customers. The broad uptake of Agilent’s GC and GCMS platforms was a key contributor.

Product innovation impact: The Pro IQ LCMS system outperformed launch forecasts, winning major accounts in the pharmaceutical industry and expanding application possibilities. The newly launched DACO OMDAS platform broadened Agilent’s reach in automated pathology, helping to capture new market segments.

Geographic expansion and market diversity: Asia (excluding China) and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) delivered strong growth, with India standing out due to local manufacturing investments and safety regulations. China’s results were stable, and management expects further improvement with anticipated government stimulus.

Operational efficiency and tariff management: The Ignite enterprise operating model enabled cost savings through streamlined management and procurement. However, higher tariff expenses and increased commercial investment impacted margins, with management focused on mitigating these costs through supply chain adjustments and targeted pricing actions.

Drivers of Future Performance

Agilent expects continued momentum from pharma and advanced materials, with key risks stemming from tariffs and cost pressures impacting margins.

Tariff mitigation and margin recovery: Management believes that the full benefits of tariff mitigation will materialize next year, as supply chain shifts and pricing adjustments take effect. The Ignite program is expected to further drive operational efficiencies and support margin expansion.

Commercial investment and product launches: Agilent is increasing its investment in commercial capabilities and rolling out new products like the Infinity Tree LC and Pro IQ LCMS systems. Management expects these initiatives to drive market share gains and support revenue growth from both replacement cycles and new applications.

End-market variability and macroeconomic risks: While management anticipates continued strong demand in key end markets, they acknowledged that capital spending trends in biopharma, government funding in academia, and changes in environmental regulations could introduce variability. The company’s outlook assumes only modest improvement in these areas, with greater upside possible if macroeconomic conditions stabilize.

Catalysts in Upcoming Quarters

In coming quarters, the StockStory analyst team will monitor (1) the pace of margin recovery as tariff mitigation and operational efficiencies scale, (2) sustained demand and replacement cycles in pharma and chemicals, and (3) the adoption and revenue contribution of new products like Infinity Tree LC and Pro IQ LCMS. Updates on government stimulus in China and trends in customer capital spending will also be important indicators of Agilent’s ability to maintain its current growth trajectory.

Agilent currently trades at $122.47, up from $118.71 just before the earnings. In the wake of this quarter, is it a buy or sell? Find out in our full research report (it’s free).

The 160,000 square foot site will focus specifically on the domestic production of advanced medicines.

The investment is expected to create approximately 120 jobs in North Carolina over the next ten years. The facility is set to employ over 500 people when fully operational and the firm will recruit 5,000 construction staff. This comes after news of the company’s recent $55 billion pledge to US domestic drug manufacturing this past March over a four-year period.

“Johnson & Johnson has more manufacturing facilities in the US than in any other country, and we continue to strengthen our presence here,” commented J&J chairman and CEO Joaquin Duato. “We continue to expand our investment in the US.”

The $2 billion pledged to the CDMO division of Fujifilm site of North Carolina will prioritize research and development specialist therapies in such as oncology, neuroscience, immunology and even robotic surgery.

In an interview with BioProcess Insider, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina Christopher Chung commented that “Johnson & Johnson’s decision to invest $2 billion in a new biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Holly Springs, along with its new biologics facility now underway in Wilson, reinforces North Carolina’s statewide role as one of the nation’s leading pharmaceutical manufacturing hubs.”

In March, as part of its first step of the $55 billion pledge, J&J broke ground on its 500,000 square foot biologics facility, also in North Carolina, emphasizing in its press release the importance of a US domestic footprint for drugs manufacturing. The announcement referred to ‘America,’ ‘Americans,’ or the ‘US’ over 16 times, and was well received by the US administration, with the White House’s rapid response X account colloquially calling the move the ‘TRUMP EFFECT.’

It’s no surprise that several large pharmaceutical companies, including J&J , Hikma Pharmaceuticals, and Biogen, have decided to bolster US investment and manufacturing efforts as Trump tariffs loom over and threaten international drug supply lines.

However, not all incentives to move production to the US has been punitive. recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it’s ‘PreCheck’ program to supercharge applications for domestic drug manufacturing sites.

J&J recently shared that its motivation for bolstering US production is due positive tax initiatives, rather than fear of expensive imports from foreign nations.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt0a48a1f3edca9eb0/bltd738907c3c69df9b/68b082524503c38a77fa0069/Depositphotos_387469256_L.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-28 16:15:16.501959

This marks Dollar Tree’s first major delivery initiative since partnering with Instacart in 2021. Dollar General joined the Uber Eats platform earlier this year.

The company now expects second-quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to decline by as much as 45% to 50% compared to the same quarter last year.

First-quarter revenue rose about 11.3% to $4.64 billion, driven partly by net same-store sales gains of 5.4%. This included a 6.4% gain in consumables and a 4.6% gain in discretionary product sales.

Anthropic wrote in its post that the joint evaluation exercise was meant to help mature the field of alignment evaluations and “establish production-ready best practices.”

Reporting the findings of its evaluations, Anthropic said OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini reasoning models were aligned as well or better than its own models overall, the GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 general-purpose models showed some examples of “concerning behavior,” especially around misuse, and both companies’ models struggled to some degree with sycophancy.

OpenAI wrote in its post that it found that Anthropic’s Claude 4 models generally performed well on evaluations stress-testing their ability to respect the instruction hierarchy, performed less well on jailbreaking evaluations that focused on trained-in safeguards, generally proved to be aware of their uncertainty and avoided making statements that were inaccurate, and performed especially well or especially poorly on scheming evaluation, depending on the subset of testing.

A Real (Instrument) Cluster F*** Believe it or not, the issue here has nothing to do with reversing cameras, a welcome change of pace.
Instead, many of Ford’s biggest pickups are having a problem with their instrument cluster displays.
Trucks affected by this action are from the 2025 and ’26 model years.
Up to 355,656 trucks could have this defect, and it’s estimated 100 percent of those rigs have the instrument panel issue.","Another day, another Ford recall. Even though it’s made good progress in some areas, notably the recent J.D. Power Initial Quality Study, this Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has had a rough few years when it comes to quality. And now, Ford just posted another huge recall, one that affects its money-making trucks.

A Real (Instrument) Cluster F***

Believe it or not, the issue here has nothing to do with reversing cameras, a welcome change of pace. Instead, many of Ford’s biggest pickups are having a problem with their instrument cluster displays. According to a recall notice posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), these screens may not show critical information like warning lights and even the vehicle’s speed, an obvious – and glaring – safety issue.

This recall applies to the F-150 “light-duty” pickup as well as Ford’s Super Duty models, including the F-250, F-350, F-450 and hulking F-550 models. Trucks affected by this action are from the 2025 and ’26 model years.

That’s a lot of different nameplates with this problem, and the vehicle total is even more concerning. Up to 355,656 trucks could have this defect, and it’s estimated 100 percent of those rigs have the instrument panel issue. Oftentimes, automakers will recall thousands, even hundreds of thousands of vehicles, but only a small percentage of those products will have a given defect. In this case, it seems all those trucks are affected.

Fortunately, The Fix Is Simple

Fortunately, the fix for this glaring issue is relatively simple. Ford will push out a free over-the-air software update to affected trucks, which should correct the problem. Of course, if you’d rather have professional help, you can always take your vehicle to a dealership.

The automaker will begin mailing out formal recall notices on September 2, so keep an eye on your mailbox if you’ve got an affected pickup, oh, and be careful out there, especially if your truck’s instrument cluster is acting up.",https://static1.hotcarsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-ford-f-150.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-28 17:17:53.667321

In fact, Ghingo said Jennie-O ground turkey business has been up 13% during the latest 13 weeks.

“We have recovered the margin we needed to, and the reason we’re able to do that is because of the strong product quality, the brand investments we’ve made, and overall execution behind the business,” he said.

Over the course of this year so far, the company has reported several significant milestones as its growth continues. Here are some the biggest stories out of Abbott’s medical device business so far in 2025:

5. Abbott launches next-gen MitraClip, TriClip G5 systems

Earlier this month, Sandra Lesenfants, SVP of Abbott’s Structural Heart Division, announced the availability of the company’s next-generation MitraClip and TriClip G5 systems on LinkedIn.

The launch came about a month after Abbott announced a significant Medicare victory for TriClip. The company said that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a National Coverage Determination (NCD) and coverage conditions for tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER) for tricuspid regurgitation (TR). That included the TriClip TEER system.

TriClip offers an option for those who aren’t good candidates for surgery and continue to have symptoms or persistent TR despite treatment with medical therapy. Delivered through a vein in the leg, the TriClip TEER technology clips together a portion of leaflets. It repairs the tricuspid valve and helps blood flow in the right direction without the need for open-heart surgery.

MitraClip, meanwhile, offers the percutaneous reduction of significant symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR).

4. Abbott launches next-gen delivery system for Proclaim DRG neurostim

In April, Abbott began the rollout of a next-generation delivery system for its neuromodulation business.

The company plans to use this system to streamline implantation for electrodes use with its Proclaim DRG neurostimulation system. It designed its new system to streamline the procedure when doctors implant them in patients suffering from complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) Type 1 and causalgia (CRPS Type 2) of the lower extremities.

Proclaim DRG targets and stimulates the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cluster of nerve cells found along the spine. This cluster controls pain signals from specific areas of the body, including the pelvis, groin, hip, knee, ankle and foot. Proclaim DRG is the first and only DRG technology approved to treat CRPS of the lower limbs, Abbott said in a news release. It also picked up expanded MRI labeling in January 2024.

The delivery system enables physicians to carefully navigate and access the precise anatomy of the DRG when placing the electrodes. Abbott designed the next-generation system for ease of use with enhanced durability and maneuverability, streamlining implantations.

3. FDA approves Abbott mitral valve replacement device that doesn’t require open-heart surgery

The FDA in May granted approval for Tendyne, Abbott’s transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) system.

The TMVR system offers an option for patients with mitral valves that fail to function properly due to severe mitral annular calcification (MAC). MAC stiffens the annulus ring-like structure that supports the mitral valve. This can lead to mitral regurgitation or stenosis, disrupting the heart’s ability to effectively pump blood.

Some patients with severe MAC at high risk for open-heart surgery can’t have their valve repaired with MitraClip. For this population, Tendyne delivers an alternative, minimally invasive way to replace the leaky (mitral regurgitation) or narrowed (stenosis) valve.

Abbott said Tendyne’s unique, innovative design and availability in multiple sizes allows it to adapt to a range of patient anatomies. Delivered through a small incision in the chest, the self-expanding valve replaces the mitral valve. It remains fully repositionable and retrievable during implantation, too.

2. Abbott wins CE Mark for Volt PFA system to treat atrial fibrillation, begins EU rollout

Pulsed field ablation for treating AFib is a hot space, and Abbott joined the European market in March with regulatory clearance for its Volt system. Approval added them to the market that features platforms from Boston Scientific, Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson MedTech.

The company has already begun commercial PFA cases with physicians who previously gained experience with the Volt system from Abbott’s PFA clinical trials. Abbott plans to expand the system’s availability to additional EU markets in the second half of 2025.

Volt integrates with Abbott’s EnSite X EP system and is designed to improve workflows by allowing mapping, pacing and ablation with a single catheter. The company said it has enhanced visualization and real-time contact assessment to optimize catheter positioning.

The Volt system’s balloon-in-basket catheter design is meant to efficiently deliver energy directly to targeted tissue, reducing the number of therapy applications required during ablation. It also provides greater procedural flexibility, allowing physicians to perform procedures with light sedation or general anesthesia.

1. Abbott is making an IVL play with FDA IDE nod

In March, Abbott announced that it received FDA investigational device exemption (IDE) approval for its coronary intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) system. With this, it launched its own bid to take share of the potentially competitive IVL market.

Johnson & Johnson currently leads the way after its 2024 acquisition of IVL leader Shockwave Medical. Boston Scientific entered the space this year, agreeing to buy Bolt Medical in January. Other companies, such as FastWave Medical, Vantis Vascular and Amplitude Vascular are making waves in IVL, too.

The current approaches for clearing calcified arterial blockages include cutting balloons and atherectomy technology. IVL, meanwhile, fractures the calcium within the artery wall. This potentially allows for vessel expansion and better stent placement. Abbott’s investigational system utilizes high-energy sound pressure waves to treat calcium blockages prior to placing a stent to achieve this.

Abbott said its investigational IVL technology builds upon its existing vascular portfolio. It aims to address the challenges of currently available IVL systems.

ID23,J&J,2025-08-28 17:02:22+00:00,The Athletic,"Michael Johnson's Grand Slam Track: $19m shortfall, unpaid athletes and a lost backer",Adam Crafton,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6577959/2025/08/28/michael-johnson-grand-slam-track-investment/,"They said: “Winners Alliance and Grand Slam Track continue to work together to recapitalize the company.
For track athletes, this treatment was out of the norm.
According to people familiar with the discussions, a term sheet was signed by GST and Eldridge on March 18.
Patrick Magyar, the founder of the Diamond League, described GST as “Grand Flop Track” in a scathing post on LinkedIn.
Under the terms of their contracts with GST, athletes would not be paid until they passed the drug-testing protocol — a 21-day process — with a further 10 days of leeway for the payments to be made.","According to Michael Johnson, the four-time Olympic gold medallist and eight-time world champion, Grand Slam Track (GST) was going to revolutionize his sport and see athletes treated as “true professionals.”

The track league launched in April this year after claiming in a press release in September 2024 that GST had “secured $30 million in financial commitments from investors and strategic partners.”

Yet almost five months after GST’s opening meet in Jamaica, the project appears to be on life support. GST did not complete its first season, announcing on June 12 that it would cancel its fourth and final meet in Los Angeles, previously scheduled for the end of that month. Had the money run out?

Competing athletes, 28 of whom were medallists at the Paris Olympics, are owed millions of dollars in promotional fees and prize money. The league has missed a series of self-imposed deadlines, so far paying out only athlete promotional fees from the first meet in Kingston, but not the $3.2m prize money from that event.

This has left some agents fearing their clients will never receive their money, while others consider legal action. Based on the prize pot formula on GST’s website, Paris gold medallists Gabby Thomas and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone are owed $180,000 and $250,000 in prize money alone respectively, while Melissa Jefferson-Wooden is owed $300,000. On the men’s side, Kenny Bednarek is owed $300,000 while Josh Kerr is waiting for more than $160,000. This is all before appearance fees.

“Everybody’s patience is wearing thin,” Paul Doyle, a prominent agent with more than a dozen athletes who competed in GST, tells The Athletic. Facilities and vendors, including the sport’s governing body World Athletics, are also awaiting overdue payments, while several high-ranking GST staff members were laid off in June and those who remained had their pay cut by 15 per cent.

Johnson, GST’s commissioner and CEO, who became a trusted and authoritative voice of track and field via his punditry on the UK’s public service broadcaster the BBC, is now scrambling to salvage his league and his reputation.

There are questions, too, for GST’s “lead investor”, Winners Alliance, the investment group described on its website as a “for-profit affiliate of the Professional Tennis Players Association” (PTPA), which had previously been co-founded by Novak Djokovic, and whose board is chaired by billionaire Bill Ackman. Its stated mission is to “equip world-class athlete groups with the resources needed to protect and maximize their collective rights” — in short, to help make athletes more money.

The Athletic can also reveal for the first time that Eldridge — a $70 billion asset management company chaired by Todd Boehly, chairman and part-owner of Chelsea in the Premier League, and a part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Lakers — were at one point lined up to invest in GST.

The Athletic has spoken to numerous sources familiar with the workings of GST, some of whom asked to remain anonymous when divulging sensitive information. Our investigation reveals:

Despite GST claiming in a press release in June 2024 it had “secured” over $30 million in “financial commitments”, sources close to the league now concede they had, at that stage, received only $13 million, with lead investors Winners Alliance having an option — but not an obligation — to advance a further $19 million.

By the time of GST’s debut meet in Kingston in April 2025, the league did not, at that stage, have access to the $30 million-plus it claimed publicly to have secured.

It did have a signed term sheet with Eldridge which, if completed, would have seen the fund close a deal “on or around April 1” to invest a further $30 million in initial funding and an additional $10 million later in 2025. However, this did not complete on time and, after Eldridge officials attended the underwhelming debut meet in Kingston, the fund informed GST it would not be investing in the league.

Athletes were kept in the dark about the drop in funds until June and continued to compete.

Athletes were first told the payment delays were due to drug-testing protocols, before Johnson told agents in the middle of June that unspecified proposed investors had gone cold following President Trump’s tariff announcements and instability to the world economy. People close to Eldridge deny this was their motivation for not advancing, citing instead concerns with the GST business model relayed before and after the Jamaica meet.

GST gave serious internal consideration to cancelling the meet at Franklin Field in Philadelphia on May 31 and June 1 but opted to proceed.

Following the cancellation of the Los Angeles meet, GST insisted the league will return for a second season, but Johnson is still to attract investment to cover debts in excess of $14 million.

In a joint statement issued to The Athletic, both GST and Winners Alliance insisted the league has a future. They said: “Winners Alliance and Grand Slam Track continue to work together to recapitalize the company. We remain steadfast in our commitment to bringing in new investment partners who appreciate the opportunity and promise that Grand Slam Track’s first season presents.”

Last summer, Johnson and his team signed up 48 of the best track athletes on the planet — split equally across men and women — to compete in Grand Slam Track. Johnson’s thesis was that track can feel irrelevant outside of its prime windows of the Olympic Games and World Championships, telling The Athletic in April how he had been out for dinner in Los Angeles but nobody had appeared to recognise U.S. Olympic champions Vernon Norwood or Rai Benjamin.

The meets saw participants run two races at every meet. Their combined score then gave a total Slam placing, which decided the prize: $100,000 (£74,893) for a first-place finish down to $10,000 (£7,489) for eighth place. Athletes also received support services, base compensation for participating and access to a content team.

On top of the racers, there were 48 challengers, who were invitees. They competed in the hope of becoming fully signed-on racers next season. They, too, expected to have travel and reasonable expenses covered, plus a $2,000 appearance fee. The eighth-place $10,000 cash prize meant they would win a minimum of $12,000 (£8,987) per meet. As agent Doyle says: “It’s athletes who are not the high earners that are going to suffer the most.”

The $12.6m prize pot across four meets made for a bigger purse per event than the invitational Diamond League, which this season will pay $18 million to athletes, including promotional fees, across 14 meetings.

The VIP treatment for athletes began in October 2024, when GST flew out signed-up racers and their plus ones to Malibu, where Johnson lives, for content creation, an all-expenses-paid social, and a trip to SoFi stadium in the corporate suites to watch the LA Rams beat the Minnesota Vikings. For track athletes, this treatment was out of the norm.

“Do I believe a four-meet Grand Slam series is capable of covering a $30 million expense? Absolutely,” says Doyle. “But it’s not going to happen overnight. My big concern, which I expressed to Michael, was what happens if you spend this $30 million and only recoup a million? Is that going to be a problem? He said: ‘No, my investors are here for the long haul, they see the big picture, they understand what this can be.'”

The problem, though, is it appears that GST never “secured” $30 million. Following substantial questions this week from The Athletic, people close to both GST and Winners say the initial investment, wired in April 2024, was for only $13 million. This also included the option for Winners to put up an extra $19 million, but this was conditional on GST’s operational and investor progress.

There was a belief on Johnson’s part that Winners, which has a track record of protecting athletes, might step in should it be necessary particularly as Winners had representation on the GST board. Yet Winners, which was not only the lead investor but the de facto operating partner in GST, insists it had no commitment — only an option.

By last November, Johnson had been informed Winners did not intend to take up that option for a further $19 million. Given $12.6 million had been publicly pledged as prize money — not to mention appearance fees — this created an obvious shortfall. Johnson had raised a relatively small additional amount from personal wealth, family and friends, but nowhere near enough to cover the season.

GST and Winners needed outside help. They hired PJT Partners, the New York City-based investment bank, to lead the search as GST went back to the market.

With the season due to start in the first weekend of April, attempts to raise cash ramped up in January and February. An executive at one fund approached by PJT told The Athletic they were spooked by the timeline, concerned that a league planning to launch so soon appeared to need so much cash.

PJT approached funds across the United States with a 10-page pitch deck, seen by The Athletic. It claimed 2.5billion people globally are interested in participating, following or attending track and field events, while saying GST planned to have more than four Slams in future seasons and lauding “the highest ever combined prize pool for track.” The deck hailed racers who had already been signed up; including Thomas, McLaughlin-Levrone and Kerr. All three were signed up to GST as ambassadors as well as competitors.

Discussions began with Eldridge, and Jeff Wilbur, a partner and head of sports and entertainment at Boehly’s firm, took the lead.

According to people familiar with the discussions, a term sheet was signed by GST and Eldridge on March 18. The document said that the investors “shall fund $30 million at the initial closing, which shall take place on or about April 1, 2025, with the remaining $10 million to be funded in Q4 2025.”

This money would have seen the league through its debut season and contributed to the second year. With the Jamaica meet scheduled for April 4, the hope was to complete the deal three days before the first meet began. Yet the term sheet, seen by The Athletic, was preliminary and non-binding, intended for discussion purposes only. It did not represent a legal commitment; simply the terms that Eldridge were prepared to consider.

GST’s optimism is understandable but people close to Eldridge reject the notion they pulled out; rather they argue any deal at term-sheet stage remained subject to business and financial diligence, legal and regulatory checks, and a continual assessment of the viability of the business. Eldridge representatives had flown to Los Angeles for meetings with Johnson and his team and they liked his vision, which is why they demonstrated their seriousness by signing a term sheet, but sources insist they maintained some concerns, which they say they relayed, about the viability of the business.

Their caution centred on GST’s dependence on event-day income — Eldridge were under the impression this would account for 75 per cent of its first two years of revenue. As such, it told GST at least a week before Jamaica they wished to see the debut event in person. Ticket sales had been slow, but Eldridge was told Jamaica was notorious as a late-buying market.

As the Eldridge talks continued, Winners provided a further $4m, this time as a loan, in the hope it would be paid back when or if the Eldridge deal completed. This money was needed to enable the league to continue operating.

Eldridge officials attended the meet at Kingston and then everything changed. Eldridge did not complete — catapulting GST into financial chaos. GST did not immediately tell athletes or agents. Only later in the summer, following the cancellation in LA, did Johnson say investors had reduced their commitments due to investor confidence being shaken by global uncertainty the economy experienced in March and April. This coincided with the period in which tariffs were imposed by the Trump administration.

Eldridge sources insist the reason they did not advance the deal was unrelated to tariffs, arguing that the sports economy is reasonably insulated from shudders elsewhere in the global economy.

The first event in Kingston did not meet expectations, either external or internal. GST said they sold 27,514 tickets over the three-day meet, averaging over 9,000 per day, yet the stands looked more sparse than that and Johnson claimed he had been surprised by no-shows.

As a television experience, broadcast by CW Network and NBC’s streaming platform Peacock in the U.S., the content was at times clunky. Some agents believed there was too much downtime between races and fed this back to the league. Patrick Magyar, the founder of the Diamond League, described GST as “Grand Flop Track” in a scathing post on LinkedIn. “An atmosphere closer to a mausoleum than a laboratory of innovation,” Magyar said.

Within days, a call came from Eldridge: they would not follow through.

After Jamaica, GST had a choice: they could postpone the league until further investment arrived — or Johnson could roll the dice again, hoping that by proving the concept, investment would follow. GST chose to continue.

Some who attended Kingston liked the product. Athletes enjoyed the business-class travel and their experience. The league’s hydration partner Drip Water laid on a red-carpet style entrance, which appealed to racers eager to grow their individual brands.

Agent Doyle says: “There were shoe company execs going to the meets and saying, ‘Oh, man, this is the future of the sport. This is it. This is awesome.'”

Yet athletes had no idea about GST’s impending financial doom. Under the terms of their contracts with GST, athletes would not be paid until they passed the drug-testing protocol — a 21-day process — with a further 10 days of leeway for the payments to be made. The second meet in Miami was within this window, meaning payments for the first meet were only expected shortly after that event. While 48 racers were signed up for the initial four events, some challengers were signed up between meets.

Agent Ray Flynn, who represents Kerr and is broadly supportive of GST, says: “We do not sit there as agents constantly checking if a company or a league has its money in place; we enter leagues in good faith and we trust the people we work with.

“We are not privy to the ins and outs of their arrangements. It would be naive if they have gone into arrangements without firm and binding contracts.”

In Miami, which sold out on two days, cost-cutting attempts were made. Staff were asked not to rack up additional hotel fees by renting conference rooms. Some staff were moved to cheaper hotels rather than staying in AirBnBs. The budget in Miami was also stretched by the cost of shuttles to and from the Miramar track to the hotel, as ride-share prices rocketed due to the event taking place on the same weekend as the Miami Grand Prix.

The Jamaica meet took place on the first weekend of April and by the time of the Philadelphia meet, over the last weekend of May, some agents realised payments were late. GST initially blamed it on delays with the drug-testing process.

The league’s CEO, Steve Gera, frequently took new investor calls and minor cash injections follow, but not enough to move the needle.

The league had burned through much of its cash. GST sources say the $18m it received was spent on ambassadorial fees to the small number of racers who took on that status, but also start-up costs to build the league, staffing costs, production, marketing and branding.

Some of those familiar with GST question if the budget management was as prudent as it ought to have been. The league did not, for example, hire an in-house finance director or CFO.

“Nobody wanted to ever be the person to say no to something,” says a source familiar with how GST works. “It needed someone at VP (vice president) level handling finances.” Instead, this person says daily items often crossed the desk of the league’s human resources lead. GST denies this, saying that Winners Alliance doubled up as an operating partner and that the fund’s CFO Vivek Khanna provided this function to GST.

In the middle of June, GST gave serious consideration to pulling the third leg of the season in Philadelphia. Johnson and Gera admitted to staff that funding was an issue and only 10 days out from the event, GST were still considering whether to go ahead.

Front Office Sports first reported that Robert Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners and a board member of GST, stepped in to help to fund the Philly meet, which was the most successful in terms of attendance, to go ahead. The event was reduced from three days to two days, while eliminating the 5,000 meters race, reducing the payday for distance runners. The Philadelphia meet cost half of what was spent in Kingston.

Agent Doyle says his first concern came when he stopped receiving replies from GST while attempting to secure his clients challenger places for the LA meet. He says: “For one race, they only had seven athletes and didn’t fill it with another challenger. They said, ‘Why bother putting somebody in that’s going to finish last place — it doesn’t bring much to meet and it costs us $10,000 in prize money?'”

On June 12, GST cancelled the season finale in LA. This had been promoted as taking place at Drake Stadium at UCLA, and tickets were on sale, but UCLA confirmed to The Athletic that despite over nine months of planning and talks, an agreement was not secured to host GST at the venue by May 2025. “It was Grand Slam Track’s focus on delivering the three preceding meets and then reductions in the fourth event’s layout and scope that were largely responsible,” said UCLA Recreation.

Negotiations also took place to move the final meet to the cheaper Mt. San Antonio College, before deciding it could not go ahead at all.

Johnson organised a call with athletes and their agents, as well as a subsequent call solely with agents. He committed not only to paying all monies owed to athletes from the three meets that did take place, but also the fourth LA meet.

A payment plan to recompense athletes was created: the Kingston prize money was supposed to be paid by the end of July and all remaining payments by the close of September. Yet July came and went without payment and no more money has yet landed.

GST published a statement on Instagram last week, in which Johnson admitted they have not met their dated timelines. “We saw circumstances change in ways beyond our control,” he said, adding that he has spent recent weeks meeting with “excited investors.”

For athletes, there are “massive consequences”, Doyle says. “Take a guy like Eric Edwards (who thought he had won $20,000 in Philadelphia). When he came out of college, he had no shoe sponsor, I was helping him to pay rent. This was his opportunity to emerge and get out of debt and make a move in the sport. If he doesn’t get paid, it’s a massive detriment.

“Or Jacory Patterson, who was working at UPS, ran really well and got second place in Miami. That was $50,000. He said, ‘Well, maybe I can quit my job now.'”

Athlete sentiment is split. Thomas recently replied to a GST post on social media by saying: “So dope! Pls pay me.” Grant Fisher said at the end of July that athletes were becoming “pretty upset.” Others, such as Kerr, have taken a more patient approach, acknowledging slow payments in other sports.

“You’ve got a big mixed bag,” Doyle says. “Some agents are out for blood and want to take legal action immediately. Others are saying ‘Hey, let’s give them an opportunity and see.’ And others are saying ‘They tried, let’s see if there’s a way we can support them and get this thing to continue.”

Flynn says: “At this stage, I do not believe it would serve us well as representatives to make threatening claims or statements. Michael has kept up his channels of communications and insists the payments will be made. I hope and trust that will be the case.”

Multiple contractors have also told The Athletic they have not been paid, while the city of Miramar is still owed $77,896 in rental fees for the use of the Ansin Sports Complex in Miami. These were meant to be paid in two tranches in April and June, according to the agreement, which has been seen by The Athletic via a public record request. The city declined to comment, while the University of Pennsylvania also did not respond when asked if GST has paid up for its use of Franklin Field in Philadelphia.

The Athletic contacted GST’s three sponsors — track company Rekortan, water firm Drip and pet food company Nulo — all of whom did not respond when asked if they are standing by GST or if any rebate or reduction in sponsorship money has been requested or paid.

Kerr’s agent Flynn says: “It’s important to be balanced. Grand Slam Track is not the first or the only event late with payments. We are still waiting for payments from the World Athletics Indoor Championships in China as far back as March. Where this is different is we know World Athletics will pay in the end because they have a track record. That is what we are waiting to see now with GST, because we have been told payments are coming. GST has received a lot more attention and scrutiny than other events who have been late previously, which may be because there were parts of the athletics establishment who saw a challenge.”

In a statement to The Athletic, World Athletics said: “World Athletics and the Chinese Athletics Federation have been chasing the Local Organising Committee (who provide the prize money) following a longer than expected internal audit of the event required by authorities in China. We are frustrated by the delay in payments but the funds were received last week and transfer payments are now being made to athletes.”

Within athletics, the rise of GST sat uneasily. World Athletics provided a permit for the league to begin and its president Sebastian Coe said the league would add “lustre” to the sport. Yet many within the sport felt Johnson talked them down in order to build up GST.

“He set himself up as the sport’s saviour,” says one agent. “But the sport did not need saving.”

Doyle says: “Feelings were hurt. Maybe there were people against Grand Slam who wanted to see it fail. I don’t think those people truly had the interest of the sport at heart. If they’re successful, that creates more opportunity for other events to grow.”

World Athletics say it is owed a five-figure fee from GST for “granting them rights to World Ranking Points as well as licensed statistics and data.”

The governing body added: “If GST wishes to apply to be part of the global calendar in the future, it will need to honour its 2025 obligations to athletes first.”

In the event GST settle their debts and return for another season, Flynn says he would likely be looking for next season’s fees to be paid in advance or secured in escrow, to avoid any repeat.

For now, athletes just hope Johnson delivers. Doyle says: “It’s a lot easier going into an investor room when you’re the legend Michael Johnson. Everyone still talks about the golden shoes. Had this been somebody else, there’d be zero faith that it would continue. But since it’s Michael, there’s some faith he can pull it off.”

Johnson & Johnson’s Abiomed is advising customers to remove certain automated controllers for its Impella heart pumps from where they are used or sold after one death was linked to an issue with the devices, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday.

The automated Impella controllers recommended for removal have a pump driver circuit assembly that does not meet current specifications, according to the FDA’s early alert.

The assemblies contain 25v-rated tantalum capacitors instead of 35v-rated tantalum capacitors. The difference may lead to decreased pump performance or the pump stopping and triggering an “Impella Failure” or “Impella Stopped. Controller Failure” alarm, with the potential for loss of circulatory support or death, the FDA said.

As of Aug. 12, Abiomed reported one death and no serious injuries associated with the problem. The FDA communicated the information as part of its pilot program for providing early alerts about potentially high-risk issues.

Abiomed sent an Aug. 20 letter to all affected customers recommending they quarantine and do not use the products. Customers were advised to contact the company to initiate a remediation process.

“Johnson & Johnson MedTech is initiating a voluntary recall (removal) of 69 Automated Impella Controllers (AIC) after identifying a capacitor failure that, in rare cases, may lead to decreased pump performance or pump stop,” a J&J spokesperson said in a statement emailed to MedTech Dive.

J&J said a review of complaints from January 2011 to June 2025 showed a 0.006% occurrence rate, with one complaint reporting a patient death.

Dive Brief:

Walmart's U.S. store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped nearly 50% last quarter amid the retailer's ongoing push to accelerate shipping speeds, EVP and CFO John David Rainey said on an earnings call last week.

About one-third of deliveries from stores in recent weeks arrived in three hours or less, with 20% of that portion arriving to customers in 30 minutes or less, according to Rainey.

""We see billions and billions of units at a high growth rate being delivered same day and within same day from our store deliveries,"" Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner said on the call.

Dive Insight:

Faster deliveries leveraging stores have been a priority for Walmart amid deepening competition with Amazon, another company working to accelerate shipping speeds. Rainey said in a follow-up investor call last week that the push is worth it, as quick deliveries lead to more frequent orders from shoppers.

""As they realize that they can get those things that they want and need right away, we see that repeat purchasing behavior, which makes the share gains that we have very sticky,"" Rainey said.

Technological progress will also strengthen the consumer delivery experience, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said on the earnings call. For example, tapping more into artificial intelligence could help the company boost the accuracy of its ""dynamic delivery windows,"" which it will offer to 95% of U.S. households by the end of the year. Walmart's dynamic delivery algorithm analyzes local conditions to determine the most efficient driver routes and the estimated time of arrival for an order.

""One of the things that we've obviously got is a ton of data and it's not just product catalog data these days, it's delivery data,"" McMillon said. ""It's real-time data. And the way that we can put that to work to understand the context in which someone's shopping is really exciting to think about.""

The dynamic delivery window expansion aligns with Walmart's aim to reach 95% of the country in under three hours by the year's end.

Insight Into Margins & Costs of FIVE

Adjusted gross profit grew 26.2% year over year to $343.3 million. We note that the adjusted gross margin increased approximately 60 basis points (bps) year over year to 33.4%, which beat our estimate of 32.6%. This is primarily reflecting fixed cost leverage from strong comparable sales, partially offset by the net impact of tariffs.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs rose 28.3% to $242.3 million. SG&A costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased approximately 90 bps to 23.6%. We estimated SG&A costs to rise 24.7% year over year for the quarter under review.

Adjusted operating income was $55.1 million compared with $37 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The adjusted operating margin increased approximately 90 bps to 5.4%.

Five Below’s Financial Snapshot: Cash & Equity Overview

The company ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $562.7 million, and short-term investment securities of $107.4 million. Total shareholders’ equity was $1.91 billion as of Aug. 2, 2025.

FIVE Provides Q2 Store Update

The company opened 32 net new stores and ended the quarter with 1,858 stores across 44 states. This represents an 11.5% increase in the number of stores from the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

The company plans to open 150 stores by the end of fiscal 2025, taking the total count to 1,921 stores.

What Lies Forward in Q3 for Five Below?

FIVE provided its financial expectations for the third quarter and fiscal 2025, incorporating the anticipated effects of currently imposed tariffs. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company anticipates net sales between $950 million and $970 million, whereas it reported $843.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This projection is based on the planned opening of 50 net new stores and indicates a 5-7% increase in comparable sales.

At the midpoint, adjusted operating margin is projected to be 1% compared with 3.3% in the third quarter of last year. This decline reflects pressures in both gross margin and SG&A. Within gross margin, the company anticipates roughly 160 basis points of unmitigated tariff-related costs, partially offset by fixed cost leverage.

SG&A expenses are expected to be about 100 basis points higher than last year, mainly due to higher incentive compensation and increased investments in store labor, including support for additional physical inventory counts.

Net income is expected to fall between $5 million and $12 million, while adjusted net income is projected to be between $7 million and $13 million. Net income and adjusted net income were $1.7 million and $23.3 million, respectively, in the year-ago period.

Earnings per share are expected to be 9-21 cents, whereas it reported 3 cents in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be 12-24 cents, whereas it reported 42 cents in the year-ago period. These projections do not take into account any potential share repurchases.

Five Below’s FY25 Outlook

The company updated its financial outlook for fiscal 2025, reflecting improved expectations in several key areas. Net sales are projected to be $4.44-$4.52 billion, an upward revision from the earlier stated $4.33-$4.42 billion. In fiscal 2024, the company reported net sales of $3.88 billion. This increase suggests stronger anticipated performance, supported by plans to open stores and an improved outlook for comparable sales growth of 5-7% compared with the prior-mentioned growth of 3-5%.

The midpoint of the company’s operating margin guidance has increased by about 60 basis points to 7.9%, driven by fixed cost leverage on higher sales. On a year-over-year basis, however, operating margin is expected to decline by approximately 130 basis points, reflecting tariff and incentive compensation headwinds that are partially offset by fixed cost leverage.

Net income is forecast between $253 million and $275 million, which marks an upward adjustment from the previously stated $223-$249 million. Adjusted net income is projected between $264 million and $286 million, significantly raised from the earlier guidance of $235-$261 million. Net income and adjusted net income were $253.6 million and $277.8 million, respectively, in fiscal 2024.

Earnings per share are expected to be $4.56-$4.96, up from the prior mentioned $4.04-$4.51 and suggesting a rise from the $4.60 reported in fiscal 2024. Adjusted earnings per share are likely to be $4.76-$5.16 compared with the previously mentioned $4.25-$4.72, whereas it registered $5.04 in fiscal 2024.

FIVE anticipates the gross capital expenditure of $210 million. These investments will support store openings and ongoing upgrades to systems and infrastructure. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 23.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 25% growth.

More on Axios: AI threatens the billable hour revenue model What news sources AI chatbots read","Some communications teams are taking it upon themselves to create AI solutions tailored to their specific workflows.

Why it matters: These tools automate a lot of the comms grunt work, creating more time for the team to focus on tasks and strategies that can drive the business forward.

State of play: Cognizant chief communications officer Jeff DeMarrais recently challenged his team to dedicate a week to building AI tools that solve their stickiest or most annoying tasks. The team used vibe coding software Lovable, which allowed it to develop processes using language, not code.

The Cognizant comms team developed a tool that measured and monitored online chatter and sentiment about a company and correlated that data with the company's stock price.

They created an executive dashboard so leaders could see how their internal and external communications were resonating across audiences and they built a message cascade optimizer to ensure they were deploying comms across the right channels.

The team also created a tool to generate executive briefing documents and another to scan and select specific photos from corporate events or appearances.

What they're saying: ""Our CEO [Ravi Kumar S] talks constantly about the future of work and what it's going to take to succeed in the future economies — and he's made it very clear that coders of the future are people who can master large language models [LLMs] and prompt engineering,"" said DeMarrais.

""And there is nobody better positioned in the world to do that than professional communicators.""

Zoom in: Instacart's comms team created an AI-powered tool to automatically pull coverage based on specific parameters it set, summarize each article and draft a coverage report email the team can review.

This tool has reduced time spent on new clips by more than 75% and costs by 60%, says Instacart chief corporate affairs officer Dani Dudeck.

""Across the entire team, we're identifying time sinks and turning those tedious tasks into more efficient processes, so we can put our talent toward higher impact and more rewarding work,"" she says.

For example, it is using AI to automate administrative workflows like routing speaking requests, managing event attendance, RSVPs and award submission deadlines.

Instacart's team also built a media response simulator using trained chatbots to test pitches and launch materials, prepare for interviews and generate potential coverage.

""Now, before any big moment, we run our messaging through the simulator to pressure-test it,"" says Dudeck. ""Does our pitch land? What parts of the release get ignored, quoted or challenged? Where are we leaning too hard on jargon or missing what a journalist would actually want to know?""

Workday's communications team has created personalized agents that mirror specific reporters or outlets to help spokespeople prepare for interviews. They have also created agents to support and scale executive thought leadership and messaging.

And Google built an AI-powered agent that has access to all of its internal and external comms — like blog posts, talking points, statements and coverage reports — throughout the company's history, which provides the team with institutional knowledge and record keeping.

Between the lines: The in-house comms teams without the resources to create their own internal tools are relying on PR agency partners for support.

Zoom out: Communications giant Burson has rolled out proprietary AI tools to help measure and monitor the impact of corporate reputation.

For example, the Reputation Capital tool predicts how corporate reputation efforts could help or hurt stock price, sales and purchase intent, while Burson Decipher predicts the believability, virality and potential impact a message might have with a particular audience. The Burson Sonar tool uses AI to monitor and predict emerging narratives across social media and niche or nontraditional media sources.

Weber Shandwick is using AI tools to message test, audit how organizations and brands show up across the LLMs and create communication campaigns to capitalize on generative engine optimization (GEO).

PRophet, a Stagwell-owned platform, launched AI-powered monitoring tools that track changes in sentiment, predict shifting narratives and advise how best to respond. It also recently introduced GEO checklists to inform how press releases and pitches are deployed.

Edelman has created its own proprietary tool to predict and measure the impact of earned media and social sentiment on corporate trust. The agency is also in the process of rolling out a GEO tool.

Plus, challenger firms are leaning on third-party LLMs and AI tools to help them achieve more with smaller teams.

Strategic comms firm Velocity created custom LLMs to support clients' executive positioning work and test or predict how key regulators might respond to specific policy messaging.

Boutique PR agency Six Eastern has deployed customized AI models using Claude to brainstorm and draft messaging based on the client's voice and goals.

What to watch: Because AI allows for them to work faster, in-house teams are reevaluating how they rely on agency support and agencies are in turn reevaluating their business models.

""The solution is moving to deliverable and value-based pricing, so that we can both share in the upside with higher performance, faster time to market, lower cost for the client and put us in a position to retain margin,"" says Brian Buchwald, global chair of AI and product at Edelman.

In practice, this is likely to show up as a shift away from the billable hours model in favor of fixed retainers, along with billing based on hitting key milestones or performance metrics.

Company shares slid more than 6% Thursday after the company stuck to 2025 guidance it had issued earlier this year despite the big quarterly beat. The Richfield, Minnesota, company cited the potential impact of tariffs on its business and customers.

In Best Buy’s most recent quarter, comparable sales, used as a barometer of a retailer’s health, increased 1.6% with Wall Street expecting a slight decline. CEO Corie Barry pointed out that it was the highest growth for same-store sales in three years.

Best Buy’s business had been hurt by online competition and also a return to more normalized spending on gadgets after a pandemic-induced splurge by Americans.

A combination of innovative products, like laptops with artificial intelligence capabilities, and a growing need to replace electronics, has helped to spur sales, Barry said on a conference call Thursday.

Customer behavior hasn’t changed in the first half of the year, Barry said, in that they remain resilient. Shoppers continue to focus on deals and are attracted to known sales events like Black Friday and the company’s July sales promotion.

“In the current environment, customers continue to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases and are willing to spend on high price point products when they need to, or when there is technology innovation,” she said.

The electronics industry can be particularly hard hit by tariffs because so many good are imported. But the overall cost increases have been much less than the overall rate of the tariffs, Barry said. Barry told reporters on a separate conference call Thursday that price increases were only applied to “a very small assortment” of products.

That’s because its vendors are taking different strategies, from adjusting promotions to potentially increasing prices on new products.

Barry said in May that Best Buy was taking a variety of actions to offset tariff costs, including a push on its vendors to diversify their manufacturing.

Best Buy has little control over its sourcing because it relies on vendors. The company directly imports about 2% to 3% of the products it sells. China remains the No. 1 source for the retailer’s products, but Best Buy estimates that the percentage of product cost those imports represent is now approximately 30% to 35%, down from 55% in March. That’s because vendors are expanding production outside of China. The U.S. and Mexico account for roughly 25% of its cost.

The reported net income of 87 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring costs and amortization costs, were $1.28 per share, which is 6 cents better than industry analysts had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

Sales rose to $9.44 billion and also handily topped expectations.

For the year, Best Buy stuck by revenue expectations in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion and a comparable sales range of anywhere from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%.

It also left profit expectations unchanged, forecasting per-share earns of $6.15 to $6.30 this year.

“We are proud of our progress so far, but there is more work to be done. We strive to be better for the people who use our products and drive value throughout our business. Getting this principle right will result in reducing our impact on the planet.""

Supply chain action on climate, packaging and sourcing

Packaging is one of the most visible elements of Colgate’s supply chain strategy, having developed a recyclable toothpaste tube which is now distributed in more than 70 countries, with 95% of North American tubes converted.

By the end of 2024, 93% of packaging was recyclable, reusable or compostable. Virgin plastics use was cut by 25% compared to 2019 levels, while post-consumer recycled plastic reached 21%. Targets for 2025 include reducing virgin plastics by a third and increasing recycled content to 25%.

Colgate also invests in renewable energy supply agreements and commits to net-zero carbon emissions across its value chain by 2040.

Shorter-term goals include 100% renewable electricity by 2030 and reducing Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services by 42% from a 2020 baseline.

Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions are also targeted for a 42% cut.

By 2040, Colgate aims to achieve a 90% reduction in Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, excluding optional categories under the Science Based Targets initiative.

Colgate works with suppliers on deforestation- and conversion-free commitments, especially in palm and soy supply chains. This includes certified materials, satellite monitoring and direct supplier engagement.

Human rights form another key part of supply chain governance, with partnerships such as the Fair Labor Association addressing responsible recruitment in the Malaysian palm oil sector.

Water management is approached through the CDP Water Supply Chain Program, where suppliers are encouraged to assess and mitigate water risks, particularly in water-stressed regions. This builds resilience not only for Colgate but also for the communities where suppliers operate.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/d20d89bfcfbf074d3ef4a931e0c0c029:6aedd230703051d10e26b5205d3b74e3/ann-tracy.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 13:23:27.556940

According to documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall covers certain Ford F-150s from the 2025 model year — as well as other Ford “Super Duty” trucks, including 2025-2026 F-550 SD, F-450 SD, F-350 SD and F-250 SDs. A recall report dated Aug. 22 notes that the instrument panel cluster (IPC) can fail at startup, resulting in drivers seeing a blank screen.

As a result, the NHTSA notes, drivers may not be able to read critical “safety-related telltales and gauges,” increasing the risk of crash. The recall report notes that Ford isn't aware of any accidents or injuries related to this issue — but had received 95 warranty claims as of June 26.

To address the display failure, Ford is offering a free IPC software update to impacted owners. This fix will be available at authorized dealers or through an “over-the-air” update, the NHTSA notes.

In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Ford said that the over-the-air software update is “more convenient for customers compared to an in-person dealer visit."" The Michigan-based auto maker added that owner notification letters will soon be sent out with more information and instructions about the remedy.

A total of 355,656 vehicles are covered by the recall, all of which are estimated to have the defect. Recall documents note that the now-recalled IPC software was introduced into production in June 2024, and was taken out in July 2025.

Ford has rolled out several sizeable recalls this year — including 694,000 Bronco Sport and Escape vehicles recalled over a fuel injector issue last month, as well as a recall covering over 850,000 cars due to potential fuel pump failure.

Kumar Galhotra, chief operating officer at Ford, addressed the recent uptick in recalls at Ford earlier this month — writing in a company blog that the increase “reflects our intensive strategy to quickly find and fix hardware and software issues and go the extra mile to help protect customers,” which includes heightened safety testing.",https://images.wral.com/asset/business/2025/08/27/22134699/media_6e470779b4244ecb85a54a1cd2feba9a-DMID1-684nm84ut-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 14:23:17.931540

Market Update

Thanks to the Fed’s series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth. The path forward holds both optimism and caution as new policies take shape.

Walmart’s U.S. store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped nearly 50% last quarter amid the retailer’s ongoing push to accelerate shipping speeds, EVP and CFO John David Rainey said on an earnings call last week.

About one-third of deliveries from stores in recent weeks arrived in three hours or less, with 20% of that portion arriving to customers in 30 minutes or less, according to Rainey.

“We see billions and billions of units at a high growth rate being delivered same day and within same day from our store deliveries,” Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner said on the call.

Dive Insight:

Faster deliveries leveraging stores have been a priority for Walmart amid deepening competition with Amazon, another company working to accelerate shipping speeds. Rainey said in a follow-up investor call last week that the push is worth it, as quick deliveries lead to more frequent orders from shoppers.

“As they realize that they can get those things that they want and need right away, we see that repeat purchasing behavior, which makes the share gains that we have very sticky,” Rainey said.

Technological progress will also strengthen the consumer delivery experience, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said on the earnings call. For example, tapping more into artificial intelligence could help the company boost the accuracy of its “dynamic delivery windows,” which it will offer to 95% of U.S. households by the end of the year. Walmart’s dynamic delivery algorithm analyzes local conditions to determine the most efficient driver routes and the estimated time of arrival for an order.

“One of the things that we’ve obviously got is a ton of data and it’s not just product catalog data these days, it’s delivery data,” McMillon said. “It’s real-time data. And the way that we can put that to work to understand the context in which someone’s shopping is really exciting to think about.”

The dynamic delivery window expansion aligns with Walmart’s aim to reach 95% of the country in under three hours by the year’s end. The retailer is currently at 93%, according to Furner.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/zyJdsUXyxa-JY7prxBerS9oYVjzyOzXghiTwtDGQQcU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjcwNDc0NjgzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-28 12:57:09.120397

ID41,Walmart,2025-08-28 15:34:08+00:00,CNBC,Walmart exec 'never believed' in 'work-life balance'—the mantra she uses instead - CNBC,"Ashton Jackson, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/walmart-exec-never-believed-in-work-life-balancethe-mantra-she-uses-instead.html,"Work-life balance looks different for different people.
""I've never believed in the term work-life balance,"" says Morris, who oversees the experience of over 2.1 million employees.
There are times that your life requires a lot more, and there are times that your work requires a lot more.
""You might be [at your kid's] soccer game, but you happen to look at a few emails,"" Morris says.
That's why it's up to leaders to set the tone for boundaries in the office and what good work-life integration may look like.","Work-life balance looks different for different people.

For some, the term can mean not working nights, weekends and holidays. Others may look at it as no text messages and emails about work after 5 p.m., prioritizing self-care in the evening instead. While this divide may give you a sense of happiness and fulfillment, it isn't always realistic, says Walmart executive vice president and chief people officer Donna Morris.

""I've never believed in the term work-life balance,"" says Morris, who oversees the experience of over 2.1 million employees. ""I call it work-life integration. There are times that your life requires a lot more, and there are times that your work requires a lot more. … I don't think that's a bad thing.""

When Morris is visiting family, for example, her main focus is on them. But if there's something at work that needs her attention, she won't wait until she's back in the office to do so. Work-life integration helps her stay on top of her work duties while still showing up for herself and the people she loves, she says.

""You might be [at your kid's] soccer game, but you happen to look at a few emails,"" Morris says. Maybe you're chatting with your boss via text while waiting for an appointment, or tying up a few loose ends at work before you put the kids to bed. That doesn't necessarily mean you're a workaholic who lacks boundaries — rather, you find ways to combine your personal and professional duties that work for you, instead of being strict and inflexible with your time.

Morris' insight comes as young professionals are demanding more out of work, shaping new professional norms like relaxed dress codes and mental health days. Along with an inadequate salary and burnout, lack of work-life balance is one of the top reasons why Gen Zers would quit a job, according to a 2022 report from Talent LMS, a workplace training company, which surveyed over 1,200 respondents between ages 19 and 25.

The pursuit of work-life balance can also cause mental distress, Jeff Karp, a professor of biomedical engineering at Harvard Medical School and MIT, told CNBC Make It in September 2024.

""We hear these things from others, [like] trust in the process [and] balance is so important, we need more balance, it's the ultimate goal,"" Karp said. ""It ends up being very frustrating and can lead to anxiety, because we're constantly feeling like we're not in balance. There's a state we should be in [and] we're never in that state.""

Of course, sometimes you may actually need a complete reset, shutting off your laptop for a few days and turning your work phone off. But if your boss doesn't use their vacation time, or is constantly reaching out during your time off, unplugging can feel impossible.

That's why it's up to leaders to set the tone for boundaries in the office and what good work-life integration may look like.

""If I never take a holiday, the tone that I set for everybody is, don't take a holiday — you can't do that. And I don't think that that's right,"" says Morris. ""As leaders, we have a responsibility to role model what we expect of others.""

""At the end of August, I'm going away [on vacation],"" she adds. ""And my team will all know, [so] when they're able to actually go off and do something, they should go off the grid and do it.""

The latest update is out from Red Light Holland ( (TSE:TRIP) ).

Red Light Holland has reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2026, highlighting a decrease in revenue and gross profit compared to the previous year. Despite these challenges, the company has made strategic moves, including entering the U.S. retail market through Albertsons, launching new products like Health Canada-approved mushroom gummies, and investing in Bitcoin as a financial strategy. The company is also exploring M&A opportunities and remains optimistic about future growth in the psychedelic and functional mushroom sectors.

Spark’s Take on TSE:TRIP Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, TSE:TRIP is a Neutral.

The overall stock score of 46 reflects significant financial challenges, including declining revenue and substantial losses. Technical analysis shows mixed signals, with some short-term weakness. Valuation is unattractive due to negative earnings and no dividend yield.

The well-known chain Monroe, part of the Swedish giant H&M, is preparing to close its last store in the UK. The closure of the Bristol sales point will take place on September 14, which will mean the complete disappearance of the brand from the streets of the country.

According to information, stores are already decorated with large posters announcing a sale before closure, as well as thanks to loyal customers for their support.

The fashion clothing chain owned by H&M is holding a sale ahead of its final closure Monki closes its store in Bristol in September

Changes in the store network

Monki, initially launched as a youth brand under the auspices of H&M, gained popularity thanks to its bold and eccentric designs. Currently, there are only three Weekday stores left in the UK, all located in London.

In January, the sales points in Manchester and Newcastle closed, and the rest in London, Bristol, and Sheffield have also applied for closure or transformation this year. A representative of H&M noted:

“With the recent launch of the Weekday creative space, Weekday has created a curated platform where culture, style, and street fashion merge. This space brings together our brands – Weekday, Monki, and Cheap Monday – with second-hand clothing, exclusive editions, and more, all under one roof.”

Thus, the last Monki store in Bristol will become a symbol of the end of its presence in the UK.

The state of retail in Bristol

The closure of Monki is yet another blow to retail in central Bristol. Recently, many well-known stores have closed here, including the flagship Apple store, which ceased operations after 15 years of trading.

These changes are taking place against the backdrop of a large-scale redevelopment of the Quakers Friars area, being carried out by the shopping center owner Hammerson, with plans to turn the former Apple space into a healthcare center.

In light of the closure of the Monki store, fashionistas from Bristol and other cities are likely to turn to online shopping to acquire unique items from this brand.",https://112.ua/e/uploads/CONSUMER-HM-10283195jpg-JS873767855.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 12:52:27.835746

However, additional costs have added further pain to an already struggling sector.

The British Retail Consortium has predicted that the Treasury's hike to employer NICs from April will cost the retail sector £2.3billion.

At the same time, the minimum wage will rise to £12.21 an hour from April, and the minimum wage for people aged 18-20 will rise to £10 an hour, an increase of £1.40.

The Centre for Retail Research (CRR) has also warned that around 17,350 retail sites are expected to shut down this year.

It comes on the back of a tough 2024 when 13,000 shops closed their doors for good, already a 28% increase on the previous year.

Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the CRR said: ""The results for 2024 show that although the outcomes for store closures overall were not as poor as in either 2020 or 2022, they are still disconcerting, with worse set to come in 2025.""

It comes after almost 170,000 retail workers lost their jobs in 2024.

End-of-year figures compiled by the Centre for Retail Research showed the number of job losses spiked amid the collapse of major chains such as Homebase and Ted Baker.

It said its latest analysis showed that a total of 169,395 retail jobs were lost in the 2024 calendar year to date.

This was up 49,990 – an increase of 41.9% – compared with 2023.

It is the highest annual reading since more than 200,000 jobs were lost in 2020 in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced retailers to shut their stores during lockdowns.

The centre said 38 major retailers went into administration in 2024, including household names such as Lloyds Pharmacy, Homebase, The Body Shop, Carpetright and Ted Baker.

Around a third of all retail job losses in 2024, 33% or 55,914 in total, resulted from administrations.

Professor Bamfield has warned of a bleak outlook for 2025, predicting that as many as 202,000 jobs could be lost in the sector.

Qantas expands fleet with 20 additional A321XLRs

Qantas has announced an order for 20 additional Airbus A321XLR aircraft, further expanding its largest-ever fleet renewal programme. Sixteen of the new aircraft will feature lie-flat Business seats and seat-back entertainment screens, marking the first time Qantas will offer lie-flat seating on its narrow-body fleet. These aircraft will serve longer domestic routes, including transcontinental flights to and from Perth, as well as short and medium-haul international services across South East Asia and the Pacific Islands.

The new A321XLRs are scheduled to arrive from 2028, bringing Qantas’ total order for the next-generation aircraft to 48. The extended range of up to 8,700 kilometres provides more than 3,000 kilometres additional reach compared with the Boeing 737s they will replace. This capability enables Qantas to launch direct flights to destinations that are currently not commercially viable, opening new connectivity options for both domestic and regional international travel.

Qantas’ first two A321XLRs, configured for domestic and short-haul international flights, are expected to commence commercial service in mid-September, making Qantas the first airline in the Asia-Pacific region to operate the aircraft type. Initially, the aircraft will operate Sydney-Melbourne and Sydney-Perth services, with a progressive rollout across other routes. By the end of the financial year, Qantas will have seven A321XLRs in operation.

Jetstar will also benefit from the A321XLR programme, with aircraft due to arrive from 2027. These will feature a two-class cabin layout designed for international travel, supporting the low-cost carrier’s expansion on regional international routes.

The additional aircraft strengthen Qantas’ ability to modernise its fleet while improving passenger comfort with enhanced seating and entertainment options. The A321XLR’s long range and efficient design will allow Qantas to increase route flexibility, reduce travel times, and provide a seamless travel experience on both domestic and international services. The expansion reflects Qantas’ strategic focus on growing direct connectivity across the Asia-Pacific region and supporting long-term network development.

About ITS Logistics ITS Logistics is one of North America's fastest-growing, asset-based modern 3PLs, providing solutions for the industry’s most complicated supply chain challenges.","RENO, Nev., Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ITS Logistics, a leading third-party logistics provider, today announced the launch of its Retail Logistics Hubs, a nationwide network of fulfillment and distribution centers designed to help retailers overcome today’s most pressing supply chain challenges, including tariff volatility, leaner inventories, stringent compliance demands, and increased consumer expectations for speed and sustainability. The hubs combine strategically located facilities with integrated systems, advanced compliance monitoring, and ESG-aligned operations, enabling shippers to move product with confidence—whether scaling a mid-market brand or supporting global retail networks.

“Retailers are facing a delicate balancing act,” said Kasia Wenker, Vice President of Solutions Engineering at ITS Logistics. “Tariff uncertainty has driven many to frontload or trim inventories, but that only works if execution is flawless. The real risk is losing sales to stockouts, delays, or compliance failures. Our Retail Hubs are designed to solve that gap—delivering speed, visibility, and reliability in a volatile market.”

Since May, several major retailers have adopted leaner, more purposeful inventory strategies to combat tariff-induced cost pressures. In the company’s recent earnings call, Lowe’s reported a $499 million decrease in inventory levels compared to the previous year, citing the implementation of new planning tools to optimize inventory allocation across their national footprint. Levi Strauss stated they will be “taking a hard look at productivity” across their products, cutting low-performing SKUs to reduce tariff costs for the holiday season. Walmart cited disciplined inventory levels and fewer markdowns as one of their key contributors to improved gross margins in the second quarter, signaling reduced inventory and faster turnover in their stores. With smaller stock levels and uncertainty surrounding future costs, companies are forced to think critically about how goods move—improving forecasting, emphasizing real-time visibility, and placing a renewed emphasis on reverse logistics to return goods to shelves.

“Leaner inventory strategies can unlock cost savings, but only if logistics partners can keep pace,” Wenker added. “Our hubs put brands within two-day reach of 95% of the U.S. population while ensuring compliance and sustainability performance that protects both margins and reputations.”

Core capabilities of the Retail Logistics Hubs include:

Reduced chargebacks and improved vendor performance through real-time dashboards, seamless EDI integrations, and compliance scorecards that keep operations aligned with retailer requirements.

Recovered revenue from returns with reverse logistics processes that minimize write-offs and return inventory to shelves quickly.

Minimized detention and delivery failures via universal drop trailer programs and proven OTIF performance that keep freight moving on schedule.

Enhanced ESG compliance with tailored sustainability solutions, including Scope 3 emissions reporting and WAIRE-compliant port drayage.

Accelerated onboarding through ITS’s dedicated activation support that ensures rapid integration, system testing, and program readiness.

In addition to Retail Logistics Hubs, ITS has already established a successful network of Food Logistics Hubs serving leading brands across the U.S. These purpose-built food facilities are designed to meet stringent regulatory and compliance requirements while enabling rapid fulfillment and nationwide reach. By extending the same proven model to the retail sector, ITS brings the operational expertise, infrastructure, and technology already trusted by major food shippers to retailers navigating today’s complex supply chain environment.

ITS Logistics offers a full suite of network transportation solutions across North America and omnichannel distribution and fulfillment services to 95% of the U.S. population within two days. These services include drayage and intermodal in 22 coastal ports and 30 rail ramps, a full suite of asset and asset-lite transportation solutions, omnichannel distribution and fulfillment, and outbound small parcel.

Despite easily beating expectations, shares slid more than 2% before the opening bell Thursday after the company stuck to earlier guidance for 2025. The Richfield, Minnesota, company cited the potential impact of tariffs.

Comparable sales, a good barometer of a retailer’s health, increased 1.6%, which was in line with expectations. The company had been battered by online competition and also a return to more normalized spending on gadgets after a pandemic-induced splurge by Americans.

CEO Corie Barry pointed out that it was the highest growth for same-store sales, which include online sales, in three years.

The reported net income of 87 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring costs and amortization costs, were $1.28 per share, which is 6 cents better than industry analysts had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

Sales rose to $9.44 billion and also handily topped expectations.

The electronics industry can be particularly hard hit by tariffs because so many goods are imported.

Barry said in May that Best Buy was taking a variety of actions to offset tariff costs, including a push on its vendors to diversify their manufacturing. The company, which still faces intense competition, said it raised some prices to absorb tariff-related costs only as a “last resort.”

China remains the No. 1 source for the retailer’s products, but Best Buy estimates that the percentage of product cost those imports represent is now approximately 30% to 35%, down from the 55% in March. That’s because suppliers are expanding production outside of China, among other actions. The U.S. and Mexico account for roughly 25% of its cost.

For the year, Best Buy stuck by revenue expectations in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion and a comparable sales range of anywhere from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%.

It also left profit expectations unchanged, forecasting per-share earnings of $6.15 to $6.30 this year. Analysts expect $6.16 per share on revenue of $41.36 billion for the year, according to FactSet.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2431/files/2023/11/best-buy.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 12:49:19.390254

The ruling by U.S. District Judge James Selna in California follows a jury verdict that found Biosense Webster had engaged in unlawful, anti-competitive conduct and ordered it to pay $147 million in damages to Innovative Health LLC.
The order also prohibits the company from hoarding used catheters that it does not reprocess to keep them out of the hands of competitors.
The restrictions will remain in place for five years, though the court retained the right to adjust the duration depending on market conditions.
“Hospitals and patients have long paid the price for BSW’s anticompetitive behavior,” Daniel J.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge James Selna in California follows a jury verdict that found Biosense Webster had engaged in unlawful, anti-competitive conduct and ordered it to pay $147 million in damages to Innovative Health LLC. The damages automatically tripled under federal antitrust law, raising the total to $442 million.

The injunction, announced Thursday by the Association of Medical Device Reprocessors (AMDR), prevents Biosense Webster from tying clinical support for its cardiac mapping machines to the purchase of its own compatible devices, discriminating against hospitals that use reprocessed catheters, or installing so-called “kill switches” designed to disable devices that had been reprocessed by another company. The order also prohibits the company from hoarding used catheters that it does not reprocess to keep them out of the hands of competitors.

The restrictions will remain in place for five years, though the court retained the right to adjust the duration depending on market conditions.

“Hospitals and patients have long paid the price for BSW’s anticompetitive behavior,” Daniel J. Vukelich, president and CEO of AMDR, said in a statement. “This ruling reaffirms that dominant device manufacturers cannot abuse their market power to prevent hospitals from delivering the best possible care at the lowest possible price to the most patients in need at the least cost to the environment.”

Maplebear Inc, operating under the Instacart brand, is a leading player in the grocery delivery sector across the United States and Canada. The company partners with a diverse range of regional and national grocers, facilitating the delivery of groceries and other goods through its platform. Instacart's business model leverages a network of approximately 600,000 independent contractors who pick and deliver orders, generating revenue through service fees and advertising sales to consumer-packaged goods companies. With a market capitalization of $11.4 billion, Instacart is positioned within the Consumer Cyclical sector, specifically in the Retail - Cyclical industry.

Instacart's financial health presents a mixed picture. The company reported total revenue of $3.546 billion, with a notable decline in revenue growth of 24.2% over the past year. However, over a three-year period, revenue growth stands at 20.8%, indicating a longer-term upward trend. Profitability metrics are robust, with an operating margin of 14.83% and a net margin of 13.76%. The gross margin is particularly strong at 74.85%, reflecting efficient cost management.

On the balance sheet front, Instacart exhibits strong financial resilience. The company boasts a current ratio of 3.32 and a quick ratio of 3.32, both indicating ample liquidity. The debt-to-equity ratio is minimal at 0.01, underscoring a conservative capital structure. The Altman Z-Score of 6.69 suggests a low risk of financial distress, while the Beneish M-Score of -2.68 indicates that the company is unlikely to be manipulating its financial statements. However, insider activity raises some concerns, with 14 insider selling transactions and no insider buying over the past three months, totaling 9,940,341 shares sold.

In terms of business performance, Instacart's revenue trends highlight both challenges and opportunities. The decline in revenue growth over the past year contrasts with the positive growth trajectory over three years. Operational efficiency is reflected in the company's high gross margin and EBITDA margin of 17.15%. The competitive landscape in the grocery delivery sector is intense, with Instacart competing against both traditional retailers and emerging digital platforms.

Valuation metrics provide further insight into Instacart's market positioning. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 25.02, close to its two-year low of 24.41, suggesting potential undervaluation. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio stands at 3.47, while the price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 3.45. Analyst sentiment is moderately positive, with a target price of $58.42 and a recommendation score of 2.3, indicating a ""buy"" consensus. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 38.99 suggest that the stock is approaching oversold territory.

Risk assessment for Instacart involves several factors. The company's financial health is strong, as evidenced by its high Altman Z-Score and low debt levels. However, sector-specific risks include the competitive pressures in the retail industry and potential regulatory changes affecting gig economy business models. Instacart's beta of 0 indicates low volatility relative to the market, providing some stability for investors.

The process for adjudicating those claims has not yet been finalized, which could lead to a cash flow crunch for retail pharmacies.","Retail pharmacy operators face an array of challenges beyond PBM reform, which many observers say remains the single biggest obstacle to operating successfully in today’s environment.

Among the most pressing issues is how the Medicare price negotiations that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act will play out at the retail level. Many retailers are concerned that reimbursement mechanisms might not be adequate to support their cash flow needs. In addition, the reimbursement models that evolve for GLP-1 drugs and other high-cost medications could also pose challenges for retailers.

Many of the challenges that retailers are seeking to resolve are more operational in nature, however, including rethinking the store business model, attracting and retaining qualified labor and implementing technology systems that increase efficiency and protect against the theft of customer data.

Overall, the air of uncertainty that has been impacting businesses across industries this year only compounds the problems that drugstore retailers face. Interest rates, inflation, tariffs on imported goods and consumer confidence are among the broad economic issues that could suddenly present new challenges at any time.

The following is a closer look at five key challenges—other than PBM reform—that the retail pharmacy industry is currently contending with.

[Related: Crisis behind the counter]

1. Rethinking the drug store operating model

The prevalent retail drug store business model has been overbuilt and doesn’t meet the demands of today’s consumers, said Howard Meitiner, managing director at consulting firm Carl Marks Advisors.

“This model faces negative factors lowering profitability, such as shrinking reimbursement rates and increased competition from online retailers, big-box retailers like Walmart and Costco and dollar stores,” he said.

Many stores have failed to provide the service levels required to support an enjoyable in-store experience for customers, he said, and a focus on offering household staples, such as toilet paper, has proven to be unprofitable and left drug stores vulnerable to competition from lower-priced operators.

Meitiner also cited the impact that shoplifting has had on retail merchandising, citing studies showing that locking products, as many drug stores have done to curb theft, negatively impacts sales and detracts from the in-store experience.

“This is a major dilemma impacting drug stores right now, with convenience, simplicity and e ciency becoming the new essential drivers in consumer trends,” he said. Meanwhile, many drug stores are too large, which drives up their operating costs, and the big chains have too many stores in their fleets, operating more locations than are needed to meet local demands in many neighborhoods, Meitiner said.

“Today, prescription services are truly the only compelling reason for customers to visit drug stores, and attempts to create other attractions have been mixed,” he said, citing the challenges that Walgreens has faced with its VillageMD clinic operations.

To mitigate these issues, pharmacies have been closing unprofitable stores, implementing cost-cutting initiatives and expanding healthcare services. It’s not yet clear, however, if these moves have gone far enough and if they are having a negative impact on customer service, Meitiner said.

“The front of store—health and beauty products, snacks, household goods—all continue to be squeezed by competition from big box stores, and the usual suspects like Amazon,” said David Patterson, associate partner at Clarkston Consulting. “I think as we’ve encountered increasing inflationary pressures, shoppers are looking to the Walmarts or the Costcos due to perceived savings.”

2. Staffing to optimize the customer experience

Providing high levels of in-store service requires retailers to ensure that their stores are staffed at the right levels. However, attracting and retaining qualified employees poses an ongoing challenge for retail pharmacy operators, and it is one that is only expected to become more diffucult to overcome in the years ahead.

“We are hearing across the board that a lot of pharmacies are struggling with staffing,” said Mark Ey, chief operating officer at the National Community Pharmacists Association. “In a world where reimbursements and profit are continually going down and wages for employees are going up, it’s diffucult to continue to raise people’s pay and continue to run a pharmacy.”

An NCPA survey last fall found that 70% of independent pharmacy managers reported diffuculty filling open staff positions. That included 80% who said filling pharmacy technician positions was challenging. Although pharmacist positions were not seen as hard to fill as technicians, 42% of pharmacy managers said they did have difficulty hiring enough pharmacists.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the employment of pharmacists overall will grow 5% per year from 2023 through 2033, with about 14,200 openings per year.

“Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire,” the BLS reported.

Some research also shows that the number of Doctor of Pharmacy graduates is not expected to keep pace with this demand. In 2026, only about 8,000 students are expected to graduate with Doctor of Pharmacy degrees, or about 60% of the number that will be needed to fill open positions, according to research from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the University of Health Sciences and Pharmacy in St. Louis.

Despite the largest drug store chains closing hundreds of stores across the country—including the bankruptcy and liquidation of Rite Aid—store-level jobs can remain di cult to fill, Ey said. “With Rite Aid’s exit, you’d think there’d be a pool of available candidates for employment,” he said. “But most of those stores seem to be getting bought up by the chains or regionals, and so it looks like a lot of their sta will end up working for those corpo-

rations instead of being available to independents that may want to pick them up.”

3. Technology investments: ecommerce, AI and cybersecurity

Closely related to the labor challenges that retail pharmacies face is their need to invest in technologies that boost efficiency and minimize their labor costs.

While personal interactions with customers are an important element of pharmacy operations, “I do think there’s plenty of room to automate,” said Patterson of Clarkston Consulting, citing functions such as inventory management and prescription bottle filling.

These technology solutions present an opportunity for retailers, but each time a new technology is implemented it also brings an element of risk and new costs in terms of implementation and maintenance.

Other technology challenges include the need for investment in digital commerce, the implementation of artificial intelligence and the need to invest in cybersecurity. Patterson noted that drug stores need to invest in upgrading their consumer-facing digital offerings as well.

“When you look at the drug store space, many lag behind in terms of the omnichannel experiences that most shoppers expect at this point,” he said.

Meanwhile, finding solutions that leverage artificial intelligence is another technology investment that drug store retailers need to pursue.

A recent Boston Consulting Group survey of U.S. and European companies found a large shift of IT budgets toward AI and away from other areas. Nearly half of respondents—48%—said they planned to allocate more spending toward machine learning and AI solutions, the biggest increase of any category. Close behind were increases in spending on cloud services (up 36%) and security infrastructure (up 29%), while companies reported cutting back on investments in server infrastructure, devices, systems and services management, and other areas.

“While spending is up, the pie is still only so large,” BCG concluded, noting that companies appear to be seeking to extend the life of their technology hardware and delay some other investments in order to fund their other tech priorities.

The survey respondents’ focus on security highlights the growing challenges that retailers face around cybersecurity, especially as they invest in digital connectivity both with their customers and with other players in the healthcare ecosystem.

“There are data security concerns that come with a lot of these new digital platforms, and the more of them that you offer, the more you have to maintain and keep secure,” said Patterson.

This poses particular challenges for smaller chains and independents, which might lack the resources to invest in the technology and cybersecurity solutions that their larger counterparts can afford, he said.

Ey of NCPA agrees that cybersecurity investments represent a significant challenge for smaller independent drugstores in particular. This year has seen a flurry of cybersecurity breaches in the healthcare sector overall, following the massive Change Healthcare breach of a year ago that interrupted prescription fulfillment processes at thousands of pharmacies.

More than 300 million patient records were breached in 2024, a 26% increase compared to 2023, according to the 2025 Breach Barometer report from Bluesight, a provider of solutions for health systems and hospital pharmacies.

“Retail IT professionals say that small businesses can be more vulnerable because most of them don’t have the level of cyber-security that the big box stores or the big health systems have,” said Ey. “That’s why a lot of our pharmacies are beefing up their capabilities to ensure that their patients’ data is protected.

“It’s an added cost to purchase those IT support systems and the insurance that is often required to protect you from a breach that could put you out of business,” he said.

4. Drug pricing issues loom

One of the biggest concerns in the months ahead for retail pharmacies is how they will be reimbursed under the Medicare prescription drug price negotiation that was part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Under that plan, Medicare has negotiated drug prices with manufacturers for 10 different drugs, effective in January 2026.

The challenge for many smaller pharmacy operators is that they will likely be buying the drug at the regular price, billing Medicare for the lower, negotiated price and then seeking a rebate from the manufacturer. The process for adjudicating those claims has not yet been finalized, which could lead to a cash flow crunch for retail pharmacies.

“The challenge is that the government didn’t really set forth any real regulations and/or guidelines for CMS to implement this,” said Ey. It’s not yet clear how the process for obtaining the rebates from manufacturers will be structured, Ey explained.

“We might not know what their process is for those rebated parts of the claim until 90 days before the implementation of the actual project, which could be a real problem,” he said. “Not many things can be implemented at that scale inside 90 days.”

5. Payment for GLP-1 drugs could impact retailers

Although payer coverage for GLP-1 drugs has been increasing during the last few years, the drugs remain expensive, and many insurance plans do not cover them or have placed restrictions on their coverage.

The surge in popularity of these drugs has been a big driver of same-store sales at retail drug stores, said Elizabeth Anderson, an analyst at Evercore ISI, adding that retailers might need to leverage new payment models to ensure they capture these sales. GLP-1 receptor agonists have soared in popularity due to their ability to stave off hunger, helping patients lose weight. However, with costs as high as $1,350 per month, many patients need assistance to cover the costs if they are not covered by their insurance plans.

“A lot of high-cost branded drugs have a challenging reimbursement model for retail pharmacies,” said Anderson. She cited efforts such as CVS NovoCare, which launched in July, as a potential solution. That program is a partnership between CVS and Novo Nordisk, which makes Wegovy, through which CVS Caremark, CVS Health’s PBM, will make Wegovy the preferred GLP-1 medication on its standard formularies.

In addition, while sales of prescription drugs overall have been on the rise, a significant portion of the sales gains have come from specialty drugs, often driven by specialty pharmacies, said Anderson. “That’s something that perhaps the in-person drug stores, whether chain or independent, have not been able to take part in as much,” she said.",https://drugstorenews.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/2025-08/augist-coverstory-mainimage.png,N,,2025-08-28 12:52:21.780450

The announcement coincided with the christening of the U.S. Maritime Administration’s (MARAD’s) third National Security Multi-Mission Vessel, held at the Philadelphia shipyard. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the First Lady, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro were among the dignitaries in attendance.

The expansion program includes the installation of two new docks and three quays, with plans under review for a new block assembly facility. Once completed, the upgrades are expected to boost Philly Shipyard’s annual production from fewer than two vessels to as many as 20.

Hanwha, a global leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessel construction, said it plans to manufacture LNG carriers, naval modules, blocks, and eventually naval vessels at the Philadelphia site. The project is projected to generate at least 5,000 skilled labor jobs and thousands more indirect positions in the region.

“We are creating good manufacturing jobs, building the world’s most advanced ships, and fostering a new skilled workforce right here in America,” said Hanwha Vice Chairman Dong Kwan Kim during his welcome address at the ceremony. “This is just the beginning. Hanwha is committed to being a partner in building the next chapter of American shipbuilding.”

Hanwha acquired Philly Shipyard last year in a $100 million deal and has since pledged to modernize the facility with advanced automation and smart-yard technology.

The announcement follows recent investments aimed at reviving Philadelphia’s shipbuilding legacy. In July, Gov. Shapiro welcomed a separate $100 million investment from Rhoads Industries at the Navy Yard, calling shipbuilding “a key part of Philadelphia’s identity and our economy.”

In addition to the infrastructure plan, Hanwha Shipping — the U.S. subsidiary of Hanwha’s shipping arm — confirmed an order for 10 medium-range oil and chemical tankers from Hanwha Philly Shipyard, with the first slated for delivery in 2029.

The company also exercised an option for a second LNG carrier, building on last month’s landmark contract for the first U.S.-ordered, export-market-ready LNG carrier in nearly 50 years.

Hanwha Ocean CEO Hee Cheul Kim and Hanwha Global Defense CEO Michael Coulter also attended the christening. Hanwha executives said the expansion underscores the company’s strategy of leveraging its global shipbuilding expertise to strengthen U.S. industrial capacity and workforce development.

U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-PA) applauded Hanwha Group’s historic $5 billion investment in the Hanwha Philly Shipyard and greater Philadelphia area.

“Hanwha Philly Shipyard already plays a critical role in American shipbuilding and is essential to the many Pennsylvanians who work there, but this investment is a gamechanger for the city, the commonwealth, our workers, and the country,” McCormick said.",https://pennbizreport.com/favico.ico?v=1756403840,N,,2025-08-28 14:22:13.675045

“We delivered comparable sales growth of 1.6% in the second quarter, our highest growth in three years,” said Corie Barry, Best Buy CEO. “This better-than-expected sales growth was driven by a mix of new technology innovation, our relentless focus on a seamless omni-channel customer experience and our strong vendor partnerships.”

“We have a busy and exciting second half of the year ahead of us with more tech innovation, new store experiences, and, of course, our newly launched Best Buy Marketplace,” continued Barry. “Our sales growth momentum has continued into August driven by strong customer response to our back-to-school sales events. I want to thank all our teams for their enthusiasm for technology, customer service passion and determined execution.”

“The sales growth resulted in a better-than-expected Q2 adjusted operating income rate,” said Matt Bilunas, Best Buy CFO. “Our SG&A expense was as expected, and we saw some gross profit rate mix pressure from the strong growth in gaming and computing.”

“For Q3, we expect comparable sales growth to be similar to what we just delivered in Q2 and the adjusted operating income rate to be similar to last year’s Q3 3.7% rate,” continued Bilunas. “We feel good about our Q2 results and increasingly confident about our plans for the back half of the year. Given the uncertainty of potential tariff impacts in the back half, both on consumers overall as well as our business, we feel it is prudent to maintain the annual guidance we provided last quarter. At this point, we do believe we are trending toward the higher end of our sales range.”

FY26 Financial Guidance

Best Buy is reiterating the following full-year FY26 financial guidance provided on May 29, 2025:

Revenue of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion

Comparable sales1 of (1.0%) to 1.0%

Adjusted operating income rate2 of approximately 4.2%

Adjusted effective income tax rate2 of approximately 25.0%

Adjusted diluted EPS2 of $6.15 to $6.30

Capital expenditures of approximately $700 million

Domestic Segment Q2 FY26 Results

Domestic Revenue

Domestic revenue of $8.70 billion increased 0.9% versus last year primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.1%.

From a merchandising perspective, the largest drivers of the comparable sales increase on a weighted basis were gaming, computing and mobile phones. These drivers were partially offset by declines in home theater, appliances, tablets and drones.

Domestic online revenue of $2.86 billion increased 5.1% on a comparable basis, and as a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue was 32.8% versus 31.5% last year.

Domestic Gross Profit Rate

Domestic gross profit rate was 23.4% versus 23.5% last year. The lower gross profit rate was primarily due to lower product margin rates, which were partially offset by rate improvement within the services category. The lower product margin rates were primarily driven by a higher sales mix of lower-margin categories.

Domestic Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)

Domestic adjusted SG&A expenses were $1.68 billion, or 19.3% of revenue, versus $1.66 billion, or 19.3% of revenue, last year. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily due to: (1) compensation expense, which included higher medical claims; (2) lapping a Q2 FY25 favorable legal settlement of approximately $10 million; and (3) technology investments. The previous items were partially offset by reduced Best Buy Health expense.

International Segment Q2 FY26 Results

International Revenue

International revenue of $740 million increased 11.3% versus last year primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 7.6% and revenue from Best Buy Express locations that opened in Canada after Q2 FY25.

International Gross Profit Rate

International gross profit rate was 21.8% versus 23.9% last year. The lower gross profit rate was primarily due to lower product margin rates.

International Adjusted SG&A

International adjusted SG&A expenses were $143 million, or 19.3% of revenue, versus $142 million, or 21.4% of revenue, last year.

Restructuring Charges

The company incurred $114 million of restructuring charges in Q2 FY26 associated with an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced during the quarter. The charges represent employee termination benefits and approximately $40 million of asset impairments. The restructuring initiative is intended to redirect resources for better alignment with changing customer behaviors and the company’s strategy.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

In Q2 FY26, the company returned a total of $266 million to shareholders through dividends of $201 million and share repurchases of $65 million. On a year-to-date basis, the company has returned a total of $568 million to shareholders through dividends of $403 million and share repurchases of $165 million. The company expects to spend approximately $300 million on share repurchases during FY26.

Today, the company announced its board of directors has authorized the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.95 per common share. The quarterly dividend is payable on October 9, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 18, 2025.

Conference Call

Best Buy is scheduled to conduct an earnings conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (7:00 a.m. Central Time) on August 28, 2025. A webcast of the call is expected to be available at www.investors.bestbuy.com, both live and after the call.

Notes:

(1) The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. For additional information on comparable sales, please see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and available at www.investors.bestbuy.com.

(2) A reconciliation of the projected adjusted operating income rate, adjusted effective income tax rate, and adjusted diluted EPS, which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, is not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty predicting the occurrence, the financial impact and the periods in which the non-GAAP adjustments may be recognized. These GAAP measures may include the impact of such items as restructuring charges; price-fixing settlements; goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairments; gains and losses on disposals of subsidiaries and certain investments; amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions; certain acquisition-related costs; and the tax effect of all such items. Historically, the company has excluded these items from non-GAAP financial measures. The company currently expects to continue to exclude these items in future disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures and may also exclude other items that may arise (collectively, “non-GAAP adjustments”). The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of non-GAAP adjustments, such as a decision to exit part of the business or reaching settlement of a legal dispute, are inherently unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

At this year’s Let’s Grow! Marketplace Seller Summit, Walmart introduced new AI-powered tools and seller incentives to help sellers grow faster, operate more efficiently, and reach more customers.

They also announced expanded Next-Day Delivery in major metros and enhanced omnichannel opportunities — including showcasing Marketplace items in-store.

Today, at its Let’s Grow! Walmart Marketplace Seller Summit, Walmart announced a suite of tools and initiatives designed to accelerate seller growth, expand international reach and deliver unmatched omnichannel capabilities —reinforcing its commitment to marketplace integrity and exceptional customer experiences.

“Walmart has become one of the fastest-growing eCommerce platforms by focusing on what matters most: integrity, seller success and delivering exceptional experiences for customers,” said Manish Joneja, senior vice president, Walmart U.S. Marketplace and Walmart Fulfillment Services. “Everything we’re building — from smarter tools to expanded fulfillment and global reach — is designed to accelerate seller growth and empower sellers to serve customers while driving their businesses forward.”

Smarter tools and capabilities to supercharge selling

Walmart is equipping sellers with AI-powered tools that simplify operations, save time and increase sales. These innovations are shaped by seller feedback and are designed to help sellers optimize every part of their business — from listing products faster to managing operations more efficiently and engaging customers with confidence. Tools and capabilities include:

AI-Powered Listing Tool and Smart Assistant: Single and bulk item setup tools reduce time to market and increase conversion rates, while Smart Assistant provides 24/7 real-time support.

Seller Advisors Program: Walmart Seller Advisors Program, spanning categories, regions and business sizes, provides a direct line of feedback to Walmart leaders. Their feedback and insights help co-create impactful programs and solutions, fostering marketplace integrity and a healthy business ecosystem.

Shipping Settings and Services: Sellers who self-fulfill can automate delivery promises by region, offering customers more delivery promises.

Brand Portal: Protect brands and flag fraudulent activity with an enhanced focus on product authenticity.

Walmart is also introducing new seller incentives to help sellers compete during the peak shopping season and win more business including:

0% referral fee on all qualifying toys

50% referral fee reduction on all qualifying pet supplies

Up to 100% referral fee reductions on qualifying top-selling items across categories

By pairing cutting-edge technology with targeted incentives, Walmart is empowering sellers to operate more efficiently, stand out in competitive categories and meet customer demand, especially during the holiday season.

Expanded reach and faster fulfillment

Walmart is making it easier than ever for sellers to reach more customers — both across the U.S. and around the world.

Next-Day Shipping in Major Metros: Walmart Fulfillment Services (WFS) now offers expanded Next-Day Delivery coverage across top U.S. cities — including Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Houston and Atlanta. This means faster, more reliable delivery of Marketplace items to millions of Walmart customers.

Competitive Rates and Higher Sales: WFS helps sellers streamline fulfillment at rates ~15% less* on average than competitors, driving stronger results. Sellers using WFS see, on average, a 50% lift in GMV on items tagged Walmart Fulfilled and 2-Day Shipping.** Through Multichannel Solutions, Sellers can use WFS to fulfill orders from their own website, social media shops and other marketplaces; new users of Multichannel Solutions can receive 30% off fulfillment fees.

Expanding Opportunities: With Walmart, sellers have access to reach customers across multiple marketplaces — including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Chile — while tapping into tools like Walmart Connect 3P Sponsored Ads to help boost visibility and sales.

Next-level omnichannel opportunities

Walmart is creating a true omnichannel marketplace that benefits both sellers and customers. These innovations are connecting online convenience with in-store trust — unlocking new ways for sellers to reach customers by blending the digital and physical shopping experience.

In-Store Digital Discovery: In April, Walmart opened its new Cypress, Texas, location, which features digital QR codes throughout the store. These codes allow customers to access digital tools, services and an extended online assortment. Walmart is bringing the extended Marketplace aisle into stores, starting with a few items on display. Customers can purchase through the Walmart app and even have their items professionally installed.

As Walmart Marketplace continues to evolve, these new investments underscore the company’s commitment to empowering sellers, enabling global expansion and delivering seamless omnichannel experiences for customers everywhere. By leveraging advanced technology, expanding fulfillment capabilities and deepening integration between online and in-store shopping, Walmart is building a marketplace ecosystem where sellers of all sizes can thrive — and customers can discover even more value and convenience.",https://www.martechcube.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Walmart.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 14:23:58.547808

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

1. Nvincible?

The results are in: Nvidia reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street's expectations last night. The chipmaker also provided better revenue guidance than analysts had anticipated for the current quarter.

Here's what else to know:

Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 processors to Chinese customers in the quarter, but the company did release $180 million worth of H20 inventory to a client based elsewhere.

Data center revenue soared compared to a year ago, but the figure still came in slightly under what analysts had forecasted.

Shares were down around 1% in premarket trading this morning. Read what the report means for the broader AI trade and stock market.

2. Consumer check-out

It's been a good morning for retailers — with one exception.

Dollar General and Best Buy both exceeded Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations before the bell. Dick's Sporting Goods also topped analysts' estimates and raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance. But Bath & Body Works reported earnings slightly below expectations for its second quarter.

The retail reports come at the tail-end of the corporate earnings season. More than 97% of S&P 500 companies have already shared results, according to FactSet. Of those, FactSet found that more than eight out of every 10 have beaten the Street's forecasts.

3. Shot shift

Regulators approved the latest round of Covid vaccines yesterday, but only cleared the shots for people at higher risk of severe illness from the virus.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the shots are available for ""all patients who choose them"" after they consult with doctors. But as of now, as CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino reports, it isn't clear how easy it will be to get a vaccine, or if insurance plans will still cover them for healthy adults.

Just hours after the announcement, the White House said it fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez after she refused to resign. At least four other officials also announced their resignations yesterday, a massive shakeup for the agency.

4. Dark web

Sports fans who watch games on YouTube TV got good news yesterday amid Google 's tiff with Fox . The platform's parent company and the broadcast network said they came to an agreement that provides a short-term extension, meaning Fox's channels won't go dark on YouTube just yet. Google did not say how long the extension would last.

The tech company also made headlines yesterday for other reasons. In an all-hands call last week — the audio of which was reviewed by CNBC's Jennifer Elias — Brian Welle, Google's vice president of people analytics and performance, said the company had cut 35% of managers overseeing small teams over the last year.

CEO Sundar Pichai at the meeting emphasized the need for Google to ""be more efficient as we scale up.""

5. Swift lift

Yes, we're still talking about Taylor Swift's engagement. In our defense, the stock market is too.

Signet Jewelers surged more than 6% yesterday, building on its initial pop following Swift's announcement on Tuesday. Shares of Ralph Lauren , whose clothing appeared to be worn by both Swift and fiancé Travis Kelce in their engagement photos, also rose for another session.

American Eagle shares meanwhile rallied 8.5% after the retailer announced a collaboration with Kelce and Tru Kolors, his sportswear brand. It of course marks the latest celebrity campaign for American Eagle: The company's denim ads starring actress Sydney Sweeney earlier this month stirred controversy and roiled the stock.

Yeah, look, uh the printer uh segment is uh is soft.
and it seems to be the theme of what a lot of companies have talked about uh over this past earnings.","fire up my stock of the day. Computer and printer giant HP Inc had a quarter that left me thinking about old tech plays navigating the new tariff normal. Here's what I found interesting on the quarter. For starters, company managed to beat sales estimates in a weak backdrop for high ticket goods. You can see that softness in Best Buy's earnings this morning. HP CEO Enrique Lores told me the company's seen good demand for its pricier new AI PCs. Meanwhile, the company's profit margins on PCs and printers didn't fall off a cliff

due to due to those uh Trump tariffs. I have reported on this before this year, but it's worth resurfacing. HP has moved quickly to cut a ton of costs from its business to offset tariff pressure. It's cutting costs internally and with product costs. It has also moved sourcing out of China very aggressively. All of this has me wondering if HP's forward PE ratio of a mere 8.2 times is undervaluing the company.

Still with me on the opening bid round tables, Eric Jackson and Nez Ferrer. Eric, um, you know, it's a little bit strange to go from talking all things Nvidia and a high growth to old tech and HP, talking about cutting costs to preserve margins in the era of tariffs, but maybe there's something here. Maybe there's a a cheap aspect to HP stock.

Certainly cheap. Um I think their big hope maybe, you know, you know, six months ago and it's the same for Dell was they were hoping like AI PCs were was going to be some like magic pixie dust that would really help uh inject some growth into into the whole uh PC upgrade cycle. I think so far the jury's still out, but you know, it doesn't look like that, you know, people yet see like the magic of like some some some stuff happening sort of like from the PC level with AI

that sort of makes it dramatically different from before. Of course, we experienced chat GPT, but that's sort of like the services in the cloud. So, uh I think the the struggle with HP and and Dell and the other PC makers is how do they, how do they some somehow uh change the experience of of using the the PC, which, you know, a lot of people still see as sort of like more more just functional.

What's amazing, Eric, I don't even see Dell as a PC maker. Of course they make PCs, but you know, you look at Michael Dell's X account. I mean, he's posting things about servers and AI. Dell seems like a way different company than HP, even Canon.

Yeah, it's I mean, that's where all the excitement and growth is. So I mean it's it's not surprising that he's not talking about the latest mouse uh model. I mean, uh I I think that's the challenge for for an HP is like how do you, how do you how do you sort of recast yourself uh kind of in this new world and you know, taking advantage of of where where people are most excited. I think that's that's that's the reason for for the smaller PE

and and why people are still sort of looking at it and trying to think of what it could could could look like in this new world.

And Nez, I had such a depressing experience. I told Enrique Lores a little bit about it. I recently got a new printer and I went to the most depressing store that I know, Staples. but the choices there, the competition is fierce. It's just amazes me this company was able to hold margins uh unchanged year over year in the printer business, given all the competition, given all the tariffs and look, I mean at 8.2 times forward earnings. Dare I say this could be a value in in overvalued tech.

Yeah, look, uh the printer uh segment is uh is soft. I mean, they they believe they they had a decline of 4% in printers. So I I think that the the entire uh that part of the uh business is is difficult. I mean, people are just printing less. Um but what I did find interesting was that they were able to mitigate this tariff situation. They did raise some prices and and also just uh moving manufacturing out of China, which is what we've seen the story with so many companies uh being able

to sort of uh shift that manufacturing and mitigate the tariffs for the time being. and it seems to be the theme of what a lot of companies have talked about uh over this past earnings.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Skc4uLnighD_Fqp2q.GlwA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/e3455a20-8418-11f0-b5cf-987f6319d779,N,,2025-08-28 13:23:54.849683

Net sales of $1.21 billion advanced 7% year over year on a reported basis and 6% on a constant-currency basis. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 billion. ANF’s comparable sales (comps) improved 3%. The top-line beat was driven by broad-based net sales growth across regions and exceptional growth at its Hollister brand.

Abercrombie & Fitch delivered another quarter of record results, marking its eleventh straight period of growth. Performance was led by Hollister, which achieved its strongest-ever second quarter, reflecting strong back-to-school and summer demand. Abercrombie brands faced a modest decline against exceptionally strong growth last year. The company improved profitability, supported by disciplined inventory management and strategic promotions, while also returning capital to its shareholders through ongoing share repurchases. Looking ahead, Abercrombie raised its full-year outlook, citing strong momentum and continued confidence in its global brands.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 11.3% in the past three months against the industry's 0.6% growth.

The outlook incorporates share repurchases of at least $50 million and diluted weighted average shares of around 48 million.

For fiscal 2025, the company expects year-over-year sales growth in the range of 5-7% compared with 3-6% growth expected earlier. This upside is likely to be backed by growth across regions and brands. ANF anticipates an operating margin in the band of 13-13.5%, up from the previous guidance of 12.5-13.5%.

For fiscal 2025, management envisions weighted average shares of around $49 million, which reflects the impacts of 2025 share repurchases of $400 million. Combined with the tax rate, ANF predicts EPS to be in the bracket of $10-$10.50 compared with the $9.5-$10.40 guided earlier.

Abercrombie anticipates an effective tax rate of around 30% for fiscal 2025. Capital expenditure is estimated to be $225 million for the current fiscal year.

For fiscal 2025, Abercrombie plans 60 store openings, together with 40 remodels and rightsizes, and 20 closures.

Company shares slid more than 6% Thursday after the company stuck to 2025 guidance it had issued earlier this year despite the big quarterly beat. The Richfield, Minnesota, company cited the potential impact of tariffs on its business and customers.

In Best Buy’s most recent quarter, comparable sales, used as a barometer of a retailer’s health, increased 1.6% with Wall Street expecting a slight decline. CEO Corie Barry pointed out that it was the highest growth for same-store sales in three years.

Best Buy’s business had been hurt by online competition and also a return to more normalized spending on gadgets after a pandemic-induced splurge by Americans.

A combination of innovative products, like laptops with artificial intelligence capabilities, and a growing need to replace electronics, has helped to spur sales, Barry said on a conference call Thursday.

Customer behavior hasn’t changed in the first half of the year, Barry said, in that they remain resilient. Shoppers continue to focus on deals and are attracted to known sales events like Black Friday and the company’s July sales promotion.

“In the current environment, customers continue to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases and are willing to spend on high price point products when they need to, or when there is technology innovation,” she said.

The electronics industry can be particularly hard hit by tariffs because so many good are imported. But the overall cost increases have been much less than the overall rate of the tariffs, Barry said. Barry told reporters on a separate conference call Thursday that price increases were only applied to “a very small assortment” of products.

That’s because its vendors are taking different strategies, from adjusting promotions to potentially increasing prices on new products.

Barry said in May that Best Buy was taking a variety of actions to offset tariff costs, including a push on its vendors to diversify their manufacturing.

Best Buy has little control over its sourcing because it relies on vendors. The company directly imports about 2% to 3% of the products it sells. China remains the No. 1 source for the retailer’s products, but Best Buy estimates that the percentage of product cost those imports represent is now approximately 30% to 35%, down from 55% in March. That’s because vendors are expanding production outside of China. The U.S. and Mexico account for roughly 25% of its cost.

The reported net income of 87 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for restructuring costs and amortization costs, were $1.28 per share, which is 6 cents better than industry analysts had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research.

Sales rose to $9.44 billion and also handily topped expectations.

For the year, Best Buy stuck by revenue expectations in the range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion and a comparable sales range of anywhere from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%.

It also left profit expectations unchanged, forecasting per-share earns of $6.15 to $6.30 this year. Analysts expect $6.16 per share on revenue of $41.36 billion for the year, according to FactSet.

The settlement resolves allegations that CVS charged MassHealth higher prices for prescription drugs than those offered to cash-paying customers through a discount program. CVS will pay $12.25 million to MassHealth and implement a yearly reconciliation process to ensure accurate pricing in the future.

“When pharmacies overcharge MassHealth, they’re undermining the integrity of our public programs and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill,” said AG Campbell. “I am proud to announce this settlement, which will prevent future inaccurate price reporting and ensure MassHealth has the resources it needs to continue serving Massachusetts residents.”

The lawsuit, filed in April 2025, alleged that CVS offered lower drug prices to cash-paying customers through a discount program administered by ScriptSave but failed to report and bill MassHealth those lower rates. This conduct was claimed to violate Massachusetts pricing regulations requiring pharmacies to charge MassHealth the lowest price they charge any other customer.

CVS followed a pricing methodology that did not give MassHealth its best prices, particularly for generic drugs, despite the “Most Favored Nation” drug pricing regulation in place since 1995. The complaint was jointly filed by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, and Oklahoma, following a whistleblower lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The Massachusetts Medicaid Fraud Division, which handled the investigation, is certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to investigate and prosecute health care providers who defraud MassHealth. The division also investigates abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation of residents in long-term care facilities and Medicaid patients.

In July, the AGO announced a $1.6 million settlement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. for allegations of improper kickbacks related to HIV drugs. In December 2024, separate settlements were reached with Center Pharmacy and Galaxy Pharmacies for submitting false claims to MassHealth.

This settlement is part of AG Campbell’s ongoing efforts to protect against waste, fraud, and abuse in prescription drug pricing, ensuring that MassHealth receives fair pricing and maintains resources to serve Massachusetts residents effectively.

By Savyata Mishra

(Reuters) -Best Buy stuck to its annual sales and profit forecasts on Thursday despite posting quarterly results that topped estimates, as it expects tariff-induced uncertainty in the second half of the year.

Shares of the top U.S. electronics retailer fell 5.7% in morning trading, as investors focused on a likely hit to the company's margins due to higher tariffs on U.S. imports.

Several retailers, including Best Buy, have had to raise prices on some goods to absorb the hit from these steep levies. Company executives said the price hikes were lower than the overall rate of tariffs, owing to its mitigation strategies.

Best Buy, which sources most of its goods from China, has also made efforts to diversify its supply chain and purchase more products from fewer partners to negotiate better terms in a bid to counter higher costs.

Meanwhile, the company's sales have struggled over the past three years as price-sensitive shoppers put off big-ticket purchases.

CEO Corie Barry said customers had become more deal-focused and waited for shopping events such as Black Friday and back-to-school promotions, even though spending remained resilient.

""Big-ticket purchases are approached more carefully, though consumers continue to spend on expensive technology when there is a clear need or innovation,"" Barry said on a post-earnings call.

On a media call with journalists, Barry said that the White House had been open to feedback from Corporate America on the impact of tariffs.

Strong sales of Nintendo Switch 2 gaming consoles, which were launched in June, and a surge in demand for artificial intelligence-powered laptops and mobile phones helped reverse a sales decline during the quarter.

""Tariffs and a pullback in discretionary big-ticket categories remain a drag, and unlike general merchandise (retailers), Best Buy has limited fallback categories to absorb that pressure,"" Emarketer analyst Suzy Davidkhanian said.

Comparable sales for the quarter ended August 2 rose 1.6%, the biggest increase in three years. Analysts on average had expected a 0.52% drop, according to data compiled by LSEG.

On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.28 per share, compared with the estimates of $1.21 per share.

The company expects comparable sales for fiscal year 2026 to range between a 1% drop and a 1% rise and an adjusted profit of between $6.15 and $6.30 per share.

In New York City, there are 0.7 Fortune 1000 firms per 100,000 residents. In several cities, however, the concentration of Fortune 1000 firms is more than 10 times that. Many smaller cities attract large companies through a combination of lower taxes, affordable real estate, access to skilled labor, investment in infrastructure, and proximity to key markets.

In addition to investing in the project, Ecolab has commenced the design of, and intends to subsequently build and operate the water management system at Blastr's 2.5-million-ton-per-annum (MTPA) steel plant in Inkoo.

Ecolab is a global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services, operating in more than 170 countries. Its Nalco Water business provides sustainable water solutions to steel companies and other customers around the world designed to reduce water usage, maximize production process water reuse and wastewater recycling, and minimize treated effluent discharged.

The parties will work together to minimize seawater intake, seawater discharge, and heat load to the sea with potential reductions estimated up to 85-90%. Further advances will be explored through innovative stormwater integration and the use of municipality wastewater.

'Water is one of Earth's most precious resources and vital to the way we live,' said Mark Bula, CEO of Blastr Green Steel. 'Even though our water treatment plan was deemed acceptable by the Finnish authorities as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), we want to do even better. We have listened to our community and to Inkoo's elected leaders, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly focused on water and heat discharge to the sea. This is why we are excited to announce this collaboration now.'

'Ecolab will work with us to design a water management system that advances Blastr's commitment to building a world-class steel mill with a significantly reduced environmental footprint. The company will also support the environmental permit application and communication of its water stewardship plans to the Inkoo community.'

'We are excited to be part of Blastr's innovative work in Finland, as both an investor and a collaborator,' said Thais Gervasio, SVP and General Manager, Water Solutions Europe at Ecolab. 'Our expertise in water solutions helps the world's leading manufacturing companies achieve their business, water circularity and decarbonization goals. Our collaboration has already created a path for Blastr to significantly reduce their water and energy use, limiting the project's environmental footprint and freeing up kilowatts for core process and production needs.'

Blastr will shortly launch its Series A investment round through its recently announced financial advisor, the U.S.- and London -based Evercore.

'Strategic collaborations, such as this most recent one with Ecolab, further enhance Blastr's financial case as we build momentum in our funding,' said David Morant, CFO of Blastr. 'Private investors increasingly see an opportunity to transform a strategic European industry. Europe last built a fully integrated steel plant in the 1960s. New technologies focused on cost and sustainability will help ensure that, as legacy steel plants close, new steel businesses like Blastr will help keep steel production in as a globally competitive and low-carbon industry.'

“That value of having a casing that can last through multiple lives is of utmost importance.” Watch the video for all of the insight on truck tire development.","For decades, fleets have spec’d and managed around a familiar truck tire truth: in tire design, gains in one area usually meant compromises in another. Mileage could be extended, but often at the expense of traction. Rolling resistance could be lowered, but durability sometimes suffered.

Today, commercial truck tire development is pushing past those boundaries. New approaches in compounding, casing design, and tread geometry are allowing engineers to deliver improvements in all three areas at once. The aim is to deliver on all fleet demands: longer mileage, better fuel efficiency, and stronger traction.

“The strategy is about bringing as much value to end users through innovation,” explained Joe Hughes, marketing manager for On-Road at Michelin. “We try to break down those natural compromises in tire design to get you more miles, better traction, and better rolling resistance all at the same time.”

Clean-Sheet Designs Drive Long-Haul Efficiency

One area where these innovations are clearest is the long-haul drive position. Michelin’s new X Line Grip D tire shows how clean-sheet tread patterns and casing construction can raise the bar for linehaul fleets.

Hughes explained that the design team borrowed ideas from other Michelin segments, including passenger cars, adapting a chevron tread pattern to heavy-duty drive tires. The result is not only improved snow and wet traction, but also efficiency gains. “When we test the final version, it has a 90% better snow starting traction than the Michelin XDN2 tire,” Hughes said.

By rethinking the tread sculpture and pairing it with advanced compounding, Michelin achieved both 20% more miles and 20% lower rolling resistance than the XDN2. In fleet trials, those numbers translated into 1% to 3% fuel savings—gains that usually require multiple component upgrades across a tractor-trailer.

Behind the tread is a casing designed for repeated retreads. The DURACORE casing combines INFINICOIL and POWERCOIL technologies to help deliver up to 1 million miles with four retreads.

“We’ve effectively eliminated that failure mode,” Hughes said of the POWERCOIL construction that prevents moisture and air from traveling along the cords. “It sounds so simple, so small, but it took a lot of work from a lot of people.”

Regional Fleets Demand Toughness

Regional applications place different demands on tires.

“These fleets do need more miles and maybe fuel efficiency is not as important to them, but robustness is,” Hughes explained. “They’re getting into tight turns at the end of their routes, they’re backing in really, really tight spaces to deliver those goods. So you need a tire that’s going to withstand all of that abuse.”

To meet that need, Michelin’s X Multi Z2 incorporates Regenion tread technology, which evolves as the tire wears to maintain grip. Combined with POWERCOIL casing design, the tire delivers 20% more mileage and 17% lower rolling resistance than its predecessor, the XZE2, while maintaining traction through its service life.

Navigating Light Truck and Van Complexity

The commercial light truck and van segment adds another layer of complexity to tire design. Fleets range from last-mile delivery vans to contractors driving longer distances between jobs.

“The commercial light truck and van market is pretty crazy because it has all of those usages all in one,” Hughes said. “When you design for that, you’re really designing for long wear life. You’re designing for robustness.”

Michelin’s Agilis CrossClimate 2 highlights the direction manufacturers are taking here: more protection against curb damage, longer tread life, and all-weather traction. The design adds 70% more sidewall rubber than some competitors, extends tread wear life by about 40% over the prior generation, and uses a siping system that provides hundreds of biting edges without accelerating wear.

The result is a single platform that can cover over 90% of the commercial light truck market, simplifying spec’ing decisions for fleets managing mixed-use vans and trucks.

Tires as Long-Term Assets

For fleets, the timing of these advancements is critical. With freight rates low and costs high, extending tire life and maximizing retreadability are becoming key strategies for controlling expenses.

“We still see a lot of fleets looking at their tires as assets to help overall operations,” Hughes said. “That value of having a casing that can last through multiple lives is of utmost importance.”

Accenture Song’s acquisition of Superdigital signals a decisive shift in how global consultancies are prioritizing social-first strategies. For CMOs and brand leaders, social media has become the first touchpoint with audiences, replacing television and even traditional search as the front line of engagement. By bringing Superdigital into its fold, Song is strengthening its ability to build end-to-end creator-driven campaigns that stretch from awareness to commerce.

This is not simply about expanding headcount or adding boutique creative flair—it’s about embedding social fluency and influencer marketing directly into Accenture’s performance-driven consulting framework. The move underscores that creators are now not just brand amplifiers but central players in how commerce itself is activated.

Superdigital’s Value Proposition Inside Song

Founded in 2013, Superdigital carved out a reputation for short-form video, community building, and platform-native storytelling. Its 40-person team specializes in cultural agility, rapid content ideation, and influencer partnerships that scale naturally within today’s fast-moving digital environment.

For Accenture Song, these capabilities directly enhance its vision of “marketing reinvention”—a strategy where creativity, data, and technology converge. Superdigital strengthens Song’s position in sectors like gaming, consumer goods, and entertainment, while also providing a blueprint for agile creator partnerships that can be deployed globally.

The Social-First Imperative for CMOs

The acquisition reflects a wider industry pivot: CMOs are shifting spend into influencer ecosystems as social platforms dominate consumer attention. TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts have outpaced television as cultural epicenters, and the need for content that is platform-native has never been higher.

Accenture Song recognizes this reality. By scaling with Superdigital’s expertise, it aims to provide clients with campaigns that aren’t retrofitted from old playbooks but designed specifically for short-form, socially-native environments. This allows brands to build communities, amplify relevance, and drive measurable commerce outcomes.

AI as the Engine of Marketing Reinvention

AI’s role in this acquisition is less about replacing human creativity and more about enhancing it. Superdigital brings human-led cultural insight; Accenture Song contributes AI-powered infrastructure for audience targeting, creative optimization, and real-time measurement. Together, they can deliver personalized campaigns at scale while maintaining the authenticity that creators bring to the table.

For marketers, this convergence matters. AI accelerates workflows and expands possibilities, but it can also introduce risks if not grounded in cultural nuance. The acquisition positions Song to offer both speed and sensitivity: technology to scale campaigns efficiently, and creators to ensure they resonate authentically.

Implications for Influencer and Creator Commerce

This deal also reflects a growing trend: the professionalization of creator commerce. Influencer partnerships are no longer “add-ons” to campaigns—they are the campaigns. With Superdigital integrated, Song can offer clients an end-to-end journey: creators driving discovery, AI optimizing engagement, and commerce integrations converting attention into measurable sales.

The implications go beyond brand storytelling. Accenture Song is positioning itself against agency holding groups like Publicis and WPP, which have also invested heavily in influencer platforms. Where others bring scale, Song aims to differentiate by tightly fusing consultancy-level analytics and tech-enabled marketing with cultural-first creative execution.

A Competitive Signal in the Marketing Landscape

The acquisition of Superdigital is part of a broader M&A wave reshaping the marketing industry. Consultancy-backed networks are increasingly competing head-to-head with traditional agency holding companies by offering both creativity and technical transformation. For Accenture Song, Superdigital is a strategic puzzle piece—reinforcing that future growth depends on social-first, creator-powered, and AI-enhanced strategies.

As marketing budgets continue shifting toward platforms and creators, this acquisition provides Song with the agility and expertise needed to stay at the forefront. It represents more than just an expansion of capabilities—it’s a bet on what the next decade of marketing will look like.",https://influencermarketinghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/c4edc4e9-20250828_1129_superdigital-acquisition-graphic_remix_01k3r01yj3fxw9qffz6nevs6b9.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 12:55:42.442363

Company Overview

With humble beginnings as a stereo equipment seller, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) now sells a broad selection of consumer electronics, appliances, and home office products.

Revenue Growth

A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years.

With $41.6 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Best Buy is larger than most consumer retail companies and benefits from economies of scale, enabling it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors. This also gives it the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there is only so much real estate to build new stores, placing a ceiling on its growth. For Best Buy to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices or lean into foreign markets.

As you can see below, Best Buy struggled to increase demand as its $41.6 billion of sales for the trailing 12 months was close to its revenue six years ago (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts). This was mainly because it didn’t open many new stores and observed lower sales at existing, established locations.

This quarter, Best Buy reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 1.6% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 2.3%.

Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months. This projection doesn't excite us and implies its newer products will not catalyze better top-line performance yet.

Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.

Store Performance

Number of Stores

The number of stores a retailer operates is a critical driver of how quickly company-level sales can grow.

Over the last two years, Best Buy has kept its store count flat while other consumer retail businesses have opted for growth.

When a retailer keeps its store footprint steady, it usually means demand is stable and it’s focusing on operational efficiency to increase profitability.

Note that Best Buy reports its store count intermittently, so some data points are missing in the chart below.

Same-Store Sales

A company's store base only paints one part of the picture. When demand is high, it makes sense to open more. But when demand is low, it’s prudent to close some locations and use the money in other ways. Same-store sales is an industry measure of whether revenue is growing at those existing stores and is driven by customer visits (often called traffic) and the average spending per customer (ticket).

Best Buy’s demand has been shrinking over the last two years as its same-store sales have averaged 2.7% annual declines. This performance isn’t ideal, and we’d be concerned if Best Buy starts opening new stores to artificially boost revenue growth.

In the latest quarter, Best Buy’s same-store sales rose 1.6% year on year. This growth was a well-appreciated turnaround from its historical levels, showing the business is regaining momentum.

We enjoyed seeing Best Buy beat analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its EBITDA missed and its gross margin fell slightly short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this quarter could have been better.

The industry's brand loyalty rate through June stood at 51.1%, down 1.4 percentage points (PPs) from the same period in 2024. The decrease marks a reversal from 2024's year-over-year gain, showing continued volatility in loyalty trends as the market continues to stabilize post-pandemic.

Both mainstream and luxury brands contributed to the decline as more than half of all brands tracked experienced year-over-year loyalty declines of one percentage point or more. Competition from conquests and evolving inventory dynamics reshaped consumer decision-making resulting in a higher rate of defections.

""The loyalty rate shift this year reflects the balance between a steady return-to-market volume and strong competition among brands,"" said Vince Palomarez, Associate Director, Loyalty Product Management, S&P Global Mobility. ""Households are returning to market, but many are open to cross-shopping in ways we didn't see during the height of pre-pandemic loyalty.""

Conquest Trends

While industry loyalty slipped, conquest volume rose in the first half of 2025. Conquest activity increased 7.6% among mainstream brands and 6.2% among luxury brands compared with the same period in 2024.

""Conquest opportunities are rebounding, particularly for luxury,"" said Tom Libby, Loyalty Solutions and Industry Analysis Associate Director, S&P Global Mobility. ""As loyalty softened, brands that executed competitive conquest strategies were able to capture households more effectively.""

Return-to-Market Dynamics

The number of households returning to market rose 4.2% year-over-year in the first half of 2025, representing the third consecutive year of improvement. While this growth provided a larger base of potential loyalists, it also created more opportunities for defections as brands competed aggressively for returning customers.

Additional mid-year highlights for 2025:

General Motors led all multi-brand manufacturers with a loyalty rate of 68.1%.

Ford topped all brands at 58.9% loyalty.

Mini currently leads the industry in loyalty growth, improving its loyalty rate by +4.6 PPs year over year.

has made tremendous progress,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said during a call with analysts.
He said the company’s chips would benefit as spending on A.I.","Nvidia, the artificial intelligence chipmaker, was crowned the world’s first $4 trillion public company last month and has become perhaps the most important factor determining the direction of the stock market.

On Wednesday, the Silicon Valley company reported results that showed that spending on A.I. infrastructure remains robust, easing the anxieties of Wall Street and investors around the world.

Concerns over whether tech companies would continue shelling out billions to build A.I. data centers — spending that has helped prop up the economy — had mounted in recent months. But Nvidia’s sales rose 56 percent to $46.74 billion in the three months that ended in July, just topping Wall Street’s expectations. Profit increased more than 59 percent to $26.42 billion.

Revenue in the current quarter is projected to rise 54 percent from a year ago to $54 billion, as tech companies pour money into data centers. The forecast was in line with Wall Street’s prediction for $53.9 billion, but the company said its estimates did not include any sales for China, which would lift its revenue higher.

“The last year, A.I. has made tremendous progress,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, said during a call with analysts. He said the company’s chips would benefit as spending on A.I. infrastructure increased to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by the end of the decade.

“We’re in the beginning of this build-out,” he said.

Shares of Nvidia fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. The decline, even when the company now posts quarterly profits bigger than tech peers like Apple and Meta, spoke to how lofty the expectations are. The company’s board approved a plan to repurchase $60 billion of its stock, signaling its confidence in its prospects.

Nvidia’s results have been closely watched since OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, igniting an A.I. boom. The company’s fortunes have soared as tech companies have flocked to buy its chips, which are ideal for powering the development of A.I. Nvidia has grown into the market’s most significant stock, accounting for 7.5 percent of every dollar in the S&P 500, up from 3 percent in December. Its results also influence the values of tech and energy companies with A.I. businesses.

“The question has been: Will the A.I. wave continue or could it meaningfully slow down?” said Melissa Otto, the head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha. Failing to meet expectations would be “like a grenade on the market,” she said. “It could blow up a lot of things.”

In recent months, demand for Nvidia’s newest chip, the Blackwell, has been especially scrutinized. Sales of the product, released late last year, have accelerated, with the company distributing about 72,000 Blackwell chips a week for an estimated price of $30,000 each.

The chip has contributed to increased spending on data centers by Meta, Google and other cloud computing companies. In July, Meta said it would spend $7 billion more on data centers than planned this year, and Google said it would spend an additional $10 billion.

Yet Nvidia has faced challenges, namely getting caught in the broader U.S.-Chinese power struggle. China is the world’s largest chip market, and Mr. Huang has said Nvidia needs to be there because half of the world’s A.I. developers are Chinese. But it has needed permission from Washington and Beijing to operate there.

In April, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia from selling its H20 chip, which was made specifically for Chinese companies, over concerns the chips could be used to help China’s A.I. industry and military. After Mr. Huang lobbied to reverse that decision, President Trump agreed in August to allow the sales.

China later summoned Mr. Huang to Beijing to discuss its concerns about the security of Nvidia’s chips. It later discouraged Chinese companies from buying the H20.

The negotiations meant Nvidia didn’t record any sales to China in the previous quarter. It also said that it has not assumed it will have any sales in China in the current quarter, even though Chinese customers have begun receiving licenses from the U.S. government to buy Nvidia chips.

During the call with analysts, Ms. Kress said government approval would clear the way for $2 billion to $5 billion in H20 sales in the current quarter. “We’re still waiting on several geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases,” she said. But, she added, “there is interest.”

Nvidia’s caution about China disappointed investors, who see the country as critical to driving future sales. Before the company’s financial results, analysts estimated that Nvidia would reap $16 billion in revenue from China this year and projected that sales there could eclipse $56 billion next year, which would be a major boost to the company’s total revenue.

Mr. Huang said Nvidia continued to talk to the Trump administration about the importance of China. He said he wanted to deliver a modified version of the company’s Blackwell chips to China, with reduced performance, and added that was “a real possibility.”

“The China market I’ve estimated to be about $50 billion in opportunity for us this year,” Mr. Huang said during the call with analysts. “You would expect it to grow about 50 percent per year, as the rest of the world’s A.I. market is growing as well.”

Lennart Heim, a tech analyst at RAND Corporation, a think tank, said Chinese companies would most likely buy two of those modified Blackwell chips at a premium price and piece them together to get more performance.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/27/multimedia/27biz-nvidia-qlkp/27biz-nvidia-qlkp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 12:56:42.488188

As a barometer of consumer behavior, pricing trends and tariff impacts, Walmart is a must-watch for anyone trying to understand the real-time U.S. economy.

When it comes to reading the macroeconomic tea leaves, most investors focus on central bank signals. But another key indicator is often hiding in plain sight: Walmart.

Call it a “WoW” moment, Waiting on Walmart.

Walmart employs 1.6 million Americans, or about 1% of the entire U.S. workforce. Its footprint spans e-commerce, traditional retail, membership clubs (via Sam’s Club), advertising and grocery. That makes it not just a retail bellwether, but an economic one. If you want to understand the U.S. consumer, labor force dynamics, pricing pressures or even tariff impacts, you start with Walmart.

In recent earnings calls, Walmart’s management acknowledged the pressure tariffs place on narrow retail margins, while also emphasizing the company’s ability to adapt and strengthen its model.

“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs... we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure.”

— Walmart earnings call, 5/15/25

“...we're strengthening our business model... The 50% growth in advertising, the 15% growth in membership, I think are really encouraging.”

— Walmart earnings call, 5/15/25

What to Watch in Walmart Earnings

Walmart’s commentary offers a unique lens into evolving consumer behavior. In prior reports, same-store sales were said to improve as each quarter progressed. That trend was mirrored by Costco’s U.S. same-store sales numbers (excluding gas), which moved from 5.5% in May and June to 6.5% in July. If Walmart shows a similar trajectory, it would counter the prevailing weak-consumer narrative and potentially reinforce the idea of “trading down” behavior instead.

The Tariff Wildcard

Other retailers like Levi’s and Procter & Gamble have weighed in on tariffs, reporting partial mitigation and cautious pricing adjustments. But Walmart’s scale and political visibility require careful messaging. Investors should watch for subtle language on cost pressures and operational flexibility across its supply chain.

Beyond Tariffs: Pricing Power, Grocery Trends and Margin Strategy

Walmart is the largest grocer in the U.S., and fresh food pricing remains a hot-button issue for inflation watchers. Commentary on food inflation, private label growth and price elasticity will be particularly telling. Additionally, the performance of Walmart’s high-margin segments, such as advertising and membership, can offer a leading indicator of margin durability in the face of economic shifts.

While macro headlines often focus on central banks, Walmart’s earnings can deliver real-time insight into the health of the U.S. economy. From labor to pricing, from tariffs to consumer sentiment, Walmart does not just reflect the economy, it helps define it.

On the company's earnings call, CEO Corie Barry said the retailer is ""increasingly confident about our plans for the back half of the year.""
Tariffs did not have a material impact on fiscal second-quarter financial results, Barry said on the company's earnings call Thursday.
She said customers are ""resilient, but deal-focused"" and have been attracted to the company's sales events like the one it held in July.
That marked the company's highest growth in three years, Barry said on the company's earnings call.","Best Buy surpassed Wall Street revenue and earnings expectations for its most recent quarter on Thursday, but stuck with its full-year forecast, citing tariff uncertainty.

The consumer electronics retailer said it expects revenue of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $6.15 to $6.30 for its full fiscal year 2026. In May, Best Buy had cut its full-year profit guidance from a prior range of $6.20 to $6.60.

For Best Buy, the middle of its expected full-year revenue range would be roughly flat to its revenue of $41.53 billion in the previous year. Best Buy said it expects full-year comparable sales, a metric that tracks online sales and sales at stores open at least 14 months, to range between a 1% decline and a 1% increase.

On the company's earnings call, CEO Corie Barry said the retailer is ""increasingly confident about our plans for the back half of the year."" She said the company is ""trending toward the higher end of our sales range.""

Yet she said, ""given the uncertainty of potential tariff impacts in the back half, both on consumers overall as well as our business, we feel it is prudent to maintain the annual guidance we provided last quarter.""

Best Buy's full-year guidance reflects that some shoppers could hold off on purchases in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said. He said the retailer could see a slowdown in the business in October ""as people are waiting for those holiday deals to come.""

Shares of Best Buy rose about 1% in premarket trading.

Here's how the retailer did for the three-month period that ended August 2 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.28 adjusted vs. $1.21 expected

Revenue: $9.44 billion vs. $9.24 billion expected

For Best Buy, a challenging trifecta of factors have complicated the retailer's outlook. Customers have bought fewer kitchen appliances as they put off home purchases and projects because of higher interest rates. Some have hesitated to splurge on pricier items because of tariff-related uncertainty or held out on tech replacements as they wait for new or eye-catching items. The company's annual sales have declined for the past three years.

To spur growth, Best Buy launched a third-party marketplace earlier this month to offer shoppers a wider selection of consumer electronics, accessories and more. On the marketplace, sellers who apply for the platform can list their own brands and items on Best Buy's website and app.

The company already increased prices on some items because of tariff-related higher costs, Barry said on a mid-May call with reporters. She did not specify which items now cost more and described price increases as ""the very last resort.""

Tariffs did not have a material impact on fiscal second-quarter financial results, Barry said on the company's earnings call Thursday.

Barry said that shopping patterns at Best Buy have not changed from previous quarters. She said customers are ""resilient, but deal-focused"" and have been attracted to the company's sales events like the one it held in July.

""In the current environment, customers continue to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases and are willing to spend on high price point products when they need to, or when there is technology innovation,"" she said.

Best Buy's net income for the fiscal second quarter of 2026 fell to $186 million, or 87 cents per share, from $291 million, or $1.34 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including restructuring charges, Best Buy reported earnings per share of $1.28.

Revenue increased from $9.29 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Comparable sales rose 1.6% in the fiscal second quarter compared to the year-ago period. That marked the company's highest growth in three years, Barry said on the company's earnings call.

In the U.S., comparable sales increased 1.1%, as customers bought mobile phones, video gaming equipment and items from its computing category. However, those sales trends were partially offset by weaker sales of appliances, home theaters, tablets and drones, the company said.

Gaming in particular had stronger-than-expected sales in the quarter, thanks to the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, Barry said. The retailer capitalized on the highly anticipated launch by offering a way for customers to pre-order and opening stores at midnight when the gaming console dropped on June 5, so customers could line up and get it right away.

Best Buy online sales in the U.S. rose 5.1% year over year and accounted for about a third of Best Buy's total U.S. revenue in the quarter.

In the first half of 2025, Fosun actively captured macroeconomic trends, maintained a clear strategic focus, and leveraged its strong capabilities in innovation and globalization to drive steady business development.

Guo Guangchang, Chairman of Fosun International, said: ""In the first half of the year, we remained steadfast in implementing our core business-focused strategy. Our core segments—pharmaceuticals and healthcare, cultural tourism and consumption, financial services and insurance—delivered steady growth. In particular, we achieved several industry-leading breakthroughs in innovative drugs, which have not only been well received by the market but will also benefit more patients worldwide. Meanwhile, we continued to strengthen our global operating capabilities, allowing more competitive products and services to accelerate their expansion into international markets to serve a growing number of families.""

Innovative drug business ushers in a period of rapid growth, fostering multiple ""China's first"" and the ""World's first"" innovations

Innovation is a core competence that Fosun has accumulated over a long period of time and has consistently adhered to. During the Reporting Period, Fosun's investment in technology innovation reached RMB3.6 billion and its global innovation system integrating ""independent R&D + investment incubation + ecosystem collaboration"" continued to gain momentum, fostering a series of globally competitive innovations.

In terms of therapeutic drugs, a total of 5 indications of 4 innovative drugs independently developed and licensed-in by Fosun Pharma were approved for launch both domestically and internationally, 4 innovative drugs had entered the pre-launch approval stage. Among them, the Class I new drug independently developed by Fosun Pharma, FUMAINING (luvometinib tablets), was approved for marketing in Chinese mainland, filling the treatment gap in the field of rare tumors. In August 2025, the small molecule orally administered DPP-1 inhibitor developed by Fosun Pharma achieved overseas licensing for a potential total of US$645 million.

Henlius' HLX43 is a PD-L1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) currently in global Phase II clinical trials. It is undergoing clinical studies for solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thymic carcinoma in countries including China, the United States, Japan, and Australia. HLX43 has demonstrated notable competitiveness in terms of drug safety, efficacy, and R&D progress, and holds strong potential to become a broad-spectrum anti-cancer drug. At the upcoming World Conference on Lung Cancer in September 2025, ten cutting-edge studies featuring Henlius' innovative products, including HLX43, have been selected for presentation. In addition, HLX22, an innovative anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, was granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the European Commission (EC) for the treatment of gastric cancer, marking it as the first anti-HER2-targeted therapy for gastric cancer to receive ODD approval from both the EU and the US. Henlius is continuously expanding its innovation pipeline in disease areas like oncology and autoimmune, advancing a differentiated portfolio of potential best-in-class (BIC) and first-in-class (FIC) candidates.

In addition, breakthrough progress has been made in the fields of medical devices and diagnostics. Leveraging the ""licensed medical devices"" permission in Hainan, the Da Vinci SP endoscopic single orifice surgical system has completed real-world study reports across multiple specialties, helping accelerate its formal registration and approval process.

Combining global resources with China's capabilities, proportion of overseas revenue exceeds half of total revenue

Leveraging its business presence and profound industry operations in over 40 countries and regions around the world, Fosun's overseas revenue saw steady growth. In the first half of 2025, overseas revenue reached RMB46.67 billion, accounting for 53% of the Group's total revenue.

Henlius consistently achieved major breakthroughs in global operations during the Reporting Period. Its core innovative product HANSIZHUANG (serplulimab), the world's first anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved for first-line treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), recorded a global sales revenue of RMB597.7 million. In the first half of 2025, HANSIZHUANG received approvals in the EU, Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and India for first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Additionally, it was approved in Indonesia and Thailand for the treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC). To date, HANSIZHUANG has been successfully approved in nearly 40 countries and regions, covering nearly half of the world's population.

Fosun rapidly advanced its pace of global expansion across more industries and business segments. Hainan Mining commenced pilot production at Phase 1 of the Bougouni lithium mine in Mali and will strategically initiate the planning of Phase 2 development. Leveraging its established projects such as the Bougouni lithium mine in Mali, Roc Oil oilfield project in Malaysia and the recently acquired oilfield project in Oman, Hainan Mining is accelerating the building of a ""Minerals + Energy"" network spanning West Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Revenue from overseas operations has now increased to 57% of total revenue.

Following its overseas debut in Paris, France in late 2023, the Yuyuan Lantern Festival continued its overseas journey in 2025: In January, the themed lantern installation made a stunning appearance in Hanoi, Vietnam, commemorating the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam. In June, the Lantern Festival officially lit up at ICONSIAM, a renowned commercial landmark in Bangkok, Thailand, as part of the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Thailand. In April 2025, Songhelou, a time-honored Chinese brand with a 268-year history, opened its first overseas restaurant in London, the UK, marking its debut on the international culinary stage.

At the same time, the global operations of Fosun's overseas subsidiaries continued to grow. During the Reporting Period, Fosun Insurance Portugal's international operations accounted for 28.2% of total consolidated business and overseas gross written premiums (""GWP"") reached EUR924 million. In July 2025, S&P initiated coverage on Fosun Insurance Portugal and assigned it an ""A"" rating, recognizing its high-quality and well-balanced business portfolio, continuous international expansion, solid financial performance, and strong capital adequacy.

During the Reporting Period, Club Med's global performance once again reached a record high. Its business volume amounted to RMB9.25 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 3.8%; operating profit reached RMB1.27 billion, up 11.0% year-on-year. With strong demand continuing for the summer vacation season and the upcoming snow season, bookings are expected to witness sustainable growth in the second half of 2025 and the first half of 2026.

While strengthening its foothold in traditional markets, Fosun accelerated its expansion into global emerging markets. Fosun Pharma reached a strategic cooperation with Saudi Arabia's comprehensive healthcare group, Fakeeh Care Group, to jointly promote the local introduction of innovative therapeutic products in Saudi Arabia. Easun Technology formed a joint venture with Saudi enterprise, Khaled Juffali Company, to provide production line solutions for Saudi Arabia's electric vehicle industry and has already received its first order. The German asset servicing entity, HAFS, will leverage Fosun's global network to expand into emerging markets in the Middle East and Asia, strengthening its asset-light operating model.

Fully embracing AI to develop new growth points

Amid the rapid rise of AI, Fosun has proactively embraced the trend, deeply integrating AI technologies into its diverse business scenarios to accelerate innovation and enhance operational efficiency.

In the field of biopharmaceuticals, Fosun Pharma tapped into AI productivity across all business scenarios by adopting a dual-engine approach that combines ""biopharmaceutical models + large language models"", building a knowledge platform to support high-quality AI applications. On the decision support front, Fosun Pharma launched the industry's first decision intelligence platform, PharmAID. It integrates multiple global clinical information and pipeline databases, with data updated as frequently as T+1. The platform delivers higher content generation accuracy in the healthcare domain compared to general-purpose large models, and improves information extraction efficiency by 50% in areas such as R&D decision and evaluation, and pipeline optimization.

In the field of cultural tourism and consumption, Club Med continued to advance AI-driven digital transformation. The G.M Copilot conversational AI assistant, which provides 24/7 instant and personalized service, has already expanded to 12 markets worldwide, including Brazil, France, Belgium, Singapore, and Malaysia. In August 2025, FTG entered into a full-stack AI collaboration with Alibaba Cloud to jointly develop the cultural tourism intelligent system, ""AI G.O"", based on the Qwen3 model series. ""AI G.O"" is designed to optimize the entire vacation experience and enhance operational efficiency. It is scheduled for official launch at the end of September, with the first pilot program to be carried out at Atlantis Sanya.

In the field of finance services, Fosun Insurance Portugal leveraged its AI application system to comprehensively improve the efficiency of its entire business process and enhance data accuracy, driving rapid growth of its insurance business. During the Reporting Period, the total number of internet users of Fidelidade exceeded 2 million, representing nearly 20% of Portugal's total population. By adopting AI technologies, the rate of fully automated processing for motor claims rose from 48% as at the end of 2023 to 66% as at the end of the Reporting Period.

In pursuit of new opportunities in fintech, Fosun Wealth accelerated its Web3 strategy. In July 2025, Finloop, independently incubated by Fosun Wealth, launched the FinRWA Platform (FRP). FRP is a globally leading one-stop solution for Real World Assets (RWA) technology, issuance and distribution, and Finloop is actively advancing multiple asset tokenization technology projects.

Committed to business for good, maintaining a leading ESG performance

During the Reporting Period, relying on Fosun's continuous efforts in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) over the years, it was once again successfully included in S&P Global's ""Sustainability Yearbook 2025"" and was selected as the top 1% in S&P Global's ""Sustainability Yearbook 2025 (China Edition)"". In addition, Fosun's FTSE ESG score continued to outperform the global industry average and the national average, and it has been included in the constituent stocks of the FTSE4Good Index Series for four consecutive years.

In terms of social welfare, Fosun Pharma has consistently contributed the ""China Solution"" to the fight against malaria in Africa. As at the end of June 2025, its independently developed artesunate for injection had been used to treat more than 84 million patients with severe malaria worldwide. Additionally, Fosun Pharma had supplied over 420 million doses of artesunate for injection globally.

In terms of rural revitalization, as at the end of June 2025, the Rural Doctors Program had covered 78 counties in 16 provinces, cities and autonomous regions (including 21 key counties for national rural revitalization), supported 25,000 rural doctors, and benefited 16.34 million rural residents and 3 million rural families.

Looking ahead, Guo Guangchang stated: ""In the face of both opportunities and challenges, we will remain focused on our core businesses, step up innovation efforts, and firmly advance our globalization strategy. Building on our long-established core capabilities, we are committed to driving Fosun's sustainable growth, scaling new heights in our areas of strength, expanding our leadership across more business areas, and creating greater value for our shareholders and society.""

For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the consolidated adjusted measures used throughout this release, please refer to the attached supporting schedule.

“We delivered comparable sales growth of 1.6% in the second quarter, our highest growth in three years,” said Corie Barry, Best Buy CEO. “This better-than-expected sales growth was driven by a mix of new technology innovation, our relentless focus on a seamless omni-channel customer experience and our strong vendor partnerships.”

“We have a busy and exciting second half of the year ahead of us with more tech innovation, new store experiences, and, of course, our newly launched Best Buy Marketplace,” continued Barry. “Our sales growth momentum has continued into August driven by strong customer response to our back-to-school sales events. I want to thank all our teams for their enthusiasm for technology, customer service passion and determined execution.”

“The sales growth resulted in a better-than-expected Q2 adjusted operating income rate,” said Matt Bilunas, Best Buy CFO. “Our SG&A expense was as expected, and we saw some gross profit rate mix pressure from the strong growth in gaming and computing.”

“For Q3, we expect comparable sales growth to be similar to what we just delivered in Q2 and the adjusted operating income rate to be similar to last year’s Q3 3.7% rate,” continued Bilunas. “We feel good about our Q2 results and increasingly confident about our plans for the back half of the year. Given the uncertainty of potential tariff impacts in the back half, both on consumers overall as well as our business, we feel it is prudent to maintain the annual guidance we provided last quarter. At this point, we do believe we are trending toward the higher end of our sales range.”

FY26 Financial Guidance

Best Buy is reiterating the following full-year FY26 financial guidance provided on May 29, 2025:

Revenue of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion

Comparable sales1 of (1.0%) to 1.0%

Adjusted operating income rate2 of approximately 4.2%

Adjusted effective income tax rate2 of approximately 25.0%

Adjusted diluted EPS2 of $6.15 to $6.30

Capital expenditures of approximately $700 million

Domestic Segment Q2 FY26 Results

Domestic Revenue

Domestic revenue of $8.70 billion increased 0.9% versus last year primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.1%.

From a merchandising perspective, the largest drivers of the comparable sales increase on a weighted basis were gaming, computing and mobile phones. These drivers were partially offset by declines in home theater, appliances, tablets and drones.

Domestic online revenue of $2.86 billion increased 5.1% on a comparable basis, and as a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue was 32.8% versus 31.5% last year.

Domestic Gross Profit Rate

Domestic gross profit rate was 23.4% versus 23.5% last year. The lower gross profit rate was primarily due to lower product margin rates, which were partially offset by rate improvement within the services category. The lower product margin rates were primarily driven by a higher sales mix of lower-margin categories.

Domestic Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)

Domestic adjusted SG&A expenses were $1.68 billion, or 19.3% of revenue, versus $1.66 billion, or 19.3% of revenue, last year. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased primarily due to: (1) compensation expense, which included higher medical claims; (2) lapping a Q2 FY25 favorable legal settlement of approximately $10 million; and (3) technology investments. The previous items were partially offset by reduced Best Buy Health expense.

International Segment Q2 FY26 Results

International Revenue

International revenue of $740 million increased 11.3% versus last year primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 7.6% and revenue from Best Buy Express locations that opened in Canada after Q2 FY25.

International Gross Profit Rate

International gross profit rate was 21.8% versus 23.9% last year. The lower gross profit rate was primarily due to lower product margin rates.

International Adjusted SG&A

International adjusted SG&A expenses were $143 million, or 19.3% of revenue, versus $142 million, or 21.4% of revenue, last year.

Restructuring Charges

The company incurred $114 million of restructuring charges in Q2 FY26 associated with an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced during the quarter. The charges represent employee termination benefits and approximately $40 million of asset impairments. The restructuring initiative is intended to redirect resources for better alignment with changing customer behaviors and the company’s strategy.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

In Q2 FY26, the company returned a total of $266 million to shareholders through dividends of $201 million and share repurchases of $65 million. On a year-to-date basis, the company has returned a total of $568 million to shareholders through dividends of $403 million and share repurchases of $165 million. The company expects to spend approximately $300 million on share repurchases during FY26.

Today, the company announced its board of directors has authorized the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.95 per common share. The quarterly dividend is payable on October 9, 2025, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 18, 2025.

Conference Call

Best Buy is scheduled to conduct an earnings conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (7:00 a.m. Central Time) on August 28, 2025. A webcast of the call is expected to be available at www.investors.bestbuy.com, both live and after the call.

Notes:

(1) The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. For additional information on comparable sales, please see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and available at www.investors.bestbuy.com.

(2) A reconciliation of the projected adjusted operating income rate, adjusted effective income tax rate, and adjusted diluted EPS, which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, is not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty predicting the occurrence, the financial impact and the periods in which the non-GAAP adjustments may be recognized. These GAAP measures may include the impact of such items as restructuring charges; price-fixing settlements; goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairments; gains and losses on disposals of subsidiaries and certain investments; amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions; certain acquisition-related costs; and the tax effect of all such items. Historically, the company has excluded these items from non-GAAP financial measures. The company currently expects to continue to exclude these items in future disclosures of non-GAAP financial measures and may also exclude other items that may arise (collectively, “non-GAAP adjustments”). The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of non-GAAP adjustments, such as a decision to exit part of the business or reaching settlement of a legal dispute, are inherently unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

($ in millions, except per share amounts)

(Unaudited and subject to reclassification)

The following information provides reconciliations of the most comparable consolidated financial measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP financial measures) to presented consolidated adjusted financial measures (non-GAAP financial measures). The company believes that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, presented non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on disposals of subsidiaries and certain investments, amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-GAAP financial measures when the company believes this provides greater clarity to management and investors. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the company’s financial statements and other publicly filed reports. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250827986893/en/659460/22/BBY_Logo_New.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 09:12:28.069973

Kristine Kobe when at Keurig Dr Pepper’s in-house agency, Liquid Sunshine, had to merge two creative organisations post-acquisition.
But you can’t build a great in-house agency by these alone.","Ask someone in marketing to describe the defining characteristics of a great in-house agency and they’ll probably mention agility, cost savings or maybe successful stewarding of the brand.

However, after having spent the past several years interviewing more than 50 senior in-house leaders for the Inside Jobs podcast, its clear that the most important differentiator isn’t operational at all. It’s all about the people.

And not just any people. The best in-house agency leaders, and the teams they build often in their image, are a fascinating, slightly paradoxical bunch. They come from wildly different backgrounds, but they share a surprisingly consistent set of traits that make them uniquely effective at working inside a brand.

Take Donovan Stohlberg, now leading creative services at Securian Financial. Donovan started out in theatre, directing plays before making the leap into corporate life. At first glance, that might raise a few eyebrows. But listen to him talk about his work and you’ll quickly realise that directing a cast isn’t that different from guiding stakeholders, shaping scripts isn’t far from shaping strategy, and storytelling. His success is shown in the fact that today his 30-person team is not only delivering creative, they’re driving culture.

That’s not a unique story. These people come from everywhere. Some are ex-agency leaders drawn by the promise of long-term brand-building. Others are client-side lifers who’ve picked up production and creative instincts by sheer necessity. Some (like a few guests we’ve had) started in architecture, or journalism, or UX before finding their way to creative leadership. No two paths look the same.

But what they have in common is clearly not a shared résumé, it’s a shared outlook. Across the board, three traits surface again, and again:

First, they are often humble though influential. Rarely the loudest in the room, but often the smartest. It’s a strange tightrope to walk. In-house teams don’t have the outside agency halo. They’re not usually seen as the experts in the room. That’s why the best ones become the experts, not by shouting louder, but by asking better questions. Beth Anne Mandia at TruStage talked about her team’s transformation from order-takers to strategic partners. Not through brute force, but through business fluency, creative confidence, and a willingness to challenge the brief with curiosity, not ego. A strategy flawlessly executed, and an accomplishment that is by no means exceptional among this cohort.

Second: they’re resilient. Being in-house means living inside the same walls as your clients. There’s no escape. You deal with the messy middle such conflicting priorities, last-minute pivots, and stakeholder layers that make a Jenga tower look stable. Kristine Kobe when at Keurig Dr Pepper’s in-house agency, Liquid Sunshine, had to merge two creative organisations post-acquisition. Imagine trying to unify cultures, toolsets, and expectations while still shipping work daily, and win awards off the back of it. She credits emotional intelligence and relentless communication as her secret weapons.

Third, and maybe this is the most important, they’re quietly proud of being in it for the long haul. There’s something different about building a brand from the inside. There’s less glory, maybe, but there’s more depth. Ekaterina Bueva, who leads Kraft Heinz’s network of global in-house teams, has built an operation that balances consistency with local flexibility. Her people aren’t in it for the case study, they’re definitely in it for the impact.

Of course, I’m not saying structure, technology, and process don’t matter, they obviously do. But you can’t build a great in-house agency by these alone. It has to start with the people who show up every day and fight for better briefs, clearer thinking, smarter strategy, and more resonant creativity.",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2025-08/1349x2.6owCiVRU.png,N,,2025-08-28 07:12:27.119902

Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) reported second-quarter revenue of $1.74 billion, a 10.1% year-on-year increase, according to a source. The company's performance surpassed Wall Street's estimates by 4.3%. Its non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.37, matching analyst expectations.

For the next quarter, Agilent provided revenue guidance of $1.83 billion at the midpoint, which is 3.4% above consensus estimates and represents a projected 7.7% year-on-year sales increase. Sell-side analysts project revenue growth of 3.9% over the next 12 months, a figure that, while positive, remains below the sector average. Data from the IndexBox platform indicates that this projected growth aligns with broader, moderate trends in the life sciences tools market.

Over the past five years, Agilent's sales have grown at a compounded annual rate of 5.4%, which is below the healthcare sector average. A two-year view shows annual revenue declined by 1.5%. The company's organic revenue, which excludes currency impacts and M&A activity, averaged a 2.1% decline over the same two-year period, indicating core operational challenges.

Agilent has maintained strong profitability, with an average operating margin of 21.6% over the last five years. Its trailing twelve-month operating margin stands at 21.3%, representing a 1.1 percentage point increase over the past two years. In Q2, the operating margin was 20.7%, consistent with the year-ago quarter.

The company's earnings per share grew at an 11.3% compounded annual rate over five years, significantly outpacing its revenue growth. This was partly due to a 8.7% reduction in its share count from stock buybacks.

Michael Ryskin has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors impacting Agilent’s financial outlook. The company reported strong core growth and sales figures that exceeded expectations, with significant contributions from its key segments. However, despite this positive momentum, Agilent faces challenges with tariff impacts that are pressuring margins in the fiscal year 2025, which are expected to be mitigated by fiscal year 2026 through strategic actions.

Ryskin also notes that while Agilent’s valuation appears fair and its earnings estimates for 2026 are in a good position, the current market conditions and expected margin pressures justify a Neutral stance. The price objective remains at $128, reflecting a balanced view of the company’s potential upside and the risks associated with the tariff-related headwinds. This combination of strong growth prospects tempered by near-term margin pressures supports the Hold rating.

Starting next year, Whole Foods employees will receive Amazon stock in lieu of annual bonuses. Analysts predict a potential 14.02% upside for Amazon's stock, while GuruFocus estimates suggest a possible downside of 8.86%.

Amazon (AMZN) is taking a significant step towards integrating its Whole Foods Market subsidiary by aligning employee benefits with its own corporate perks. Starting next year, Whole Foods corporate employees will see changes that include the phasing out of unique perks such as in-store discounts and remote work options. Instead, they will receive Amazon stock in lieu of annual bonuses. This move aims to unify and enhance collaboration within Amazon's grocery operations [1].

The changes are part of Amazon's broader strategy to centralize operations and scale back some of Whole Foods' distinctive perks and benefits. According to Amazon spokesperson Lauren Snyder, the integration is designed to ""propel collaboration and innovation"" [1]. The shift will take effect on December 8, 2025, with in-store discounts for Whole Foods employees retained until 2027 [1].

Analysts predict a potential 14.02% upside for Amazon's stock following this announcement. GuruFocus estimates suggest a possible downside of 8.86% from the current price [2]. The average one-year price target for Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) stands at $261.93, with a high estimate of $306.00 and a low estimate of $206.00 [2]. The consensus recommendation from brokerage firms places Amazon at an ""Outperform"" status, indicating a positive outlook among analysts [2].

The integration of Whole Foods employee benefits with Amazon's corporate perks reflects Amazon's broader strategy to consolidate its grocery operations and compete with rivals like Walmart (WMT), Instacart (CART), and Kroger (KR) [1]. This move is expected to streamline operations and foster innovation within the company's grocery business.

The company specializes in measurement instruments for the communications, electronics, life sciences, and chemistry sectors, with net sales primarily from product sales (71.8%) and services (28.2%). Geographically, sales are distributed mainly between the US (34.5%), China and Hong Kong (18.7%), and other regions (46.8%).

Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) is set to announce its fiscal third-quarter (FQ3) 2025 earnings on August 27th, following the market close. The consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimate stands at $1.37, while revenue is projected to reach $1.67 billion [1]. Over the past two years, Agilent has consistently exceeded earnings expectations, a record of 100% success in beating estimates [2].

The company's Q3 2025 guidance reveals a mixed performance across its operating segments. The Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) is projected to deliver a 75.2% year-over-year revenue increase to $720.15 million, driven by strong demand for consumables, automation, and services. Conversely, the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group (LDG) is expected to contract by 19.3% to $631.29 million, reflecting softness in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and biopharma markets [1].

Agilent's Ignite Transformation program, focused on supply chain diversification, pricing discipline, and organizational efficiency, is projected to deliver $130 million in FY25 profit. Early wins include $80 million in annualized savings from organizational agility improvements and $50 million from procurement centralization, offsetting tariff-related costs by FY26 [1].

The company's stock has experienced volatility over the past decade, with a 35.5% surge in 2021 followed by declines in 2022, 2023, and 2024. As of July 2025, the stock trades at $120.35, 27.8% below its 52-week high of $153.84 but 19.9% above its 52-week low of $96.43 [1].

Wall Street analysts have assigned Agilent a ""Moderate Buy"" rating, with a mean price target of $139.77, 16% above current levels. Eight analysts advocate a ""Strong Buy,"" while eight recommend a ""Hold,"" reflecting diverging views on the company's ability to sustain growth in a post-pandemic world [1].

For investors considering an entry, Agilent's current valuation—trading at a P/E of 28.91—appears reasonable relative to its projected 5.7% EPS growth in FY25 and 8.8% in FY26. However, the LDG's underperformance and macroeconomic risks, such as U.S. funding uncertainties for academia and government labs, warrant caution [1].

A strategic exit may be justified for investors prioritizing short-term stability. The LDG's 19.3% decline in Q3 2025 and the broader market's sensitivity to interest rates could pressure the stock further in the near term [1].

Agilent Technologies' Q3 2025 outlook presents a nuanced picture. While the LDG's underperformance and macroeconomic headwinds are valid concerns, the ACG's explosive growth, Ignite Transformation's momentum, and the company's strong balance sheet provide a compelling case for a cautious entry. Investors with a 3–5 year horizon may find value in Agilent's strategic pivot toward high-growth areas like PFAS testing and advanced therapies, particularly as its Ignite savings begin to fully materialize in FY26.

For now, the stock's 16% upside potential and ""Moderate Buy"" consensus justify a watchful approach. Those who can stomach near-term volatility may find Agilent's mix of innovation and operational discipline a rewarding long-term bet.

Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) reported its Q3 2025 financial results, beating analyst expectations on both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue. The company's GAAP EPS came in at $1.37, exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.17 by $0.20. Revenue for the quarter reached $1.74 billion, a 10.1% year-over-year (YoY) increase and $70 million above the projected $1.67 billion. Following the announcement, Agilent's shares rose 2.12% after hours.

The earnings report highlighted Agilent's mixed performance across its operating segments. The Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) delivered a significant 75.2% YoY revenue increase to $720.15 million, driven by strong demand for consumables, automation, and services. Conversely, the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group (LDG) experienced a 19.3% decline to $631.29 million, reflecting softness in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and biopharma markets [1].

Agilent's Ignite Transformation program continues to show promise, delivering $130 million in FY25 profit. The program's early wins include $80 million in annualized savings from organizational agility improvements and $50 million from procurement centralization, offsetting tariff-related costs by FY26 [1].

Investor sentiment toward Agilent remains mixed. Wall Street analysts have assigned the company a ""Moderate Buy"" rating with a mean price target of $139.77, 16% above current levels. Eight analysts recommend a ""Strong Buy,"" while eight advocate a ""Hold,"" reflecting diverging views on the company's ability to sustain growth in a post-pandemic world [1].

Agilent's current valuation, trading at a P/E of 28.91, appears reasonable relative to its projected 5.7% EPS growth in FY25 and 8.8% in FY26. However, the LDG's underperformance and macroeconomic risks, such as U.S. funding uncertainties for academia and government labs, warrant caution [1].

South Africa is losing market share in neighbouring countries because of a lack of support for local manufacturing, ceramics manufacturer and retailer Italtile said.

“An onerous regulatory environment, deteriorating infrastructure, uncertain energy supply and spiralling municipal costs” are “leading to the acceleration of de‑industrialisation,” the Johannesburg-based tile-maker and retailer said in commentary accompanying its first-half results report. The introduction of import tariffs by Zambia and Zimbabwe to protect their local production also affected the ability of South African producers to export into these countries, the group said.

Italtile’s criticism echoes comments by the local unit of ArcelorMittal SA, which gives high power prices, limited protection against steel imports from China and a poorly run state-owned rail service as some of the reasons behind the planned closure of loss-making construction-steel mills.

Manufacturing accounts for about 14 percent of gross domestic product, and the industry is the fourth-largest employer in the country. However, a purchasing managers’ index that tracks factory sentiment has been in contractionary territory for most of the last two-and-a-half years, as global and domestic uncertainty and weak consumer demand weigh on prospects. — Moneyweb",https://www.heraldonline.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cropped-the-heraldonline-new-logo-27-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-28 12:49:06.348835

Colgate-Palmolive’s 2024 Sustainability and Social Impact Report emphasises the company’s passion for sustainability and drive to climate action to reach net zero.

Governance and strategy

Colgate-Palmolive assesses and manages its ESG risks through its Enterprise Risk Management process, as well as identifying climate transition and plastic transition as two of the critical risks facing the company.

These risks provide an opportunity for the company to drive innovation and growth, strengthen brand reputation and demonstrate its commitment to responsible business practices.

The organisation has a cross-functional ESG Reporting Task Force that monitors and works to prepare for existing and emerging ESG disclosure regulations and frameworks.

Materiality assessments ensure alignment between stakeholder priorities and business goals.

Sustainability is integrated into risk management, procurement and innovation processes, while progress is tracked against recognised frameworks including working on 14 out of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

“Our sustainability efforts also help to strengthen our business,” says Ann Tracy, CSO of Colgate-Palmolive, in the sustainability report.

“We believe that some consumers favour brands from companies that act responsibly and will recognise our leadership in this space and choose our brands

“We are proud of our progress so far, but there is more work to be done.

“We strive to be better for the people who use our products and drive value throughout our business. Getting this principle right will result in reducing our impact on the planet.”

Climate action and environment

Colgate has advanced its sustainability journey across key areas including climate action, waste reduction and packaging innovation, with a strong focus on creating circular and environmentally responsible solutions.

Central to this effort is packaging, where Colgate continues to lead with its first-of-its-kind recyclable toothpaste tube, now accessible in more than 70 countries and with approximately 95% of toothpaste tubes in North America already converted to recyclable designs.

By December 2024, 93% of Colgate’s packaging was recyclable, reusable or compostable, with progress also made in reducing virgin plastic use, down 25% from a 2019 baseline and increasing post-consumer recycled content, which reached 21% in 2024.

The company’s 2025 targets, set through the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Global Plastics Commitment, include reducing virgin plastic by one-third, using 25% post-consumer recycled plastic and eliminating unnecessary or problematic packaging.

Beyond packaging, Colgate has signed renewable energy agreements, set a net zero carbon target for 2040 and continues to mitigate climate-related risks across its global operations.

Strategic partnerships, such as those with the U.S. Plastics Pact, The Recycling Partnership and innovative start-ups, are helping accelerate progress on recyclability, waste reduction and emissions reduction.

These collective efforts reflect Colgate’s holistic approach to sustainability, sourcing responsibly, designing efficiently, advancing circular systems and inspiring positive behaviour, to reimagine a healthier future for people, pets and the planet.

Colgate-Palmolive's vision

The company has also committed to achieve various targets by 2030 and 2040.

By 2030

The company aims to increase annual sourcing of renewable electricity from 35% in 2020 to 100%.

Another target is to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from Purchased Goods and Services by 42% against a 2020 baseline.

Colgate-Palmolive is also aiming to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in operations by 42% against a 2020 baseline

By 2040

The aim is to reach net zero carbon emissions across the value chain, excluding Scope 3 optional emissions per SBTi Net Zero Standard.

As well as reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% against a 2020 baseline, excluding Scope 3 Categories 9, 11 and 12 and optional emissions per SBTi Net Zero Standard.

“At Colgate-Palmolive, we're committed to reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet,” writes Ann on LinkedIn.

“We are driving social impact, helping millions of homes and preserving our environment.”

Sustainable supply chains

Colgate is driving sustainable sourcing by working closely with key suppliers to build deforestation- and conversion-free supply chains, with particular focus on palm and soy.

This strategy combines certified materials, geospatial monitoring and deep supplier engagement to ensure ethical, resilient and transparent practices across global operations.

Through initiatives such as the CDP Water Supply Chain Program and supplier webinars in water-stressed regions, Colgate promotes water stewardship, encouraging partners to measure and manage their own water risks.

The company also collaborates with organisations like the Fair Labor Association to strengthen human rights protections, including responsible recruitment in the Malaysian palm oil sector.

In addition, Colgate actively participates in cross-industry coalitions such as the Forest Positive Coalition to drive systemic change and prioritises recycled content in pulp and paper products to reduce environmental impacts.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/387e1f071c169ab53315f143d08cef3d:381ec342f8f4230fb73ac515fd406635/colgate-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 07:12:22.201213

BOQ confirmed it's exploring a whole-of-loan sale process for up to approximately $3.8 billion of its equipment finance portfolio. This move is intended to enhance the bank's capital flexibility and improve its Return on Equity (ROE). The proposed transaction aims to transfer the underlying assets, net interest income, and credit loss exposure to a capital partner, thereby generating capital light earnings for BOQ. The completion of this transaction is targeted for the first half of FY26, contingent upon acceptable terms and Board approval.

In a parallel development, BOQ has entered into a strategic partnership with Capgemini. This collaboration focuses on agentic artificial intelligence (AI), information technology, and business processing services. The partnership with Capgemini is designed to simplify BOQ's operating model, digitise processes, improve customer experience, and support scalable growth. As part of this initiative, BOQ plans to co-create an AI academy with Capgemini to upskill its workforce for an AI-driven future.

The partnership is expected to lower BOQ's cost to serve, with anticipated annualised cost savings of at least $30 million from FY27.

""We are fundamentally transforming the way we operate and how we allocate capital to support customer growth and deliver sustainable shareholder returns in a structurally challenged market. We are making transformative decisions for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders through disciplined execution of our plans,"" stated Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer Patrick Allaway.

The news comes as BOQ provided financial guidance, expecting to report cash earnings after tax in the range of $375 - $385 million for FY25, reflecting an increase of 9% to 12% on FY24. Additionally, the bank anticipates a FY25 Cash ROE uplift of between 50 and 70 basis points compared to FY24. However, BOQ is no longer providing specific ROE and Cost to Income (CTI) targets for FY26, citing an unpredictable operating environment and industry headwinds.

The Personal Systems segment's strength, coupled with strategic cost discipline and AI innovation, provides a compelling case for long-term value creation.
However, the Printing segment's challenges—while not catastrophic—highlight the need for continued agility in a rapidly evolving market.","HP Inc.'s Q3 2025 earnings report paints a starkly contrasting picture of growth and stagnation across its two core segments. While the Personal Systems division surged ahead with robust revenue gains and margin recovery, the Printing segment faced headwinds from declining hardware demand and pricing pressures. For investors, the critical question is whether the PC market's momentum can offset the Printing segment's struggles and solidify HP's long-term value proposition.

Personal Systems: A Catalyst for Growth

The Personal Systems segment delivered a 6% year-over-year revenue increase ($9.9 billion), driven by a 5% rise in unit sales and a 5%–10% price premium for AI PCs. This segment now accounts for 25% of HP's Personal Systems mix, a full quarter ahead of internal targets. The Windows 11 refresh cycle and strong back-to-school demand in North America and China further fueled growth.

Key drivers include:

- AI PC Adoption: HP's strategic focus on AI-enabled devices has positioned it to capitalize on the shift toward high-performance computing. These units not only command higher prices but also align with enterprise and consumer demand for productivity-enhancing tools.

- Margin Recovery: A 5.4% operating margin reflects successful cost mitigation, including supply chain diversification and pricing adjustments. This marks a return to profitability after years of trade-related headwinds.

- Geographic Diversification: Strong performance in China and North America underscores HP's ability to adapt to regional demand cycles, reducing reliance on volatile markets.

Printing Segment: Navigating a Shifting Landscape

The Printing segment, however, reported a 4% revenue decline ($4.0 billion), with hardware units down 9% year-over-year. Consumer and Commercial Printing revenue fell 8% and 3%, respectively, as enterprises redirected IT budgets toward AI and PC investments. Pricing pressures exacerbated the decline, with competitive dynamics limiting margin expansion.

Yet, the segment's 17.3% operating margin highlights resilience. HP's focus on high-margin subscription services—such as consumer print subscriptions, which grew double-digit year-over-year—and industrial graphics (e.g., large-format printers for architecture and engineering) provides a buffer. Additionally, stable page volume suggests underlying demand for printing solutions may persist, even as hardware sales wane.

Strategic Resilience: Balancing the Scales

HP's ability to offset Printing weaknesses hinges on its strategic initiatives:

1. Supply Chain Optimization: Nearly all North American products are now manufactured outside China, reducing exposure to tariffs and trade disruptions. This shift, combined with $2 billion in annualized cost savings by FY2025, strengthens margins.

2. AI-Driven Innovation: Partnerships with software vendors like Adobe and Zoom to integrate AI capabilities into hardware create a sticky ecosystem, enhancing customer retention.

3. Capital Allocation Discipline: $1.5 billion in free cash flow and $400 million returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks demonstrate a commitment to shareholder value, even amid segment-level challenges.

Investment Outlook: A Tug-of-War Between Growth and Risk

For investors, HP's Q3 results highlight a pivotal inflection point. The Personal Systems segment's growth trajectory—anchored by AI PCs and Windows 11—positions HP to benefit from the broader tech upcycle. However, the Printing segment's decline, though manageable for now, raises questions about long-term sustainability in a market increasingly dominated by digital workflows.

Key Considerations for Investors:

- PC Market Tailwinds: The mid-single-digit growth forecast for the PC market in H2 2025, driven by AI adoption and refresh cycles, offers a clear runway for HP's Personal Systems division.

- Printing Segment Exposure: While HP's focus on subscriptions and industrial graphics mitigates some risk, the segment's revenue decline could weigh on overall growth if hardware demand remains soft.

- Valuation Metrics: HP's forward P/E ratio of 12.3x (as of August 2025) appears undemanding relative to peers like Dell (14.1x) and Lenovo (10.8x), suggesting potential upside if PC momentum accelerates.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on Tech's Future

HP's Q3 earnings underscore a company in transition. The Personal Systems segment's strength, coupled with strategic cost discipline and AI innovation, provides a compelling case for long-term value creation. However, the Printing segment's challenges—while not catastrophic—highlight the need for continued agility in a rapidly evolving market. For investors with a medium-term horizon, HP offers a balanced bet: exposure to the AI-driven PC boom, tempered by the risks of a maturing Printing business. Those who prioritize resilience over rapid growth may find HP's disciplined capital allocation and margin stability appealing, but should remain vigilant about macroeconomic shifts that could amplify Printing segment vulnerabilities.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-28 06:06:22.001621

Walmart says these initiatives will accelerate seller growth, expand international reach and deliver unmatched omnichannel capabilities. The company says it reinforces its commitment to marketplace integrity and exceptional customer experiences.

“Walmart has become one of the fastest-growing eCommerce platforms by focusing on what matters most. Integrity, seller success and delivering exceptional experiences for customers,” said Manish Joneja, Senior VP, Walmart US Marketplace and Walmart Fulfilment Services. “Everything we’re building — from smarter tools to expanded fulfilment and global reach — is designed to accelerate seller growth. It will empower sellers to serve customers while driving their businesses forward,” Joneja added.

Key Insights:

At this year’s Let’s Grow! Marketplace Seller Summit, Walmart introduced new AI-powered tools and seller incentives to help sellers grow faster, operate more efficiently, and reach more customers.

They also announced expanded Next-Day Delivery in major metros and enhanced omnichannel opportunities — including showcasing Marketplace items in-store.

Smarter tools and capabilities to supercharge selling

Walmart is equipping sellers with AI-powered tools that simplify operations, save time and increase sales. These innovations are shaped by seller feedback and are designed to help sellers optimise every part of their business. From listing products faster to managing operations more efficiently and engaging customers with confidence. Tools and capabilities include:

AI-Powered Listing Tool and Smart Assistant: Single and bulk item setup tools reduce time-to-market and increase conversion rates, while Smart Assistant provides 24/7 real-time support.

Seller Advisors Programme: Walmart Seller Advisors Program, spanning categories, regions and business sizes, provides a direct line of feedback to Walmart leaders. Their feedback and insights help co-create impactful programs and solutions, fostering marketplace integrity and a healthy business ecosystem.

Shipping Settings and Services: Sellers who self-fulfil can automate delivery promises by region, offering customers more delivery promises.

Brand Portal: Protect brands and flag fraudulent activity with an enhanced focus on product authenticity.

By pairing cutting-edge technology with targeted incentives, Walmart says it is empowering sellers to operate more efficiently. In addition to standing out in competitive categories and meet customer demand, especially during the holiday season.

Expanded reach and faster fulfilment

Walmart says it is making it easier than ever for sellers to reach more customers. Both across the US and around the world.

Next-Day Shipping in Major Metros: Walmart Fulfilment Services (WFS) now offers expanded Next-Day Delivery coverage across top US cities. This includes Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Houston and Atlanta. Walmart says this means faster, more reliable delivery of Marketplace items to millions of Walmart customers.

Competitive Rates and Higher Sales: WFS helps sellers streamline fulfilment at rates ~15% less on average than competitors, driving stronger results. Sellers using WFS see, on average, a 50% lift in GMV on items tagged Walmart Fulfilled and 2-Day Shipping. Through Multichannel Solutions, Sellers can use WFS to fulfil orders from their own website, social media shops and other marketplaces.

Expanding Opportunities: With Walmart, sellers have access to reach customers across multiple marketplaces — including the US, Canada, Mexico and Chile. At the same time tapping into tools like Walmart Connect 3P Sponsored Ads to help boost visibility and sales.

Next-level omnichannel opportunities

Walmart is creating a true omnichannel marketplace that benefits both sellers and customers. These innovations are connecting online convenience with in-store trust. The company says unlocking new ways for sellers to reach customers by blending the digital and physical shopping experience.

In-Store Digital Discovery

In April, Walmart opened its new Cypress, Texas, location, which features digital QR codes throughout the store. These codes allow customers to access digital tools, services and an extended online assortment. Walmart is bringing the extended Marketplace aisle into stores, starting with a few items on display. Customers can purchase through the Walmart app and even have their items professionally installed.

As Walmart Marketplace continues to evolve, these new investments underscore the company’s commitment to empowering sellers, enabling global expansion and delivering seamless omnichannel experiences for customers everywhere.

By leveraging advanced technology, expanding fulfilment capabilities and deepening integration between online and in-store shopping, Walmart is building a marketplace ecosystem where sellers of all sizes can thrive — and customers can discover even more value and convenience.

Last year, Walmart said eCommerce accounted for 18% of its global sales, up from 11% five years prior. The retailer also said it lowered its delivery costs by 20% in the previous quarter for the US business. Furthermore, its US marketplace revenue grew 37% year over year in the fourth quarter of last year, ending February.

Enterprise Times: What this means for business

Several years ago, Walmart fully embraced digital rather than become just another retail website outlet. The company adopted key strategies to enhance its online business including expanding delivery services, leveraging physical stores for online fulfilment, and acquiring other e-commerce businesses.

The company also focuses on its subscription service, Walmart+, and uses artificial intelligence to improve its online catalogue and customer experience. So, the company’s latest announcements are a continuation of this particular journey. This includes AI-powered tools, expanded fulfilment to major metro cities, and new incentives that equip Marketplace sellers to grow faster and reach more customers.

Walmart says all the recently announced developments are geared to support seller growth. To empower sellers to serve customers while driving their businesses forward. The smarter tools, more sophisticated fulfilment and providing global reach will definitely enable sellers to support and build customer base. It will be interesting to see how other possible competitors to Walmart – Shopify, Amazon, Alibaba, Target, and eBay will react to these changes.

These platforms compete by offering vast product selections, strategic pricing, and strong logistical capabilities. Though they often differentiate themselves through specialised niches.

However, none of these players have the high street physical reach and presence of Walmart. As a result, it’s the continued integration of the digital and physical space which makes this announcement interesting. Walmart appears to be attempting to create a true omnichannel marketplace that could potentially support both sellers and customers.",https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pexels-equalstock-31112239.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 07:12:31.441352

— Source: Agilent Technologies Disclaimer: This article does not necessarily reflect the views of AsianScientist or its staff.","AsianScientist (Aug. 28, 2025) – Agilent Technologies is no stranger to transformation. For more than two decades, the scientific-instruments leader has grown its footprint in Singapore from regional base to globally recognized innovation hub—one of only five local facilities named by the World Economic Forum as a Lighthouse for advanced manufacturing.

Now, with a newly launched enterprise-wide transformation called Ignite, Agilent is sharpening its customer focus and doubling down on collaboration, digitalization and agility. Padraig McDonnell, president and CEO of Agilent, discusses the company’s evolving priorities, Singapore’s strategic role and the multiplier effect of partnership.

1. Agilent has had a strong presence in Singapore for over 25 years. Why was it important to expand into Southeast Asia, and how has this proved beneficial for both Agilent and Singapore?

Singapore has played a huge role in Agilent’s growth story. At the highest level, we’re here to bring great science to life, and that comes to life through our deep focus on customers and enabling outcomes in life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets. Southeast Asia, and Asia more broadly, is a fast-growing and diverse region.

Singapore has been an amazing hub in Asia for us. We have over 600 skilled scientists, engineers and other employees here and a 172,000 square foot facility. Over the years, we’ve expanded from automation to mass spectrometry solutions. In 2017, our investment of S$85 million in manufacturing and research activities embodies the trust we have in Singapore’s innovation ecosystem.

What makes Singapore especially attractive is the combination of geographic advantage, world-class infrastructure, pro-innovation policies and strong IP protection. Above all, it is the talent and capability—we value Singapore’s focus on developing talent in both scientific areas and leadership.

2. Agilent recently launched its Ignite transformation. What is the strategic vision behind it and how will customers benefit?

It’s a company-wide transformation designed to help us scale more effectively and serve customers better. The strategy is centered on markets and customers, not just products, and that shift helps us stay aligned with what matters most to the people we serve.

We have a long-range plan of 5 to 7% core revenue growth annually and double-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth. Ignite is also about how we operate. We want to simplify global processes, reduce complexity and build a more agile value chain.

For customers, this means shorter lead times, greater consistency and quality, and faster response to their needs. It also means faster product launches and co-innovation. For instance, in areas like PFAS analysis or biopharma workflows, we’re accelerating how quickly analytical instruments reach the hands of researchers.

3. Agilent has launched several collaborative projects here with partners like NUS, NTU, NCCS and NUH. Why are such partnerships so important in the clinical lab technology space?

Partnerships bring complementary strengths together across academic rigour, clinical insight and technological expertise. That’s really powerful in the clinical-laboratory space, where speed and precision can directly impact patient outcomes.

Take our collaboration with NUS Medicine and NUH. We launched a S$38 million translational R&D hub in 2019 to boost clinical diagnostics and testing through biochemical innovation and techniques. The alliance has since produced over 95 scientific publications and more than 50 local and international partnerships. More recently, we partnered with NCCS to accelerate genomic profiling of Asian-prevalent cancers using our fully automated NGS library prep systems.

We’re also working with NUS Medicine to support cardiovascular and metabolic disease research through the new Centre of Excellence in Cell Metabolism. These are all structured, outcome-oriented collaborations that bring science from bench to bedside.

The way I look at it is: The world is our laboratory. Great ideas don’t come from Agilent alone. By building the right partnerships among government, industry and academia in key areas of research, we can accelerate science advancement and advance the quality of life.

4. How do these partnerships ultimately improve Agilent’s offerings for customers?

Our partnerships close the gap between innovation and implementation. Working with leading clinicians and researchers enables us to design technologies that fit real-world lab workflows. That makes our solutions more relevant and easier to adopt.

It also speeds up the feedback loop. We can test, validate and refine solutions in partnership with our collaborators, which shortens time-to-market and ensures that customers benefit from scientific advances sooner.

Another important aspect is local responsiveness. These partnerships deepen our understanding of market needs in Asia and help us provide more tailored support in many facets — from product design to service to education.

Going forward, I think what we’re going to see is even faster connection with customers around some of the most difficult challenges we have in our world.

5. Agilent is also pushing forward with scalable AI and digital-lab solutions. What changes should customers expect?

Through our Global Solution Development Center in Singapore and beyond, we’ve built a comprehensive digital-lab ecosystem that transforms research labs’ potential into peak performance.

Our focus spans four key optimization areas: data, instruments, the lab environment and the broader enterprise. By integrating AI-driven insights with connected technologies, we simplify complex workflows, automate processes and enhance data accuracy across research and production.

Scientists can expect more predictive analytics, seamless instrument connectivity and improved solutions that reduce labor-intensive workflows and variability. Harnessing Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies, we drive efficiency and sustainability—whether it’s how our instruments work or the way we build them. Our commitment is demonstrated through four smart factories recognized by the World Economic Forum for their breakthroughs in scaling 4IR.

It’s very clear that in today’s competitive landscape, digitalization is no longer a “nice-to-have.” Digitalization is foundational to how labs perform and we’re proud to help our customers lead that transition.

6. Looking ahead, what’s your vision for Agilent in the next five years?

We strive to be even more customer-centric. That’s the core of everything we’re doing. We’re continuing to invest in innovation—both organic and through M&A, and we’re expanding into high-growth adjacencies.

We’re also enabling greater automation and enhancing our software capabilities to support labs around the world. The goal is to make it easier for customers to solve complex challenges, whether that’s speeding up therapeutic development or detecting microplastics more effectively.

Ultimately, we’re building an enduring company that can help accelerate scientific progress while staying deeply connected to the people who use our technologies every day.

Good results for Snowflake Snowflake raised its annual forecast for product revenue from $4.33 billion to $4.40 billion.","The latest quarterly figures from several leading US technology companies paint a mixed picture. While Nvidia and Snowflake exceeded expectations and raised their forecasts, HP presented solid results, and CrowdStrike struggled with the aftermath of its infamous Windows outage.

Nvidia saw revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 increase by 56 percent to $46.7 billion, exceeding market expectations. Profits and margins were also higher than predicted. The data center division, with its new Blackwell chips, posted 17 percent quarter-on-quarter growth. For the current quarter, the company is targeting revenue of $54 billion, slightly above consensus but below the most optimistic estimates. Investors had expected more: the stock fell 3 percent after hours. CEO Jensen Huang spoke of an unprecedented wave of investment in AI infrastructure, which will require trillions of dollars worldwide in the years to come.

HP shares fall

HP Inc. reported a 3.1 percent increase in revenue to $13.9 billion, higher than expected. Net profit climbed to $763 million, or $0.80 per share. On an adjusted basis, the $0.75 figure was exactly in line with analysts’ forecasts. CEO Enrique Lores emphasized that HP had achieved revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, primarily driven by Personal Systems and a strong performance in growth regions. Nevertheless, the stock fell 1.9 percent in after-hours trading.

Good results for Snowflake

Snowflake raised its annual forecast for product revenue from $4.33 billion to $4.40 billion. In the second quarter, product revenue totaled $1.09 billion, in line with expectations, while remaining performance obligations increased 33 percent to $6.9 billion. CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy highlighted the strong growth of Microsoft Azure within the platform, particularly in the EMEA region. Analysts view Snowflake as a logical choice for companies seeking to centralize their AI infrastructure. The stock rose 13 percent in after-hours trading.

CrowdStrike struggles with outage

CrowdStrike reported revenue growth of 21 percent to $1.17 billion in the second quarter, above market expectations, and adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share, well above forecasts. However, the outlook fell short: for the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $1.21 to $1.22 billion, slightly below analysts’ expectations.

Positive Points

HP Inc (HPQ, Financial) delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of growth, with top-line revenue increasing 3% year over year.

The company achieved double-digit growth in key growth areas, including AI PCs and advanced compute solutions.

HP Inc (HPQ) successfully mitigated higher trade-related costs by diversifying manufacturing and implementing cost reductions.

The Personal Systems segment saw a 6% revenue growth year over year, driven by strong demand for AI PCs and Windows 11 refresh.

HP Inc (HPQ) is on track to achieve $2 billion in future-ready gross annualized savings by the end of fiscal year 2025.

Negative Points

Print revenue declined 3% in constant currency, with a softer-than-expected demand in the office segment.

The company faced a more aggressive pricing environment in the Print business, impacting profitability.

Gross margin decreased year over year due to a higher mix from Personal Systems and increased trade-related costs.

The Print segment experienced market-driven hardware declines in both consumer and commercial categories.

HP Inc (HPQ) noted that some companies are delaying IT projects, affecting software demand in hybrid systems.

Q & A Highlights

Q: Can you quantify the impact of tariff-related costs in the quarter and how much was offset?

A: Karen Parkhill, HP Inc's Chief Financial Officer, explained that they made significant progress in mitigating tariff costs through supply chain optimization, cost reduction, and pricing actions. They managed to offset the majority of these costs in Q3, delivering EPS slightly above the midpoint of their guidance. Enrique Lores, HP Inc's CEO, added that most products sold in the US are now manufactured outside China, which helps mitigate future tariff impacts.

Q: With many enterprises announcing return-to-office initiatives, why hasn't there been an improvement in the Print business outlook?

A: Enrique Lores noted that enterprises are prioritizing investments in areas like AI and PCs over Print, impacting short-term hardware sales. However, the number of pages printed remains stable, indicating that demand for printers will eventually return as companies need to ensure employees have the right tools.

Q: Do AI PCs have a higher ASP or margin profile compared to non-AI PCs?

A: Enrique Lores confirmed that AI PCs carry a 5% to 10% price increase over similar non-AI units. The demand for AI PCs is driven by applications taking advantage of their capabilities, and HP is seeing strong growth in this category.

Q: What gives you confidence in the continued strength of the PC market, given recent strong growth?

A: Enrique Lores highlighted the ongoing Windows 11 refresh and AI PC adoption as key drivers. The funnel for Windows 11 is improving, and with only slightly more than 50% of the installed base converted, there is still significant potential for growth. Karen Parkhill added that they expect sequential revenue growth in line with prior-year seasonality.

Q: How do you view the future of Print margins given recent volatility?

A: Enrique Lores explained that the Q3 margin decline was due to lower supplies sales, a seasonal pattern similar to last year. They expect Print margins to be at the top end of their range in Q4, driven by higher supplies volumes and disciplined pricing. Long-term, they aim to maintain their current margin ranges while focusing on profitable unit placements and cost management.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000BA3.png?5,N,,2025-08-28 05:06:10.463074

Strategic Entry Points for Long-Term Investors For investors seeking exposure to the hardware sector, HP's valuation offers a compelling entry point—if risks are managed.","HP Inc.'s Q3 2025 earnings report offers a compelling case study in resilience for investors navigating the turbulent hardware sector. Despite macroeconomic headwinds and sector-specific challenges, the company delivered mixed but structurally significant results. While its Printing segment faced declining demand, the Personal Systems division drove revenue growth, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.75—within its guidance range—underscored operational discipline. This article evaluates HP's ability to balance margin stability with competitive positioning, and whether its valuation metrics justify a long-term defensive play in a market increasingly wary of cyclical tech stocks.

Operational Efficiency and Pricing Discipline: The $0.75 Signal

HP's non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.75 in Q3 2025, though down 10.7% year-over-year, reflects a strategic focus on cost control and pricing resilience. The Personal Systems segment, which accounts for 71% of revenue, grew 6% to $9.9 billion, driven by strong AI PC adoption and the Windows 11 upgrade cycle. This segment maintained a 5.4% operating margin, outperforming the Printing segment's 17.3% margin despite its revenue decline. The contrast highlights HP's ability to prioritize high-margin growth areas while managing legacy business costs.

The adjusted EPS also benefited from $50 million in after-tax adjustments, including restructuring charges and amortization. While these non-operational items masked GAAP's 23.1% EPS growth, they underscore HP's proactive approach to streamlining operations. For investors, this signals a company willing to invest in long-term efficiency, even at the expense of short-term volatility.

Margin Stability in a Volatile Market

The hardware sector's volatility is no secret. HP's Printing segment, which declined 4% to $4.0 billion, faced reduced office demand and supply chain disruptions. Yet, its 17.3% operating margin—despite a 9% drop in hardware units—demonstrates pricing discipline. This resilience is critical in a market where competitors often slash prices to retain market share. HP's ability to maintain margins in a shrinking segment suggests a strong brand premium and customer loyalty, particularly in commercial printing.

Meanwhile, the Personal Systems segment's 5% unit growth (8% in consumer and 3% in commercial) indicates HP's success in capturing demand for AI-enhanced devices. With global PC markets expected to stabilize in 2026, HP's early adoption of AI integration could position it as a leader in the next hardware cycle.

Valuation Metrics: A Discounted Opportunity?

HP's current valuation appears disconnected from its fundamentals. At a trailing P/E of 10.08x and a forward P/E of 8.15x, the stock trades at a steep discount to the Technology sector's 24.26x average. Analysts project a fair value of $65.07 per share via DCF analysis, over double the current price of $26.47. This disconnect is partly due to the Printing segment's drag and concerns over its -9.34 debt-to-equity ratio. However, HP's free cash flow of $1.5 billion in Q3 and a $2.6–$3.0 billion annual outlook provide a buffer for debt reduction and shareholder returns.

The company's 4.6% dividend yield further enhances its appeal as a defensive play. While tariffs and China exposure remain risks, HP's diversified supply chain and focus on AI-driven innovation mitigate long-term vulnerabilities.

Strategic Entry Points for Long-Term Investors

For investors seeking exposure to the hardware sector, HP's valuation offers a compelling entry point—if risks are managed. The stock's 52-week low of $21.21 and current price of $26.47 suggest a potential floor, while its DCF-derived intrinsic value of $65.07 implies significant upside if the Printing segment stabilizes. A strategic approach could involve dollar-cost averaging into the stock during market corrections, particularly if Q4 guidance aligns with the $0.87–$0.97 non-GAAP EPS range.

However, investors should monitor two key metrics:

1. Printing Segment Turnaround: A 3% decline in Q3 is concerning, but HP's focus on commercial printing and cloud-based solutions could reverse this trend.

2. Debt Management: With $2.9 billion in gross cash, HP has flexibility to reduce leverage, but its -9.34 debt-to-equity ratio remains a red flag.

Conclusion: A Defensive Play with Caveats

HP Inc. embodies the duality of the hardware sector: a resilient core business (Personal Systems) and a struggling legacy segment (Printing). Its adjusted EPS of $0.75, combined with a discounted valuation and robust free cash flow, positions it as a defensive play for long-term investors. However, the risks of debt and sector volatility cannot be ignored. For those willing to navigate these challenges, HP offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on the next phase of tech innovation while harvesting income through its dividend.

In a market where certainty is elusive, HP's balance of operational efficiency and margin stability makes it a stock worth watching—and potentially owning—for those with a multi-year horizon.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-28 05:06:14.244505

Source: DAC panel, “Navigating the Tides of Funding for Chips and System Design.” Another point is knowing where technology ideas fit into the big picture.
Government Chip Funding Spreads Globally Nations vie for a piece of the semiconductor pie with offers of cash, subsidies, tax breaks, and other approaches.","Governments around the globe are starting to invest more heavily in chip design tools and related research as part of an effort to boost on-shore chip production, opening new opportunities for startups and established EDA companies.

Those cash infusions, which are being doled out in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, are part of a growing recognition of the importance of design automation tools within domestic supply chains. In the past, engineers and scientists would pitch innovative ideas to investors, who would assess both the possible upside of investments and time to revenue. Much has changed in recent months, and those changes are accelerating.

Among the reasons:

A global AI race, has pushed chip design well beyond reticle limits, forcing chipmakers to decompose SoCs into assemblies of chiplets that require an assortment of AI-driven tools to keep track of all the possible connections, interactions, and dependencies;

A shortage of engineering talent means that without new or improved tools there will be huge gaps in design starts and potentially yield issues, leaving the door open to competitors in increasingly competitive markets, and

The focus by governments on re-shoring and on-shoring means there also will be more opportunities for private investments, and potentially more sharing of government-funded research among companies.

“Funding used to be all about manufacturing, design be damned,” said Michal Siwinski, chief marketing officer at Arteris. “TSMC revolutionizing technology for the angstrom era is very important, but it’s not sufficient. That’s just one element. You have to talk about the architecture, how you compute. Overall, design is becoming a lot more important, and it is getting more respect, because you cannot fix it only at the manufacturing level. It’s still sexy to build a fab, and having a shiny shovel in the ground makes for a better picture. On a chip, what do you see? You see a tiny little thing and billions of things go in there, but you can’t touch them.”

This becomes even more imperative with the shift toward 2.5D, 3.5D, and 3D-IC designs. “A lot of CHIPS Act investment went towards foundries and equipment, as it’s still the core competency and differentiator,” said Nandan Nayampally, chief commercial officer at Baya Systems. “On the EDA side, it was lower down that path, but there are certain things — especially with 3D stacking — that would benefit from a program that invests in the research that can be used by many, as opposed to what’s custom or proprietary.”

Government or consortium-type programs traditionally have been the backbone of that kind of longer-term research, but much of that funding dried up in recent years.

“What do you do with it? No one quite knows,” said Steve Roddy, chief marketing officer at Quadric. “If I’m a venture capital company, I raise $500 million for my limited partners, I’ve got a 2- or 3-year window where I’m going to put that money to work investing in companies, and I expect to liquidate those investments and get a return. The time horizon for VC financing has to be 3 to 7 years max. It can’t be one of these things where, ‘Oh, this promising technology that might pay off 20 years from now.’ No venture fund has the patience for that. In those scenarios, you need either a patient corporate funding partner, like a big tech company, which back in the day would be IBM Labs or ATT Bell Labs. Or, you need a government grant from the DoD or Department of Energy, or something of that nature, because it’s the only kind of investor that has the patience to develop raw technology that may or may not have a product ready for a long time. This is like saying fusion reactors would be super cool if we could get them.”

What kicked government research back into gear were COVID-related supply chain shortages, the rapid developments in AI everywhere, and a recognition that chips were an essential element for national economic security. So short-term research, as well as long-range moonshot programs with a 10-year horizon suddenly were back in vogue among governments.

“If there’s core research needed in terms of, ‘I want to see chiplets in two years,’ that’s not where that’s going to come from,” said Nayampally. “That’s going to come from innovation with the big companies and the small companies thereafter. Funding is consistently necessary, but there’s so much traction in the semiconductor market that either private companies themselves are investing, or they’re finding investment vehicles to invest back into specialized technologies that are coming.”

Currently, specialist fields of design are attracting more government attention. “The funding focus is mostly manufacturing, but there has been a recognition that the design side has a critical gatekeeping function between design and manufacturing, with the tools,” said Marc Swinnen, director of product marketing at Ansys, now part of Synopsys. “There has been investment, for example, to come up with better, newer processes, especially in the analog space, where the government has a lot of interest in remote sensing, high frequency radar, lidar, that sort of thing.”

For example, Natcast has an AI-driven RFIC design program, which aims to close the gap between long-term research and short-term industry needs. The program’s goal is to create foundational solutions using AI, which all members can benefit from. “That will drive innovation faster than an individual company saying, ‘I have a great idea, but I’m not going to tell you what it is. I’m going to build it for myself and commercially release it,’” said Nilesh Kamdar, general manager, design and verification business unit at Keysight Technologies, which spearheads one of three groups that shares $30 million in government funding. “Maybe they will be successful, maybe not. But many AI challenges are related to data, and getting an industry group together, an ecosystem, where we share data, is much more critical. Sometimes there’s an assumption that government entities move slowly, and there’s a lot of red tape and process associated with it. We haven’t experienced that. We’ve seen a lot of positive engagements.”

Kamdar said it helps to have a group comprised of established companies, startups, and universities. “As a traditional EDA vendor, we may have certain ideas and ways of looking at where AI can help. Working with a startup company challenges our mindset. The typical Silicon Valley ethos is ‘break everything, move fast, ship it now.’ You see all of that when you engage with startups. That’s very useful for my team to be exposed to some of those experiences. We also engage a lot with universities, and universities bring us some other interesting value.”

Vivek Prasad, vice president of design engineering ecosystem enablement at Natcast, which operates the National Semiconductor Technology Center, discussed the R&D side of CHIPS Act funding in a DAC panel[1]. The NSTC plan includes several facilities, a design enablement gateway, silicon aggregation as a service, and a venture fund to help bring more funding into the industry. “In the investment fund, we have two broad categories — Horizon Fund for very early seed funding, and an Acceleration Fund,” said Prasad. “If you look at the goals, it’s not about funding a company and then driving them toward success as an individual investor. The goal is to lead to a place where private sector funding starts to grow again. Today, this is at a very low level. We are trying to add some with NSTC funds so that eventually, maybe a year or two from now, we get the private sector funding back into the equation.”

Fig. 1: Natcast’s two main investment funds. Source: DAC panel, “Navigating the Tides of Funding for Chips and System Design.”

When creating a proposal, Prasad expects up to 20 different entities to work together. “There’s space for senior faculty to get into the game, as well as up-and-coming faculty with ideas that fit into a bigger puzzle. In research, if you look at the early TRL (technology readiness level), it’s a blue scatter. Ideas can come from anywhere. I would expect everybody to have a pretty level playing field, especially because the funding was not there, and now funding is more prolific. Everybody is off to the races together.”

Natcast is trying to build a platform with as many startups and ideas as it can get to go to the next stage, when it can start testing market adoption, explained Vikram Bhatia, executive director for Synopsys Cloud product management, who also oversees the company’s Cloud Startup Program.

Synopsys, Keysight, Cadence, and others provide tools to enable startups and smaller companies to succeed when participating in government programs such as the U.S. Department of Defense’s Microelectronics hubs. For example, the California Defense Ready Electronics and Microdevices Superhub (DREAMS) adopted Synopsys Cloud, which offers unlimited software licenses and access to unlimited compute infrastructure, while its FlexEDA model gives users tool usage by the minute or hour, rather than purchasing fixed-term licenses. “We’ve got startups on this platform now who are doing 10 verifications a day, because what took 12 hours you can now finish in an hour and analyze the results, and an hour later submit a new job,” said Bhatia. “Essentially, when you’re paying for a software license and for compute on the cloud, if you throw more licenses and more compute groups at it, that same job’s going to finish faster — but you end up paying the same amount.”

Startup incubators

Sitting somewhere between government programs and VCs are incubators. “Talent is scarce in this space, so typically we see startups being born out of colleges that have very strong electronics design programs, such as Berkeley, Stanford, and Michigan,” said Bhatia. “Even if you do get seed funding, that’s not enough to build a team and to get to a stage where you can tape out a real design or a real chip. Typically, the path for these startups is to get some seed funding, say $2 million, through your network or contacts, or in some cases going through incubators. There’s a whole range of incubators that started silicon practices in recent years. One that stands out is Silicon Catalyst, which has been around for a long time.”

Incubators normally provide logistics, infrastructure, and office space, said Bhatia. “They also provide access to hardware and software through their association with different organizations in the ecosystem and provide access to foundries for startups to get to prototype.”

Government programs and facilities, incubators, and industry cloud platforms are all allowing startups to do things now that were very difficult five years ago for cutting-edge design or leading-edge nodes. “Typical startups would not be able to approach that because sheer access to this was difficult,” said Bhatia. “For example, Dream Big Semiconductor is one of the few startups I know that has built a 3D-IC chiplet using the latest technology. The various programs and platforms have made it easier to get to the next stage of success in the journey of your venture. It plays a big role in not just funding, but also the ability to tape out the chip on time, or even much ahead of time.”

ChipAgents, which won pre-seed funding last year for a design and verification AI agent, is also a supporter of the federal government and/or the private sector funding the research in universities and new startups to support tech innovation in the U.S. “This is critical, and a lot of the best research comes from universities,” said Daniel Rose, founding engineer at the company. “Our CEO was a former university professor. He was my professor at university. Without funding from the federal government, we wouldn’t be able to make industry startups like this to help maintain our edge around the world.”

How to attract funding: embed ideas, attend conferences, gain visibility

The more papers academics publish, and the more funding they apply for from agencies such as the U.S. National Science Foundation, the better the odds they will obtain funding.

“There’s no one recipe that’s successful,” said Sathishkumar Balasubramanian, head of products at Siemens EDA. “It’s about how you network and focus on a problem. I would flip it another way. You will get funding when you know what you’re solving, and when you’re solving an important problem. For example, AI is a buzzword everywhere. Automation, design automation, or design migration are fundamental customer problems, which means that we need to solve them, and we are looking in different areas where we can get the knowledge to do that. Startups can get funding from suppliers, from EDA vendors like us. We have our own VC fund, and we actively work with universities and startups, and so forth. Fundamentally, you shouldn’t be doing a ‘me too’ thing, where you solve the same problem as someone else. It needs to be a game-changer in terms of getting a 10X improvement. Then you don’t need to worry about funding. You will be called into any conference and everything else. It’s a function of how smart you are in reading the industry and the customer challenges, and thinking further ahead, as well.”

Another tactic is to focus on solving a wider problem for industry or society, and then to build a large-scale project around that technology. “You can no longer think, I want to solve an EDA problem,” said Tim Cheng, vice president R&D at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, during the same DAC panel as Prasad. “You want to address a larger-scale problem, then identify a scientific problem in between where you can shine. You need to have a bigger story. Within the bigger story, there should be some small number of shining scientific elements. That’s how large projects are being run.”

Cheng says more private equity VCs are coming to universities for early-stage results, but some are frustrated when they find faculty who want to stay in their own zone, doing things that don’t connect to the investment community or with industry. “If you can come out and sell them a story, but still do academic research, and you have the passion and the skill set, the opportunity is enormous.” For example, one group aimed to help Hong Kong’s elderly population. “We got an $80 million SEAM-based project for aging, but inside their chip design, that’s edge inference,” he said. “Start looking for what elements are missing and find people to work with you and sell to the government, sell to the industry.”

Additionally, more industry in Hong Kong is now going to universities, looking for partnerships. “You can work closely with industry and establish a joint lab. We see that happening a lot, because industry is hungry for talent and the raw technology,” said Cheng. “In Hong Kong, there is the RAISe+ program, which includes a $10 billion grant. It’s a new funding model in which government, the investment community, industry, and universities collaborate. The government says, ‘If you can raise $1, I will give you another dollar.’ That motivates the industry to be even more aggressive in reaching out to universities. Getting money from industry is not easy, but industry does need new technology, and in our society, I would say universities provide the cleanest technology in the sense that it doesn’t infringe on anyone’s IP. Secondly, you can license it without competition.”

This funding model also produces spin-off companies. “I saw a lot of very motivated, aggressive young professors,” said Cheng. “They not only want to do research, but they also want to put together a large program. Once they have a large program, in the course of research, they spin up a company, which is also encouraged.”

Depending on the investor, they might actively seek ideas and groups to fund, create a competition around an idea they think needs funding, or wait for good bets to fall in their lap.

Bastian Mohr, program officer at the German Research Foundation (DFG), noted that many funding agencies don’t go out looking for ideas. “We wait for ideas to come to us. Other pilot agencies are more strategic and make calls, but still, they have to know what is important, what is interesting. It’s very important to challenge your ideas early at conferences like [DAC], to look for peers, to look for interdisciplinary disciplines, and to somehow get this back to the funding agencies. In Germany, the Chip Design Network is a success story, where the scientists convince the government that we don’t just need factories, we also need expertise. And now they have EDA-specific calls. Just the same for us, when we hear of ideas, we can try to design programs around it.”

Ian O’Connor, distinguished professor at Lyon Institute of Nanotechnology, also said international co-operation and conferences are crucial. “These events enable people to confront their ideas against others who may have different ideas, and this strengthens their ideas. It makes you visible, and this is extremely important when you try to ask for funding. If you’re not visible, you are less likely to get the funding.”

Fig. 5: EU/French funding has bloomed and dried up over the years. Source: DAC panel, “Navigating the Tides of Funding for Chips and System Design.”

Another point is knowing where technology ideas fit into the big picture. “If you can build a constructive and coherent message to say why you are doing this research, because you have the vision of what will happen in 5, 10, 15 years, that is extremely important,” said O’Connor.

With the France 2030 initiatives, the French National Research Agency (ANR) has a program specifically for young researchers that enables them to get into the driver’s seat on a research topic that they want to pursue. “These large-scale projects are top-down, coming from the funding agencies that say, ‘Build me a program that will work on circuit design or AI devices.’ So you build it with several projects that respond to it,” O’Connor said. “But it is important to couple that with bottom-up research — things that are proposed from the research community that the big labs didn’t necessarily think of. There is also an opportunity for younger researchers in Europe, helped by EuroPractice.”

Conclusion

EDA startup funding can come from many sources, including others in the industry, government agencies, and VCs. The best way to get funding is to work on a specific technology that you can present as part of a solution to a wider problem. Young researchers and developers need to test their ideas and gain visibility in public forums such as conferences. Then they can draw the necessary attention to win funding competitions or attract investors.

“In EDA, from a funding point of view, just having standalone programs is getting more and more challenging, but it’s embedded everywhere,” said HKUST’s Cheng. “When people talk about AI, the most talked about point is hardware. It’s not software anymore. Things are moving, but ultimately, it’s embodied AI. It’s a physical AI. That’s where the hardware, the computing power, and energy efficiency become a focal point. We have an enormous amount of opportunities for this community, but don’t do it alone.”

This transaction, pending antitrust approval, is not merely a corporate restructuring but a strategic recalibration of ContiTech's identity. By divesting OESL—a €1.9 billion, 16,000-employee-strong unit focused on automotive components—Continental is pivoting toward a future where industrial markets, rather than automotive OEMs, drive long-term value creation.

The Strategic Logic of Industrial Focus

ContiTech's decision to cede 80% of its sales to industrial customers post-sale reflects a broader industry trend: the decoupling of automotive suppliers from the cyclical demands of vehicle production. Electrification and sustainability mandates have disrupted traditional automotive supply chains, creating volatility that industrial markets, with their stable, long-term contracts, can mitigate. Regent, a global industrial holding company with stakes in media, consumer goods, and technology, positions OESL to leverage cross-sector synergies. For example, the unit's expertise in hose lines and bearing elements—critical for both combustion and electric vehicles—can now be repurposed for renewable energy infrastructure or advanced manufacturing systems.

This realignment mirrors the strategies of peers like Michelin and Bridgestone, which have diversified into industrial rubber and smart mobility solutions. By shedding automotive-centric divisions, companies can reduce exposure to EV transition risks while capitalizing on industrial automation and green energy growth.

Long-Term Value Creation in a Fragmented Sector

The automotive supply chain has long been characterized by overcapacity and margin compression. Consolidation, however, is reshaping the landscape. Regent's acquisition of OESL is a case study in how private equity and industrial conglomerates are acquiring niche players to build vertically integrated ecosystems. Unlike public companies, which face quarterly earnings pressures, Regent's ownership structure allows for patient capital deployment, enabling OESL to invest in R&D for sustainable mobility solutions without short-term shareholder scrutiny.

For Continental, the sale accelerates its Capital Market Day vision of creating four independent champions. By focusing ContiTech on industrial material solutions, the company can streamline operations, reduce overhead, and redirect capital to high-growth areas like smart materials or digital manufacturing. This mirrors the playbook of Siemens and ABB, which have spun off or acquired units to sharpen their industrial IoT and automation offerings.

Risks and Opportunities for Investors

While the transaction's financial terms remain undisclosed, the strategic clarity it provides is invaluable. Investors should monitor two key metrics:

1. ContiTech's EBIT margin trajectory post-divestiture, as industrial markets typically offer higher and more stable margins.

2. Regent's integration strategy for OESL, particularly its ability to scale the unit's expertise into non-automotive sectors like aerospace or renewable energy.

A critical risk lies in regulatory delays. Antitrust approvals for cross-border industrial deals have become increasingly stringent, especially in sectors deemed strategic. However, the urgency of the EV transition may expedite approvals if regulators view the sale as a step toward stabilizing supply chains.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for the Future

Continental's OESL sale is emblematic of a larger shift: the automotive supply chain's transformation into a platform for industrial innovation. For investors, this signals an opportunity to bet on companies that can navigate the dual forces of electrification and industrial consolidation. While the absence of financial details introduces uncertainty, the strategic logic is compelling. Regent's deep pockets and Continental's operational expertise create a powerful combination—one that could redefine the boundaries of the automotive-industrial nexus.

In a world where sustainability and specialization are paramount, the winners will be those who, like Continental and Regent, dare to reimagine their roles. The question for investors is not whether this trend will continue, but how quickly it will accelerate—and who will lead the charge.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-28 04:08:06.069514

Conclusion HP Inc.'s Q3 earnings and subsequent AI-driven product innovations signal a strategic pivot toward future-ready hardware.","HP Inc.'s recent financial performance and product innovation initiatives have sparked renewed interest in its long-term value proposition. While the company's Q3 2023 earnings reflected a challenging macroeconomic climate, its post-earnings pivot toward AI-driven hardware and disciplined free cash flow management has positioned it as a potential leader in the next phase of computing. This article evaluates whether HP's strategic investments in AI and its capital allocation practices can sustainably enhance shareholder value.

Financial Performance: Navigating a Tough Landscape

HP's Q3 2023 results were mixed. Revenue fell 9.9% year-over-year to $13.2 billion, driven by supply chain disruptions and macroeconomic headwinds. However, the company outperformed EPS expectations, with GAAP diluted net earnings per share (EPS) of $0.76, exceeding its guidance range. Free cash flow of $0.9 billion and $0.3 billion in shareholder returns via dividends signaled resilience. By Q3 2025, revenue had rebounded to $13.9 billion, a 3.1% year-over-year increase, with the Personal Systems segment growing 6% to $9.9 billion. This growth was fueled by the Windows 11 refresh cycle and rising demand for AI PCs, which HP now targets to account for 25% of its shipments by year-end 2025.

AI-Driven Product Innovation: A Strategic Bet

HP's post-Q3 2023 product roadmap underscores its commitment to AI integration. The launch of the HP AI Studio—a software platform for accelerating private AI model development—and partnerships with NVIDIA to deliver AI workstations with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software highlight its focus on enterprise and scientific applications. Hardware innovations like the HP Spectre Fold (a 17-inch foldable PC) and HP Envy Move (a mobile all-in-one PC) cater to hybrid work and lifestyle trends, while AI-enhanced peripherals like the HyperX Vision S Webcam target content creators.

The company's acquisition of Humane's AI platform for $116 million, including 300+ patents, further strengthens its AI ecosystem. These moves align with industry forecasts predicting AI PCs to dominate 60% of enterprise hardware demand by 2027. HP's emphasis on localized AI processing—via neural processing units (NPUs) in devices like the ZBook Ultra G1a—addresses privacy and latency concerns, differentiating it from competitors like Dell and Lenovo.

Free Cash Flow Allocation: Balancing Growth and Returns

HP's free cash flow management has been a cornerstone of its strategy. In Q3 2025, the company generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow, returning $422 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. For fiscal 2025, it projects $2.6–$3.0 billion in free cash flow, with $1.9 billion in annualized cost savings from its “Future Ready” initiative. This disciplined approach ensures flexibility to invest in AI R&D while maintaining shareholder returns.

The company's capital allocation strategy includes:

1. Shareholder Returns: Consistent dividends and buybacks (e.g., $0.2894/share dividend in Q3 2025).

2. Operational Efficiency: Cost-cutting measures and supply chain diversification (e.g., shifting North American PC production to Southeast Asia to mitigate U.S. tariffs).

3. Strategic Investments: Funding AI R&D, including the AI R&D center in Saudi Arabia and the Humane acquisition.

Market Position and Risks

HP's 21.6% global PC market share (as of 2025) positions it as a key player in the AI PC race, though it trails Lenovo's 24.8%. Its focus on enterprise security and localized AI processing offers a competitive edge, particularly as organizations prioritize data privacy. However, risks include:

- Supply Chain Volatility: Geopolitical tensions could disrupt production.

- Competitive Pressure: Dell's hybrid cloud solutions and Lenovo's global reach may challenge HP's market share.

- AI Adoption Cycles: Sustaining demand for AI PCs beyond 2027 depends on enterprise ROI.

Investment Implications

HP's strategic alignment with AI trends and disciplined capital allocation make it an intriguing long-term play. The company's ability to generate robust free cash flow while investing in high-growth areas like AI PCs and hybrid work solutions suggests a balanced approach to value creation. For investors, the key metrics to monitor include:

- AI PC shipment growth: Targeting 25% of total shipments by 2025.

- Free cash flow consistency: Maintaining $2.6–$3.0 billion in annual free cash flow.

- EPS performance: Non-GAAP EPS guidance for Q4 2025 ($0.87–$0.97) indicates confidence in profitability.

Conclusion

HP Inc.'s Q3 earnings and subsequent AI-driven product innovations signal a strategic pivot toward future-ready hardware. While short-term challenges in the Printing segment persist, the company's focus on AI PCs, enterprise security, and shareholder returns positions it to capitalize on the $60 billion AI PC market by 2027.

The company has piloted the tools with a test group of shoppers.

Early trials have shown strong results in boosting engagement and sales.

The company now plans a full rollout for Indonesia and Thailand later this year, before extending the use of AI agents to other brands in its portfolio.

According to the company, the search agent helps fix one of retail’s biggest challenges, which is poor search functions that fail to understand what shoppers really want.

This AI agent understands the true intent behind search queries in natural language.

It understands what shoppers mean, even if they search in local languages, English or make a typo - like asking for a blouse for hot weather in Thai or an elegant tunic for Eid in Bahasa.

By focusing on the meaning of words, not just keywords, it surfaces contextually relevant results.

On the backend, the agent also automatically analyses and organises a vast product catalogue.

This frees staff from the task of researching and adding keywords to each product.

Gill Capital is working with Google Cloud, and the new AI search agent is built on Vertex AI Search for Commerce.

Integrating a conversational shopping agent

Gill Capital is also integrating a conversational shopping assistant into H&M’s websites and apps.

Developed using Vertex AI Search for Commerce, the agent offers personalised recommendations and can handle complex queries like checking if an item is in stock at nearby stores.

It also answers customer service questions, including return policies, creating a seamless bridge between digital and physical shopping.

Gill Capital Group’s group chief data and analytics officer, Victor Siow, said, “While search technology has advanced from keyword-matching to semantic and agentic search, many online retailers haven’t kept pace.

(1) Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Core revenue is a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliations between GAAP revenue and core revenue for Q3 fiscal year 2025 are set forth on page 6 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure. Core revenue growth rate as projected for Q4 fiscal year 2025 and full fiscal year 2025 excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures within the past 12 months. Most of the excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided for the projection.

(2) Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share primarily exclude the impacts of restructuring and other related costs, intangibles amortization, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs and net (gain) loss on equity securities. Agilent also excludes any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations, and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 4 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

(3) Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q4 fiscal year 2025 and full fiscal year 2025 exclude primarily the estimated impacts of non-cash intangibles amortization, transformational initiatives, and acquisition and integration costs. Agilent also excludes any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations, and which are either isolated or are not expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy and could differ materially. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $24 million per quarter.

(a) The adjustment for taxes excludes tax expense (benefits) that management believes are not directly related to on-going operations and which are either isolated, temporary or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability such as the realized gain/loss due to sale of a business, windfall benefits on stock compensation, and the impact of R&D capitalization under section 174 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. During the three months ended July 31, 2025, tax reserves were released, which resulted in a tax benefit for GAAP purposes. This tax benefit is excluded from our non-GAAP results since it is not related to on-going business operations. For the three and nine months ended July 31 2025, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 12.00%. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, management used a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 13.00%. We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to restructuring and other related costs, asset impairments, amortization of intangibles, transformational initiatives, acquisition and integration costs, net (gain) loss on equity securities and pension settlement loss. Restructuring and other related costs include incremental expenses incurred in the period associated with restructuring programs, usually aimed at changes in business and/or cost structure. Such costs may include one-time termination benefits including acceleration of stock-based compensation expense, facility-related costs and contract termination fees. Asset impairments include assets that have been written down to their fair value. Transformational initiatives include expenses associated with targeted cost reduction activities such as manufacturing transfers including costs to move manufacturing, site consolidations, legal entity and other business reorganizations, insourcing or outsourcing of activities. Such costs may include move and relocation costs, one-time termination benefits and other one-time reorganization costs. Included in this category are also expenses associated with the Ignite transformation and company programs to transform our product lifecycle management (PLM) system and human resources and financial systems. Acquisition and integration costs include all incremental expenses incurred to effect a business combination. Such acquisition costs may include advisory, legal, tax, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such integration costs may include expenses directly related to integration of business and facility operations, the transfer of assets and intellectual property, information technology systems and infrastructure and other employee-related costs. Net (gain) loss on equity securities relates to the realized and unrealized mark-to-market adjustments for our marketable and non-marketable equity securities. Pension settlement loss resulted from the transfer of the Netherlands defined benefit plan to an unaffiliated insurance company. Other includes certain legal costs and settlements, consulting costs, special compliance costs, acceleration of stock-based compensation expense, impact of the difference between current and inflated tariff rates between USA and China for the first two weeks of May 2025 and other miscellaneous adjustments. Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results “through the eyes” of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management’s internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company’s profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company’s performance. Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information. Page 4

Now, Optum Rx is working to keep five Kentucky counties out of that same sweeping opioid litigation.","UnitedHealth Group’s multibillion-dollar pharmacy benefit manager, Optum Rx, is suing five Kentucky counties in an attempt to force them out of national opioid litigation against the company.

Pharmacy benefit managers, often called PBMs, act as middlemen that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug companies, insurance plans, and pharmacies. Some lawyers and advocates say PBMs helped fuel the overdose crisis by failing to restrict the flow of opioid prescriptions.

As governments begin exploring potential lawsuits against PBMs — a step that could represent the next wave in opioid-related litigation — Optum Rx is attempting to shut down those efforts, in some cases before they even fully take shape.

In June, Optum Rx sued Anderson, Boyd, Christian, Nicholas, and Oldham counties in Kentucky for allegedly making decisions about participating in the new wave of national opioid lawsuits behind closed doors, violating Kentucky’s open meetings law.

Optum Rx is asking courts to effectively force those counties to make their decisions again, this time in open meetings, potentially with the hope that some won’t bother because of the administrative burden. The result could be fewer claims against the company and possibly less money for it to pay in a future settlement.

But legal experts call Optum’s case “hypertechnical” and “frivolous,” and addiction recovery advocates say it could set a dangerous precedent for companies to evade accountability for their role in fueling the overdose crisis.

Christine Minhee, an attorney, a national expert on opioid litigation, and founder of OpioidSettlementTracker.com, said Optum’s suit reminded her of an adage among lawyers: “If the facts are on your side, pound the facts. If the law is on your side, pound the law. If neither is on your side, pound the table.”

“Right now, what we’re seeing is it pounding the table,” Minhee said of Optum Rx. The company is “desperately” trying “to find some kind of foothold” to get cases against it thrown out.

Minhee said these suits fit a pattern of Optum Rx using thin arguments to try to delay or evade opioid litigation nationwide.

Last year, Optum Rx, along with another PBM, asked a judge to throw out an opioid lawsuit filed by Los Angeles County, claiming during a December hearing that the county hadn’t shown harm. The judge appeared skeptical of the claims and ultimately rejected the companies’ request.

In April, the same companies tried to oust a federal judge overseeing national opioid litigation, claiming he was biased. Their argument was based partly on a Florida lawyer’s having said the judge was “plaintiff-oriented.” Their attempt failed.

Now, Optum Rx is working to keep five Kentucky counties out of that same sweeping opioid litigation.

That national legal undertaking began more than seven years ago, as jurisdictions saw overdose deaths climb. Many people who had become addicted to prescription painkillers were cut off by their doctors, and some transitioned to using deadlier heroin or fentanyl. Health care and public safety costs skyrocketed. Thousands of cities, counties, and states began suing health care companies for allegedly creating a public nuisance by aggressively marketing prescription painkillers and negligently distributing them.

Those cases were lassoed together into the giant multidistrict litigation, which has resulted in massive settlements. The first few waves of settlements involved opioid manufacturers, distributors, and retail pharmacies, with companies such as Johnson & Johnson, CVS, and Walgreens agreeing to pay state and local governments billions of dollars. The money is meant to be used for addiction treatment and prevention services — though its rollout has been controversial.

To add a new round of companies as defendants, jurisdictions must undertake a multistep process, said Peter Mougey, a Florida-based attorney who represents many local governments in the massive national litigation. The five Kentucky counties in question were in the early stages of that process, only having asked the judge to amend their complaint, he said. They hadn’t added Optum Rx yet.

If Optum Rx’s suits are successful, those counties would have the option of redoing the initial steps of the process in a public meeting, then continuing to add Optum Rx as a defendant, Mougey explained. The company may hope that some counties won’t undertake the extra administrative effort.

Optum Rx’s “goal is clearly just to wear down and tire out these small counties,” Mougey said. “They’re trying to have a chilling effect on the litigation.”

It’s not clear why Optum Rx targeted those five counties out of the many localities undertaking the process to add the company as a defendant. The Kentucky counties range from having fewer than 8,000 residents (Nicholas) to more than 70,000 (Christian). One is among the richest in Kentucky (Oldham), while others are poorer. Boyd County, in Appalachia, is one of the hardest hit, with a recent overdose rate twice the state average.

Optum Rx, in its filing against Boyd County, which was similar to claims against the other counties, said local authorities had taken official legal action by asking the judge to make a change in its case. The suit said such action must be done in a public meeting and that the county did not hold one.

Optum spokesperson Isaac Sorensen told KFF Health News that the company’s argument is not about “a technicality.”

It is “an important legal requirement designed to ensure accountability and transparency before a county takes legal action,” said the statement Sorensen provided. “We have found many counties ignored this requirement, alongside their duty to preserve relevant evidence, and Optum Rx will defend against these improper legal actions.”

The five Kentucky counties disagree with these assertions, according to court records. As of late July, all five had filed motions to dismiss Optum Rx’s claim.

Boyd County, like the others, argued in its motion to dismiss that asking a judge to amend its complaint was a routine, procedural step that did not require a public meeting. Optum Rx jumped the gun, the county argued, filing a case before any final action had been taken.

“No amended complaint has been filed. No new defendant, OptumRx included, has been added. No new lawsuit has been initiated,” Boyd County’s response said.

The county also pointed out that it held an open meeting in 2017 that kicked off its involvement in the national litigation and authorized future amendments to that litigation.

Hearings on the counties’ motions to dismiss Optum Rx’s suits are set for late August and early September, according to court records.

These cases are shaping up to be a Goliath-versus-David legal action. Although Oldham County is the wealthiest of the Kentucky counties that Optum Rx sued, its most recent budget is less than 0.1% of Optum Rx’s annual revenue, which the company reported as exceeding $133 billion in 2024.

Oldham County Attorney D. Berry Baxter told KFF Health News he’d seen the impact of the opioid epidemic as a prosecutor working on a growing number of drug-related cases over the years. Now, as settlement money is arriving from other companies, it has funded increased addiction treatment in local jails. More settlement money from additional companies could expand such services, Baxter said.

If Optum Rx succeeds in kicking Kentucky counties out of the national litigation, it would set “a really horrific precedent” for other PBMs and health care companies to do something similar, said Tara Hyde, CEO of the statewide nonprofit People Advocating Recovery.

Hyde said she’s been in recovery for more than a decade from an addiction that began with prescription painkillers for a broken leg. She wants to see PBMs and other companies held accountable and made to change their processes to prevent future crises.

Despite a recent decrease in overdose deaths nationwide, Hyde said people in her state, their families, and the economy are still hurting.

“Recovery doesn’t just happen overnight,” she said. “Without these dollars that have been a direct result of people being misled, mistreated, and taken advantage of, we will still be detrimentally impacted.”

Trabucchi, D., Buganza, T., “Platform Thinking: What Established Firms Can Learn from Big Tech and Digital Start-ups”, The European Business Review, 2023.","By Daniel Trabucchi and Tommaso Buganza

Established companies face persistent challenges of inefficient transactions, shifting customer needs, innovation bottlenecks, underused data, and strategic data gaps. Daniel Trabucchi and Tommaso Buganza of the Politecnico di Milano reveal how platform models address these problems and present a methodology to design, ignite, and grow scalable ecosystems.

The platform economy is no longer an emerging trend—it is an established reality. Yet its geography tells a story of striking imbalance. According to the latest Top 100 Worldwide Platforms ranking, based on market capitalisation, 85.8 per cent of their total value is concentrated in the Americas, 11 per cent in Asia-Pacific, while Europe accounts for a modest 2.2 per cent and Africa just 1 per cent1. This disparity begs an obvious question: has Europe already lost the platform battle?

Not entirely. Significant examples prove that Europe can still matter in the global platform landscape. Siemens with Siemens Xcelerator, AXA with its AXA Digital Commercial Platform, and Eni with Open-es are three distinct initiatives united by the same logic: leveraging platform models to tackle complex challenges and create new value2.

We believe there is still hope. Like a phoenix rising from its own roots, European companies can build on what they already have—brand, customers, relationships, data, and know-how—to innovate and grow.

In our previous article for The European Business Review3, we introduced the concept of Platform Thinking, showing how even traditional firms can adopt it. With our new book, The Digital Phoenix Effect2, we explore this dynamic in depth, revealing how legacy companies can reinvent themselves—not by burning everything down, but by using their legacy as the foundation for a new way of creating value.

The Study: Decoding the Digital Phoenix Effect

The Digital Phoenix Effect is grounded in a multi-year research effort on the S&P 500, examining how established firms have approached platform strategies in recent years. Our analysis covered over 800 initiatives, identifying 140 cases that met the essential conditions to be classified as platforms: the presence of at least two distinct groups of customers and the existence of cross-side network externalities2.

These two features, which we discussed in our previous The European Business Review article3, are what distinguish platform models from traditional linear value chains. In a linear model, value is created and delivered through a sequence of activities—from supplier to producer to customer—without the interdependent dynamics of multi-sided interactions. In a platform, value emerges from enabling these interactions, and network effects power its growth; the more participants on one side, the more valuable it becomes for the other side, and vice versa4,5,6.

From the 140 platforms identified, a pattern emerged. Regardless of industry, we found that platforms were not built for their own sake—they were designed to solve pressing business problems that linear models could no longer address effectively. We distilled these into five recurring “business problems” that platforms are particularly suited to tackle2:

Missing or Inefficient Transactions – cases where opportunities for exchange exist but are hindered by friction or lack of connection.

Evolving Customer Demands – situations where customer expectations shift faster than traditional offerings can adapt.

Innovation Bottlenecks – contexts where internal innovation capacity is insufficient to keep pace

with market needs.

Underutilised Data – scenarios where valuable data exists but is not leveraged for new value creation.

Lack of Data for Strategic Insights – situations where key decisions are made with incomplete or inaccessible data.

These categories provide a practical lens for managers. Instead of asking, “Should we build a platform?”, the more relevant question becomes, “Which problem are we trying to solve, and can a platform mechanism address it better than a linear one?” The next section explores each problem through a concrete case.

The Five Problems Platforms Can Solve

1. Kroger – Supplier Hub for Missing or Inefficient Transactions

Some transactions, while possible and desirable, remain slow, fragmented, or absent. Inefficiencies may arise from organisational silos, non-integrated IT systems, or centralised decision-making that slows the flow of information. These frictions can occur externally—between customers and suppliers, partners and affiliates—or internally—between departments and teams.

Kroger, one of the largest U.S. supermarket chains, faced this challenge in procurement. With thousands of suppliers and hundreds of internal buyers operating across categories and locations, transactions between these two existing groups were frequent but often costly and inefficient.

Moving beyond the traditional “supplier as vendor” mindset, the platform positioned suppliers as active participants in a shared ecosystem.

In 2018, Kroger launched Supplier Hub, a platform designed to streamline these interactions. Moving beyond the traditional “supplier as vendor” mindset, the platform positioned suppliers as active participants in a shared ecosystem. It provided self-service tools, tutorials, dedicated support, and simplified compliance processes.

By enabling more direct, transparent, and efficient exchanges, Kroger unlocked previously hidden value. As more suppliers engaged, the platform generated richer data and greater variety for buyers; as buyers became more active, suppliers gained visibility and efficiency.

This illustrates the power of Platform Thinking: reimagining existing relationships and assets to transform inefficiency into a scalable, self-reinforcing advantage.

2. Royal Caribbean – Royal Caribbean Hotels for Evolving Customer Demands

Royal Caribbean is renowned for world-class onboard experiences, yet many guests face a recurring gap: pre- and post-cruise lodging near ports. Managing this need through external portals is fragmented and can undermine the perceived quality of the entire journey. Rather than buying hotels or locking into a handful of bilateral deals, Royal Caribbean launched Royal Caribbean Hotels, a transactional platform that connects two distinct groups: passengers seeking convenient stays and hotels eager to reach a pre-qualified, high-value audience.

On the platform, hotels are not mere suppliers—they are customers. The more properties participate, the more choice and flexibility travellers enjoy; the more travelers book through the platform, the greater the visibility and occupancy upside for hotels. These cross-side network effects strengthen with every interaction, without diverting the company from its core: delivering great cruises.

By leveraging brand trust, customer relationships, and an existing loyal base, Royal Caribbean extended its ecosystem to solve a fast-evolving customer need, improving end-to-end experience while keeping capital intensity low. The platform turns a service gap into a growth vector—and does so by orchestrating partners rather than owning every asset.

3. Caterpillar – Cat Digital Marketplace for Innovation Bottlenecks

As customers demanded smarter, more integrated solutions, building every digital tool in-house became untenable for Caterpillar: slow cycles, rising costs, and a narrow funnel of ideas. To break the bottleneck, Caterpillar created Cat Digital Marketplace, opening APIs and infrastructure so external developers can build software that augments its machines—fleet management, predictive maintenance, and more.

Developers are platform customers, motivated by access to Caterpillar’s global installed base. More developers mean more solutions for equipment owners; more adoption attracts more developers—a virtuous loop that scales innovation without bloating internal teams.

Crucially, the marketplace enhances (not replaces) Caterpillar’s core. The machines remain the anchor; the ecosystem makes them more valuable, configurable, and future-proof. By activating dormant assets—brand, trust, and a massive installed base—Caterpillar shifted from “doing all the innovation” to enabling it, accelerating time-to-solution while preserving focus on what it does best.

4. Kraft Heinz – Kraft-O-Matic for Unlocking Underused Data

Kraft Heinz, a household name in the food industry, has long enjoyed the trust of millions of consumers and a portfolio of iconic brands. Yet, much of its vast trove of sales, marketing, and feedback data remained locked in silos, underutilised and mostly archival. Recognising the opportunity to transform these dormant assets into real-time strategic insights, the company partnered with Google Cloud to create Kraft-O-Matic, an AI-powered platform designed to aggregate, analyse, and distribute data across the organisation.

In this ecosystem, consumers remain end customers but also act—often unknowingly—as data suppliers through their interactions with the products. Internal R&D and marketing teams become customers of the platform’s insights, leveraging them to shape new products, campaigns, and adaptations with far greater precision.

By reframing data as a multi-use asset, Kraft Heinz shifted from static reporting to a continuous, generative flow of value. Cross-side network effects ensure that the more data consumers feed into the system, the more effective internal decision-making becomes—creating a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation. The result is not just technological upgrade, but a redefinition of relationships, roles, and flows within the company’s value creation system.

5. News Corp – Vertical Video Platform for Strategic Data Gaps

In the fast-evolving media landscape, News Corp faced a critical challenge: acquiring the granular, real-time behavioural data that advertisers demanded, while competing with mobile-first giants like TikTok and YouTube. Traditional audience metrics and market research were too slow, too costly, and too generic to sustain competitiveness.

The solution came in 2022 with the launch of the Vertical Video Platform—a mobile-first, interactive content service designed to attract new audiences and, crucially, to turn engagement into a natural source of data generation. Integrated with Intent Connect, News Corp’s proprietary analytics engine, the platform enables hyper-personalised targeting for advertisers based on in-app behaviours, preferences, and interactions.

Here, users become both customers of an engaging media experience and providers of valuable data; advertisers gain precise targeting capabilities, which in turn makes the platform more attractive for users. This virtuous loop is a hallmark of Platform Thinking: value is exchanged continuously, with each side making the other more valuable.

By leveraging brand trust, existing advertiser relationships, and its established user base, News Corp didn’t just close a data gap—it built an entirely new, sustainable source of competitive advantage.

From the Platform Revolution to the Phoenix Effect, making platform a concrete tool for legacy firms

All five cases presented—Kroger, Royal Caribbean, Caterpillar, Kraft Heinz, and News Corp—are drawn from the U.S. market. This is no coincidence. Given the global scale and maturity of the “platform revolution,” our research focused on the S&P 500, where platforms have long been integral to business models.

Yet the opening examples—Siemens Xcelerator, AXA Digital Commercial Platform, Open-es—show that European firms can play, and win, in this arena. The first part of The Digital Phoenix Effect is dedicated to these and other European success stories, such as Telepass and XOM Materials, demonstrating that geography need not dictate destiny2.

The book closes with a practical build-track: the Platform Thinking Journey, a strategic design process structured into four phases—Framing, Design, Ignition, and Growth—and articulated through seven recurring cycles of questions, each supported by clear alternatives, tools, and milestones. The aim is not a linear recipe but a recursive cadence that managers can actually run.

Framing clarifies where and why to apply Platform Thinking (new service, core activity, or support activity; problem to solve or idle asset to unlock).

Design translates intent into architecture

and business model choices across sides and value flows.

Ignition makes the go-to-market concrete, selecting onboarding strategies and sequencing sides with a roadmap, learnt from a decade of research in start-up-based platforms.

Growth scales through extension and exploitation strategies, based on the success

of digital platforms.

This methodology was developed and stress-tested within the Platform Thinking HUB at Politecnico di Milano, a multi-year design science effort that engaged more than 50 managers annually and iterated the journey from a card-based toolkit into a four-phase model—now also supported by a GenAI co-thinker to sustain decisions between workshops. Recent partners include Eni, Leonardo, Prysmian, GS1 Italy, Angelini Industries, and Sisal (over 20 partners in the first three editions).

The “platform revolution” may no longer be an ongoing revolution—it’s the current operating system of competition. The new game is different: established firms can win by building on what they already have—relationships, data, physical assets, and know-how—using platform mechanisms to turn constraints into catalysts. Like a digital phoenix, they don’t burn everything down; they rise by recombining legacy assets into new value-creation logics. That is the opportunity in front of Europe—and any legacy company ready to play it.

Marks first decarbonization step for Secunda complex, more needed

The 97.5 MW Damlaagte solar project, developed by Mainstream Renewable Power in South Africa's Free State, has begun commercial operations. As the first decarbonization plant for the Secunda synfuels complex to secure financial closure, it will supply about 270 GWh of clean electricity annually for 20 years to industrial companies Sasol and Air Liquide.

Sasol considers the project a crucial step toward its carbon neutrality goals. ""We have reached a critical milestone today with our announcement of the first Secunda decarbonisation renewable project reaching financial close,"" said Priscillah Mabelane, Executive Vice President of Sasol Energy Business, in 2023. ""This is significant progress towards Sasol’s ambition to reduce its absolute scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 30% off a 2017 baseline."" The group has already secured over 600 MW of renewable energy, with a target of 2 GW by 2030.

Air Liquide emphasized the strategic importance of the project, stating that the commercial commissioning of Damlaagte is a key step in decarbonizing its operations at Secunda. The company aims to reduce its local emissions by 30% to 40% by 2031.

In a country where more than 80% of electricity comes from coal and where the state-owned utility Eskom struggles to maintain a stable grid, private power purchase agreements have become an essential tool for industrial companies. The Damlaagte project confirms a significant shift in energy strategy.

However, transforming the Secunda complex will require multiple projects of several hundred megawatts.

In the memo, which was first reported on Tuesday by Bloomberg News, Kroger Chairman and CEO Ron Sargent said the retailer for the past several months has been seeking ways to simplify its organization, shift resources closer to its customers, and focus on work that creates the most value.

“Through this work, we have updated many of our priorities and stopped projects that were not directly helping us to run great stores,” he said.

The savings from the staff reductions will be reinvested in lower prices, new store growth, and more store-level jobs, Sargent said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Supermarket News. Efforts will include adding more hours for store teams and “building up real estate capabilities” for store expansion, he said.

Catching up on efficiencies

In announcing the store closures earlier this year, Kroger had said it had paused its store-review program during the past few years while the merger was pending. Analysts agreed that the company was catching up on implementing some efficiencies that had been on hold, according to reports.

Earlier this year Kroger confirmed some initial rounds of corporate employee layoffs, including some at its 85.51° data analytics division. A February report said Kroger was laying off up to 200 corporate staff, followed by another round of cuts in March. Kroger said at the time that the cuts were meant to drive efficiency at the company.

Kroger’s initial round of layoffs followed an announcement by Albertsons that it would seek to cut spending by $1.5 billion over the next three years, including the elimination of nearly 400 corporate positions as its Safeway division.

In May, Walmart said it was cutting 1,500 corporate positions, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The cuts, which were reportedly made to trim costs and streamline decision-making, impacted workers in global technology operations, U.S. managerial roles in ecommerce fulfillment, and Walmart Connect.

With global demand for AI infrastructure, 5G/6G networks, and high-speed data processing accelerating, the company's strategic investments in R&D, supply chain resilience, and market diversification position it as a compelling long-term investment. At the Deutsche Bank 2025 Technology Conference, CFO Neil Dougherty outlined a roadmap that underscores Keysight's ability to capitalize on secular trends while delivering robust shareholder value.

Financial Resilience and Strategic Priorities

Keysight's Q3 2025 results highlight its financial strength: revenue surged 11% year-over-year to $1.35 billion, with EPS hitting $1.72, exceeding Wall Street estimates. This performance reflects strong demand in AI-driven digital infrastructure and aerospace/defense markets. The company's current ratio of 3.39 and $2.636 billion in cash and equivalents (including $759 million in restricted cash for the Spirent acquisition) underscore its liquidity and capacity to fund growth initiatives.

Dougherty emphasized a disciplined approach to capital allocation, including share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. The pending Spirent deal, expected to close in Q4, will expand Keysight's portfolio in network testing and performance validation, critical for AI and 5G/6G ecosystems. Meanwhile, the company's free cash flow of $291 million in Q3 (up $1.1 billion year-to-date) provides flexibility to navigate macroeconomic headwinds.

R&D as a Growth Engine

Keysight's R&D investments are central to its long-term strategy. In Q1 2025, the company launched a 400 Gbps-per-lane test solution, enabling 3.2 terabit speeds for AI data centers and optical interconnects. Such innovations align with the growing complexity of AI workloads, where signal integrity and performance validation are mission-critical.

Dougherty highlighted the company's focus on “next-generation” technologies, including:

- AI Infrastructure: Developing tools for AI cluster design, high-speed memory (DDR6, PCI Gen7), and silicon photonics.

- Wireless Evolution: Leading 5G Advanced and 6G research, with partnerships in satellite communications and non-terrestrial networks.

- Aerospace/Defense: Expanding secure communication systems, radar, and quantum computing solutions, leveraging $75 billion in global defense spending.

These initiatives are not speculative—they are already generating revenue. The Communication Solutions Group (CSG) saw 11% year-over-year growth in Q3, driven by double-digit gains in wireline and wireless segments. Keysight's collaboration with AMD on PCIe Gen 6 compliance and its 1,000-qubit quantum platform with AIST in Japan exemplify its ability to translate R&D into market leadership.

Market Expansion and Tariff Mitigation

Dougherty's guidance for Q4 2025—$1.37–1.39 billion in revenue and $1.79–$1.85 EPS—reflects confidence in sustained demand. Full-year revenue growth is projected at 7%, with EPS up 13%, assuming tariffs remain at August 2025 levels. The company is proactively mitigating trade risks through supply chain optimization, pricing adjustments, and tariff surcharges, with full offset expected by Q1 2026.

Geographically, Keysight is expanding into high-growth regions. In Europe, it secured contracts with prime defense contractors for radar and spectrum operations. In Asia, its quantum computing and AI partnerships position it to benefit from sovereign tech initiatives. These moves diversify revenue streams and reduce exposure to U.S.-centric risks.

Investment Implications

For investors seeking resilient tech exposure, Keysight offers a compelling mix of near-term execution and long-term vision. Its 5–7% top-line growth target aligns with the secular tailwinds of AI and 5G/6G, while its 10% EPS growth target (for FY2025) suggests strong margin discipline. The company's balance sheet, with $2.6B in cash, provides a buffer against volatility and funds for innovation.

However, risks persist. Tariff uncertainty, supply chain bottlenecks, and competition from smaller tech firms could pressure margins. Yet Keysight's first-mover advantage in AI test solutions and its deep customer relationships (e.g., with AMD, AIST) create high switching costs.

Conclusion: A Tech Stock for the Long Haul

Keysight Technologies is not just riding the AI wave—it is shaping it. By combining R&D excellence, strategic acquisitions, and financial prudence, the company is building a moat around its core competencies. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: Keysight's ability to monetize long-term technological shifts—while maintaining profitability—makes it a standout in the 2025 tech landscape. As Dougherty noted, the company is “well-positioned to deliver value through both near-term execution and long-term innovation.” In an era of rapid disruption, that duality is rare—and invaluable.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-28 02:10:41.864775

“What is your Medicare advantage penetration, specific to the counties that you’re in?” Korte said.","As Medicare Advantage (MA) continues to see an increase in enrollment, home-based care providers that want to lean into these opportunities will need to have strategies and processes in place to build a lasting business in the space.

No one understands this better than Frontpoint Health. The Dallas-based home health and hospice provider has centered its business around MA, rather than shying away from it.

“Our journey has been one of controlling costs, understanding how you work with Medicare Advantage plans and getting a lot more gray hair, relative to how good these Med Advantage plans are at obfuscating a very common sense conversation about rate increases,” Brent Korte, CEO of Frontpoint Health, said during a presentation last month at the National Alliance for Care at Home Financial Summit.

Backed by Cimarron Healthcare Capital and Tacoma Holdings, Frontpoint Health is a provider that delivers care across 176 counties in Texas.

Currently, 54% of individuals who are eligible for Medicare are enrolled in an MA Plan, according to the latest data from KFF.

Meanwhile, fee-for-service enrollment saw a 4% decline between July 2022 and July 2023, according to data from MedPAC.

Additionally, a handful of large insurers make up the majority of MA enrollment. This includes companies such as UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), Humana (NYSE: HUM) and CVS Health (NYSE: CVS).

Alex Van Gundy — manager of data and business analytics at Frontpoint Health — explained that continued MA enrollment growth signaled the need for home-based providers to adapt their business models to meet this shift.

“Historically, with Med Advantage, we’ve seen lower margins,” he said. “For us at Frontpoint, it’s really just packing costs where we can and understanding the payers. When you look at these payers, you have UHC, Humana, and then under that, there are delegated groups that are smaller. We like to group those together. They often have similar characteristics, so] we can tell what’s going on with the business.”

Van Gundy also noted that having a firm grip on documentation has been key in Frontpoint Health’s dealings with MA plans.

“Documentation is always important for us to make sure we get those visits authorized,” he said. “Also, just staying on top of our write-offs and our adjustments each month. We don’t always get the answers we want from MA plans as to why or what they need, so [we have to] stay on top of write-offs and make adjustments, as needed to get authorization done correctly.”

It’s also important to identify areas where you can streamline operations, whether that’s scheduling, clinical management or intake.

“I think that there are some AI folks that can do some intake work to make things more efficient,” Korte said.

Providers looking to take on more MA business should also increase their knowledge about the specific markets they’re trying to serve and form strategic partnerships.

“What is your Medicare advantage penetration, specific to the counties that you’re in?” Korte said. “That data is accessible. What do your referral partners really need? Work with your health systems to gain influence with payers.”

In a previous interview with Home Health Care News, Korte also emphasized the importance of demonstrating Frontpoint Health’s value to payers, especially during rate negotiations.",https://homehealthcarenews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/HHCN-Facebook-Share-Size.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 04:07:21.927463

McCormick de Mexico sells spices, sauces, condiments and tea under McCormick brand names. The business generates net sales of about $810 million per year, and officials expect sales to climb in “the mid-single digits range.”

McCormick officials said that the move would create growth opportunities in Mexico, as well as a “strategic platform” for expansion in Latin America overall.

""This marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for McCormick in Mexico,” McCormick Chairman, President and CEO Brendan Foley said in a statement. “With this expanded ownership, we will advance our global flavor leadership and increase our presence in condiments and sauces.”

The power will be wheeled via the national grid to Sasol and Air Liquide’s operations in Secunda, located in Mpumalanga province.

The 20 year PPAs are part of Sasol and Air Liquide’s joint drive to decarbonise their respective operations.

The Damlaagte facility is owned by Mainstream Renewable Power, uBuzwe Energy and Thembelihle Trust.

Mainstream controversy

Foreign independent power producer (IPP), Globeleq, and the Ikamva Consortium made up another foreign IPP, Mainstream Renewable Power plus local black economic empowerment partners, Africa Rainbow Energy & Power (AREP) and H1 Holdings, who make up more than 45 % of black ownership, allegedly owe the IPP Office in South Africa around R254.8 million.

The Ikamva Consortium were named by South Africa’s Department of Minerals, Resources and Energy (DMRE) as Preferred Bidder for twelve (12) of the twenty-five (25) projects, totalling 1274 MW capacity, in South Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) Bid Window 5 (BW5). The projects were awarded preferred bidder status in October 2021.

All 12 projects failed to reach commercial close, and the consortium is currently refusing to pay bid bonds for the failed projects. The country’s IPP Office has confirmed that it has called the bid bonds (termination) of the 12 projects. Read more

According to clause 26.1 and 26.2 of the general requirements, rules and provisions (REIPPPP_BW5 RFP_PART A_GENERAL REQUIREMENTS, RULES AND PROVISIONS) the consortium is liable to pay the IPP Office a total of R254.8 million calculated at R200000.00 per megawatt (MW) as a preferred bidder.

The outcome of Bid Window 5 was racked with controversy and allegations of tender rigging emerged. 21 of the 25 preferred bidders announced had the same BBBEE partner in H1 Holdings – Mainstream Renewable Power (12 projects), Scatec (3 projects), EDF (3 projects) and local IPP Red Rocket (3 projects). The majority of the projects that won preferred bidder status were not shovel-ready and had outstanding development works activities including CEL, EIA and other permitting. Only 11 of the 25 projects reached commercial close which raised serious questions over the competency of the IPP Office under the leadership of Bernard Magoro, which at the time fell under the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy, headed by Gwede Mantashe.

Some of the Ikamva Consortiums failed BW 5 projects have allegedly been re-submitted under different names by the MG consortium in REIPPPP Bid Window 7 but failed to achieve preferred bidder status. Read more

Last month, an employment tribunal in London found Capgemini failed to provide the recommended neurodiversity awareness training, and this amounted to discrimination.

In a statement, the company said: ""Capgemini is deeply committed to building a truly inclusive and diverse workplace, where everyone feels valued and respected.

""We continuously strengthen our culture of inclusion through employee networks, training, and open dialogue, ensuring that every voice is heard. We don't comment on specific employees.""

An issue for businesses across the country

The Capgemini case is not remote or isolated. The decision has ramifications for businesses across the country, especially as rates of ADHD diagnosis are climbing.

Official data analysed by Sky News shows the number of people in work with disabilities or long-term health conditions has risen by 21% since the pandemic. That includes a 35% jump in workers with learning difficulties and mental conditions like ADHD.

Many of these people will already be in work and are being diagnosed as adults. This is a trend that is particularly pronounced among older women, with ADHD traditionally having been underdiagnosed in young girls.

However, it will also affect the future workforce. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, the number of disabled children with ADHD as their main condition has more than doubled - from 38,000 in 2013 to 66,000 in 2023.

It means the profile of the workforce is changing, and businesses will have to think hard about how they can harness the potential and meet the needs of their workers to maximise their productivity.

A growing legal issue

Failure to do so could also have legal consequences. Although not every case of ADHD meets the definition of a disability, employment lawyers are increasingly receiving enquiries about possible discrimination related to neurodivergent conditions, especially since the pandemic.

Elizabeth McGlone, an employment lawyer at the law firm Didlaw, said every other enquiry she receives now relates to neurodiversity, up from one in every 10 or 20 before the pandemic.

""So the classic scenario is performance. They're struggling at work in relation to time management, attendance, assimilating information, assimilating tasks, prioritising. And it's not so much that they can't do the job, they are just not having enough adjustments made to be able to do the job,"" she said.

""I do think employers have greater responsibilities. I do also think it depends on the size and the resources of your business. So for a smaller business, it's going to be much more difficult to make great changes. But some of the changes don't have to be that significant.

""They can be as small as moving someone's desk so they haven't got as much surrounding noise, or making sure that they are taking regular rest breaks.""

Grey areas

However, not all cases are clear-cut. Neurodiversity sits on a spectrum, and a diagnosis can create grey areas for businesses, where it is difficult to determine how much of a role the condition is playing in an employee's performance at work.

""You don't want to be cynical,"" said Ms McGlone.

""Obviously, you take everybody at face value, but I have had chronological circumstances where somebody has got performance issues, the employer isn't aware of any diagnosis, then a diagnosis has been sought and confirmed… sometimes you do feel some element of it being contrived, but that's very, very few and far between.""",https://mmo.aiircdn.com/452/6560940f41678.png,N,,2025-08-28 00:02:42.841464

While Agilent has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

Full transcript - Deutsche Bank’s 2025 Technology Conference:

Operator: All right, I think we’re on time. I know we’ve got a few minutes. Few minutes left. Yes.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: When the lights go down, assume it. That’s right. You’ve got your logo up here, which is good. Have you got any slides to talk to

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: now? No slides. Slides.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: We managed to get the usually they have the Deutsche Bank logo. All right. Let’s get started. Welcome back to this final session of day one of Deutsche Bank’s Technology Conference. I’m delighted to welcome Neil Daugherty from Keysight, CFO.

I am Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst. Keysight, for those of you who don’t know, is a leading test and measurement equipment company, but also shifting to software. So we are going to discuss the demand environment, tariffs. If you have any questions along the way, please raise your hand. And without further ado, maybe Neil, maybe just start by giving a little bit more of an intro than I just gave just to the company for those who don’t know and then we can get into more of the questions.

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes. So as you suggested, Keysight is the leading provider in the electronic design and test space. We have a broad portfolio of hardware and software solutions, which we essentially bring to market targeted at a number of different end markets, most notably commercial communications focused on both wireless and wireline communications, aerospace defense where we are benefiting now from increased commitment in terms of spending as a percentage of GDP from the NATO allies and now multiple years of increased U. S. Aerospace defense budgets as well.

We have an industrial business that is focused on kind of next generation automotive including electrification of the drivetrain move to more of a software defined vehicle, which would include everything from autonomous driving, the various levels of autonomous driving, software defined vehicles excuse me, in infotainment systems and really all the in car electronics and in car networks that are part of a modern automobile. We have a semiconductor business that is really now being driven by move to smaller process architecture, things like silicon photonics, high bandwidth memory are drivers that kind of link back directly to the AI side of things. And then we have a kind of a catch all business in general electronics, which is kind of everything else that has electronic content in it. There are some submarkets in there which we tack separately. We pay attention to the education, advanced education research end markets, med tech, those areas are embedded in that as well.

And again, hardware and software about approaching 40% of the revenues these days are coming from software and services. The balance coming from hardware and that mix continues to shift in the direction of software and services. And maybe just lastly, the business is pretty heavily levered to our customers’ R and D labs versus their manufacturing lines. You could think of it as high 50% R and D, maybe 30 ish percent manufacturing with the balance being kind of post deployment installation maintenance types of applications.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Great. So you had your Q3 results last week and you did have a beaten raise, which is congrats on that. You’ve raised your sales growth to 7%, as I understand, for the fiscal year 2025 from, I think, closer to 5%. So can you parse out the delta in your improved outlook between AI spend perhaps upside to aerospace and defense and anything else?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes, absolutely. So as we entered this year, keep in mind ’twenty four is a down year for us, a cyclical down year, but we had started to see our end markets inflect driven most notably by wireline and the AI build out. But we had we realized that all of these end markets, which I just walked through, were not in phase with one another. Some of them were recovering or set to recover. Others we felt were still likely to be a headwind for us as we entered FY ’twenty five.

And so our base case was at the low end of our long term growth target of 5% to 7%. And so we were forecasting growth this year of 5%. We And have actually been able to increase that full year expectation each of the last two quarter ends. So at the end of Q2, we took it from five to 6%, the end of Q3, we took it from six to 7%. And so if you think about what has outperformed and what’s kind of more performed in line with expectation this year, first of would say what’s leading the growth charge for us is in fact our wireline business driven by AI, but I would say that growth has been largely in line with what we expected.

We expected it to be strong. It has in fact been strong and again largely in line with expectation. I think we have seen a little bit of upside on the aerospace defense side driven as I have mentioned by budgets, but I really think that opportunity is more in front of us than it is being realized currently, because there is a long lag that occurs between the time a politician stands on television and makes a commitment to increasing defense spending to the point that it’s actually in budgets, assigned to programs and then RFPs and other things have conducted and it actually results in orders on a company like Keysight. Semiconductor, we expected to strong rebound maybe slightly higher than expected. So I think there is some upside that we have seen in the semi space.

The auto business we expected to be challenging and in fact has been challenging. So again, I think that’s in line with expectation. And probably the single area that has the single biggest area of outperformance for us has been in wireless. Wireless, our base case coming into the year was for our wireless business, which is a large business for us well north of $1,000,000,000 was for that business to be flat, stable this year. And in fact, we have seen some growth, some nice growth in that business.

And so it’s not growing as fast as it was a couple of years ago, but it’s a big enough business and we’ve seen enough growth it’s a significant contributor to us being able to take up our growth rate for the year for the entire portfolio. So it’s been a good year. I think we’ve done a good job executing and converting that revenue growth to profitability, we have actually been able to take up our EPS growth expectations even as we have absorbed significant tariff headwinds. So it’s been a good year so far and with one quarter to go.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Great. And you mentioned tariffs, there was a little bit of disappointment I am sensing last week around some tariff discussion, maybe you could just clarify how you are seeing the tariff situation impacting your product cost and margin and where do you see the biggest impact today?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes. So obviously, we had now kind of two rounds of tariffs, obviously, initial round of tariff announcements back in April, which is kind of baselined at 10% for a lot of countries and then we saw this tariff rates increase most recently here in August. And I think right now we are likely to settle in somewhere around the $40,000,000 a quarter in terms of total tariff headwind as a result of two waves of tariff announcements. I think the good news is we feel like we largely have it handled. We have taken a set of actions to mitigate this tariff exposure.

It is going to take some time to fully be realized in our P and L. It’s a mix of cost action and operational efficiency actions and another set of actions that are focused on passing the remaining costs on to our customers via price increase. And it’s those latter increases that really do take time, right. We have not made an attempt to reprice backlog. We have honored outstanding quotations to our customers largely.

And so given our relatively large backlog, 2,400,000 of backlog, it does take time for new quotes that include the pricing changes to turn into orders and then ultimately turn into revenue. And so what we have said is we would have the April round of tariffs fully offset within Q1 and a second set of actions here in August and we would expect to have the August tariff increases offset before the end of Q2. And so again, I feel pretty good about where we are at and feel like we have got a really robust plan to ultimately make these things earnings neutral to our P and L.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then let’s dive deeper a little bit on the end markets. So let’s start with wireline. Obviously, think investors, I am guessing, seem to be looking at you as a potential AI play, but it’s quite hard to pass out how much of your wireline story is to do with hyperscalers and how much is just general demand. So is there any way you can sort of quantify the AI contribution to that wireline growth you are seeing?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Well, let me start by quantifying our wireline business. So we have a commercial communications business that is in the vicinity of $2,500,000,000 and approaching 50 percent of that, we are getting very close on a quarterly run rate of having 50% of that business come from wireline side of things. Obviously, the major underlying driver of our wireline growth over the last eighteen to twenty four months has been this rapid acceleration of investments in AI. And I think the good news there is a couple of bits of good news here. First, we are very bullish on the opportunity as we look forward into FY ’twenty six and beyond, right.

What we are seeing is a shortening of the technology cycles as the industry looks to move to faster speeds from 100, 400 largely being 400 to 800, which is where most of the activity is right now, ultimately moving to 1.6 terabit, then 3.2, 6.4 and even talking about 12.8 at this point in time. And as those cycles shrink, you essentially need to redesign all of the equipment that makes these networks work, the network silicon, the connectivity, the optical transceivers, the network equipment and then ultimately and we have touch points with all of those aspects of the hardware build out itself. And then we actually have touch points with the hyperscalers themselves that are building out these data centers. And so you have a combination of multiple touch points between Keysight’s technologies, both physical and protocol layer solutions to service this ecosystem and shortening design cycles as the industry works through various technology inflection points to give us confidence in the opportunity as we move forward. And so very exciting and again a significant driver of growth for us as we look both backward over the last say twelve to eighteen months and forward into the coming year.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Great. And would you call out anything in particular like it sounded like it’s mainly interconnect driven, is it Ethernet, is it PCIe, is there perhaps a trend towards scaling out versus scaling up that you seeing that could be an inflection for you guys or is it just as you say a shortening of the whole cycle overall that’s driving your business?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes, I think it’s an interesting question. I think we have the opportunity to benefit both from scale out and from scale up, but as I think of those two opportunities and keep in mind as I have said, our business is significantly more levered to R and D, that’s true at the Keysight level and it’s even more true within our wireline business, which is probably 70% R and D versus manufacturing. And so given that emphasis in this space on R and D, I think of the scale out play is more of a volume play, whereas the scale up play is more of a technology play. And so as I think about those two things, I tend to think of the scale up play as the bigger long term opportunity for us, because not just the move through various speeds, but if you think about the multiple developing alternatives to the NVIDIA ecosystem, whether that’s Ethernet or UA link or PCIe based solutions, there is a complete set of tools and equipment that need to be a build out in support of each of these standards. And again, we have touch points at silicon, connectivity, network appliance and with the hyperscalers that will ultimately deploy these technologies.

And so kind of a little bit of a more the merrier standpoint when you are selling into the R and D lab, the more technologies that they are trying to bring to market, we are agnostic ultimately to winners and losers, but it creates a tremendous opportunity in the interim.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Great. And if anyone has any questions, please do raise your hand. Let’s switch to wireless. Obviously, I think if you think historically, it was one of your larger businesses, it sounds like wireline is now bigger than wireless at the moment. How is AI influencing your test product development in wireless?

I’m thinking of features like RFB performing using AI to software innovation, how are you seeing that and how can you monetize

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes. So, a couple of comments. First of all, just correct the record. Wireline is wireless is still bigger, but the gap is closing and we are very close to fifty-fifty. So, but wireless is still the larger business.

We will see when that transition happens and ultimately wireline becomes bigger, which appears to be the trajectory that we are on. I think as it relates to AI, what we are seeing is within our customer set primarily on the network side and we are in the very early stages of the as you can think of it as more research rather than development at this point in time. They are looking at how do they use AI to optimize these networks, how do they optimize for power efficiency, how do they optimize for network traffic, how do they model the behavior of the actual user themselves so that they can better predict and ultimately shape the form of the beam to provide better connectivity for a mobile user. So what Keysight does to enable this AI learning within this wireless network ecosystem is we essentially have simulation emulation tools that can essentially simulate very high volume network traffic that can be used for these models to learn. And so we can simulate the traffic, they can create a model, they can learn and ultimately apply these AI algorithms to again model power efficiency or schedule call scheduling, these types of things.

And then once the model has been built, you can use these same tools to test the efficacy of the actually AI driven model itself. So it’s a highly software driven focus to actually enable the AI modeling and the learning of these AI algorithms for these ecosystems.

Operator: Got it.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Sorry, there is a question, I can’t see. Yes, go ahead.

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: I don’t necessarily know specifically about the transaction, but certainly non terrestrial networks are a significant driver of investment in our ecosystem today. And one of the areas where I talked about earlier about one of the things that surprised us, the upside was growth in wireless. A lot of that investment, one of the areas where we are seeing it is this investment in non terrestrial networks. And so when you think about these non terrestrial networks, the connectivity between a earth based device and a satellite at the physical layer is not that much different than a terrestrial wireless connection. And so we use similar tools, but you have added complexity, right.

The satellite itself is moving at what is it 27,000 kilometers per hour or something like that. And so you have to you have this speed, you have the distance, you have the speed and you have the complexity of handoffs from one satellite to the next that need to be modeled. And so similarly to other industries, we have multiple touch points within these ecosystems that folks that are making components that go either into the satellite or to the ground station, sub assembly things like antenna arrays that need to be developed and tested and then the actual satellite itself as well as the ground station and the communication channel, earth to satellite communication channel. So we can provide in this case simulation capability to simulate these data links to test the ground station, to test the satellite and then a whole slew of both physical and protocol layer tools to test the components and subassemblies that make up these complex networks. So again, exciting for us because of the multiple touch points.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Great. Yes. And how is your positioning within the satellite space, I mean relative to your position with the wireless in the wireless sort of classic wireless operator area? I mean do you have a comparable share?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes, mean I think the thing that is unique about Keysight relative to other players in the broader test space is the breadth of our portfolio. We have been in this business a very long time. We have by far the most complete set of tools and we have for a long time, but even if you go back and look since the launch of Keysight and the spin off from Agilent, at that time we were very much focused on physical layer test and what we did post spin is we wanted to expand our touch points with these marketplaces and move up the protocol stack and so we moved into these protocol layers. We bought a company in 2015 called Anite, which got us protocol layer solutions for wireless. In 2017, we bought a company called Ixia, which got us protocol level solutions for wireline.

And so now as a result, we have a pretty unique portfolio, again a complete set of physical layer tools coupled with protocol layer solutions for both wireless and wireline that’s unique in the marketplace. And what that allows us to do for our customers instead of just selling them tools and allowing them together to cobble together a solution by buying tools from multiple vendors, we have a better opportunity to understand the specific challenges of the industries we are facing and provide them a complete solution with hardware, with software, with services that addresses that and essentially accelerates their time to market, which is why the focus on R and D, what are we really selling, you are selling time to market to our customers and it’s a breadth of our portfolio that I think uniquely positions us in the marketplace to do that.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Got it. And then let’s switch to Spyrin, a company I used to cover. You are awaiting regulatory approval to acquire Spyrin. You have had to make some concessions along the way. It sounds like you’re going to close the deal by October, but there’s still some approvals to go.

So maybe you can just remind us where you are in terms of the approval process and which parts of the portfolio you’ll be acquiring and you’re looking forward to having part of it?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes, absolutely. So there is kind of one step left and there is one big step left and then there is some kind of formality steps that we will also need to go through. The big remaining step is we are waiting on approval from China SAMR. All I would say is our conversations with SAMR have been and continue to be constructive and we are highly optimistic that we are going to get this transaction closed by the end of our fourth quarter, but we will continue to work with them until those approvals are in hand and we can close the transaction. I think from a strategic viewpoint and why this transaction was important and why we are excited to have it be part of Keysight, there are couple of SAM expansion portions of their business, which create a material expansion to our served addressable market.

One is around precision location, kind of GPS precision location. This is probably the crown jewel from our perspective. It is something that we believe is going to be critical to six gs. It’s critical in the aerospace defense sections. I just talked about how they are using AI to improve the beam forming as they model the likely behavior of a user with a mobile user with a cellphone, the more precise location you can get, the better off you are going to be able to do in modeling those types of things.

So I think there is a gap in our portfolio. We believe it’s going to be integral to success in six gs and it’s something that we are excited to have on board. The second thing is more of a network monitoring thing. So we do a lot of stuff again in the R and D lab, in manufacturing helping bring these communications ecosystems to market and getting them deployed, but we didn’t have a lot of touch points with those ecosystems once the networks were deployed. And so this gives us a further extension of touch points with the ecosystem into deployed networks and yet another revenue stream.

So excited to bring those things on board. Ultimately, we expect once we get the business integrated, it’s going to be accretive to both gross and operating margins at the Keysight level, so a great opportunity for us to create value for shareholders.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Great. And that’s a neat segue to aerospace and defense given their positioning business. I guess that could be relevant for robo taxis as well. But let’s talk about aerospace and defense. There’s been a lot of different policy announcements, the NATO spending increase, the big beautiful bill, there’s been Doge.

What have you seen at a net level? Have you you said it sounds like it’s more ahead of you, there are, I guess, potential headwinds you might have seen from government efficiency measures. So what have you seen so far?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes, I think a couple of things. So first of all, we believe net additive, so certainly net additive at the macro level. We have actually seen less detraction from things like Doge than you might have expected, because again, where we tend to play aerospace defense technology spending and the Doge was really more about efficiency gains rather than trying to reduce fundamental spending in core technologies as we move forward. I think one of the things we are benefiting from in The U. S.

Is there is does seem to be one of the few areas where there does seem to be some political alignment between the Democrats and Republicans in terms of the need to invest not just in defense, but in defense technology and I think that’s been helpful. We have seen increasing defense budgets across both the Trump one, Biden and now Trump two presidential administrations And so that’s been has been additive and we would expect to continue to be additive. I think one of the big changes that we are starting to see now really in terms of picking up of activity is the increased commitment to spending as defense spending as a percentage of DUP among the NATO allies. Again, can take time to work its way through, but we are seeing increased activity, increased quoting activity, bidding activity on programs with our European defense customers and again these tend to be long term commitments. And so it’s something that we are excited about and has us very bullish on the aerospace defense opportunity as we look forward.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: And what are the sort of priorities that excite you the most in the defense modernization or is this just a modernization process of bringing this existing equipment up to date or is it more these Germanys of this world that are stepping up for the first time?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Well, I think it’s both. I mean I think as these NATO allies who maybe have been under spending for a period of time looked at have dramatic increases in their spending, a certain percentage of that is going to go to things that we don’t necessarily care about, boots and weapons and bullets and then a certain percentage is going to go to things that we very much do care about, technology investment. And that technology investment primarily centers around communications, signal capture, signal jamming, understanding the communications signature of the battlefield if you will, electromagnetic spectrum operations, radars, these types of things are where we have the biggest contributions to make. And I think it’s highly likely that as the NATO allies increase spending that a not insignificant percentage of that business, particularly as it relates to Keysight with a $1,000,000,000 plus aerospace defense business is going to create significant opportunities for us moving forward.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Got it. And let’s switch to automotive in the interest of time. So we’ve got this big change happening with both on the powertrain to EVs, there’s been a there’s a change from the West to China, which looks like it’s going to dominate. But at the same time, we’ve got this transition to software defined vehicles, which China seems to be leading on. How are you positioned relatively given that China seems to be taking the lead in a lot of this innovation?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes. I mean I think I’d say two things. I think as it relates to the drivetrain and the move towards electric vehicles, China has been a significant disruptor, not unlike what happened in solar panels. There are lower cost Chinese batteries available that I think create real questions as to what level of investment is going to continue in the OEMs and the other big auto producing countries around the world. And I think that’s a question to be answered.

I think if there is good news in there, I think it’s that our EV business has been significantly derisked at this point. There is not a lot of downside. We will see if those markets recover. I think where opportunity lies for us is in the software defined vehicle space, can think about autonomous driving is probably the really big opportunity that will play out over at least a decade, maybe a couple of decades if you think about true level five autonomous driving, but also included in there would be infotainment systems, in car networks, a lot of in car electronics are also included in this space. And there I do think you are going to see the broader global automotive ecosystem continue to develop and invest and it goes beyond the car itself.

You talk about vehicle to everything communications, you got infrastructure elements and other things that are going to need to include these communications technologies. And so when you think about autonomous driving, how does it ultimately get accomplished? It’s through a confluence of multiple different communications technologies, things like five gs and six gs, but also Wi Fi, in car land, radar, LiDAR systems, these are all areas where Keysight has core expertise. And so I think we are uniquely positioned to help the industry particularly as things standardize, right. We love industries that have standards.

I think the auto industry has resisted that in a lot of ways. You can think of that about charging, right. The Tesla plug is different than BMW plug as an example, but I think if you talk about getting to a true broad scale autonomous, there is going to have to be some standardization. These industries are going to have to come together, which creates interoperability challenges and all sorts of other things, which is good for Keysight. So as I said, where we are seeing strength in auto today is in that software defined vehicle and this is an area where we are very bullish as we look forward.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: And if China does take the lead, is there a risk in five to ten years that those guys switch from sort of best in class Western vendors to domestic vendors even if they are inferior, maybe they are under pressure?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Right now, think that’s unlikely. I just think first of all, I think it’s significantly more challenging technological problem than the battery problem where there has been some significant Chinese disruption. I also just think it’s unlikely that these major auto OEMs around the world, you think about the big names in Japan and Korea and Europe, it’s going to seed these markets, right. And so I just think that there is going to continue to be development across the board and ample opportunity for Keysight to compete and win.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Got it. And then you’ve got your semiconductor general electronics business. Obviously, there’s a lot of design activity around AI chips, perhaps not that actually that much volume relative to the overall semiconductor industry, but obviously, if you are playing into the R and D side, then presumably you have seen quite a big uptick and how is that affecting you so far today and where are we in the kind of baseball innings of that? You’re talking about

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: the use of AI in chip design?

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Said the AI semiconductor AI related semiconductor demand, for example, custom silicon from hyperscalers, obviously new potential customers, how have you seen that impact? Yes. So I mean if

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: you think our semiconductor business is pretty we have a couple of highly differentiated positions. We are not a broad semiconductor tools player, but within our semiconductor business, we make a tool called the Parametric Tester. It’s essentially a wafer level test at the end of the manufacturing process, but we are definitely seeing AI driven demand, right, because you can point it back to high bandwidth memory, you can point it back to the demand back to the migration towards smaller process architectures and an increasing focus on silicon photonics and all of those things directly link back to AI. And so we tend to be more agnostic to what the actual functionality of the chips itself were more of a wafer level test on the production processes, but we can tie the demand that we are seeing back to the underlying market drivers and AI is clearly one of those drivers that is driving demand across the semi ecosystem.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Got it. Last couple of questions unless there is any from the audience. Just one more on China and one more on margins. So on China, it’s about high teens percent of revenue as How I understand is it that the sort of overall geopolitical backdrop affected that market and what do you see going forward? You have touched a bit of on in terms of auto, but what about for your whole business?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes. I think there are puts and takes as it relates to China. So first of all, we have been dealing with now for six or seven years that kind of the ongoing evolution of trade sanctions on China. Obviously, it started with restrictions on selling it aerospace defense and then it was Huawei and then it was semiconductor. And this has been an ongoing headwind, which we have largely been able to kind of plow through and continue to grow our business.

I think with the escalation of the tariff environment and just kind of the prolonged nature of this, we are seeing an increased portion of the industry move to at least the China plus one strategy, if not just an all out move out of China. So what we have seen some pullback in some areas of demand in China, it’s been offset by a corresponding increase in demand in Southeast Asia. And so kind of it gives in one area and takes away in the other. And I think the net benefit is that we continue to see growth across the broader Asia region as a result.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Got it. And just a last one on margins, obviously, you have been transitioning to a greater portion of recurring revenue, greater portion of software, how much more margin upside can you push through from that transition from here?

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: Yes, mean I continue to think about the high level operating model, which we have laid out for investors, which essentially calls for our business to grow at 5% to 7% on a sustained basis over the cycle on average. And when we grow at that level, we can deliver 40% operating leverage to the bottom line. And so you see that this year, we are actually slightly over delivering to that metric ex tariffs and then the tariffs have obviously been a little bit of an exogenous shock to the system. But as our businesses continue to recover, we expect to continue to grow in line with those long term averages and expect to continue to increase our overall profit margins by delivering to this strong incremental. That’s the way we manage our business and we believe we can continue to deliver to that model.

Rob Sanders, European Tech Hardware Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Well, great. Thanks very much. I really appreciate the time and let’s go to the drinks.

Neil Daugherty, CFO, Keysight: All right. Thank you, everybody.

Her script included some significant messaging, including praise for “our beloved agency brands” — a notable point given WPP’s internal agency mergers in recent years, since before the pandemic.
Staff who are unable to join due to the time difference can submit questions in advance.
“Our next chapter will be fantastic,” she said, before acknowledging the company’s recent challenges, which included a profit warning on July 9.
“Now I won’t sugar-coat this: We have a lot of hard work ahead and of course it won’t be easy.","Cindy Rose, the incoming chief executive of WPP, has used her first company message to tell staff in a video that she is “super-excited” to start in the job but she won’t “sugar-coat” the “hard work ahead”.

Her script included some significant messaging, including praise for “our beloved agency brands” — a notable point given WPP’s internal agency mergers in recent years, since before the pandemic.

Rose, who starts on September 1, has invited WPP’s 104,000 staff to join a “town hall”—live from New York—on September 4, when she will address them and take questions about her plans for the UK-based agency group. Staff who are unable to join due to the time difference can submit questions in advance.

Rose started her two-minute video by saying she was “proud and honoured” to take charge and pointed out how, during her prior roles at Vodafone, Virgin and Microsoft, she had worked variously with WPP creative agencies Grey, VML and Wunderman Thompson. The latter brand was dropped at the end of 2023 and merged into VML.

In her most recent role at Microsoft, where she was chief operating officer for global enterprise, she also had experience as a “strategic technology partner” to WPP on “cloud and AI”. “You could say I’ve been a mega-fan of WPP for 15 years now,” she said, noting she has also been a non-executive director of WPP since 2019.

“Our next chapter will be fantastic,” she said, before acknowledging the company’s recent challenges, which included a profit warning on July 9.

“Now I won’t sugar-coat this: We have a lot of hard work ahead and of course it won’t be easy. But when I think of the assets that we have as a company, the brilliant people we have, the multi-award-winning creative work that we produce, our beloved agency brands, our amazing clients, our global reach, our world-leading technology capabilities—wow, I cannot help but feel excited about our future.”

Rose, who has joint American and British citizenship, concluded by saying: “I cannot wait to get out there and spend time with you and your clients, to get to know you better, to learn from you, and to support your success. I am, as you can probably tell, super-excited to co-create the new WPP together.”

WPP said at its Q2 results that it expects revenues less pass-through costs to fall between 3% and 5% in 2025 — in contrast to rivals Publicis and Omnicom, which both expect to grow—and added Rose will carry out a review of WPP’s strategy.

WPP’s share price has also more than halved since the start of the year to trade below 400p, giving it a stock market valuation of about $5.4 billion (£4 billion).",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2fCindy-Rose-WPP-Campaign-Asia-Pacific.jpg&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-08-27 23:09:23.889220

The 2025 summer season has been marked by mixed financial publications, against a backdrop of slowing consumer spending, markets that have become unpredictable and, above all, the forthcoming rise in customs duties in the United States.

While some companies fared better than others, all had to contend with a more complex economic reality. Here's a look at the main players in the sector: France's and the Americans, and .

Coty in transition, between falling sales and possible asset disposals

The American group Coty saw its sales fall by 4% in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, for net sales of $5.89 billion (€5.07 billion). Demand remains weak, particularly in North America, and retailers are clearing their inventories rather than placing new orders. The group has indicated that it is going through a ""transition year"" and is counting on a return to growth in the second half of fiscal 2026.

Faced with this tense economic situation, Coty has launched a new phase of transformation called All-in to Win, which involves restructuring around 700 jobs. At the same time, market speculation has been circulating since June about a possible sale of assets, notably in luxury and consumer cosmetics. France's Interparfums may be in the running.

Estée Lauder deepens losses and accelerates restructuring

For the other American giant, Estée Lauder, the results published at the end of August were particularly alarming. The group recorded a net loss of $546 million in the fourth quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, a figure almost double that of last year. This underperformance is largely due to the implementation of a restructuring plan announced in February, the total cost of which is estimated at between $1.2 and $1.6 billion. In all, between 5,800 and 7,000 jobs will be eliminated worldwide.

The general decline in sales, down 8% for the full year to $14.3 billion (€12.3 billion), affected all segments except perfume, which remained stable. The group was particularly hard hit by the collapse of travel retail sales, which fell by 28%.

Despite this, Estée Lauder remains hopeful of a rebound as early as 2026, betting on a gradual recovery, selective price increases, and double-digit growth in e-commerce. However, management anticipates a negative impact of around $100 million from U.S. tariffs in the current financial year.

The company surpassed analysts’ expectations on earnings and revenue and said it’s seeing solid demand for its new generation of artificial intelligence-capable personal computers, but its guidance for the current quarter failed to reflect that optimism.

The PC and printer manufacturer reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of 75 cents per share, matching Wall Street’s forecast. It also delivered total sales of $13.9 billion, up 3% from a year earlier and ahead of the $13.69 billion consensus estimate.

The slight bump in revenue helped HP to boost its bottom line, and it reported net earnings of $763 million in the quarter, up from $640 million in the same period one year ago.

HP President and Chief Executive Enrique Lores (pictured) hailed the company’s fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, saying this was the result of strong momentum in key growth areas. “These results demonstrate our agility and focused execution in the quarter, reinforce the strength of our strategy, and our commitment to be a leader in the future of work,” he added.

HP’s stock quickly rose around 2% on the report, but the initial momentum faded and those gains were soon pared back, and it was trading almost 3% lower at the time of writing.

A lot of attention was paid to Lores’ comments on a conference call with analysts, who were eager to find out how U.S. trade tariffs are impacting the company. While some technology hardware is exempted from the heaviest tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump due to ongoing investigations, HP is not totally immune to the country’s shifting trade policies.

Lores insisted that the company is “executing with discipline” in a dynamic environment. He explained that the company managed to avoid some of the heaviest China tariffs by moving manufacturing away from that country to other nations, where there are currently no tariffs for PCs.

However, he admitted that the company’s printer business didn’t come through completely unscathed. “We have been impacted by the trade changes across the board by the reciprocal tariffs, and what we have been doing is rebalancing manufacturing into the countries that were more favorable, driving more accelerated cost reductions, and also in some cases, selectively taking prices up to compensate for that,” Lores explained.

HP’s stock has declined 17% in the year to date, not only from ongoing concerns about the impact of tariffs, but also fears of weakness in the PC market. But Lores said the company was seeing stronger-than-expected demand for PCs, especially in the consumer segment.

The CEO said sales of PCs were boosted due to the growing interest in its so-called “AI PCs,” which are fitted with powerful chipsets to process AI workloads on the device. According to him, AI PC sales rose by double-digits on a sequential basis, and he believes this is a trend that will accelerate next year. “If you are buying a new PC now, you don’t want to buy a PC that will not be able to take advantage of all these improvements that will continue to come to market in the coming months and years, so you better upgrade to an AI PC,” Lores said.

The PC business is also getting an annual boost due to the “back-to-school” season, which Lores said has “started strong” so far. In addition, HP also stands to benefit from the imminent end of support for Microsoft Corp.’s Windows 10 operating system. That company is planning to stop providing software updates and technical support for Windows 10 users at the end of October, unless customers pay an additional fee.

Lores said that just over half of the Windows installed base has made the transition to Windows 11 so far, which suggests that many more are likely to upgrade their PCs soon.

Despite Lores’ apparent optimism, HP’s forecast for the third quarter was a tad conservative. The company said it’s expecting third-quarter earnings of between 87 and 97 cents per share, the midpoint in line with Wall Street’s forecast of 92 cents per share.",https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/08/Screenshot-from-2025-08-28-08-17-50.png,N,,2025-08-27 22:06:21.988034

At the heart of it all is Marcel, Publicis’ AI-powered employee experience platform and its growth engine.
“In most organisations, the employee experience has historically been the focus – improving life at work for employees,” she says.
“At Publicis, we have a view that life experience matters just as much.
Another area of life experience that Publicis is addressing is giving people access to global opportunities while helping them connect to family and friends.","PARTNER CONTENT

“The current state of employee experience across industries is at a turning point,” Grant says. “Roughly 25% of people in the region across all industries are either looking for new opportunities or planning to. Lower population growth, an aging population, demand for new capabilities – all of these forces mean that organisations must double down on capability building and support individuals to continually augment their skills and support client growth.”

“Agencies must also respond to generational shifts. Gen Z will have around 17 jobs spanning five careers in their lifetime. As such, they are looking for radical flexibility, lifelong learning and a personalised career path. Gone are the days where organisations can offer a one-size-fits-all approach.”

Grant’s words reflect the sentiment of a rapidly evolving industry and workforce. The industry has for some time now been challenged by limited talent pools and cost pressures. Agencies now find themselves navigating both increased employee expectations and accelerated technological advancement. In this climate, Grant believes the relationship between people and organisations needs to evolve.

“There’s a real shift in what people are expecting from their employers,” she says. “They want to work for companies that care about them, that invest in them. That’s especially important now as AI starts to reshape everything.”

Nurturing people in the age of AI

Rather than framing AI as a threat, Grant sees it as a catalyst for reinvention, in regards to roles, capabilities, and the employee experience itself. But she’s also aware of the anxiety that comes with change.

“There is fear around AI,” she acknowledges. “People don’t want to be replaced by it, but they do want to understand how to work with it. They want to be upskilled so that they're not left behind.”

Publicis has responded by doubling down on internal education and hands-on experimentation, giving employees the tools to engage with AI rather than resist it. One such program is PL.AI, a personalised learning course that allows talent to choose their own AI upskilling path based on their role, AI utilisation level, and ambitions. At the heart of it all is Marcel, Publicis’ AI-powered employee experience platform and its growth engine.

“Marcel has become the hub for what we offer our people,” Grant explains. “It’s how they access PL.AI, how they discover opportunities, and how we connect our people across markets. It makes learning visible and accessible.”

This hands-on approach has helped simplify AI for employees, allowing them to participate in the change rather than fear it. But beyond capability building, Grant is more concerned with what she calls “career confidence”.

“People want to feel like they have a future,” she says. “And part of our job is to show them what that future can look like, and how they can be part of shaping it.”

The Groupe’s approach to AI is underpinned by ‘Viva la Difference’, a philosophy which means everyone at Publicis, regardless of difference, is valued and has a sense of belonging.

“It's crucial that we help everyone at Publicis to understand the ethical significance of using AI and the potential risks involved. This ensures we remain accountable to our clients. As AI usage becomes more widespread, our people must be critical thinkers who use AI ethically to reduce bias in data and outputs, promoting inclusion, not mere implementors. Our Viva La Difference spirit is even more important in the age of AI,” says Grant.

The future of LX

For Publicis, the evolution of talent strategy has gone beyond traditional upskilling. Grant refers to it as a move towards LX – short for life experience.

“In most organisations, the employee experience has historically been the focus – improving life at work for employees,” she says. “At Publicis, we have a view that life experience matters just as much. We are interested in improving how work fits into your overall life, how we support people through different life stages, how we give them access to growth and how we help them explore many careers across Publicis. All of that is part of the value exchange.”

To promote a culture where individuals are encouraged to bring their whole selves to the workplace, Publicis offers a number of DEI initiatives across APAC, from Menopause Leave in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong to fertility leave and flexible public holidays in various markets – initiatives that epitomise the Viva la Difference spirit.

In March 2024, Publicis ANZ launched its first-ever Disability Access and Inclusion Plan, in partnership with the Australian Disability Network. India has adopted an initiative called Boss Lady, a six-month intensive programme with the women of the company around leadership. Across the region, women also make up 75% of Publicis APAC’s executive leadership team, which is significantly higher than the APAC average for female CEOs.

Another area of life experience that Publicis is addressing is giving people access to global opportunities while helping them connect to family and friends. Take Work Your World, a program launched in 2021 that allows any Publicis employee to work from any office around the world for up to six weeks a year.

As a result of these programs, which support people’s life experiences in big and small ways, employee turnover has significantly decreased ahead industry benchmarks across APAC.

Supporting growth & connection

Publicis Moves, a new APAC-wide initiative, launched in July 2025, is helping employees explore new roles across markets, disciplines, and agencies within the business. In Australia, 11% of new roles are now filled internally; the goal is to help people grow their careers while retaining them within the Groupe.

“Since launching Publicis Moves, we have already seen several stories of success, with people moving from China to Singapore, local moves from talent acquisition to production, or from agency data to PMX – and the list goes on. We are uniquely positioned in our industry to offer diverse careers due to our culture of collaboration and connection across agencies and capabilities,” says Grant.

“There’s this outdated idea that when you join an agency, you stay in one career lane. But careers aren’t linear anymore. We want to make it easy for people to have multiple careers within Publicis. With Generation Z now making up close to 30% of our workforce across APAC, Publicis Moves and our connected structure enables them to explore different careers.”

Another program that leverages the Groupe’s connected platform to support career growth is Next Generation Board, which brings together a group of emerging leaders from different agencies and capabilities in each local market to tackle real business problems with fresh thinking. What started in ANZ has now expanded across SEA, India, China and Japan, depicting a clear signal that the Groupe is preparing for what’s next, not just reacting to what’s now.

In India, for example, Next Generation Board created an innovation hub, and devised a strategy for engaging clients in more innovative solutions, addressing real-world business challenges as one connected team.

Caring for people

Perhaps one of the most moving initiatives at Publicis Groupe is Working with Cancer, launched after Publicis Groupe Chairman and CEO Arthur Sadoun publicly shared his own diagnosis with all 100,000 employees in 2022. “He didn’t hide it, instead he put out a video saying ‘don’t worry, I’m back,’” Grant recalls. “That vulnerability sparked a global movement.”

Around the world, Publicis has put its might and scale behind a movement to erase the stigma of working with cancer. It partners with leading cancer institutes, and to date, 3,000 companies employing 30 million people have signed the WWC pledge, promising to create a more recovery-forward culture at work.

Across Publicis APAC, the program has offered extended paid leave for people undergoing treatment and increased flexibility when caring for loved ones. This year, the initiative expanded to include Screening Time Off, encouraging preventive health checks through company-wide participation in screening services, and free skin checks available at offices in various markets.

Grant says the response to Working With Cancer has been overwhelmingly positive.

“We’ve looked really hard into acknowledging the evolving needs of our people as an organisation. And as a result, we’ve achieved higher engagement and improved retention in relation to our overall industy. I’ve always been a big believer in creating a positive work environment for people that enables them to deliver their best work. In turn, this has contributed to the ongoing success of Publicis Groupe, as evidenced by our first-half results.

“We are not a company that waits for the industry to shift and then catches up. We always have one eye on the future, and one on the here and now. As a result, we have a very clear view on where we’re going and the next steps in our evolution.”",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2fPauly+Grant+CTO+APAC+(1).jpg&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-08-27 22:07:43.029392

Here’s how Lebanon, Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel got to this point and where it might go from here: Transformation plan Cracker Barrel hired Masino, a longtime Taco Bell and Starbucks executive, in July 2023.
“I suspect that if we did it in the same sequence as Cracker Barrel, we would have gotten the same noise.” Nostalgia factor Cracker Barrel acknowledged Monday that it should have done a better job with the new logo’s rollout.
Now, Murphy said, Cracker Barrel should reinforce the message that it’s not moving away from its values or heritage.
Murphy said Cracker Barrel can continue to “refresh” its stores, making them brighter and more welcoming to younger customers.","Like its namesake barrels that transported soda crackers until boxes replaced them, Cracker Barrel needed to change.

The restaurant chain’s new CEO, Julie Felss Masino, laid out the argument to investors last year: Cracker Barrel’s customer traffic was down 16% compared to 2019. Research showed consumers thought the brand fell short of competitors in essential ways, from the quality of the food to value and convenience.

Cracker Barrel relents and says its old logo will return

“We are not leading in any area. We will change that,” Masino said.

But over the past week, Cracker Barrel’s attempted revamp hit a wall. The company saw severe backlash over its plans to modernize and simplify its nostalgic logo – including from President Donald Trump.

“I don’t like the changes. I mean it’s always been Cracker Barrel like it is, so I’d like for it to stay like it is,” customer Sid Leist said during a visit to a Cracker Barrel in Vicksburg, Mississippi, on Tuesday.

By that evening, Cracker Barrel had reversed course and said its old logo would remain. It features an overall-clad man – said to represent Uncle Herschel, a relative of Cracker Barrel’s founder – leaning on a barrel, with the words “Old Country Store” underneath.

Investors cheered the move. Cracker Barrel’s stock price rose 8% Wednesday to close at $62.33 per share. That was even higher than its closing price on Aug. 15, before it announced the new logo.

Here’s how Lebanon, Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel got to this point and where it might go from here:

Transformation plan

Cracker Barrel hired Masino, a longtime Taco Bell and Starbucks executive, in July 2023. She was chosen for her record as an innovator, with the hope that she would attract new customers to Cracker Barrel, which operates 660 restaurants in 43 states.

Masino introduced updated menu items, like Hashbrown Casserole Shepherd’s Pie, to increase Cracker Barrel’s dinnertime traffic. She also started remodeling the company’s dark, antique-filled restaurants, lightening the walls and installing more comfortable seating.

The changes appeared to be helping. Cracker Barrel’s fiscal third quarter, which ended May 2, was the fourth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth for the company. Same-store sales, a key metric for restaurants, measures sales at locations open at least one year.

Logo misstep

Richard Wilke, a former executive at the brand consultancy Lippincott who helped lead rebrands for companies like Delta Air Lines and Walmart, said Cracker Barrel’s existing logo is too detailed and fussy for the digital age, when companies have to think about how their brand appears in a smartphone app.

But Wilke said Cracker Barrel’s new logo, featuring just the company’s name in brown letters on a gold background, lacked character. The logo’s rollout also seemed like an afterthought. In a press release about new fall menu items released Aug. 18, the company mentioned the new logo in the fourth paragraph.

The approach Walmart took in 2008 provides a better model for a successful rebrand, according to Wilke. Walmart wanted to broaden its appeal, especially to shoppers in urban areas. It redesigned stores, slowly adding a new blue-and-yellow color scheme and yellow asterisk symbol. It trained employees on the meaning behind its new slogan, “Save money. Live better.”

After a year or more, the company finally introduced its new logo, which added the yellow asterisk and dropped the hyphen from Wal-Mart in order to de-emphasize the discount term “Mart.”

“The logo change was almost a natural conclusion to this multi-year transformation,” Wilke said. “I suspect that if we did it in the same sequence as Cracker Barrel, we would have gotten the same noise.”

Nostalgia factor

Cracker Barrel acknowledged Monday that it should have done a better job with the new logo’s rollout.

The company said it should have emphasized all the things that would remain the same about Cracker Barrel restaurants: the rocking chairs on the front porches, fireplaces in the dining rooms and vintage Americana and antiques scattered throughout.

The company said it would also continue to honor Uncle Herschel on its menu and on items sold in the country-style stores attached to its restaurants. But it was too late, and Cracker Barrel pulled its new logo the next day.

Next steps

Thomas Murphy, a professor of practice at Clark University School of Business, said returning to the original logo was a “positive course correction” given the intensity of fans’ response. Now, Murphy said, Cracker Barrel should reinforce the message that it’s not moving away from its values or heritage.

Murphy said Cracker Barrel can continue to “refresh” its stores, making them brighter and more welcoming to younger customers. But it doesn’t really need to “rebrand,” he said, which would indicate a bigger change in direction or purpose.

Wilke agrees that Cracker Barrel should stick with the old logo but continue to revamp its restaurants in the short term. Eventually, the company will have to adopt a simpler logo, he said, but it should design one that retains more of the brand’s heritage.

Political fallout

One difference with past corporate transformations — including a 2014 rebrand by Southwest Airlines to attract more business customers or Dunkin’ Donuts 2019 renaming to Dunkin’ — is the more divisive political climate.

Cracker Barrel caught heat not only from Donald Trump Jr. but from the president himself. On Tuesday morning, Trump said via Truth Social that Cracker Barrel “should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before.”

Later, Trump celebrated Cracker Barrel’s decision to drop its new logo.

Wilke said he wishes both Republicans and Democrats would stay out of brand decisions like Cracker Barrel’s. Rebrands are almost always about trying to attract new customers without alienating old ones, he said.

“This isn’t a political story,” he said. “If politicians now turn every company logo design update into a debate about being ‘woke’ or ‘anti-woke,’ we are headed into a damaging new era for corporate branding.”

“We’ve seen Los Angeles lag behind other cities in getting people back to the office,” CBRE real estate broker Jeff Pion said.","Even as bosses across the country report a jump in the number of people returning to the office, attendance in California remains less than half of what it used to be.

A recent survey shows that managers’ push to get workers back in the office is bearing fruit, but executives would still like to see people at their desks more often. A different dataset demonstrates that much of the lag is due to California.

Companies are stepping up enforcement of their attendance policies even as many workers try to avoid the daily routine of commuting and clocking in, real estate brokerage CBRE found in a national survey of office tenants.

Companies made “significant” progress in the last year in moving toward their office-attendance goals and enforcing their attendance policies, moving closer to cementing their long-term work guidelines than at any time since the COVID-19 pandemic, CBRE said.

The annual survey found that 72% of the companies surveyed have met their attendance goals, up from 61% the previous year.

“Companies have made significant progress on establishing a new baseline for work habits and office attendance after five years of adapting to hybrid work,” said Manish Kashyap, CBRE’s global president of leasing.

Still, a separate indicator released Tuesday shows how office visits are stuck below the national average in California.

The Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas still have some of the lowest office attendance in the country, according to the latest data from Kastle Systems, which provides key-card entry systems used by many companies and tracks patterns of workers’ card swipes.

Business in the regions is dominated by the entertainment and tech companies, which can often be more freewheeling because much of the work is done alone and on computers that could be located anywhere.

Bosses in Los Angeles tend to be more flexible when it comes to remote work in part because commutes can be so long there, said Mark Ein, Kastle’s executive chair. “It’s just harder to get to the office.”

In the week that ended Aug. 20, the average office population was 48.3% of full occupancy in Los Angeles, Kastle said Tuesday. Attendance was 41.8% in San Francisco and 49% in San Jose.

That’s well above the lows below 20% during the pandemic, but still behind places including New York and Chicago and far behind cities in Texas, which had more than 60% attendance.

In the CBRE annual survey, the most notable change was in the level of enforcement of back-to-office policies. The share of companies monitoring attendance jumped to 69% this year from 45% last year. Those enforcing attendance policies rose to 37% from 17%.

Bosses said they want to see even more people in the office. Surveyed companies reported that they want employees in the office an average of 3.2 days per week. Actual attendance is close to that at 2.9 days a week.

The fact that people aren’t in the office every day creates vibe issues for some managers who are trying to recapture the buzz their workplaces had before the pandemic.

More than half of organizations reported that a lack of office vibrancy on non-peak attendance days is a central challenge. Uneven attendance patterns create peaks and valleys throughout the week, something managers say makes it difficult for them to provide a consistent experience for employees.

“We’ve seen Los Angeles lag behind other cities in getting people back to the office,” CBRE real estate broker Jeff Pion said. “I would hypothesize that we didn’t have as many people in the office five days a week, even pre-COVID, just because of the nature of the work that takes place in Los Angeles.”

The data suggest that better offices are more likely to have more people. Average occupancy in what Kastle considers the best quality offices is higher than at lower quality offices.

“If someone is paying a lot for their office space, they’re going to want people to use it,” Kastle’s Ein said. “People who spend a lot on office space are ones who value it.”

Century City, L.A.’s hottest and most expensive office rental market, known for its elegant office towers full of financial companies and lawyers, is performing better than most, Pion said.

The commercial real estate industry needs people to return to the office. The overall drop in attendance and related cutbacks in leased office space have been particularly hard on landlords, some of whom have lost their buildings to forced sales or foreclosure due to falling revenues.

Downtown L.A. has 54 office buildings that are at immediate risk of devaluation and could result in nearly $70 billion in lost value over the next 10 years, a recent report by BAE Urban Economics said. That could lead to a loss of $353 million in property tax revenues.

The report recommended converting some of them partially or completely into housing.

Companies’ growing sense of clarity about their attendance policies offers some good news for struggling landlords as 67% of the managers CBRE surveyed said they plan to keep their offices the same or expand them within the next three years, a slight increase from last year’s survey.

Decisions about where offices will be located and what they’ll look like are being made more often with employees’ interests in mind, CBRE said.

“Employers are much more focused now than they were pre-pandemic on quality-of-workplace experience, the efficiency of seat sharing and the vibrancy of the districts in which they’re located,” said Julie Whelan, CBRE’s global head of research on tenant preferences.

In some cases, making the workplace more attractive may include offering employees a low-cost concierge to perform such services as filling employees’ cars with gas, picking up their laundry or retrieving their dogs from day care, as L’Oréal does in El Segundo.

Other inducements from companies adopting a carrot-and-stick approach to getting people back in the office include free food and drinks, comfortable furniture and communal workspaces. Some newer offices have designated library-type spaces as quiet zones, where cellphones and conversations are prohibited.

Many companies seek to be near public transportation, he said, but would also like to be near outdoor recreational facilities, such as parks and bike paths, where employees can exercise at lunchtime.

“They’re looking for amenity-based locations where there’s just lots and lots for people to do,” Pion said. “That is a trend that will continue.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bbf54ef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdc%2F3b%2F4298a1e947f5a75c77e4a0c672e1%2F1517084-fi-downtown-office-conversion-19-ajs.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 23:09:00.017282

Kroger-Owned Locations Closing In addition to Kroger stores, the company owns several regional grocery store chains.
As of February, Kroger had 409,000 employees, mostly working at its grocery stores.","Store bankruptcies and closures seem to be the norm this year, with everything from Joann craft stores to Rite Aid going under. Kroger, a massive grocery store company, is not immune to that trend.

Earlier this year, the company announced that it plans to close 60 locations. Since then, at least 39 have announced that they’re closing or have closed already. Here’s the complete list of Kroger-owned grocery store closures, along with the latest news that the company is laying off employees.

Why Is Kroger Closing Stores?

Back in June, when Kroger announced that it was closing 60 locations across the country, the company stated that the stores were being shut down because they were unprofitable. Closing 60 stores would bring “modest financial benefit.”

That announcement came about six months after a failed merger between Kroger and rival grocery chain Albertsons. Federal and state judges blocked Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons, stating that it would reduce competition and be detrimental to consumers.

When Will the Kroger Stores Close?

Many Kroger-owned stores have already closed, and many more planned closures have been announced. The company has not released a list of all the stores closing or closing dates. However, local news networks from around the country have been reporting on planned Kroger closures in their area.

Kroger-Owned Locations Closing

In addition to Kroger stores, the company owns several regional grocery store chains. Grocery Dive, a supermarket industry publication, has compiled a list of Kroger-owned stores that have closed or announced closures to date. Here are all 39 of them, organized by state, including the closing date if known.

From 2024 to 2025, strategic investments in robotics infrastructure have emerged as a critical catalyst for AI adoption, delivering measurable returns on investment (ROI) across sectors. This article explores how enterprises are leveraging robotics to accelerate AI integration, the financial and operational benefits they're reaping, and why investors should prioritize this transformative synergy.

The Robotics-AI Synergy: A New Industrial Paradigm

Robotics infrastructure is evolving from rigid, task-specific machines to intelligent, adaptive systems powered by AI. Three key advancements are driving this shift:

1. Analytical AI enables robots to process vast sensor data, adapting to dynamic environments. For example, BMW's AI-powered computer vision systems reduced vehicle defects by 60% by analyzing real-time production line data.

2. Physical AI uses simulated environments to train robots, reducing deployment costs. Startups like Boston Dynamics are pioneering humanoid robots that learn from virtual trials, slashing development timelines.

3. Generative AI is revolutionizing robotics design and simulation. Shell's AI-driven predictive maintenance system processes 20 billion sensor readings weekly, preventing equipment failures and saving millions in downtime.

These innovations are not isolated experiments. The global industrial robotics market hit $16.5 billion in 2025, with AI startups securing $107 billion in funding. This surge reflects a broader trend: enterprises are no longer asking if to adopt AI but how to scale it effectively.

ROI in Action: Case Studies from the Frontlines

Strategic robotics investments are delivering quantifiable ROI across industries:

- Walmart optimized its supply chain with AI, saving $75 million annually by refining truck routing and load efficiency. The system also cut CO₂ emissions by 72 million pounds, aligning with sustainability goals.

- JPMorgan Chase automated 360,000 staff hours yearly via its COIN platform, which reviews loan agreements with near-perfect accuracy. This freed employees to focus on high-value client interactions.

- CarMax used generative AI to summarize 100,000 customer reviews into 5,000 actionable insights in months—a task that would have taken 11 years manually. The result? Enhanced SEO and customer engagement.

These examples underscore a critical insight: AI's ROI is maximized when paired with purpose-built robotics infrastructure. The Capgemini Research Institute found that enterprises with strong AI readiness achieve ROI 45% faster than peers, with supply chain and finance functions seeing 20–30% cost reductions.

The Investment Opportunity: Where to Allocate Capital

For investors, the robotics-AI nexus offers multiple entry points:

1. Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS): This model democratizes access to automation for SMEs. Companies like ABB and Fanuc are expanding RaaS offerings, enabling scalable, pay-per-use robotics.

2. Sustainability-Driven Robotics: Energy-efficient robots are in high demand as industries meet ESG targets. Startups like Boston Dynamics and traditional players like Fanuc are leading this charge.

3. AI Hardware Specialization: High-performance GPUs and TPUs (e.g., NVIDIA's H100) are essential for real-time AI processing in robotics. The market for such hardware is projected to grow 25% annually through 2030.

Risks and Mitigations

While the potential is vast, challenges remain. Labor displacement fears and regulatory scrutiny could slow adoption. However, the net job creation (12 million globally by 2025) and reskilling initiatives (e.g., Germany's “Industry 4.0” workforce programs) suggest a managed transition. Investors should prioritize companies with robust ESG frameworks and partnerships with educational institutions.

Conclusion: A Strategic Imperative for Investors

Robotics infrastructure is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity for enterprises aiming to stay competitive. By accelerating AI adoption, these investments are driving productivity gains, sustainability, and operational agility.

Chris Ward authored the bill, based in part on a Consumer Watchdog report that examined various examples of surveillance pricing.
However, groups like the California Retailers Association believe the bill could lead companies to eliminate popular loyalty programs that help deliver lower prices, thus working against the goal of helping consumers.
Under the bill, loyalty and benefit programs are still permitted, as Ward notes the bill has been specifically tailored to target the practice of using people’s personal data to charge higher prices.
However, Michelin argues the language in the bill is overly broad when it comes to using personal data, which could open the door to litigation for companies.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California lawmakers, who pledged this year to address the state’s affordability crisis, are now weighing a proposal to stop companies from using personal data to set different prices. It's a move retailers say could undermine loyalty program discounts.

Assembly Bill 446, moving through the Capitol, would ban companies from using customers’ personal data to charge different prices for the same item, building on California’s existing privacy laws.

Asm. Chris Ward authored the bill, based in part on a Consumer Watchdog report that examined various examples of surveillance pricing. In the report, they cited examples such as Target, which, through its app, charged people $100 more for a television if they were in the store's parking lot as opposed to another location.

“We're trying to define through AB 446, the intersection of using your own personal information from your cell phone, from the IP address on your home computer that stores all those little tidbits about who you are and what demographics you might be a part of…and using that through an algorithm to regulate what price you pay for a good or a service,” Ward said.

Ward says at a time when prices are rising across the board, the last thing people should have to deal with is their personal data being used to dictate the price they pay. The proposal would not touch dynamic pricing, such as the system airlines use to adjust fares based on demand.

However, groups like the California Retailers Association believe the bill could lead companies to eliminate popular loyalty programs that help deliver lower prices, thus working against the goal of helping consumers.

“This is going to be a problem, and California consumers should be aware that the Legislature that promised affordability is actually moving forward with legislation that will make it more expensive to buy products in the state,"" said the organization’s President and CEO, Rachel Michelin.

Under the bill, loyalty and benefit programs are still permitted, as Ward notes the bill has been specifically tailored to target the practice of using people’s personal data to charge higher prices.

“We are not going to get in the way of very positive consumer benefits, if you have those loyalty programs, those discount programs, that is something we are accustomed to and we agree with, it’s pro-consumer and pro-business,” Ward said.

However, Michelin argues the language in the bill is overly broad when it comes to using personal data, which could open the door to litigation for companies.

“What the bill does is, while it might say that [loyalty programs are allowed], when you dive deep into the details of the bill, what it does is it changes parts of the Privacy Act in California that narrowly define what information you can and cannot use for loyalty programs, which actually will put them in jeopardy,” Michelin said.

Initial efforts to investigate and regulate surveillance pricing were underway at the Federal Trade Commission in January. According to Ward, those efforts have since been stalled due to the change in administrations, and it's up to the states to lead the effort in regulating.

Lawmakers will decide Friday if the proposal moves forward — a step that could make California the first state to outlaw surveillance pricing and reshape how companies use personal data during checkout.",https://media.abc10.com/assets/KXTV/images/1f54a574-afb6-4a43-a8ba-835a027c35b4/20250827T001354/1f54a574-afb6-4a43-a8ba-835a027c35b4_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 22:06:53.649318

But here’s a timely heads-up on one popular option sold at several major retailers, including Walmart, with expiration dates active and extending past the holiday weekend.

Tuesday night, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a voluntary recall by Taylor Fresh Foods after a recall was initiated by Latitude 36 Foods, LLC. The recall involves Taylor Farms Honey Balsamic Salad Kit (6/8.3 oz). From provided product photos at the FDA’s link, the salad kit appear to come in bags with a net weight of 8.3 ounces (oz). It is not immediately clear what the “6” listed by the FDA applies to.

The recall is happening because “Master packs — individual packets of dressing and toppings supplied by Latitude 36 Foods and included in Taylor Farms salad kits — incorrectly included Asian Sesame Ginger dressing rather than the intended Honey Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing,” meaning there’s potential for undeclared sesame and soy allergens in the Honey Balsamic Salad Kits.

Anyone with “an allergy or severe sensitivity to sesame and soy run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products,” cautions the FDA. The agency says no illnesses have been reported in connection with the recall.

Provided product details include:

Taylor Farms Honey Balsamic Salad Kit 6/8.3oz.

Code dates starting with “TFRS”

“Best If Used By” date up to and including September 4, 2025

States the notice: “The product code can be found in the upper right-hand corner of the packaging.”

Early Wednesday, Walmart also posted information to the Product Recalls section of its website, stating the recall affected select Walmart stores in 14 states: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia.

The FDA’s notice listed a more expansive distribution pattern to 25 total states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia. It does not further clarify which retailers—or potential foodservice vendors, as Taylor Farms also appears to be in the foodservice industry—may have received the recalled kits.

Major grocer Kroger also posted the following details on August 21:

“Affects Kroger stores located in Georgia; South Carolina; Auburn, Alabama; Greater Cincinnati (including Northern Kentucky and Dayton, Ohio plus South Eastern Indiana); Central and Northwest Ohio; Northwestern Virginia panhandle; Michigan; Indiana (except SE Indiana, -Evansville-); Illinois; Eastern Missouri; Greater Louisville area (including Indiana) and Lexington, Kentucky; Hopkinsville and Bowling Green, Kentucky; Nashville and Knoxville, Tennessee; Huntsville, Alabama; Greater Memphis area, Tennessee; Arkansas; Mississippi; Western Kentucky; North Carolina; Virginia; Eastern West Virginia; Eastern Kentucky; Southeastern Ohio; Texas and Louisiana; Dillons, Baker’s, Gerbes, King Soopers. City Market, Fry’s, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, QFC, Smith’s, Food 4 Less, and Foods Co. stores.”

The FDA urges anyone with the recalled salad kits to not eat them and to throw them away. Refunds “are available at the location of purchase,” states the agency.

(HPQ) has emerged as a standout performer in the technology sector, driven by a bold strategic pivot toward AI-driven hardware. The company's Q3 2025 earnings call revealed a compelling narrative of innovation, margin expansion, and market share gains, positioning HP as a leader in the next phase of computing. For investors, the question is no longer whether HP can adapt to AI but how quickly it can capitalize on its first-mover advantages.

Strategic Shift: AI as the Core of HP's Product Roadmap

HP's AI PC (AIPC) strategy has accelerated beyond expectations. AIPCs now account for 25% of the personal systems mix, a full quarter ahead of initial targets. These devices, equipped with NPUs, enable localized AI workloads that enhance productivity, collaboration, and data processing. The 5–10% price premium for AIPCs directly supports margin expansion, a critical factor in a market where traditional PC margins have long been compressed.

Beyond AIPCs, HP is embedding AI into its broader ecosystem. Partnerships with Adobe, Zoom, and Microsoft are unlocking new use cases for AI-driven software on HP hardware. For example, the HP Dimension with Google BIM leverages AI to create 3D video representations for remote collaboration, while HP Neo optimizes print shop workflows. These innovations are not just incremental—they redefine HP's value proposition, shifting the company from a commodity hardware provider to a solutions-driven innovator.

Financials: Margin Resilience and Cost Discipline

HP's Q3 2025 results underscore the financial benefits of its AI strategy. Revenue hit $13.9 billion, up 3.1% year-over-year, with the Personal Systems segment growing 6% as AIPC adoption drove double-digit sequential revenue growth. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 fell within guidance, while GAAP EPS surged 23.1% to $0.80, reflecting improved operating leverage.

The company's cost discipline is equally impressive. HP is on track to achieve $2 billion in annualized cost savings by fiscal 2025 through AI-powered automation, supply chain optimization, and manufacturing diversification. Nearly all North American products are now built outside China, mitigating trade-related risks and reducing costs. These savings are being reinvested into AI R&D and shareholder returns, with $400 million returned to shareholders in Q3 alone.

Competitive Positioning: Outpacing Peers in AI Adoption

HP's strategic agility is reshaping its competitive landscape. While rivals like Dell and Lenovo focus on traditional PC refresh cycles, HP is capturing market share in premium segments. AIPCs now represent a 25% mix of personal systems, with Adobe and Zoom integrating AI workloads into HP's ecosystem. This creates a flywheel effect: higher margins from AIPCs fund further AI innovation, which in turn strengthens customer loyalty.

The Printing segment, though down 4% year-over-year, is stabilizing through a shift to premium offerings and subscription models. HP's 99% recycled content in printers and 100% renewable electricity in U.S. operations also position it as a sustainability leader, a growing differentiator in ESG-focused markets.

Guidance and Long-Term Outlook

HP's Q4 2025 guidance reinforces its momentum. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to range between $0.87 and $0.97, with full-year free cash flow projected at $2.6–3.0 billion. The company anticipates mid-single-digit PC market growth in the second half of fiscal 2025, driven by Windows 11 refresh cycles and AIPC adoption.

Looking further ahead, HP's Investor Day in early 2026 will outline its AI-driven hardware roadmap, including plans to expand AI integration into industrial and enterprise solutions. With a P/E ratio of 10.35 and a free cash flow yield of 10%, HPQ appears undervalued relative to its growth trajectory.

Investment Thesis: A Buy for the AI-First Era

HP's strategic shift to AI-driven hardware is not just a short-term play—it's a structural transformation. The company's ability to monetize AI through premium pricing, operational efficiency, and ecosystem partnerships creates a durable competitive edge. For investors, the key risks include macroeconomic volatility and supply chain disruptions, but HP's cost discipline and diversification mitigate these concerns.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 20:10:36.547416

Title: CVS Health Settles Medicaid Overcharging Allegations, Analysts Predict Upside

CVS Health has agreed to a $12.25 million settlement with Massachusetts over allegations of overcharging Medicaid recipients. The settlement, announced by Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell, follows claims that CVS charged MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid program, higher prices than it offered to the general public for the same drugs.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell stated, ""When pharmacies overcharge MassHealth, they’re undermining the integrity of our public programs and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill."" As part of the settlement, CVS is required to adopt a yearly reconciliation process to review prescription drug pricing for MassHealth members to ensure the agency is not overcharged in the future.

The complaint was jointly filed by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana, and Oklahoma after a whistleblower lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

Financial analysts predict an 11.06% potential upside for CVS Health following the settlement, with an average one-year target price of $79.88. GuruFocus estimates a 14.89% upside based on GF Value calculations. Despite the settlement, CVS Health has committed to reviewing its pricing practices to prevent future occurrences.

Kroger shifts investment strategy to boost growth and maximize returns Despite the mounting challenges, Kroger continues to deliver positive financial results.","Following a failed merger with Albertsons and ongoing economic uncertainty in an evolving retail landscape, Kroger is taking further steps to stay competitive, though not without making harsh decisions for the sake of its business.

In an internal memo, Kroger announced it will lay off around 1,000 corporate employees to streamline operations, cut costs, and refocus resources on in-store performance.

The job cuts will primarily impact Kroger's Technology and Digital division. According to a company spokesperson, no employees from in-store positions, manufacturing facilities, or distribution centers will be affected.

Kroger plans to reinvest savings from the layoffs into key areas such as lowering grocery prices, extending store hours, and expanding real estate capabilities to boost store performance and enhance customer experience.

This marks at least the third round of corporate job cuts Kroger has implemented in 2025.

In February, the company eliminated a small number of roles to improve efficiency, followed by layoffs in March at 84.51°, Kroger's retail data science and analytics subsidiary.

In June, Kroger revealed it would close 60 underperforming stores by the end of 2026 to focus on higher-performing locations. Of those, 39 have been named, and at least 18 have closed.

Kroger and Albertsons' failed $24.6 billion merger

This major company restructuring follows the termination of a proposed $24.6 billion merger agreement between Kroger (KR) and Albertsons (ACI) in 2024.

The two grocery giants first announced the deal in 2022, with plans for Kroger to acquire Albertsons to form a national grocery powerhouse. The merger aimed to increase the brands' footprints and allow them to better compete with retail rivals.

However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) blocked the deal, arguing it would reduce competition, raise grocery prices, lower product quality, limit consumer choice, and harm workers.

The case against the merger was further solidified when a Washington state judge ruled it violated state consumer protection laws.

Kroger shifts investment strategy to boost growth and maximize returns

Despite the mounting challenges, Kroger continues to deliver positive financial results. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, total sales increased 3.2% year over year, with e-commerce sales up 15%.

However, recent cost-cutting measures are not a response to declining sales. Instead, they are part of Kroger's strategy to realign its spending to focus on initiatives that offer the highest return.

The speed and scale of China's electric vehicle revolution has caught the world by surprise, and analysts say this trend shows no sign of slowing down.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk was among those whounderestimated the potential of China's EV manufacturers.

In 2011, Musk dismissed BYD by laughing at their products during a Bloomberg interview. ""Have you seen their car?"" Musk said. ""I don't think it's particularly attractive, the technology is not very strong. And BYD as a company has pretty severe problems in their home turf in China. I think their focus is, and rightly should be, on making sure they don't die in China.""

BYD seems to have had the last word. The company has been at the forefront of China's aggressive EV push, rapidly expanding its domestic market and overtaking Tesla as the world's largest EV manufacturer by revenue in 2024.

Chinese start-ups such as Nio and Li Auto, alongside more established automakers including Geely and SAIC Motor, are also leading manufacturers in this space. Battery giant CATL has meanwhile been a key player in powering these vehicles.

It's so saturated in China that they have to look elsewhere. And we're at the point now where exports to the rest of the world is only really just starting.

Rella Suskin

Equity analyst at Morningstar

Henner Lehne, vice president of competitive intelligence, market analysis, forecasting at S&P Global Mobility, said China's EV industry has become a ""significant force"" in reshaping the global car market.

""Just a couple years ago the domestic car makers in China were not seen as true competitors to the established global car industry. But that changed quickly within just a couple of years,"" Lehne told CNBC by email.

""BYD alone was growing about 1 [million] units per year for the last three years straight, wiping out the smile in the faces of many product managers from the legacy car makers. And the competition is not only staying in China,"" he added.

Feeling the pressure

Notably, in 2023, China surpassed Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter. It's domestic car sales then ballooned to a record 31.4 million units last year, with brand-new EVs accounting for roughly 41% of the total vehicles produced.

The Asian giant's auto sector growth has been attributed to subsidies, tax incentives and, between 2009 and 2023, an estimated $230 billion in EV development costs. Analysts also cited lower labor costs, the weaker yuan, innovative technological developments and a robust battery supply chain among Beijing's key advantages.

China's ascent has since led to regulatory scrutiny in Western markets, amid allegations of anti-competitive practices. Both the U.S. and European Union have slapped duties on Chinese-made EVs to protect traditionally dominant American and European brands.

Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights and a China auto market researcher, said he expects China to cement its dominance in auto manufacturing, ""just as it has done for solar panels. ship-building, drones and steel in recent years.""

By 2030, Dunne told CNBC that he expects China will manufacture 36 million vehicles per year, or four out of every 10 cars built globally at the time. He also anticipates that Beijing will export an estimated 9 million vehicles a year, from just 1 million in 2020.

""Countries with smaller manufacturing industries like Thailand, [South] Africa and Spain are already feeling the pressure from Chinese imports,"" Dunne told CNBC by email.

An industry shake-out?

In the U.K., for one, Chinese EV sales have soared. Chinese-owned car brands accounted for roughly 10% of all new car sales in June, up significantly from previous years.

Chinese EV brands have also rapidly made inroads in EV-friendly Norway. From the first delivery of an MG car to the Nordic country in January 2020, Chinese EV brands have gone on to capture a combined market share of roughly 10%.

watch now

Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar, said the growing competitiveness of Chinese vehicles in many parts of the world is only just beginning.

""It's so saturated in China that they have to look elsewhere. And we're at the point now where exports to the rest of the world is only really just starting. We haven't even begun to see the start of it,"" Suskin told CNBC by video call.

In that vein, China's EV industry was recently found to have spent more on factories abroad than at home for the first time on record, during 2024.

The story for Chinese EV players is perhaps not so rosy in their domestic market, however. Analysts told CNBC they expect an industry shake-out before too long, with many startups struggling to turn a profit in an increasingly crowded field.

How can Europe respond?

Sigrid de Vries, director general of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), a car lobby group, described China as a ""fierce competitor"" in the global market.

""I think we as the European auto industry have a legacy of being great competitors as well. So, I certainly wouldn't want to give up on European players, or Japanese, Korean or American for that matter.""

ACEA represents 16 major Europe-based automobile manufacturers, including the likes of Volkswagen , BMW , Stellantis , Renault and Volvo. It has frequently called on the EU to take action to ensure the bloc's competitiveness on the road to full electrification.

To help European carmakers compete with China's EV behemoth, ACEA's de Vries said a leveling of the policy playing field would make a meaningful difference.

""We have to realize that some of that leveling of the ground, speaking for the EU, could be realized on their own terms. It's the regulatory framework, driving cost, stifling innovation rather than unleashing entrepreneurial spirit,"" de Vries said.

ACEA's de Vries added that while Europe won't be able to substantially influence China or the U.S., the bloc's regulatory framework could be adjusted to ""try and create the best possible environment for doing business in Europe.""

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.

ID17,CVS Health,2025-08-27 23:11:22+00:00,Metro Weekly,CVS Health Refuses to Cover Cost of Twice-a-Year Injectable PrEP - Metro Weekly,"John Riley, André Hereford",,,,,https://www.metroweekly.com/2025/08/cvs-yeztugo-coverage-denial/,"CVS Health, which runs the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, will not cover Gilead Sciences’ FDA-approved HIV prevention drug Yeztugo, also known as lenacapavir, an injectable form of PrEP shown to be nearly 100% effective at preventing HIV transmission.
Gilead said it is “extremely pleased” with progress in its conversations with payers, most of whom continue to cover HIV prevention products with no cost-sharing or coverage barriers.
The three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRx, and Cigna’s Express Scripts — control about 70% of U.S. specialty drug prescriptions.
Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, blasted CVS Health’s refusal to cover Yeztugo as a “clear violation” of the Affordable Care Act, which requires preventive treatments, including PrEP, to be offered to patients at no additional cost.
“However, a drug will only work if people can access it, and right now CVS Health, which owns the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, is shamefully blocking people from taking it.”","CVS Health, which runs the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, will not cover Gilead Sciences’ FDA-approved HIV prevention drug Yeztugo, also known as lenacapavir, an injectable form of PrEP shown to be nearly 100% effective at preventing HIV transmission.

CVS spokesman David Whitrap told Reuters the decision was based on “clinical, financial, and regulatory factors,” citing the drug’s high price as a major concern.

Whitrap added that CVS will also exclude Yeztugo from its Affordable Care Act formularies, noting that its ACA preventive program follows recommendations from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which guides HHS policy and was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court earlier this summer, currently recommends only three older PrEP drugs: daily oral Truvada (also available as a generic), daily oral Descovy, and Apretude, a bimonthly injectable from ViiV Healthcare.

Some HIV advocates worry that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — known for questioning modern medicine and whose personal beliefs about HIV transmission are not based in science, and border on the bizarre — could replace members of the 16-member task force with ideologically aligned appointees.

Such an overhaul could lead to flawed preventive care guidelines across multiple diseases, higher out-of-pocket costs for patients, and even a rise in new HIV infections.

Mitchell Warren, executive director of the HIV/AIDS nonprofit AVAC, called CVS’s refusal to cover injectable PrEP “a grave disappointment and frankly a missed opportunity.”

“It does reflect a price that is too high and a U.S. pharmaceutical pricing structure that is frankly not sustainable,” Warren said.

Patient advocates had hoped Yeztugo, given twice a year by injection, would not only help prevent the spread of HIV but also reduce reliance on daily oral PrEP, lowering the risk of noncompliance that can undermine effectiveness. They believed the drug could further “bend the curve” and accelerate progress toward ending the HIV epidemic by cutting new infections each year.

HIV infects an estimated 1.3 million people annually and has caused more than 42 million deaths since the virus first emerged.

A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Gilead is still negotiating with CVS over Yeztugo, which carries a U.S. list price of more than $28,000 a year.

Gilead said it is “extremely pleased” with progress in its conversations with payers, most of whom continue to cover HIV prevention products with no cost-sharing or coverage barriers. The company said it is on track to secure 75% of U.S. insurer coverage of Yeztugo by year’s end, and 90% coverage by June 2026.

Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, serve as middlemen between drug companies and consumers, negotiating discounts with manufacturers on behalf of employers and health plans. The three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, UnitedHealth Group’s OptumRx, and Cigna’s Express Scripts — control about 70% of U.S. specialty drug prescriptions.

Optum said it will review Yeztugo for coverage in the coming weeks, while Express Scripts did not respond to requests for comment from news wire services.

Government programs, including the Veterans Administration and Medicare, have already added Yeztugo to their coverage lists. Gilead said earlier this month that Medicaid programs in states such as California and New York are also covering the drug.

Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, blasted CVS Health’s refusal to cover Yeztugo as a “clear violation” of the Affordable Care Act, which requires preventive treatments, including PrEP, to be offered to patients at no additional cost.

“The entire world is excited by this drug and its potential contribution to preventing and eventually ending HIV,” Schmid said in a statement. “However, a drug will only work if people can access it, and right now CVS Health, which owns the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, is shamefully blocking people from taking it.”",https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Injection-Photo-spukkato-via-123rf.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 20:10:29.845870

Krista, Conference Moderator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter twenty twenty five HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Krista, and I’ll be your conference moderator for today’s call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of the conference.

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP’s third quarter twenty twenty five earnings conference call.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Thank you, Orit, and thank you to everyone for joining today’s call. Let me start by saying we made solid progress against our goals and key strategic initiatives in Q3. We continue to execute with discipline and focus, delivering on our commitments and advancing our ambition to be a leader in the future of work. Today, we will take a closer look at our third quarter performance, highlight some of our newest innovations and discuss our Q4 outlook. Beginning with our performance, I am pleased to report that we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Q3.

Top line revenue increased 3% year over year, driven by strong performance in Personal Systems. This momentum was fueled by continued Windows 11 refresh, AITC adoption and services growth. We also drove collective double digit growth year over year and sequentially in our key growth areas. Our operating profit margins for both Print and Personal Systems were in line with our guidance. And non GAAP EPS was slightly above the midpoint of our guide, reflecting a sequential improvement of 6%.

These results demonstrate our ability to execute our plan and adapt quickly to the evolving trade environment. We are on track to reach our future ready gross annualized savings of $2,000,000,000 by the end of fiscal year twenty twenty five, which we expect will help drive continued improvements in operating profit. At the same time, we are making solid progress on our actions to mitigate higher trade related costs, including manufacturing diversification, cost reduction and pricing adjustments. This quarter as planned, nearly all products sold in North America are now built outside of China, helping to further reduce trade related costs. We continue to ramp up production across Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico and The U.

S. Most importantly, we have done what we said we would. We have demonstrated we can remain agile in responding to external pressures, while staying focused on our long term strategy. Now, let me share more color on the performance of each business unit. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 6% year over year, above our expectations.

We continue to shift our mix to higher value segments such as AIPCs, commercial premium and services. We saw strong year over year growth in both commercial and consumer segments. Commercial performance was supported by the Windows 11 refresh and increased AIPC adoption. We are very pleased with accelerating demand for the AIPC category, which grew revenue double digit sequentially. It has surpassed our expectations with shipments continuing to ramp, now reaching over 25% of our mix, a quarter ahead of our plan.

Consumer growth was supported by a strong back to school season. In our key growth areas, we delivered double digit revenue growth in advanced compute solutions. In services, momentum continued with strong revenue growth year over year, driven mainly by digital services and managed services. Yes, we did see softer demand in hybrid systems as companies are delaying some of their IT projects. Our installed base of active AIPC users is growing significantly and positioning us well for future AI driven innovations.

We are seeing strong momentum in the AIPC ecosystem with a number of software companies introducing solutions growing by double digits quarter over quarter. We are working closely with Microsoft and silicon providers to capture the opportunity created by the AIPC platform. Key ISV partners such as Adobe and Zoom are shifting workloads locally to take advantage of the NPU. We grew share in high value categories, especially in premium segments. This includes year over year and sequential gains in PC commercial premium, consumer premium and AIPCs.

Last quarter, we committed to actions to return our Personal Systems operating margin to its long term target range. I am pleased to report we achieved that delivering an operating margin back into our target range. Turning to Print. Revenue declined 3% in constant currency as expected. Our key growth areas in Print continued to perform well and had strong growth year over year.

While we continue to take actions to mitigate the increase in trade related costs, we saw overall a more aggressive pricing environment. Demand in the office segment was slightly softer than anticipated, particularly across North America and parts of Europe. However, we maintained our share position in office and we continue to focus on profitable unit placements. In Home, we maintained discipline in a competitive pricing environment. Supplies revenue performed as expected.

Diving deeper into our key growth areas, consumer subscriptions had a strong ramp in new subscribers of our all in plan. We had key wins with workforce solutions in industries such as finance, manufacturing, retail and public sector. We saw another quarter of strong growth in Industrial Graphics with share gains year over year reflecting the strength of our portfolio. Now, let’s take a closer look at recent innovations that are positioning us as a leader in the future of work. In Q3, we advanced our portfolio of AI powered solutions that help businesses drive growth and employees achieve professional fulfillment.

On the commercial side, our AI PC lineup received industry recognition. Our ElliBook Ultra was named top AIPC in the CRN Tech Innovator Awards. It was noted for its design, performance and impact on productivity. Our Workforce Experience Platform was recognized in the enterprise IT management category, praised for its ability to reduce digital friction and improve IT efficiency. Since launch, the platform has been deployed in 40 countries and we plan to expand to more than 30 additional countries in the coming months.

We are redefining how people connect and collaborate. We introduced HP Dimension with Google BIM, a video communication tool that uses six cameras and AI to generate three d video of participants designed to enhance remote collaboration. And we are excited to bring advanced AI capabilities to a broader audience with our Omnibook five notebook. For the prosumer, it delivers high performance and up to thirty four hours of battery life, empowering customers to stay productive longer. In our print portfolio, we are integrating AI to drive intelligent automation and customer centric design.

HP Neo, an AI powered chatbot for industrial print, is helping print shops improve production efficiency. In large format, HP Build workspace, an AI vectorization tool, helps architecture, engineering and construction professionals reduced drafting time by up to 80%. Responsible innovation and sustainability are foundational to our future of work efforts and we continue to demonstrate meaningful measurable impact. Today, 9% of HP home and office printers, desktops, notebooks, displays and workstations incorporate recycled content. We have reached 100% renewable electricity across our U.

S. Operations, marking a significant step toward our net zero goal. And in partnership with the YMCA, we’re establishing digital hubs that have already reached over 700,000 people worldwide, helping them succeed in the digital age. In addition, HP is pleased to support the White House initiative to advance AI education for America’s youth. This is an important step toward equipping the next generation with the skills needed to thrive in the future of work.

As we look ahead, we remain confident in the strength of the PC market in 2025. We expect the market to grow mid single digits in the second half with continued strong momentum from Windows 11 refresh and the AITC adoption. We believe these catalysts will continue to drive PC market growth in 2026. We expect the print market to decline low single digit in 2025 and at a similar level in 2026. However, our strategy is focused on protecting the operating profit contribution of the premium business to the company.

We will continue focusing on reducing unprofitable units by shifting to Big Tank, increasing lifetime customer profitability through growth in our consumer subscription business, gaining share in the higher value office categories, growing our key growth areas and maintaining cost discipline. AI is also opening new possibilities to transform how we operate and compete. Beyond driving structural cost reductions, we see tremendous potential to automate additional workflows, streamline decision making and accelerate innovation across the business. These capabilities will help us reduce complexity and drive lower costs. You will hear more about this from us in the quarters ahead.

Extremally, we recognize there is continued uncertainty in the global trade environment. We have planned for today’s landscape and have proven our ability to respond quickly to any future changes. Through our actions, we have strengthened our operational agility and have full confidence in our ability to navigate evolving conditions. As we continue to adapt to this dynamic environment, engagement with investors is a top priority. We are looking forward to sharing our long term plans during our Investor Day in early twenty twenty six.

There, we’ll provide updates on our progress and explore the exciting opportunities ahead to advance our strategy. Before I close, I want to thank our employees for their dedication, resilience and customer first mindset, which have been key to our progress. We know what it takes to deliver results and be a leader in the future of work, and we are executing with focus. Now, let me hand it over to Karen.

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with the progress we’ve made in the quarter to advance our strategy to lead the future of work, while navigating an evolving market environment and delivering on our financial commitments. We drove another quarter of solid revenue growth with continued momentum in Personal Systems, fueled by AIPC and Win eleven refresh activity and strong performance in our key growth areas. In fact, we delivered double digit sequential growth in Personal Systems, resulting in strong free cash flow in the quarter. In Print and PS, we executed decisively on the actions we laid out to mitigate trade related headwinds and are pleased with the meaningful progress we made in the quarter, including accelerating supply chain resiliency, cost reduction and pricing actions.

As a result, we were able to mitigate the majority of tariff costs in Q3, while delivering operating margins within our expected ranges for both businesses and non GAAP EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Taking a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 3% year over year, both nominally and in constant currency, with growth across all regions. In constant currency, Americas and EMEA each grew 1%, and APJ was up 11%, with particularly strong personal systems performance in China. Gross margin was 20.5%, down year over year with a higher mix from Personal Systems, increased trade related costs and unfavorable currency impacts.

We offset those headwinds in part with disciplined pricing actions and cost management. As anticipated, non GAAP operating expenses were up year over year. We drove our future ready cost plans and maintained strong expense management, while importantly investing in growth with key strategic and go to market initiatives. All in, our non GAAP operating margin was 7.1%, down year over year and in line with our expectations. Finally, with a diluted share count of approximately $954,000,000 shares, our non GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.75 and our GAAP earnings per share was $0.80 helped by favorable tax adjustments in the quarter.

Now let’s turn to segment performance. We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of solid growth in Personal Systems, with revenue up 6% above our expectations on 5% unit growth and increased ASPs. We continue to shift mix toward premium categories, while executing disciplined pricing actions to help mitigate cost increases. Sequentially, revenue was up 10 and units were up 13% on seasonal strength and overall share gains. And momentum continued in our key growth areas with strong performance in AIPCs, advanced compute and workforce solutions, offset in part by softness in hybrid systems.

We drove commercial revenue up 5% on 3% unit growth with favorable pricing and a mix shift toward premium. Consistent with our strategy, we gained share in Windows based commercial PCs as refresh activity fueled by Win eleven and AIPCs continued. Consumer revenue and units grew 8% with strong performance in North America along with China driven by gaming. And robust back to school seasonality and share gains drove consumer units up 34% sequentially. Importantly, as promised, we drove Personal Systems operating margin back into our guidance range at 5.4% with our planned mitigation actions.

Turning to Print. Our results reflect a slightly softer than expected office market and a pricing environment that remained competitive despite rising trade related costs across the industry. In this dynamic environment, we maintained our focus on profitable unit placement, prioritization of higher value categories, and disciplined cost management. We also drove strong performance in key growth areas, including double digit growth in consumer subscriptions and strong performance in industrial, fueled by double digit hardware growth. Looking at the details, print revenue declined 4% year over year or 3% in constant currency, with market driven hardware declines in both consumer and commercial.

Supplies performed as expected, down 3% in constant currency, and we continued to drive market share gains and favorable pricing that partially offset installed base and usage headwinds. And in line with our guidance, we delivered an operating margin of 17.3%, solidly within our target range and flat year over year as we offset increased trade related costs with pricing actions and cost reductions. Turning to our future ready cost plans. We are pleased with the progress we have made to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness across the company. This includes leveraging AI capabilities internally to drive automation and optimization of processes to better support our customers, partners and employees.

We are well on track to hit our total program goal of at least $2,000,000,000 in annualized gross run rate savings by the end of our fiscal year. These incremental structural savings enable our continued investment in our key growth areas and AI innovation, as well as to help us to mitigate macro uncertainties. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated approximately $1,700,000,000 in cash from operations in the quarter and roughly $1,500,000,000 in free cash flow, in line with our expectations. We also improved our cash conversion cycle this quarter, driving days payable up with higher manufacturing activity.

Lastly, we returned more than $400,000,000 to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. As we signaled at the beginning of the quarter, our leverage ratio remained slightly above our target range. So

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.: in

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: line with our stated framework, we limited our repurchase to offsetting stock compensation dilution. Of course, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as gross leverage remains under two times and there aren’t better return opportunities. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we will continue to focus on disciplined execution, while maintaining the agility needed to respond to changes in a fluid environment. Our Q4 guide takes into account current global tariff rates, as well as the market growth expectations that Enrique just covered. By segment, in Personal Systems, we expect Q4 revenue to be in line with prior year seasonality, driven by the typical holiday uptick in consumer, continued Windows 11 refresh and AIPC adoption.

And we expect Personal Systems margin to be solidly in our 5% to 7% target range, improving sequentially as the mitigation actions we have taken gained full traction in the quarter. In Print, we also expect Q4 revenue to be in line with prior year seasonality and operating margin to be near the top of our 16 to 19% range, reflecting a higher supplies mix along with disciplined pricing and cost management, offset in part by increased trade related costs. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of 2,600,000,000.0 to $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year twenty twenty five, including approximately $400,000,000 in cash restructuring charges for the year. We expect our non GAAP tax rate to remain consistent with prior periods. Of note, we appreciate the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will help keep our tax rate more consistent and enable continued investment and long term growth opportunities.

With all of this, we expect fourth quarter non GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.97 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85 Looking beyond Q4, we expect continued momentum in the refresh catalysts driving growth in the PC market. And we are confident in the measures we are taking to capitalize on opportunities in the print market and to protect operating profit. I will share more on our fiscal twenty twenty six outlook on our Q4 earnings call. In closing, we delivered solid results in the quarter while executing well against our strategic initiatives. We are confident that the actions we are taking are the right ones to enable us to respond swiftly to near term market dynamics, while continuing to invest for long term profitable growth.

With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question and answer session. And our first questionnaire today will be from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.

Steven, Analyst, TD Cowen: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. This is Steven calling on behalf of Krish. I guess the first one for either Enrique or Karen. I was kind of curious about the tariff related costs in the quarter.

Are you able to help quantify what the total impact was, whether it’s on a dollar basis or maybe in terms of impact to gross margins? And given all the actions you’ve taken, how much are you able to offset as opposed to having to absorb that company?

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: Thanks for the question, Stephen. We made meaningful progress in the quarter with our mitigation actions, which included accelerating our supply chain to optimize driving cost reduction and taking pricing actions. And as a result, we were able to mitigate the majority of the tariff costs in Q3, while still delivering EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guide. As we’ve said, we do expect to fully offset these trade related costs as quickly as possible. The full benefit of our mitigating actions, really depending on the scope can take a little bit of time.

But again, we expect to fully mitigate as quickly as we can.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: And I would say we are pleased with the progress we made. As we have said before, this quarter we completed the change of manufacturing and all products going to The U. S. Or the great majority of products going to The U. S.

Are not built in China anymore. We also drove additional cost actions and we do indeed selective price increases. Overall, we made good progress and this is why we are confident in ability to mitigate tariffs down the road as we will continue to execute on these plans.

Steven, Analyst, TD Cowen: Great. Thank you for that. And as my follow-up, one question on the Print business. I guess anecdotally just given the number of large, I guess enterprises around the world that have announced return to office initiatives so far this year. I guess I’m a little surprised that there weren’t any improvements to the outlook for the print business.

I guess can you talk about any expectations perhaps going into fiscal twenty twenty six on some of these return to office initiatives if that might have a delayed growth impact into next year perhaps or is there some different dynamic about return to office initiatives in terms of spending on supplies and commercial hardware? Thank you so much.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Yes. Thank you. I think there are two dynamics that we need to have in mind. First of all, from an investment perspective, we are seeing enterprise and commercial businesses prioritizing other areas above print. For example, investments in AI or even investments in PCs.

So we think that this has impacted in the short term the sales of print hardware in the office side. On the other side, when we look at pages printed, and as you know, this is the most fundamental variable to understand the health of the business going forward. We have not seen a deviation versus our plan, which means that down the road, we will see the demand for printers come back because customers continue to print and there has not been a deviation there, which is in line with the return of the office assumptions that we were making. So short term impact on the hardware, but not impact on supplies, which means in the long term, the business will come back as companies will have to build new hardware to complete or to make sure that the employees are having the right experience.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.

Urban Lu, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Hi. Thank you for the question. This is Urban Lu calling in for Amit. It’s great to see your momentum in your AIPC product category. I think the sequential 25 growth was rather notable.

But can you help us understand whether AIPCs carry a higher ASP or margin profile versus non AIPCs?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Yes. So let me confirm that we are very pleased with the growth that we are seeing in AIPCs and not only of the category by itself, but also of how the ecosystem is being developed because eventually the demand for AIPCs is going to be driven by applications and we are seeing more and more applications taking advantage of the new capabilities that AIPCs have. In terms of pricing, we can confirm the estimations that we had before. We are seeing an uplift in pricing of AIPCs compared to similar units that are not that don’t bring this capability. And we maintain the assumptions that we had shared before of the 10% to the 5% to 10% price increase driven by AIPCs.

Urban Lu, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Got it. And then I have one for Karen as well. As I look at your Q4 EPS guidance, I think the sequential or seasonal increase in EPS for Q4 is at $0.17 at the midpoint and it’s higher than what we’ve historically seen. I’m just kind of curious whether this is going to be driven by any sort of margin benefit from your ReadyNEXT program?

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Erwin. We are seeing good momentum heading into fourth quarter. And in PS, we do expect sequential revenue growth in line with the prior year seasonality. And that’s really driven by the continued momentum in the Win 11 refresh and AIPC adoption, as well as we’ve got the holiday uptick in consumer that we expect to happen strongly.

I’d say more importantly though, we do expect the PSOP rate to continue to improve as we continue to work to offset the headwinds of trade related costs and commodity costs. And in Print, we also expect sequential revenue growth in line with prior year seasonality and sequential OP improvement to the top of our 16% to 19% target range, and that’s really driven by seasonally higher Supplies volume. So we’re confident in our Q4 guide.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: To complement that, we also will see a bigger impact of some of the actions we took around tariffs. Some of the new tariffs were put in place at the end of last quarter, beginning of this quarter. And this we will continue to mitigate as time goes.

Urban Lu, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Understood. Thank you for the color.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of David Voigt with UBS. Please go ahead.

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. So maybe

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.: we go back to

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: the PC market because I think Aaron you mentioned you expect normal seasonality in the PC market. And I guess what I’m struggling with a little bit is you’ve had incredibly strong growth the last two quarters. And if I think about your business over the years, generally speaking, you don’t have that degree of strength for, call it, three quarters in a row sequentially. Can you just maybe expand upon what gives you confidence in this guide? And I think you also mentioned strength in, I guess, momentum into next year.

And I know you mentioned ARPC and obviously some other Windows 11 refresh dynamics, but a little bit more color there would help. And I’ll give you my second question at the same time. And so maybe just help us understand kind of the margin dynamics within print a little bit better. I know last quarter you had the grant this quarter, obviously mix and some pricing dynamics probably hurt margins. Can you maybe walk us through kind of what’s going to reverse a little bit in the October to help get us back towards the upper bound of that range from a print perspective?

Thanks.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Okay. So let me take the first question and Kieran will take the second question. In terms of PC demand, I think there are different things to have in mind. First of all, Q4 versus Q3, in the consumer side, there is always an increase of demand driven by completing the back to school cycle and also preparing for holidays. And this always drives a sequential improvement.

In the commercial side, we expect to continue to see two major drivers of growth. One is the Windows 11 refresh and second is the IPCs. In Windows 11 year on year and quarter on quarter, we see an improvement in the funnel, meaning the funnel at the beginning of Q4 is higher than it was at the beginning of Q3 and also bigger than what it was at the beginning of Q4 last year. And Windows 11 is playing a key role there. Second, what is also very important to assess long term sales, when we look at where are we in the cycle, our estimate is that slightly more than 50% of the installed base has been converted to Windows 11, which means there is still going to be a positive impact not only in Q4, but also in the earlier quarters of next year.

And this is why we’ve seen the demand for PCs is going to continue in Q4. We projected that the growth of PCs will be mid single digits for the second half and that there will be growth in fiscal year twenty twenty six.

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: And on the margins, we’re confident in our sequential improvement in print margins. In our Q3 print operating margin at 17.3% was solidly within our guidance range and in line with our expectations. You know, we typically have lower supply sales in the summer months and that, you know, that can cause some seasonal seasonality in the margins. But as we look into Q4, we do expect the print margins to be at the top end of our range, and that’s reflecting some higher supplies volumes as we saw very similar to last year, along with disciplined pricing and cost management. I know you also mentioned the grant last quarter.

We did see a grant last quarter from the EDB that had a bit of a catch up from the beginning of the calendar year to be booked in the quarter, but it is a multiyear grant and we are continuing to receive that grant this fiscal year and into future fiscal years.

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: Great. Thanks, Enrique. Thanks, Karen.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Wamsi Mohan, Analyst, Bank of America: Yes. Thank you so much. I guess, Enrique or Karen, I don’t I know you spoke up quite a bit color on print margins just now, but I normally don’t think of print margins to be that volatile, but you just dropped 200 plus basis points on print margin sequentially and it’s going to bounce back next quarter. And Enrique, you made some comments on sort of where you’re emphasizing and deemphasizing certain parts of the portfolio as well. So if you were to pull those together and we think and we fast forward beyond sort of fiscal 4Q, are you thinking that the range for these print margins is sort of going to be in this long term range that you’ve given because you seem to be tracking at the higher end, even above the higher end in quite a few quarters.

And given some of the cost actions that you’re taking, should we just be calibrating towards a higher range for print margins?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: So let me a couple of comments. First, in terms of the changes quarter over quarter, what we have seen this year is very similar to what we saw last year. As Kare mentioned before, the biggest impact in Q3 was driven by the mix of supplies that was lower compared to Q2 and is lower compared to what we expect to see in Q4. And this really has a big impact. But again, we saw very similar performance a year ago.

So I don’t we don’t think it’s out of what we have seen in previous cases. In terms of the projections long term, we are not changing our projections from what we have been seeing before. We continue to maintain the ranges that we have seen. As we have said before, having these ranges gives us the opportunity in a given country in a given quarter to be more aggressive placing units. If this is what we decide to do because we see that they will be profitable units, we have done this in the past and we want to have the ability to do that without getting out of the ranges that we have.

In terms of the actions that we’re taking for the print business going forward, they are very consistent with conversations we have had in the past one, two. We are going to continue to drive in the consumer space, a shift to more profitable units, especially big tank. We are going to continue to drive improvements to capture more lifetime customer profitability by shifting the business to subscriptions and services. We see opportunities to grow share in profitable office categories and we see an opportunity to drive growth in the industrial side that we have done in that we have driven in the past and we will continue to do. And of course, we are going to be very disciplined managing our cost structure and looking for any opportunity we have to improve productivity and increase efficiency.

So it’s very consistent with the plan that you have seen us executing before and we will continue to do that going forward.

Wamsi Mohan, Analyst, Bank of America: Okay. Thanks, Enrique. And if I have a follow-up just on PCs. If you look at industry expectations, there is below normal seasonality based on whether it be ODM builds or other things that the industry third parties that we can look at below normal seasonal trends in the back half of this year and then even projections for a decline. You’re kind of saying something very different, which is sequentially consistent with prior years and then growth next year.

So is the implication here that HP is taking share? And if you are, where is that coming from? Any particular regions, any particular players? And where is that success may be coming from?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: There are two comments. One is our projections are consistent to what we are seeing in the market. And we have seen strong commercial demand in Q3. We have seen strong consumer demand. And as I mentioned before, we don’t think this is a pull in of demand.

We think this is real demand, because it’s not only happening in The U. S, we are seeing this across multiple countries and across multiple geographies. In terms of our projections going forward, they rely on the fact that we continue to see strong demand for AI PCs, strong demand for Windows 11. And something I didn’t mention before is also the fact that we expect ASPs to continue to grow because of demand stronger demand and stronger growth in premium categories, which has been our strategy in the previous quarters and will continue to be going forward. So answering your question on share, you know that our goal and our objective is not to grow share for the sake of gaining share, is to drive profitable growth.

What we have been doing in the last quarters is growing share in the more premium segment of commercial, consumer, AIPCs and this is going to continue to be our strategy going forward.

Wamsi Mohan, Analyst, Bank of America: Okay. Thanks, Enrique.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Michael Ng, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you. I just have two as well. One for Enrique on Print and one for Karen just on capital allocation. Enrique on Print, you guys have talked a little bit about the more aggressive pricing environment, the demand in office softer than expected in North America and Europe.

As you look out to the rest of this year and into next, I was wondering if you could just talk about your expectation on those two things, pricing and the office environment, and whether you see that becoming better or worse in the next couple of months in the next year or so? And then, Karen, I just wanted to ask for a clarification. Are we at the point, from the gross leverage standpoint, I think you guys are below 2% now where you guys will return 100 of free cash flow to shareholders as soon as next quarter. And I just wanted to ask if you could clarify, when you guys talked about the revenue guidance for the segments, was that consistent with prior years or typical years? I feel like you may have said both.

I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Let me start on the question on pre in demand. So at this point, what we are expecting or what we are building in the plant is similar market behavior to what we have seen in Q3. If many of our competitors announced price increases as a consequence of the trade related costs. What we have seen in the market is that these price increases didn’t materialize in the competitive space. So we are expecting that this aggressive price competition is going to continue going forward.

We think it’s connected to the fact that the market was smaller and therefore there was in the market more pressure on the price side. But as I said before, we think this is going to be temporary. We have not seen a change in the fundamental variable, which is the number of pages printed, which gives us confidence on the future. And in terms of 2026, it’s early to give you a lot of detail. We will in the coming quarters, in the coming months as we do more work to estimate what will be the demand on for next year.

Karen Parkhill, Chief Financial Officer, HP Inc.: Yes. And Michael on your second question on capital allocation, our leverage did improve from Q2 where it was slightly over 2.2 times and improved in Q3 to just be slightly over two times, the 2.04 in Q3. And that was driven by improved EBITDA and the repayment of a debt maturity that we had in June. While it could remain slightly elevated in Q4, we do expect it to continue to improve in FY 2026. So we do anticipate more repurchase activity soon.

And I would say, should we continue to operate at higher leverage levels, we would use cash to reduce debt as bonds mature and that would also enable us to repurchase stock as well.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Maya, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Hi, good afternoon. This is Maya on for Eric. Enrique, maybe if we start with you, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on your AIPC comments? When we speak to CIOs or channel partners, we don’t hear as much enthusiasm for AIPCs, but clearly your comments prove otherwise. Can you just please unpack maybe the industries you see adopting AIPCs or regions that are particularly strong?

And then what are the key use cases you’re hearing that are driving this AIPC adoption? Then I have

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: a Sure. Follow-up. Yes.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: And I think it’s really my comments are driven by what we see in actuals. As I said in the prepared remarks, our mix of AIPCs today is more than 25%. And this is the goal that we had for Q4 for the end of the year. So we are one quarter ahead of our original target, which shows the demand that we see. I think the key thing behind AIPCs is the fact that over the next quarters, more and more software applications are going to take advantage of the capabilities that AIPCs have.

And we have started to see it now and we expect that it will continue. For example, we have now Adobe and Zoom that are taking advantage of the capabilities of running some of their application software in their PCs, which means it will be faster and also it will reduce some of the cloud costs that they will be having. We have seen security companies like CrowdStrike taking advantage of the ability to use in the MPUs to scan the memory faster, which means for many of their applications this brings a significant advantage. Also Microsoft is doing a remarkable job continuing to improve the libraries that they offer to other companies, so they can do a lot of activities in the PCs that before they had to do in the cloud. And finally, of our own AI applications, during the last months, we launched AI companion, OMEN AI.

We launched a specific AI application in China. We continue to see month over month and quarter over quarter improvements in utilization. So we see clearly a gradual improvement. And as we said to many of our customers, if you are driving a refresh of your installed base and IPC you expect to leave two, three, four years and you expect your employees to use it for this time. If you don’t want to be left out of the productivity improvements that over time are going to come, you should be considering buying an AIPC now and this is what we see happening.

Maya, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you. And then I know you mentioned that we’re a little over 50% of the way through Windows 11 refresh. If we think about the SMB category, do you see them adopting more of that twelve month extended support that could come back and refresh in 2026? Or kind of how do the trends differ by underlying customer

David Voigt, Analyst, UBS: segments?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Yes. I think it’s a great question. So first of all, when we look at the total conversion, we are behind what we have been other years sorry, in previous refreshes,

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.: which

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: is why we think this process is going to be extended. When we look at the penetration in enterprise versus SMB, and this is very consistent to what we have seen before, the changes starting enterprise and over time it takes in SMB. This is what is happening this year, which is very consistent with preview refreshes. So we have we see a bigger opportunity in SMB going forward, which again is very consistent with previous refreshes that happened before.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alec Valero with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.0: Hey guys, this is Alec on for Ananda. Thank you for taking my questions. Just very quickly on the Poly business, is there anything that you could update us on? Are you seeing any noticeable pickup or increased certainty in enterprise and corporate spending?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Thank you. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that this was not a strong quarter for what we call hybrid systems. We have seen companies, especially in Europe, especially in the headset space, de prioritizing some of these projects versus PCs or versus AI. So we have seen an impact in the short term. We continue to think that this is going to be or this is a very important business for us going forward.

And we continue to invest not only on the headset space, also in the video side. We announced a very innovative solution on the video collaboration that we did with Google and we are going to continue to invest in this category. On the other side, on the gaming side, in similar categories, we have seen very strong growth this quarter. This is driven by HyperX. So on that side of the peripheral space, we had a strong quarter.

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.0: Very helpful. And just a quick follow-up. As part of your refresh initiative, is there any specific product lines that you are eyeing to refresh?

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: Is the question on PCs or is it really across the full portfolio?

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.0: Yes, just across the full portfolio.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: I mean, the answer is yes, across the board. We continue to invest very significantly in R and D. Innovation is a key part of how we win and how do we compete. And next year, there will be refreshes across the PC portfolio, both in the consumer side, in the commercial side, in the workstation space and many of the key areas of printing. Of innovation that is coming.

We mentioned a bit of that of what we did in Q3, but the next quarters are going to be very exciting from an innovation perspective.

Orit Keenan Nahoun, Head of Investor Relations, HP Inc.0: Super helpful. Thank you, guys.

Enrique Loris, President and Chief Executive Officer, HP Inc.: I think it was the last question. So in closing, let me reiterate a few of the key points that we have been making. First of all, we are executing with discipline in an environment that continues to be dynamic. Second, we expect to continue to see momentum in the refreshed catalyst driving growth in the PC market. As I just mentioned, we are innovating to be a leader in the future of work and we remain very energized by the opportunities that we see ahead.

And before we wrap the call, I want to share that Dorit will be moving to a new role as my new Chief of Staff. And I want to use this opportunity to thank her for her leadership as Global Head of IR. Her financial insight, sound judgment and guidance have been invaluable to HP, to me and to Karen, and we look forward to her continued strong contribution in her next role. I am also pleased to welcome Alok Yuyao, our new Global Head of IR, With more than a decade at HP, including his recent role as CFO of our Personal Systems business, Alok brings deep expertise and a clear understanding of our operations. And he is very well positioned to support our investor relationships and contribute to HP’s long term goals.

So thank you to both, and thank you to all of you for attending today’s call. Thank you.

Krista, Conference Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

In Nigeria, Ghana and beyond, this is where cultural power meets commercial impact — and where brands can help shape the future of marketing across the continent.","Influencer marketing is surging worldwide, but Africa is rewriting the rules. With over 1.1 billion people and a median age under twenty, it is the fastest growing digital market on the planet. The African creator economy is projected to reach US $17.84 billion by 2030, rising at an annual rate of 28.5 per cent.

Nigeria and Ghana are now at the forefront, joining the dentsu School of Influence, a programme founded in South Africa and later launched in Spain and Kenya, designed to train and empower creators who connect deeply with local communities, cultures and languages.

“With Nigeria at the forefront of dentsu’s Influencer Movement, we are unlocking a new era of storytelling powered by authenticity and community. In Africa, influence is not about celebrity alone, it is about cultural resonance — and Nigerian creators are already proving that they can shape conversations, shift perceptions, and drive impact at scale,” said Emeka Chris Okeke, Group Executive Chairman & CEO, MediaFuse-Dentsu Nigeria

Okeke emphasized that the programme is timely, given Nigeria’s young, mobile-first population and thriving creator economy. He noted that the dentsu School of Influence will not only elevate the voices of Nigerian creators but also provide them with tools for long-term success — from monetisation and brand partnerships to data literacy and community building. He added that this initiative reflects dentsu’s broader commitment to innovating to impact by equipping the next generation of African storytellers to compete and thrive on the global stage.

Speaking on the initiative, Marian Ogaziechi, Managing Director of Dentsu Agyle, who has led successful influencer marketing projects in Nigeria, expressed her delight that dentsu is formalizing and scaling the fast-growing creator economy in Africa. “Influencer marketing in Nigeria is evolving rapidly, from one-off collaborations to structured, insight-led partnerships that deliver measurable impact,” she said.

She added that through the School of Influence, dentsu will equip creators with global best practices, data-driven insights, a clear understanding of the global landscape, and the structure they need to thrive. “This initiative is not just about brand campaigns; it is about building an ecosystem where Nigerian voices can lead conversations locally and globally.”

An Influencer Landscape Like No Other

In Africa, influence is built on authenticity, community relevance and trust. Success depends less on celebrity status and more on cultural resonance and local storytelling. Platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and X dominate in Nigeria and Ghana, but impact comes from content rooted in diverse languages and lived experiences, from Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa in Nigeria to Twi, Ewe and Ga in Ghana.

The Power of Gen Z

Nigeria and Ghana have some of the youngest populations globally, with median ages of 18 and 21. These mobile first generations value economic empowerment, social mobility and community recognition. They are prolific creators and consumers, shaping trends that travel far beyond their borders.

According to dentsu Africa, 72 per cent of African Gen Zs trust brands more when influencers come from their own communities, favouring relatability over aspiration alone. Nigerians spend an average of 3 hours 41 minutes daily on social platforms, with Ghanaian usage similarly high.

Why the dentsu School of Influence Matters

The programme develops skills beyond content creation, covering brand partnerships, monetisation, data literacy and community building. It addresses challenges such as brand safety, ROI measurement and the underrepresentation of grassroots voices.

Results are proven. In Kenya, programme-trained influencers outperform standard campaigns by about 60 per cent. In South Africa, the uplift is 17 per cent. The talent pool in Africa is already rich:

Nigeria: Charity Ekezie, 3.4 million TikTok followers, 86 million likes, using humour to dismantle stereotypes.

Ghana: Wode Maya, 1.73 million YouTube subscribers, 274 million views, telling authentic African stories.

South Africa: Seemah, 2.7 million followers, 206 million likes, blending beauty, fashion and comedy.

A Data Led, Hyperlocal Approach

Using proprietary platforms such as Merkury and CCS, dentsu Africa profiles millions of consumers to design culturally intelligent, community-first campaigns. A YouTube campaign in Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Twi, Ewe and Ga delivered a 9.6 per cent lift in brand recall in Nigeria and 6.5 per cent in South Africa.

The Opportunity for Brands

South Africa’s influencer market is valued at over US $115 million, growing 13 to 15 per cent annually. Across Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, influencers range from macro stars to nano community leaders, with cultural corridors linking Lagos, Accra and Johannesburg offering regional scale.

Shaping the Next Chapter of Influence

The dentsu School of Influence is more than a training ground. It is a catalyst for a new era of African storytelling, led by creators who speak the languages, live the cultures and understand the communities they represent. By combining hyperlocal insight with global expertise, dentsu is building the infrastructure that will define influence for the next decade. In Nigeria, Ghana and beyond, this is where cultural power meets commercial impact — and where brands can help shape the future of marketing across the continent.

Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 53.19 and moving averages (SMA 20: 292.92, SMA 50: 286.74, SMA 200: 251.51) provide insights into the stock's trading momentum. Institutional ownership stands at 64.91%, reflecting confidence from large investors.

Risk Assessment

Ralph Lauren's financial health grades are robust, with a Piotroski F-Score of 7 indicating a healthy financial situation. The Beneish M-Score of -2.73 suggests that the company is unlikely to be a manipulator. However, sector-specific risks, such as changes in consumer preferences and economic downturns, could impact performance.

The stock's beta of 1.85 indicates higher volatility compared to the broader market, which could lead to significant price fluctuations. Investors should also be mindful of the company's valuation metrics, which are approaching historical highs, potentially limiting future upside.

In conclusion, Ralph Lauren's strong financial performance and strategic initiatives position it well for future growth. However, potential investors should consider the valuation metrics and insider activity as part of their investment decision-making process.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000CAE.png?20,N,,2025-08-28 06:06:31.901932

The AG's office sued CVS in April, claiming that CVS offered lower prices at its pharmacies for cash-pay patients through an outside discount program administered by ScriptSave, but did not report those prices to MassHealth.
“When pharmacies overcharge MassHealth, they’re undermining the integrity of our public programs and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill,” Campbell said in a statement.
A spokesperson for CVS told Fierce Healthcare that the company is ""pleased"" to resolve the matter and noted that the settlement only relates to that MFN regulation.
""In the cases involving CVS, we’ve prevailed many times, including by court dismissal, jury verdict and arbitrator award,"" the spokesperson said.","CVS has agreed to a $12.25 million settlement with Massachusetts that resolves allegations that it charged members of its Medicaid program more for prescription drugs than they charged the general public.

In addition to the funds in the settlement, CVS agreed to an annual reconciliation process where they will make sure that prices charged to MassHealth members are on par with others to avoid future overcharges, according to an announcement from Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell.

The AG's office sued CVS in April, claiming that CVS offered lower prices at its pharmacies for cash-pay patients through an outside discount program administered by ScriptSave, but did not report those prices to MassHealth.

The suit was filed jointly by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Indiana and Oklahoma.

“When pharmacies overcharge MassHealth, they’re undermining the integrity of our public programs and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill,” Campbell said in a statement. “I am proud to announce this settlement, which will prevent future inaccurate price reporting and ensure MassHealth has the resources it needs to continue serving Massachusetts residents.”

MassHealth has a unique ""most favored nation"" policy in place that requires the lowest drug prices to be charged within the program. A spokesperson for CVS told Fierce Healthcare that the company is ""pleased"" to resolve the matter and noted that the settlement only relates to that MFN regulation.

The spokesperson added that the settlement is not an admission of guilt.

""We’ll continue vigorously defending against the claims concerning CVS Pharmacy’s usual and customary pricing brought by remaining plaintiffs in the case,"" they said. ""For the last several years, many pharmacies, including CVS Pharmacy, have been named as defendants in other U&C lawsuits accusing the pharmacies of having submitted inflated U&C prices.""

""In the cases involving CVS, we’ve prevailed many times, including by court dismissal, jury verdict and arbitrator award,"" the spokesperson said.

‘Reset Its Cost Base’

""With the Kroger-Albertsons merger off the table, Kroger is moving to reset its cost base and streamline operations,"" said Arun Sundaram, analyst at CFRA Research.

""Many decisions were put on hold during the merger process, so it makes sense that we're seeing more major business decisions in recent months,"" he added.

Kroger and Albertsons had proposed a $25 billion merger, which was blocked by a US judge in December, leading to a legal battle between the companies.

On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled Michigan House passed its first version of a government budget, which features widespread cuts impacting all levels of education. Hours later, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer met with Johnson and Lapinski to learn how their preparations were going and what comes next in Lansing.

""It's not a budget that is going to get signed into law, but they did their part, and now it is time for us to have serious and fast negotiations, to have a budget that really reflects the needs of the people of the state,"" said Whitmer.

For Briones, Jefferson Elementary's community is special. A former alum herself, two of her children called the school home, and she says seeing the budget fight makes her anxious for the year ahead.

""I can't just uproot my children into a different state because we don't have a budget. So, that's where our future is. It's a little scary,"" said Briones.

Both Lapinski and Johnson encourage legislators to look past their party and focus on who they serve.

""Stop looking at the numbers. Stop pushing numbers. Think about the children,"" said Lapinski.

""If we keep kids and families at the center of our focus and not think about anything else, everybody knows what the right thing is to do. Everybody,"" said Johnson.

Now, negotiations will begin as the House will have to strike a deal with the governor and Senate by Oct. 1 or risk a state government shutdown.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/27/cf060570-1f63-4029-ac3b-97d79261b495/thumbnail/1200x630/672694e7a293b3d132ce2cbee7b9e2e3/snapshot-2025-08-27t172335-560.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 19:12:53.825153

“We believe cocoa prices will remain high for another three-plus years,” says Stefan Bucher, senior principal scientist.
“All of the solutions are similar in the sense that they are composed cocoa/chocolate flavors that are designed to supplement up to a 30% reduction of cocoa powder in different applications.
There is no single key ingredient, and they all have unique cocoa/chocolate flavor profiles.
T. Hasegawa’s (www.thasegawa.com) Cocoa Powder Replacer was designed specifically for beverage applications, and comes in both powder and liquid forms.","Raw cocoa prices for decades hovered between $2,000 and $3,000 per metric ton, but beginning in 2023, they began a climb that broke $12,000 a ton last year. While they have moderated a bit since, the commodity still is trading above $8,000 – and that has food processors looking for alternatives.

“Cocoa market prices remain high due to low stock levels and a large supply deficit observed over the last few years,” French supplier Prova said in its August 2025 market report. “The ICCO [International Cocoa Organization] recently updated the figures for the 2023/2024 season [when] global cocoa production fell by 12.9% to 4,368 million metric tons, with a supply deficit revised upwards of 494,000 tons, much higher than the figure observed in previous shortfall years.

“However, for 2024/2025, the ICCO is forecasting surplus supply, with the harvest expected to be better than the previous year due to improved weather conditions,” the Prova report continued. “Despite this, production will still fall short of 2022/2023 levels. The start of the intermediate harvest (April to September) has however been disappointing, with a lower bean quality resulting in a lower butter and powder yield.”

So while cocoa’s prospects are improving, it will take a while for the beans to mature and be harvested, the ingredient to be processed and prices to come down.

Hershey Co. in July confirmed it’s raising prices on its chocolate candies by ""low double-digit"" percentages, with most price hikes coming in the fall. In some cases, pack sizes will get smaller; in others, list prices will rise. “This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies,” a Hershey spokesperson told us. “It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa.”

Hershey is not alone. Also in July, Swiss chocolatier Lindt acknowledged it already has increased prices by 15.8% in the first half of this year. Nestle’s financial reports have included references to price hikes. While Mondelez has been quietly working them in over the past year, the company is cautiously optimistic about the cocoa price outlook, citing improving market fundamentals and a promising West African pod count.

Cocoa is a complex flavor, and it’s also familiar to almost all consumers, so replacing it is tricky. Ardent Mills and Prova introduced solutions at the July IFT FIRST food ingredients show.

Wheat is the main ingredient in Ardent Mills’ (www.ardentmills.com) Cocoa Replace, the toasting process providing most of the sensory (both flavor and color) attributes of cocoa. Based on U.S.-sourced wheat, it not only provides a cost savings but also a stable, domestic supply.

By replacing up to 25% of the cocoa powder in standard formulations, Cocoa Replace can provide significant cost savings. It also lowers the fat content of the final product, since cocoa powder typically has 10-12% fat.

Ardent Mills sampled a devil’s food cupcake at the IFT show with a quarter of its cocoa substituted with Cocoa Replace. As a single-ingredient solution, it simplifies reformulation and keeps label changes to a minimum, especially in chocolate products already based on wheat.

“We believe cocoa prices will remain high for another three-plus years,” says Stefan Bucher, senior principal scientist. Ardent Mills focuses on mostly bakery applications, and the firm showed prototypes at the IFT show for cakes, muffins, brownies, cookies, pancakes & waffles, quick bread and pumpernickel bread.

Prova, too, showed cocoa substitutes at the show. “We put together a toolbox that included flavor samples and their respective usage rates and organoleptic sensory charts,” says Justin Demers, director of applications and product development for Prova (provaus.com). “We've validated these flavors specifically for compound companies to reduce up to 30% cocoa in their products.”

Protec is the name for all of Prova’s technical solutions; Cocoa Reduction Flavor Solutions are within that. “All cocoa powder/solids have unique flavor profiles,” Demers continues. “We create tailormade solutions for our customers, but this box shows a selection of what types of profiles we can target, even with off-the-shelf options.”

Prova’s applications focus on baked goods, sweet confections, beverages and dairy-based creations. “All of the solutions are similar in the sense that they are composed cocoa/chocolate flavors that are designed to supplement up to a 30% reduction of cocoa powder in different applications. There is no single key ingredient, and they all have unique cocoa/chocolate flavor profiles. They are formulated with the specific solubility and processing tolerance of each application in mind.”

A year ago, Planet A Foods (planet-a-foods.com), based in Germany, was using sunflower seeds and oats as main ingredients for its ChoViva cocoa replacers. But this year, “We’ve updated our recipes and are using sunflower seeds and grape seed flour as main ingredients,” says Marketing Manager Jessica Karch.

The company began developing its solution in 2021, before the current cocoa price spikes. So reducing the cost was not the company founders’ intention -- they learned that demand for cocoa was causing mass deforestation, exacerbated by climate change, so they set out to create chocolate without cocoa.

“Planet A Foods isn’t just about ChoViva — we’re an ingredients company working to de-risk global supply chains by developing alternatives for endangered ingredients,” Karch explains. “Our overall vision is to save 500 million tons of carbon dioxide per year.”

ChoViva has not made it into the U.S. market yet, but it’s currently an ingredient in chocolate-flavored cookies, peanut butter cups and cereal found on German and Austrian grocery store shelves – altogether, it’s in approximately 70 products in nine countries worldwide. A launch in the U.S. has been a goal. “It’s on our list, and we’re already in talks with several partners,” says Karch. A cocoa butter alternative also is in development.

Two ubiquitous technologies are teaming up to help. NotCo (tech.notco.com), the Chilean food tech company in which Kraft Heinz has an investment, says its Giuseppe AI platform can create customized cocoa-free chocolate alternatives that mimic the taste, texture, and melt of traditional chocolate without relying on the strained cocoa supply chain. Using precision fermentation, the NotCo team optimized a blend of upcycled ingredients and sustainable crops to craft an alternative that resembles real cocoa flavor.","https://img.foodprocessing.com/files/base/ebm/foodprocessing/image/2025/08/68af6f390a189d7e2386a6e7-choviva_bar_source__planet_a_foods_photographer__d.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-27 18:13:58.316066

AL’s Real Goods Chewy Cookies

AL’s Real Goods enters the crowded cookie aisle with a trio of chewy, indulgent options: Choco Chip, Ginger Smack, and Choco Choco. Each variety comes packed in bright, 6.7 oz boxes that emphasize handmade charm with a premium twist. Developed by a former Michelin starred chef, these non-GMO verified cookies aim to elevate the packaged cookie experience by emphasizing real ingredients like butter and unpretentious/classic flavor profiles that still feel chef-crafted.

Things that stand out:

As far as packaged cookies go, AL’s is truly top-notch and we’d be hard pressed to think of a brand that does chewy cookies better. It’s definitely an elevated experience across all three flavors.

Packaging is eye-catching and effective — bold typography, pastel tones, and large cookie visuals make for strong shelf appeal.

The SKU choices evoke nostalgia vibes and are very straightforward. There should be near-zero consumer education required, which allows AL’s to focus on being a super premium player.

The use of real butter and a focus on clean-label cues (e.g., non-GMO) sets these apart from typical mass-market chewy cookies.

Things to consider:

While the flavor and texture are standout for a shelf-stable cookie, the inclusion of preservation-friendly ingredients (necessary for this format) slightly undermines the “Michelin” positioning. Not sure that there is really a way around this, but worth noting nonetheless.

Price point will likely reflect the premium branding, which may limit its appeal to more ingredient-conscious or gourmet-inclined consumers.

Minor point, but “Choco Chip” and “Choco Choco” could benefit from more name differentiation.

New Primal Rotisserie Chicken

Fresh off a big growth year, New Primal unveiled a bold rebrand and shortened name to stand out in the red-hot meat stick segment. The brand also debuted a Rotisserie Seasoned Chicken offering, leaning further into poultry in a category largely dominated by beef. Combining the convenience of a meat stick with the flavors of a classic comfort food, this latest addition carves a new space in an increasingly crowded set.

Things that stand out:

A relatively high-protein option, with 10 grams of protein, 60 calories and zero sugar per 1 oz. stick.

Crafted with simple ingredients, including all-natural chicken raised without added hormones or antibiotics, plus sea salt, celery powder, black pepper, garlic, onion, cherry, coriander, parsley flakes and ground nutmeg.

The product is free of the top eight allergens and Whole30 Approved.

Things to consider:

Priced at $11.99 for a 5-count bag and $39.99 for a 20-count carton, each unit shakes out to roughly two bucks per pop – on par with other premium meat sticks but could be a tough sell for the conventional crowd.

While full of flavor, these sticks aren’t as tender and juicy as other chicken-based meat snacks (that are typically packed with unwanted additives).

Rating:

NOVOS Longevity Bar

Increasing lifespan and improving healthspan have been hallmarks of the wellness community for a while that are now making their way deeper into more conventional packaged food formulations. Supplement maker NOVOS Labs has been operating in the space since 2018, recently launching a Longevity Nutrition Bar line (Salted Chocolate Crunch, Mixed Berry Crunch and Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Crunch) to bring the brand into more retail locations.

Things that stand out:

The familiar protein bar texture has the added benefit of crunchy pea protein crisps that give it a nice bite.

Callouts to skin health, mind and mood, metabolism and lean muscle add to the differentiated positioning as a longevity product.

Subtle but straightforward branding provides shoppers with an understandable value proposition.

Things to consider:

More flavor variation with a touch of healthy indulgence like chocolate coating could help with the taste. Salted Chocolate Crunch had a bitter aftertaste. Mixed Berry was our favorite.

While not overly dry or chalky, some formulation tweaks to improve texture would help the eating experience.

The nutritional panel is packed with over 20 ingredients which could be tightened to focus on key functional inclusions.

Earnings, excluding some items, will be 87 cents to 97 cents a share in the period ending in October, the maker of computers and printers said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated 91 cents.

In the fiscal third-quarter ended July 31, HP reported sales climbed 3.1% to $13.9 billion. Profit, excluding some items, was 75 cents a share. Analysts, on average, projected adjusted earnings per share of 74 cents on revenue of $13.7 billion.

To cope with the effects of tariffs, HP has adjusted to use manufacturing facilities outside of China for almost all of its products sold in North America, and the company has increased some prices, Chief Executive Officer Enrique Lores said in an interview.

The company was able “mitigate the majority of the tariff costs in Q3, while still delivering EPS slightly above the midpoint of our guide,” Chief Financial Officer Karen Parkhill said in response to analysts’ questions during a conference call after the results were released. “As we’ve said, we do expect to fully offset these trade-related costs as quickly as possible. And the full benefit of our mitigating actions really depending on the scope can take a little bit of time. But again, we expect to fully mitigate as quickly as we can.”

In the fiscal third quarter, sales of PCs rose 6% and the company expects “mid-single digit” growth to continue in the current period, Lores said in the interview. Business customers are upgrading to machines with Microsoft Inc.’s Windows 11 and new AI PCs, which now make up more than 25% of HP’s product mix, a milestone reached a quarter ahead of the company’s target. Consumer PC sales were also better than expected, he said.

“We feel confident about the fact that PCs will continue to grow,” Lores said. “AI PCs and Windows 11 are going to continue to drive demand.”

Sales in the company’s printer unit, however, declined 4% to $3.99 billion, missing estimates, and continue to be a drag on profitability.

Company Overview

Born from the legendary Silicon Valley garage startup founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in 1939, HP (NYSE:HPQ) designs and sells personal computers, printers, and related technology products and services to consumers, businesses, and enterprises worldwide.

Revenue Growth

Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years.

With $54.71 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, HP is a behemoth in the business services sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because it’s harder to find incremental growth when you’ve penetrated most of the market. To accelerate sales, HP likely needs to optimize its pricing or lean into new offerings and international expansion.

As you can see below, HP struggled to increase demand as its $54.71 billion of sales for the trailing 12 months was close to its revenue five years ago. This shows demand was soft, a poor baseline for our analysis.

Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Just like its five-year trend, HP’s revenue over the last two years was flat, suggesting it is in a slump.

We can dig further into the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segments, Commercial Personal Systems and Commercial Printing, which are 50.5% and 28.6% of revenue. Over the last two years, HP’s Commercial Personal Systems revenue (desktops, laptops, etc.) averaged 3.2% year-on-year growth. On the other hand, its Commercial Printing revenue (commercial or industrial printers) averaged 3.5% declines.

This quarter, HP reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 3.1% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 1.2%.

Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.1% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. While this projection implies its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.

Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming.

Operating Margin

Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D.

HP was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 7% was weak for a business services business.

Analyzing the trend in its profitability, HP’s operating margin decreased by 2.3 percentage points over the last five years. HP’s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn’t pass them onto its customers.

In Q2, HP generated an operating margin profit margin of 5.1%, down 1.8 percentage points year on year. This reduction is quite minuscule and indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.

Earnings Per Share

We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable.

HP’s EPS grew at an unimpressive 6.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This performance was better than its flat revenue but doesn’t tell us much about its business quality because its operating margin didn’t improve.

We can take a deeper look into HP’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. A five-year view shows that HP has repurchased its stock, shrinking its share count by 33%. This tells us its EPS outperformed its revenue not because of increased operational efficiency but financial engineering, as buybacks boost per share earnings.

Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.

For HP, its two-year annual EPS declines of 2% show it’s continued to underperform. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data.

In Q2, HP reported adjusted EPS of $0.75, down from $0.83 in the same quarter last year. This print was close to analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects HP’s full-year EPS of $3.13 to grow 6.9%.

Key Takeaways from HP’s Q2 Results

It was good to see HP narrowly top analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, EPS was in line, as was EPS guidance for next quarter. Zooming out, we think this was a quarter without many surprises. The stock remained flat at $26.89 immediately following the results.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/hp-cover-image-220e9e9be02c_2025-03-04-164456_dhwo.jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 23:08:42.763301

Around 70,000 sq ft remains available across three floors of the all-electric building, which will feature a business lounge, roof terrace and communal terrace facing St Mary-le-Bow church.

London-based development company Fabrix was appointed earlier this year as development and leasing manager of Bow Bells on behalf of Fubon in partnership with its European strategic investment manager Patrizia.

The retrofit project is being delivered by contractor Ikon alongside White Red Architects and Arup, with completion set for early 2026 to coincide with a forecast shortage of grade-A supply.

Paul Hicks, director of development at Fabrix, said: “London’s history and future sit side by side at Bow Bells. This reimagined, all-electric City HQ places sustainability, quality and wellbeing at its core, in an unrivalled location that benefits from the outstanding transport connectivity of the Square Mile.

“Our approach has prioritised the amenities and performance features that tenants value most – from enhanced energy efficiency and fully electric M&E systems to a healthy internal environment with landscaped terraces, a design-led reception, generous communal areas and best-in-class end-of-journey facilities. Bow Bells has demonstrated our capabilities through the ultimate proof point of preletting 50% of the building, and we remain active in the market to work with partners to strategically reposition their assets in a development management capacity.”

Knight Frank and Newmark are marketing the remaining space. Cushman & Wakefield advised Bristows on the deal.

ID25,Kraft Heinz,2025-08-27 21:02:35+00:00,VegNews.com,"While Everyone Was Arguing Over Food Dyes, Kennedy Sidelined Beans - VegNews.com",VegNews Editors,,,,,https://vegnews.com/rfk-dietary-guidelines-beans,"According to Sentient Media, Kennedy “wants to ditch recommendations that would encourage Americans to eat more beans and other plant proteins.” That’s a sharp departure from what the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee proposed last year.
We have no idea.” Why beans were poised for a promotion Beans aren’t just a side dish—they’re nutrient workhorses.
But Gardner told Sentient Media that operationalizing a ban on UPFs is harder than it sounds, especially in schools.
Meanwhile, Kennedy is waging war on food dyes While beans lose traction in Washington, DC, Kennedy’s other food fight—against artificial dyes—is gaining traction.
“There was plenty of material that was simple,” he told Sentient Media, pointing to existing consumer summaries.","Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is throwing out the rulebook on America’s official nutrition playbook. Instead of adopting recommendations that would spotlight beans and other plant proteins, Kennedy is pushing to scrap them—leaving scientists and public health experts worried about what that means for everyday diets, school lunches, and the $2 billion bean industry.

According to Sentient Media, Kennedy “wants to ditch recommendations that would encourage Americans to eat more beans and other plant proteins.” That’s a sharp departure from what the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee proposed last year. After reviewing the latest nutrition science, the panel called for beans, peas, and lentils to be elevated out of the vegetable category and recognized instead as protein sources (despite their high fiber content).

Christopher Gardner, a committee member and professor of medicine at Stanford, told Sentient Media that after submitting the report, he and his colleagues were “completely ghosted” by the Department of Health and Human Services. “No one will tell us the name of a person who’s working on it,” he said. “It’s a black box. We have no idea.”

Why beans were poised for a promotion

Beans aren’t just a side dish—they’re nutrient workhorses. The committee’s 2024 report explained that Americans fall short on fiber far more than protein. Nearly three-quarters of the population doesn’t get enough fiber, but only a small percentage lacks protein. That’s why the panel wanted legumes—beans, peas, and lentils—to have a bigger role in official recommendations.

“When they go for the meat, they’re getting no fiber,” Gardner explained to Sentient Media.

By contrast, beans deliver both protein and fiber, along with iron, folate, and a host of micronutrients. The health science is clear: swapping red or processed meats for legumes is linked to lower risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even early death.

The committee’s suggestion also aligned with climate goals. Our World in Data shows beef generates more than six times the greenhouse gas emissions of beans on a per-gram-protein basis. Legumes also use far less land and water, making them one of the most sustainable proteins on the planet.

Kennedy’s rejection

Instead of leaning on that science, Kennedy has said he will start from scratch. He described the committee’s document as “unreadable” and “a political document.” According to Food Fix, one of his advisers even called it “a 453-page document that looks like it was written by the food processing industry.”

Why the pushback? Gardner suspects it’s because the panel didn’t explicitly tell Americans to stop eating ultra-processed foods (UPFs). Kennedy has made attacking UPFs—from seed oils to tomato sauces with added sugar—a personal crusade. But Gardner told Sentient Media that operationalizing a ban on UPFs is harder than it sounds, especially in schools. “You could take the high fructose corn syrup out [of tomato sauce], and there are tomato sauces without that. But they cost twice as much, and the schools wouldn’t be able to afford them,” he explained.

What’s at stake for school lunch and SNAP

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans dictate more than $40 billion in federal spending every year. That includes school meals and SNAP (food stamps). When beans are highlighted as protein sources, they get baked into lesson plans, cafeteria menus, and even grocery store SNAP nudges for low-income families.

A stronger bean message would have helped schools serve more black bean burritos or lentil chili while still meeting USDA protein targets. It would also have given SNAP-Ed programs more support to promote beans as an affordable, fiber-rich choice. If that message disappears from the final guidelines, it will be harder for agencies and retailers to justify those pushes.

The bean market is growing anyway

Even without policy support, beans are having a moment. USDA data shows per-capita dry bean availability rose 30 percent in 2024, climbing to 6.8 pounds per person as supplies of black, pinto, and kidney beans surged. Chickpea imports have also rebounded, fueling hummus and snack production.

Getty

Globally, pulses now top 100 million metric tons in consumption annually, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. That growth underscores consumer appetite for affordable, protein-rich, plant-based foods. Still, US policy signals matter: less promotion could mean less investment in bean-based innovation at home.

Meanwhile, Kennedy is waging war on food dyes

While beans lose traction in Washington, DC, Kennedy’s other food fight—against artificial dyes—is gaining traction. In April, the Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture praised the International Dairy Foods Association for pledging to eliminate synthetic dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5 across most US ice cream brands by 2028. Days later, Kraft Heinz said it would strip dyes from Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and Crystal Light by 2027. General Mills and Nestlé have announced similar timelines.

Kennedy argues these dyes are unsafe, pointing to research linking them to hyperactivity in children and, in the case of Red 3, to cancer in lab animals. The Food and Drug Administration banned Red 3 earlier this year, but the rest remain legal. Brands admit natural dyes are costlier and less stable, but public demand is forcing the transition.

The shorter guideline debate

Kennedy has also said the new guidelines will be only four pages long, compared to the 164-page 2020 edition. Gardner says brevity was never the issue. “There was plenty of material that was simple,” he told Sentient Media, pointing to existing consumer summaries. What matters now, though, is whether those four pages will include—or exclude—the clear, science-based recommendation to eat more beans.",https://vegnews.com/media/W1siZiIsIjMxMTMzL1ZlZ05ld3MuQmVhbnMuQUQwNzcuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwiY3JvcF9yZXNpemVkIiwiMjEyMXgxMTEzKzArNzAiLCIxMjAweDYzMF4iLHsiZm9ybWF0IjoianBnIn1dLFsicCIsIm9wdGltaXplIl1d/VegNews.Beans.AD077.jpg?sha=00bf2cae98294547,N,,2025-08-27 18:14:04.446163

“It’s not just this ambiguous patient out there,” said Holloman, a clinical research program manager at Medtronic.
Holloman is part of efforts to change that by using artificial intelligence to design technology for all from the start.
“We’re shining light, through tissue, to measure oxygen in the blood,” Case said, “You can think of this like shining a flashlight into fog to look for something.
“Imagine if we could use AI to look at small variations in the pulse to see an infection early and then do something about it,” he said.","When Keith Holloman saw how COVID-19 affected his own family, the importance of accurate healthcare technology became deeply personal.

“It’s not just this ambiguous patient out there,” said Holloman, a clinical research program manager at Medtronic. “It’s someone I care for that could benefit from our technologies.”

Holloman now works in Acute Care & Monitoring developing pulse oximeters — devices he used regularly when he worked as a respiratory therapist.

Pulse oximeters measure oxygen in the blood. They became even more critical for decision-making during the pandemic, and that surge in use spotlighted a troubling flaw: studies showed the devices can be less accurate on patients with darker skin tones.

Holloman is part of efforts to change that by using artificial intelligence to design technology for all from the start.

“We’re making sure that our technology is equitable for every patient we serve,” Holloman said.

Powered by AI

Doctors have relied on pulse oximeters for more than 40 years to monitor patients’ oxygen levels and knowing oxygen levels helps clinicians detect when a patient’s health is declining.

“They’re dependent on having an accurate measurement which potentially could result in them making decisions in terms of what level of intervention is necessary for that patient,” Holloman said of doctors.

At Medtronic, the NellcorTM pulse oximeter has been using artificial intelligence for more than 20 of those years — a move that positioned the company as an early adopter of AI to enhance device accuracy, said Jason Case, who leads research and development in the Acute Care & Monitoring business.

How does AI work in these small devices? First, consider how pulse oximetry works, he said.

“We’re shining light, through tissue, to measure oxygen in the blood,” Case said, “You can think of this like shining a flashlight into fog to look for something. And because blood moves with every heartbeat, the pulse lets us know when to take a measurement. Our AI is really good at identifying each and every pulse, and that enhances our accuracy.”

Every pulse is an opportunity to accurately measure oxygen supply, and AI in NellcorTM sees every single one – helping clinicians ensure patient safety moment-to-moment.

Still, said Case, there’s more work to be done.

The human touch

Long before pulse oximeters get clipped to a patient’s finger in the hospital, Medtronic scientists and engineers are innovating AI algorithms with the help of regular people, Holloman said.

The company opened a clinical physiology lab near the Five Points neighborhood of Denver, Colorado, to conduct its clinical trials not only with a wide array of participants but with more speed and frequency, leading to faster innovation.

“We’re looking at ways to improve our algorithms to accurately account for the variations in skin pigmentation, and we’re going a step further to actually design clinical studies that will give us the data that shows our algorithms, our new technology, is indeed accurate,” Holloman said.

The lab in Denver empowers Medtronic to not only examine current device performance but to inform new designs. This work includes thinking through how AI can help predict and prevent complications – perhaps even before a doctor knows something’s wrong, Case said.

“Imagine if we could use AI to look at small variations in the pulse to see an infection early and then do something about it,” he said.

The technology under development has been accepted into the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Safer Technologies Program for Medical Devices (STeP) — a designation that accelerates the development, assessment, and review of devices that are expected to improve the safety of current treatments.

“This means a ton for our patients,” Case said.

“I’ve always specialized in marine insurance, starting in ocean marine primarily on the cargo side, then expanding into inland marine after moving to America.
Not all products and services are available in every jurisdiction, and insurance coverage is governed by actual policy language.
This article was produced by the R&I Brand Studio, a unit of the advertising department of Risk & Insurance, in collaboration with Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance.
The editorial staff of Risk & Insurance had no role in its preparation.","Marine insurance at Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance has evolved far beyond its traditional maritime-focused origins, with only a small part of the company’s marine portfolio actually involving vessels on water, while the remainder encompasses diverse modern risks from data centers supporting artificial intelligence to construction equipment and supply chain coverage. This transformation reflects broader industry shifts as marine insurers adapt to contemporary business needs while maintaining the collaborative expertise that has historically defined the sector.

The term “marine insurance” has become something of a misnomer in today’s market. “When I say marine, everyone thinks about ships, yet our marine portfolio at BHSI is only about 5% on water,” explains Ben Wyatt, Head of Marine, U.S. at BHSI. “The portfolio is comprised of inland marine risks, domestic transportation and warehousing through the cargo stock throughput product.”

This evolution encompasses contractors’ equipment, including everything from warehouse forklifts to construction cranes and port equipment. Oil and gas equipment falls within this category, as does much of the emerging data center work. The marine team also handles smaller builders’ risks, highlighting how construction projects now fall under marine insurance coverage.

“We also have an excellent team that specializes in more complex, larger builders’ risk projects, and we remain very collaborative with them, sharing knowledge, expertise and experience,” he said.

Stock throughput products offer comprehensive transit and storage coverage—essentially cradle-to-grave protection for goods and inventory throughout the supply chain. Despite the product’s value, Wyatt notes that “we’re still having conversations educating established large companies about the benefits of the stock throughput coverage, whether they have a risk manager or not.”

Many companies don’t realize their property coverage may include transit protection, but it’s often sublimited with higher deductibles and restrictive terms. The global supply chain has faced numerous challenges in recent years, from the current conflicts and COVID disruptions to the Suez Canal blockage, U.S. port congestion, and labor strikes.

The marine insurance market presents several compelling opportunities driven by technological advancement and economic shifts. BHSI is positioning itself to insure data centers and servers supporting AI infrastructure, representing a significant departure from traditional marine risks while still falling within the sector’s expanded scope.

“We’re looking to insure data centers and servers supporting AI, while still managing traditional challenges like war conflicts and vessels navigating troublesome areas,” Wyatt said.

Vessel size increases over the past decade have created substantial insurance requirements. “The limits required for U.S.-based and global customers in the petrochemical, oil, gas, and LNG sectors are significant, as they can have $100-150 million worth of LNG or oil on a single ship,” Wyatt observes. This necessitates substantial insurance coverage limits that create opportunities for insurers capable of handling such exposures.

Beyond petrochemicals, manufacturers and distributors require higher limits due to price increases, particularly in cargo coverage. While specific data would be so wide ranging, Wyatt believes “the average value of goods in a container has increased significantly over the past decade”.

The stock throughput market presents particular promise as supply chain complexity increases. Companies are recognizing the need for more comprehensive coverage as they face ongoing challenges including geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, and infrastructure disruptions.

BHSI’s marine team, which has grown to 10 members over 18 months under Wyatt’s leadership, structures itself around specialized expertise rather than traditional ocean and inland marine divisions. The team includes cargo stock throughput specialists, a transportation segment focused on domestic trucking and warehouse legal liability, contractors’ equipment and floaters coverage, and builders’ risk expertise.

“I structured our team around expertise, not trying to make everyone a jack of all trades but fostering specialist knowledge with collaboration,” Wyatt explains. Team members consult with colleagues when working outside their primary expertise, recognizing that comprehensive marine underwriting requires diverse knowledge sets.

Geographic distribution across New York, Boston, and Chicago supports market understanding while presenting collaboration challenges. The company maintains an in-office focused work week and views individual and group efforts to communicate as key to fostering meaningful and effective connections. “Successful collaboration comes down to the character of the people we’ve brought into the team,” Wyatt emphasizes.

Character and Capability

Character assessment focuses on two core values: respect and passion. “I believe to enable effective collaboration and communication you have to respect your teammates above all else,” Wyatt states. “Passion is equally important because it drives motivation. This includes passion for the team, company, colleagues, knowledge expansion, and achieving positive results.”

The team’s success depends on four key elements: service, expertise, flexibility, and BHSI’s financial stability. Service remains paramount for building broker relationships and understanding customers. Expertise enables informed decision-making in difficult markets, while flexibility allows creative solutions tailored to individual customer situations.

“We’re building as collaborative a culture as possible because we see the value in it,” Wyatt said.

“It requires effort from all team members to pick up the phone and have discussions with colleagues in different offices,” he added.

“The success of our team depends on individuals’ character, willingness and desire to contribute to our collective success.”

This collaborative approach extends to customer relationships, where value alignment proves crucial across the spectrum from small wholesale deals to sophisticated Fortune 500 companies. Recent customer interactions demonstrate this flexibility, with one risk manager receiving 12 different deductible options to balance risk retention versus transfer.

“I love how our team challenges each other, including those who specialize in specific areas,” Wyatt said.

“Sometimes they receive unexpected questions about how different coverages interact or why certain practices have persisted in the marine industry,” he said.

“These interactions lead to valuable insights and continuous learning within our team.”

As technology continues reshaping the insurance landscape, BHSI’s marine team is exploring how to maintain personalized service standards while leveraging technological advances, particularly for complex, unique risks that require bespoke solutions technology alone cannot provide.

For his part, Wyatt counts himself thankful for being in a branch of insurance with a long history that is pivoting to meet the challenges of today.

“My background gives me a unique perspective on this evolution,” Wyatt said.

“I worked in Lloyds’ for ten years before moving to the U.S. six and a half years ago,” he added.

“I’ve always specialized in marine insurance, starting in ocean marine primarily on the cargo side, then expanding into inland marine after moving to America. Now I lead a great team handling both ocean and inland marine underwriting across all product lines.”

These innovations illustrate the company’s ability to anticipate consumer needs, blend functionality with sustainability and leverage marketing in ways that both grow categories and reinforce brand equity.

However, the question looming over Procter & Gamble’s playbook is whether this constant push for innovation is still yielding enough incremental advantage to outpace competitors. As leadership acknowledged, some categories have lost their edge in “superiority,” leading to share pressures in North America despite heavy reinvestment in innovation. This dynamic highlights the delicate balance between breakthrough launches that fuel growth and the risk of incremental updates that fail to excite consumers or widen the competitive gap.

The company’s restructuring program, focusing on portfolio streamlining, supply chain optimization and organizational redesign, is intended to re-energize innovation and ensure resources are deployed against the most promising opportunities.

Procter & Gamble’s ability to sustain its innovation-driven model will be tested against a backdrop of slowing category growth, trade-down pressures and heightened competition. While the company boasts a strong pipeline of upcoming launches and an unmatched track record of placing products on Circana’s New Product Pacesetters list, investors are watching closely to see if these efforts translate into market outperformance or merely defend share.

PG’s Peers: How CHD & CL Approach Innovation Differently

Church & Dwight CHD and Colgate-Palmolive Company CL showcase contrasting innovation approaches, one rooted in trusted, value-driven extensions, the other in premium, science-backed advancements.

Church & Dwight has built its reputation on value-driven innovation, leaning heavily on trusted heritage brands like Arm & Hammer, Trojan and OxiClean. Its strategy often focuses on incremental product extensions, new formats, improved formulas, or expanded uses, that resonate with consumers seeking reliable, affordable solutions. This “small but steady” approach has worked well in household and personal care, where CHD consistently finds growth opportunities in overlooked niches.

Colgate’s innovation strategy is centered on premiumization and science-backed product superiority, particularly in oral care, where brands like Colgate Total, Optic White and elmex continue to anchor growth. The company is investing heavily in new formulations, advanced whitening technologies and gum-health solutions, while also pushing into sustainable packaging and premium pet nutrition with Hill’s Science Diet and Prescription Diet innovations.

Ecolab, a global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions, is focused on data center liquid cooling.
The system provides real-time monitoring of coolant health and other parameters to help data centers maintain efficient and reliable performance.
The company's recent direct-to-chip liquid cooling innovation helps data centers respond to changing operations as they address rising demand for water and energy resources.
With this offering and others for cooling water and adiabatic applications, Ecolab can support the entire data center cooling landscape from site to chip.","Data centers have become a critical part of daily life. With the advent of artificial intelligence, machine learning and other high-performance computing, or HPC, applications, it’s estimated that global demand for data center capacity could rise at an annual rate of between 19% and 22% from 2023 to 2030 to reach an annual demand of 171 to 219 gigawatts.

As the pressure placed on data center providers increases and facilities grow to accommodate heavier computing loads, their heat load will grow along with them. HPC applications require advanced chips that use more power and generate more heat than traditional servers. This means data center operators will need to find new, more effective ways to manage cooling.

One solution is direct-to-chip liquid cooling, which brings cooling power directly to the heat source, or server chips, via an integrated loop of piping that circulates coolant through the servers.

Ecolab, a global leader in water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions, is focused on data center liquid cooling. To protect servers and cooling infrastructure, the company has developed 3D TRASAR technology for direct-to-chip applications. The system provides real-time monitoring of coolant health and other parameters to help data centers maintain efficient and reliable performance.

Ecolab Senior Corporate Account Manager Matt McMullen said that 3D TRASAR monitoring technology has been around for more than two decades, with more than 50,000 systems implemented at customer locations. The company's recent direct-to-chip liquid cooling innovation helps data centers respond to changing operations as they address rising demand for water and energy resources.

3D TRASAR technology uses smart sensors to allow for remote monitoring and reporting to help a variety of cooling operations run efficiently. With this offering and others for cooling water and adiabatic applications, Ecolab can support the entire data center cooling landscape from site to chip.

”We’re leveraging our industry experience across other critical loops to create a best practice around real-time monitoring and control,” McMullen said. “Our approach ultimately helps maximize cooling, optimize water usage and extend the life cycle of critical equipment for data center operators.”

McMullen continued to reflect that data center demand is expected to rise four times its current capacity in the next five years, and it's bringing a lot of stress to its infrastructure. 3D TRASAR technology helps alleviate this burden, particularly through smart water management resources in the data center.

McMullen described smart water management as a holistic approach that looks at a data center’s available water sources and takes into account climate versus cooling options, local regulation and water consumption during power generation.

“Our company looks at all of these factors to determine the best way to leverage the existing water and find out how to leverage it for reduced energy consumption and reliable cooling,” he said.

Data centers require significant power to operate, and newer cooling systems are not only expensive to run but can be even more costly when they go down. McMullen said that finding the best practice for maximizing coolant health and heat transfer efficiencies can minimize the energy needed for cooling and help reduce downtime.

“By reducing the power use or maintaining lower power use, we can extend the life of the coolant and limit data center downtime,” he said. “Changing a coolant in a critical space is difficult, and we want to avoid a disruption in the data center such as overheating or potential equipment failure.”

3D TRASAR has already created a positive impact for data centers, particularly through its ability to connect to Water Quality IQ performance insights for cooling water. In 2024, Ecolab collaborated with data center service provider Digital Realty to use AI-driven insights in 35 of Digital Realty’s U.S. facilities for its water-cooling operations.

“Our platform helped focus on a variety of Digital Realty sites to address water-related optimization opportunities,” McMullen said. “When fully implemented, we believe the solution will help avoid the withdrawal of up to 126 million gallons of potable water from local watersheds annually.”

McMullen said that more data center companies need to think about smart cooling early in the design phase, particularly evaporative cooling. One example is adiabatic cooling. Adiabatic cooling uses the natural process of water evaporation to cool air, reducing the need for mechanical cooling systems like chillers, which lowers operational costs and reduces power usage.

3D TRASAR is available to monitor adiabatic cooling activity as well. McMullen said this will be more widespread for operations over the next 10 years.

“There's a saying in the industry: The most sustainable data center is the one you didn't build,” McMullen said. “To get more out of each data center, it starts with the design phase and the idea of smart water and evaporative cooling to help lower your PUE.”

McMullen said he believes a smart water management approach will be adopted even more as data center operators look to non-potable water sources to cool their facilities and reduce environmental impact.

“Like many industries, data centers can leverage reclaimed water while still prioritizing reliable, high-performing operations,” McMullen said. “At Ecolab, we’re not only looking at recycling multiple types of water sources, like rainwater, gray water and black water, but also helping our customers do this in a more sustainable and cost-effective way.”

In a recent interview, Hendrik Streeck, appointed Commissioner on April 28, 2025, provided further insight into the new government’s thoughts on a multi-stage evaluation of Germany’s cannabis regulations, which is currently underway.

The first results from that evaluation are expected this fall, with additional findings to follow in the spring.

The Commissioner takes specific exception with how Germans currently can access medical cannabis online, and highlights concerns with the country’s cultivation laws for non-medical cannabis.

“We’ll have to look at some figures, such as the development of the black market, traffic accident statistics, the number of users, but also whether there’s an increase in cannabis-induced psychoses,” Streeck told the Rheinische Post, a prominent German regional daily newspaper, in an interview published on August 27.

While the Commissioner told the publication that it was too early to respond to specific policy questions regarding issues like home cultivation, cultivation clubs—which are currently allowed—and the possibility of sales through pharmacies, he did say that growing three plants at home is “far too much for personal use.”

“That’s an enormous amount. A knowledgeable owner with a green thumb can harvest about a kilo of cannabis with it,” Streeck told the publication, saying there is a clear need to reform Germany’s cannabis laws.

A joint document from the country’s recently elected coalition government said earlier this year that there would be “an open-ended evaluation of the law on the legalization of cannabis” in the fall, which was already planned as part of the original legislation.

Although the previous German government had created several new avenues for accessing cannabis for medical and non-medical purposes, the recently elected Conservative government (CDU) has said that it does not support easier access to cannabis, seeking to roll back a recent surge in Germans using cannabis under the medical program.

According to one analyst, it’s estimated that approximately between 700,000 and 900,000 individuals in Germany are accessing medical cannabis through pharmacies.

A new bill in Germany seeks to restrict how people access medical cannabis, rolling back rules that have allowed online consultations and mail order delivery from pharmacies. The bill seeks to restrict how people can access cannabis for medical purposes, requiring in-person authorizations for cannabis, as well as in-person sales (the Bill can be viewed here, translated). The move could significantly impact the country’s medical cannabis imports.

Germany first allowed the prescribing of cannabis flowers for medical purposes by physicians in 2017. The country then legalized recreational, non-medical cannabis in March 2024. The law came into effect in two phases.

The first phase, which allowed for personal cannabis cultivation and possession, came into force on April 1, 2024, and cultivation clubs were allowed in July. More than 100 of these clubs have already been approved.

The second phase was intended to facilitate regional model projects with commercial supply chains; however, shifting domestic politics appears to have slowed down that process.

“The law must definitely be more stringent and coherent,” the new Commissioner of the Federal Government for Drug and Addiction Policy told the Rheinische Post. “It isn’t at the moment. For everything else, we’ll have to wait and see what the evaluation reveals. There are no restrictions on thinking here.

“The situation is different with medicinal cannabis. Medicinal cannabis is currently being abused too often for recreational use. Health Minister Warken has already proposed a change in the law, which I welcome. It cannot be that online pharmacies deliberately direct people through medical forms in order to immediately obtain private prescriptions for medicinal cannabis. As a doctor, all the alarm bells are going off for me here. Imagine that with other medications. We also need to make adjustments with regard to medicinal cannabis.”

While the Commissioner seems to support some forms of cannabis for medical purposes, he takes exception with cannabis flower and the way flower is traditionally consumed.

“While capsules and drops have a constant active ingredient content, the THC content of flowers fluctuates considerably depending on the plant and harvest. This is precisely the problem: Sales of cannabis flowers have increased by 80 percent—​​a clear indication that this is less about alleviating illness than about consumption.

“Flowers are usually smoked, damage the lungs, and increase the risk of cancer. For the treatment of pain or epilepsy, capsules and drops are the medically sensible form – precisely dosed, evidence-based, and safe. Current developments show that many have simply switched from the black market to a legal loophole. This is an abuse of medical regulations. We have a proven system in Germany: doctors make diagnoses, prescribe medications in clear dosages, and pharmacies dispense them in a controlled manner. This principle must also apply to cannabis. That’s why I am in favor of no longer prescribing cannabis flowers.”

Cannabis from Canada supplies much of the German medical market. In the second quarter of 2025, Germany imported 43,257 kg of cannabis for medical purposes, with nearly half (20,107 kg) coming from Canada, an increase from the 16,057 kg imported from Canada in Q1 2025.

Portugal exported the second-highest amount of cannabis into Germany in the same period, with 13,465 kg. Portugal often acts as an intermediary between countries like Canada and Germany, thereby adding to Canada’s overall exports to the European Union’s most populous country.

A distant third was Denmark, exporting 2,282 kg of cannabis to Germany’s medical cannabis program in Q2 2025.

Bloomwell Group, a Frankfurt-based medical cannabis company, recently released new data and a map showing the distribution of medical cannabis patients across Germany, highlighting areas with the most and least patients.

A ban on accessing cannabis online and through the mail could affect about half of all registered patients in Germany, argues the company, driving many of these medical consumers back into the illicit market.

There are three licensed medical cannabis producers in Germany. Two companies, Tilray and Aurora, are based in Canada, while a German company, Demecan, is the third.

Amazon previously said it had been duplicating some of its efforts in grocery and missing out on opportunities to drive efficiency when Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh were operating independently.

No more Whole Foods discount for corporate workers

Current Whole Foods corporate workers, including employees in such roles as marketing and merchandising, will be offered new titles, salaries, and benefits, according to the Wall Street Journal report. They will continue to receive a discount at Whole Foods until December of next year. Whole Foods corporate staff will also no longer be able to work remotely four weeks per year, the report said.

Corporate employees will receive a 10% discount on Amazon.com, worth up to $100 a year, effective this December, the company said. Workers at Whole Foods stores and other facilities will continue to receive a 20% discount at Whole Foods.

The changes come as Walmart has recently expanded the discount available to its employees, allowing them to receive 10% off on all food products all year. The discount previously had been limited to certain items, with broader discounts available during the year-end holiday season.

Amazon expands its grocery operations

The consolidation of Amazon’s grocery operations also comes as the company adds more services, including same-day perishables delivery in more than 1,000 cities and towns across the U.S., with plans to expand to 1,300 additional locations by year-end.

In addition, Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, said in a recent Q&A with investors that he was “very bullish” on the company’s grocery business. He said Whole Foods was growing “meaningfully faster than the grocery industry in general,” with strong profitability metrics.

He also said the new, small-format Whole Foods Daily Shop stores that have opened during the past year in New York City have outperformed expectations, and additional locations are planned.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/bltb32bde333ec53174/68af6107eb57216f34a94ad8/The_front_of_a_Whole_Foods_Market.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-28 04:08:02.951920

Bad bosses are made,"" Mallick, who worked at Unilever until 2020, told Business Insider.
The book outlines 13 bad boss archetypes — from the micromanager to the credit thief, the chaos agent to the fearmonger.
The grinner This boss, Mallick said, was beloved, kind, cheerful, always smiling.
""Bad bosses steal it.""","You might think you're a good boss — supportive, fair, and hardworking. But what if you're the reason your team dreads Monday?

That's the uncomfortable question former Unilever and Johnson & Johnson marketing executive Mita Mallick asks in her forthcoming book, ""The Devil Emails at Midnight: What Good Leaders Can Learn from Bad Bosses.""

""Bad bosses aren't born bad. Bad bosses are made,"" Mallick, who worked at Unilever until 2020, told Business Insider.

The title nods to one of her first bosses, a manager whose communication style was to send barrages of emails at midnight. Spoiler alert: that's probably not a great idea.

The book outlines 13 bad boss archetypes — from the micromanager to the credit thief, the chaos agent to the fearmonger. All, Mallick argues, can be changed if leaders are willing to be honest with themselves.

1. The devil who emails at midnight

During a summer internship, Mallick's boss barely interacted with her in person. Instead, she sent midnight email barrages with urgent tasks and no context. Mallick started replying out of fear.

Mallick said she had just two 15-minute meetings with her across an entire 11-week internship.

She recommends auditing your calendar to make space for your team during business hours. If you work late, use scheduled send — and be clear that responses can wait until morning.

2. The boss who gives unwanted nicknames

This manager renamed Mallick ""Mohammed"" because her real name, Madhumita, was ""too hard."" Others joined in. Mallick eventually quit.

She advises learning and using people's names correctly and fostering team norms that call out microaggressions early. Don't make colleagues do the emotional labor of explaining why it hurt.

3. The napper

This boss routinely slept in meetings, delegated everything, and gossiped about how much he hated his job. He was actively disengaged, yet inexplicably tolerated by leadership.

Mallick says leaders should be proactive about disengagement, whether it's their own or someone else's. Her ""be a mirror"" framework involves giving feedback, creating space for honesty, and building an improvement plan with clear accountability.

4. The chopper

This boss insisted on being cc'd on every email, nitpicked minor formatting, and constantly redid her team's work, even when it didn't need redoing.

Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

Mallick warns micromanagement erodes trust. Instead, she recommends focusing on outcomes, coaching through mistakes, and resisting the urge to hover. Ask yourself: Is this about quality or control?

5. The white rabbit

This boss turned every task into a crisis. Urgent huddles, moving deadlines, and panic-driven chaos became the norm.

Mallick recommends defining urgency explicitly. Her framework — Define, Prioritize, Protect — helps leaders keep focus and avoid burning out their teams with fake fire drills.

6. 'Medusa'

This boss screamed at staff, berated people for salad orders, and once hurled a designer shoe at a colleague.

""Fear kills communication, trust, and innovation,"" Mallick writes. She urges leaders to stop equating intensity with authority and instead create safe spaces where people feel heard and respected.

7. The great pretender

After Mallick announced her pregnancy, she described how this manager reassigned her projects, denied her opportunities, and sent constant ""quick asks"" while she was on leave — all while promoting herself as an ally to working moms.

She advises asking team members what they need — don't assume. ""Protective"" behaviors rooted in bias often sideline ambitious employees.

8. The grinner

This boss, Mallick said, was beloved, kind, cheerful, always smiling. But he was utterly incompetent, per Mallick.

He had no idea what to do on the job and outsourced everything to his team.

Mallick stresses that kindness isn't a substitute for competence. If you're in over your head, ask for help, get trained, or reconsider whether managing people is right for you.

9. The cheerleader

This boss was relentlessly positive and used that positivity to deny reality. He ignored challenges and set impossible goals, then blamed the team when they missed them.

Mallick recommends replacing ""toxic positivity"" with grounded optimism. Validate struggles. Don't ask people to smile through setbacks — support them through solutions.

10. 'Gossip Girl'

Mallic said this boss shared confidential information, spread rumors about team members, and used gossip to maintain power.

Mallick was eventually accused of saying something she hadn't, and nearly lost a key workplace friendship over it.

""Just don't engage,"" she advises. Set norms that shut gossip down and build a culture of transparency where people feel seen without backchanneling.

11. The spotlight stealer

This manager plagiarized teamwork, lifted Mallick's entire self-review, and asked her to email his boss with fabricated praise.

She advises letting people present their own work. ""Good leaders share the spotlight,"" she writes. ""Bad bosses steal it.""

12. 'Tony Soprano'

When Mallick explored internal opportunities, her boss accused her of betrayal. He called her a ""rat,"" tried to block her transfer, and forced her to quit to escape him.

""You don't own your team,"" she writes. Leaders must support growth, not punish ambition. Let people go when they're ready to grow.

13. The grieving boss

Mallick's most personal story: after her father died, she became inconsistent, emotionally distant, and reactive — everything she had warned others about.

She said that when a team member quit, it was a wake-up call.

She recommends being honest when you're not OK. Take time off. Set expectations. Grief doesn't excuse bad leadership, but ignoring it can create more harm.",https://i.insider.com/686fa8663d5881a51c1d0c9c?width=750&format=jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 19:12:57.496062

Barclays Keeps Overweight Rating, Raises Ncino Price Target to $37.

Barclays analyst Saket Kalia has raised the firm's price target for nCino (NCNO) to $37 from $31, while maintaining an Overweight rating on the shares [1].

Chris Gannatti, Head of Global Research at WisdomTree, remarked that ""if the Federal Reserve loses its independence, gold will become the preferred safe-haven asset for investors.""","U.S. President Trump has taken action to dismiss a member of the Federal Reserve Board, a move that could undermine confidence in the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasury bonds, while enhancing the appeal of gold and other assets regarded as safe havens.

James St. Aubin of Ocean Park Asset Management stated, ""The independence of the Federal Reserve is its hallmark, and the act of dismissing a board member is a direct attack on its ability to formulate monetary policy free from political motivation. When you begin to weaken confidence in the monetary policy of a global reserve currency, you are playing with fire. If the market believes that the Federal Reserve is setting policy based on direct political influence, U.S. assets will lose their appeal.""

On Monday evening, Trump announced the immediate dismissal of Cook on 'Truth Social,' attempting to shake the credibility of the central bank. However, his legal authority to do so is being questioned.

Robert Savage, Managing Director and Head of Market Strategy and Insights at Bank of New York Mellon, stated that the dismissal of Cook represents ""a historic test of presidential power in the United States."" In an email, he noted that a loss of trust in the Federal Reserve's independence would pose long-term risks to U.S. bonds and the dollar, thereby limiting investors' safe-haven options.

On Tuesday, the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose slightly (bond yields move inversely to prices), while the U.S. dollar index fell slightly.

Savage stated that the market's reaction to Cook's dismissal is ""temporarily muted due to legal proceedings,"" expecting this process to last for several months. The importance of Federal Reserve independence lies in the historical concerns over government intervention in interest rate cuts to promote pro-cyclical policies, which has been a driver of inflation exceeding 2%. He added, ""The risk of a bubble bursting increases, leading to shorter business cycles.""

In the long run, inflation exceeding 2% also comes at a cost, Savage pointed out, ""This manifests as a reduction in fixed income duration holdings, thereby limiting long-term business investment.""

Controversies and Market Games Surrounding the Independence of the Federal Reserve

Kevin Flanagan, Head of Income Strategy at WisdomTree, stated that if the independence of the Federal Reserve is ultimately called into question, it could have a ""negative impact on the back end of the U.S. Treasury yield curve... but we are not at that point yet."" In the short term, the market's focus is on the upcoming employment and inflation data, as well as the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

Flanagan noted that once Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell resumes interest rate cuts in September as expected, the issue of the Fed's independence may ""become irrelevant.""

Some believe that the Federal Reserve has never truly been free from government politics. Stefan Gleason, President and CEO of Money Metals, stated that the independence of the Federal Reserve is a ""myth.""

He pointed out that the Federal Reserve is ""essentially a political institution, not only because the Board is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but also because our entire monetary system today has a political nature. We no longer have a sound currency backed by gold; rather, we have a political currency that is centrally planned by policymakers through monetary policy adjustments.""

The Rise of Alternative Assets

However, once trust in the Federal Reserve fractures, the risks associated with the dollar and U.S. Treasuries increase, inflation rises, and investors will rush to seek alternative assets. Savage from Bank of New York Mellon stated that traditionally, investors hedge against high inflation through physical assets, including gold, oil, and industrial metals.

Gold may top the list of candidates. Chris Gannatti, Head of Global Research at WisdomTree, remarked that ""if the Federal Reserve loses its independence, gold will become the preferred safe-haven asset for investors."" The company believes that any threat to the Fed's independence serves as a ""powerful catalyst for gold demand.""

""Gold does not have counterparty risk, does not rely on government credibility, and has a historical record of thousands of years as the ultimate store of value,"" said Ganatti. ""During periods of political or monetary uncertainty, it is the most trusted asset for investors to preserve value."" Data from 2025 supports this, with Ganatti noting that global central banks are expected to purchase approximately 1,000 tons of gold this year, marking a fourth consecutive year of significant accumulation.

Savage from the Bank of New York Mellon stated that ""investing internationally in countries with stable growth and low inflation"" also helps hedge against high inflation in the United States. Thus, commodities and international investments ""are clear alternative choices for current investors.""

The situation regarding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as alternative assets is more complex, as they play an important role in emerging markets with depreciating fiat currencies. Savage noted, ""They also involve payment systems and the growing demand for banking services in frontier markets.""

Overall, Jim Masturzo, Chief Investment Officer of Multi-Asset Strategies at Research Affiliates, indicated that when the risk of financial assets rises (such as when the Federal Reserve loses its independence), physical assets like gold and real estate will become safe havens.

""Investors have enjoyed substantial returns from the U.S. stock and bond markets over the past 15 years,"" he remarked. ""Regardless of the risks to the Federal Reserve's independence, U.S. stock valuations are nearing historic highs, making it a good time to take profits and focus on other safe-haven assets.""",https://pubimg.futunn.com/2022051003430642c0f32ef870d.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:31:39.353305

Moody's ratings affirms Air Liquide's A2 rating: outlook stable

Moody's Investors Service has affirmed Air Liquide's long-term issuer rating at A2 with a stable outlook. The rating reflects the company's strong balance sheet, consistent cash flow generation, and robust market position in the industrial gases sector. Moody's highlights Air Liquide's ability to navigate the volatile industrial gas market, driven by its strategic investments and operational efficiency.

The latest rating affirmation comes amidst Air Liquide's significant expansion in South Korea, where the company has signed a binding agreement to acquire DIG Airgas for €2.85 billion [1]. This acquisition, expected to close in the first semester of 2026, will strengthen Air Liquide's market position in the sixth-largest manufacturing country by GDP and the fourth-largest industrial gas market [2]. The deal is part of Air Liquide's strategy to expand its footprint and tap into South Korea's high-tech sectors, including semiconductors, clean energy, and mobility.

Air Liquide's CEO, François Jackow, commented on the acquisition, stating that it aligns with the company's commitment to profitable long-term growth. The acquisition will enable Air Liquide to build a reference player in South Korea, leveraging DIG Airgas's strong operational assets and backlog of nearly 20 secured projects [2]. This strategic move is expected to contribute to Air Liquide's net profit growth within one year of integration.

From a financial perspective, the transaction values DIG Airgas at a 2024 EBITDA multiple of 20.2, reducing to 14.8 when factoring in secured project backlogs and cost synergies [2]. Air Liquide plans to finance the deal initially through a structured bridge loan, later refinanced via bond issuance.

The acquisition not only strengthens Air Liquide's leadership in Asia and the global electronics sector but also underlines its long-term dedication to South Korea's economic growth and clean energy transition [2]. Moody's expects Air Liquide to continue its growth trajectory, driven by its strong financial standing and global footprint.

The settlement stems from an April 2025 lawsuit alleging CVS offered lower drug prices to cash-paying customers through a discount program run by ScriptSave while failing to report and bill MassHealth at these lower rates.

According to the complaint, CVS violated Massachusetts’ ""Most Favored Nation"" drug pricing regulation, which has been in effect since 1995 and requires pharmacies to charge MassHealth the lowest price offered to any other customer.

The Attorney General’s office claimed CVS contracted with ScriptSave to administer discount card programs for former customers of CVS’s Health Savings Pass program and former Target pharmacies acquired by CVS. Customers with these ScriptSave discount cards often received lower prices than those charged to MassHealth.

Beyond the financial payment, CVS will implement a yearly reconciliation process to review prescription drug pricing for MassHealth members, ensuring the program isn’t overcharged in the future.

Transcend Plus delivers major advancements in image quality and artificial intelligence (AI), including newly FDA-cleared 2D and 3D image quality enhancements and a growing suite of AI-enabled clinical applications — all designed to meet the growing challenges of cardiac care. With increased patient volume, rising clinical complexity and persistent staffing shortages, Transcend Plus is designed to help cardiology teams by offering fast, reproducible results with uncompromising image quality and decision-making support.

""Transcend Plus represents a bold leap forward in the evolution of echocardiography, reinforcing our commitment to continuous innovation, empowering clinicians with AI-driven tools that enhance confidence, accelerate decision-making, and elevate care at every stage of the cardiac journey,” said David Handler, Business Leader, Cardiology Ultrasound at Philips. “Transcend Plus is more than an advancement – it’s a clear statement of Philips’ leadership in cardiovascular ultrasound. Building on the momentum of our original Transcend launch, Transcend Plus brings the full power of AI integration to the forefront, giving clinicians the confidence, speed, and precision they need to lead in cardiac care – today and into the future.”

Enhanced Image Quality

Transcend Plus visibly improves sharpness, contrast and detail in 2D and 3D imaging, featuring the latest FDA-cleared enhancements for EPIQ CVx and Affiniti CVx. These upgrades support superior visualization of cardiac anatomy and function, enabling diagnostic confidence even in the most complex or technically challenging cases. The update also introduces the new 2D Auto EF Advanced feature, expanding AI capabilities for contrast images – essential for accurately assessing cardiac function.

“Artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat, and I always maintain that human plus AI is going to be better than human alone or AI alone – the 3D Auto CFQ and 3D Auto TV AI applications are examples of this, taking manual, time-consuming processes and automating these measurements in a fast, easy and reproducible way,” said Akhil Narang, MD, Director, Echocardiography Laboratory and Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Cardiology at the Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University and Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute.

FDA-cleared AI Applications, Now Fully Integrated

Philips now offers 26 FDA-cleared cardiovascular ultrasound AI applications — the most in the industry — fully integrated into Transcend Plus for both EPIQ and Affiniti CVx systems. Among the latest enhancements to receive FDA 510(k) clearance are 2D Auto EF and 2D Auto EF Advanced. These advanced tools are designed to streamline clinical workflows and improve diagnostic accuracy across a range of care settings, from the echo lab through the hospital to outpatient clinics, pre-assessment, and long-term follow-up. With these integrated AI applications, clinicians can assess patients more quickly, consistently, and confidently across the entire care continuum.

Left Ventricular Function Assessment

Left ventricular (LV) function assessment is one of the most critical applications in cardiac imaging, playing a central role in diagnosing and managing a wide range of cardiac conditions. Transcend Plus directly supports this need by delivering fast, reproducible results that help cardiologists quickly and definitively evaluate LV function consistently across different patients and over time. Automated tools minimize operator variability, ensuring more reliable and standardized measurements, especially vital in high-volume or high-pressure clinical environments. In addition, Transcend Plus offers robust support for both contrast and non-contrast imaging. The 2D Auto EF feature enables accurate assessments even when contrast agents cannot be used, such as in patients with renal impairment. Building on this, 2D Auto EF Advanced adds AI-powered quantification capabilities for both contrast and non-contrast studies, broadening clinical applicability and enhancing measurement reliability in patients with poor image quality or challenging acoustic windows. These capabilities combine to deliver a more confident, efficient approach to cardiac care.

Clinical Confidence

Transcend Plus empowers clinicians to make fast, confident decisions across every cardiac care setting – whether in the echo lab, interventional suite, or during routine outpatient assessments.

This integration, set to begin next year, is part of Amazon's broader effort to streamline its operations and enhance collaboration and innovation within its grocery division.

Effective December 8, 2025, Whole Foods corporate employees will transition to Amazon's systems and programs. This shift includes replacing Whole Foods' unique benefits, such as in-store discounts and four weeks of remote work per year, with Amazon's standard offerings. Additionally, Whole Foods employees will receive Amazon stock as part of their compensation package instead of an annual bonus.

Amazon spokesperson Lauren Snyder emphasized that the move is designed to bring the grocery teams closer together, fostering better collaboration and innovation. The integration comes as Amazon ramps up its in-house grocery business to compete with rivals like Walmart (WMT), Instacart (CART), and Kroger (KR) with same-day delivery of fresh groceries.

The announcement has had a mixed impact on the market. While Amazon's shares have risen, the news has also weighed on competitors' shares. This integration marks a continuation of Amazon's strategy to centralize Whole Foods' operations and scale back some of its distinctive perks and benefits since its acquisition in 2017.

Whole Foods employees have expressed concerns about the cultural shift, but Amazon maintains that the integration is essential for driving collaboration and innovation. After the transition, in-store discounts will be reserved for Whole Foods in-store employees, starting in 2027.

Brazil's Marinho comments in ‘worst case scenario for tariffs’

Brazil's steel industry is facing an uncertain future as the expiration of key trade protections and escalating geopolitical tensions loom large. ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer, has been navigating these challenges with its $25 billion investment in Brazil, which includes a significant expansion of its Tubarão plant. The company's strategic decisions are closely tied to the political landscape and trade policies.

According to a recent statement by ArcelorMittal's Brazil head, Jorge Oliveira, the company's expansion plans for the Tubarão plant could be delayed or canceled if the Brazilian government does not extend current trade protections by May 2025. The expiration of these protections, along with the ongoing U.S. tariffs, poses a significant risk to ArcelorMittal's investment pipeline and the 1.2 million jobs it supports in Brazil's construction and automotive sectors [1].

The U.S. has imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian steel, disrupting ArcelorMittal's export strategy and forcing it to redirect shipments to European plants and accelerate U.S. production. While the U.S. later exempted Brazilian pig iron from the tariff, the broader trade war has had a substantial impact on ArcelorMittal's operations and financial performance. The company has already incurred financial losses of $150 million in 2025 due to these tariffs [1].

Brazil's political landscape adds another layer of risk. The U.S. tariffs, framed as politically motivated, have strained bilateral relations and raised questions about the durability of trade protections. Analysts speculate that the tariffs could be reversed before August 1, 2025, given Brazil's trade deficit with the U.S. and its lack of competitive threat in the steel sector. However, the Brazilian government's response remains unpredictable [1].

Investors are closely monitoring the situation. The risks for investors are clear: if trade policies remain unstable, ArcelorMittal's $25 billion investment could yield subpar returns. Additionally, rising interest rates in Brazil, projected to hit 14.75%, threaten to dampen demand in the automotive sector, a key client for ArcelorMittal [1].

Yet, the opportunities are equally compelling. A successful expansion in Brazil would solidify ArcelorMittal's position as a global steel leader. The company's recent acquisition of Nippon Steel's stake in the Calvert joint venture and the launch of a new electric arc furnace in Alabama demonstrate its agility in navigating trade barriers. If the Brazilian government extends tariffs and strengthens import controls, ArcelorMittal's domestic market share could grow, enhancing its EBITDA contribution [1].

For investors, the key is to monitor trade policy developments in Brazil and the U.S. ArcelorMittal's ability to pivot, such as its U.S. production expansion, mitigates some risks. However, long-term success depends on political stability. The resolution of the U.S. tariffs will be a critical inflection point. A reversal could unlock $200 million in annual savings for ArcelorMittal, while a prolonged trade war could force further cost-sharing with customers [1].

Net sales of $1.21 billion advanced 7% year over year on a reported basis and 6% on a constant-currency basis. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 billion. ANF’s comparable sales (comps) improved 3%. The top-line beat was driven by broad-based net sales growth across regions and exceptional growth at its Hollister brand.

Abercrombie & Fitch delivered another quarter of record results, marking its eleventh straight period of growth. Performance was led by Hollister, which achieved its strongest-ever second quarter, reflecting strong back-to-school and summer demand. Abercrombie brands faced a modest decline against exceptionally strong growth last year. The company improved profitability, supported by disciplined inventory management and strategic promotions, while also returning capital to its shareholders through ongoing share repurchases. Looking ahead, Abercrombie raised its full-year outlook, citing strong momentum and continued confidence in its global brands.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 11.3% in the past three months against the industry's 0.6% growth.

During the quarter, sales in its Asia-Pacific region grew 12%, while international comparable sales climbed 3%.
That was offset by a slowdown in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where sales slid 1% and comparable sales were down 5%.","Abercrombie & Fitch sales growth slowed again in its fiscal second quarter as the apparel company struggles to top the surge it enjoyed last fiscal year.

During the quarter, sales at the namesake Abercrombie brand fell 5% while comparable sales dropped 11%.

But the success of the teen-focused Hollister brand helped to salvage the quarter. Overall, Abercrombie & Fitch sales climbed 7%, led by 19% growth at Hollister – the brand's best-ever second-quarter net sales growth, the company said. Comparable sales across the business rose 3%, led by Hollister, which also saw comparable sales grow 19%.

Abercrombie narrowly beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines. The company also hiked its full-year revenue outlook and now expects sales to climb 5% to 7%, compared with previous guidance of 3% to 6% growth. Much of that range would top Wall Street expectations of 5.2% growth, according to LSEG.

The company's shares were down in afternoon trading.

Here's how the company did in its fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.32 adjusted vs. $2.30 expected

Revenue: $1.21 billion vs. $1.20 billion expected

Abercrombie's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $141 million, or $2.91 per share, compared with $133 million, or $2.50 a share, a year earlier. Excluding the impact of a favorable litigation settlement, Abercrombie saw earnings of $2.32 per share.

Sales rose to $1.21 billion, up about 7% from $1.13 billion a year earlier.

""We entered the second half of 2025 on offense,"" CEO Fran Horowitz said in a news release. ""We are increasing our full year net sales outlook, reflecting our strong positioning and growth trajectory, building on record 2024 results. Our team remains focused on delivering for our customers while investing to capitalize on the significant, long-term opportunities for our global brands.""

For its current quarter, Abercrombie's also gave a better-than-expected sales outlook. It anticipates revenue will rise between 5% and 7%, beating expectations of 4.3% growth, according to LSEG.

Meanwhile, its profit outlook for the fiscal third quarter is weaker than expected. The company anticipates earnings per share will be between $2.05 and $2.25, far below expectations of $2.53, according to LSEG.

Abercrombie said it expects its operating margin, a closely watched metric on Wall Street, to be between 11% and 12% during its current quarter, also lower than Wall Street expectations of 13.3%, according to StreetAccount. The company said a $25 million tariff cost, net of mitigation efforts, is expected to weigh on its operating income in the current quarter.

For the full year, Abercrombie tightened its earnings outlook and now expects earnings per share to be between $10.00 and $10.50. That compares with a previous range of $9.50 to $10.50 per share.

Abercrombie's guidance incorporates about $90 million in net tariff costs – nearly double what it previously anticipated. When it announced fiscal first-quarter earnings in May, Abercrombie said it was expecting a $70 million hit from tariffs that it could reduce to $50 million through mitigation.

At the time, President Donald Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs were held at 10% across most of the globe. But now Abercrombie faces higher duties on goods from Vietnam, Cambodia and India, key manufacturing regions for the company.

The company reiterated during a conference call with analysts that it is not planning broad price increases, saying higher prices are not part of its outlook.

Abercrombie & Fitch, once a forgotten mall brand, has been on a rocket ship of growth over the last few years. But the surge has started to slow at its namesake banner. On the call, Horowitz attributed the decline in sales during the quarter to old inventory that it needed to mark down to sell through, which reduced the average selling price of products. She expects the brand to be back to growth by the end of the year.

""We did take a little bit of a step back, but we are very confident in where we're headed. The brand is in great shape. Our traffic is strong,"" said Horowitz. ""We are confident we're on a path to improvement.""

In the meantime, Hollister has been fueling the overall business performance, especially with the recent launch of its Y2K assortment, which brings back some of the brand's beloved styles from the early 2000s and a touch of the old Abercrombie, including graphic tees and short skirts.

To boost growth at Abercrombie, the brand has turned to new categories, such as dresses, athleisure and bridal, to stimulate growth. It's also working to expand internationally and lean on partnerships.

On Monday, the company announced it would be the NFL's first ""official fashion partner"" – a multiyear deal that will include personal styling for athletes, athlete-led campaigns and player-designed apparel. The partnership comes after Abercrombie launched an assortment of NFL-licensed products in 2022, a category that has performed well for the company.

It has teamed up with star players like Christian McCaffrey, Tee Higgins and CeeDee Lamb to advertise the partnership and designed limited-edition co-designed apparel that will be available for sale during the upcoming season.

""Who would have dreamed a few years ago to partner with an iconic global brand like the NFL?"" Horowitz told analysts.

The partnership reflects the steps retailers are taking to ensure they can continue to grow sales and stay relevant with consumers at a time when shoppers are pulling back on nice-to-have items like new clothes and accessories. Competitors like Levi Strauss , American Eagle and Gap have teamed up with celebrities in recent marketing campaigns ahead of the back-to-school and fall shopping seasons.

Still, the slowdown raises questions about how the brand will grow in the quarters ahead, especially as competition continues to heat up, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a note.

""Better numbers ... will probably come through as the prior year comparatives start to ease, but they also need to be engineered by the company. We believe there are some good initiatives in play here, including the overseas expansion of the brand,"" said Saunders. ""Our recent channel checks at new stores in London were all positive, although we believe the stores can reach a higher potential once the consumer economy in the UK strengthens.""'

Internationally, Abercrombie's efforts to expand are paying off in some parts of the world. During the quarter, sales in its Asia-Pacific region grew 12%, while international comparable sales climbed 3%. That was offset by a slowdown in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where sales slid 1% and comparable sales were down 5%.

Abercrombie has also started to expand into wholesale for its Abercrombie Kids brand, which most recently launched in Macy's . The company has a very small share of the overall market, which was worth $82.1 billion last year, Saunders said.

""This leaves considerable headroom for growth,"" said Saunders. ""Expanding through wholesale is a sensible strategy: it provides relatively fast access to new customers and requires far less capital than opening additional stores – of which Abercrombie Kids still has relatively few.""

The accused would submit orders over Instacart and Shipt, which they would then accept via their stolen shopper accounts, investigators said.
By mid-2023, Target had noticed the Shipt accounts were being used to buy gift cards rather than the ordered items, which is against its terms of use.
The FBI said Instacart reported a loss of just over $16 million as a result of the fraud carried out over 5,500 compromised shopper accounts.
Shipt lost $14.3 million and had 2,215 accounts hacked.","Eight men have been accused of hacking into over 7,500 gig workers’ accounts at Instacart and Target-owned Shipt to defraud the companies of as much as $30 million, according to a search warrant and an indictment reviewed by Forbes.

It’s a rare case showing how gig workers are vulnerable to hacking at scale, which can be damaging for the tech companies who employ them.

In the court documents, filed earlier this month in Ohio and Michigan, the FBI claimed that from 2022 onwards the accused worked together to acquire a stolen list of Instacart and Shipt shoppers who were tasked with buying and delivering items to customers of the two apps. To get into accounts, the defendants posed as Instacart and Shipt employees, contacting the shoppers, some of which were inactive, to ask if they wanted to continue doing deliveries, according to the FBI’s account. The scammers asked the victims to share a one-time passcode to give them access to the account, purportedly to remove their account, reactivate it or to confirm their status as active.

But instead they allegedly used that access for a gift-card fraud scheme. The accused would submit orders over Instacart and Shipt, which they would then accept via their stolen shopper accounts, investigators said. Because user orders go to the nearest shoppers, it’s simple to engineer a task to go to a specific account. Once funds to cover the cost of the goods they were supposed to buy were available on their shopper debit cards, the defendants bought gift cards rather than the items requested, according to the FBI. Meanwhile, posing as the original customer, the swindlers cancelled the order to get a refund. Typically they used the gift cards to buy items online or acquire cryptocurrency, the government said; often, they’d exchange the crypto for cash.

“There's people who sell lists of inactive drivers from their platform. You call them and get access to their account.”

Quote from a suspect in a Justice Department search warrant

According to the search warrant for one of the suspect’s properties, the defendants used another method to get into additional active shopper accounts: they put in an order, then contacted the shopper on the Instacart or Shipt app asking to arrange a call so they could add items to the shop. This gave them the gig worker’s phone number, which they later called pretending to be Instacart or Shipt staff, again asking for the one-time passcode for the account under the pretense that a customer had complained that their profile image didn’t match the person who made the delivery, investigators alleged.

By mid-2023, Target had noticed the Shipt accounts were being used to buy gift cards rather than the ordered items, which is against its terms of use. Later, the men were seen on surveillance cameras purchasing the cards using their Shipt accounts, according to the warrant, which included the relevant phishing texts and video footage.

Meanwhile, an undercover FBI agent contacted one of the alleged scammers on Telegram, where the suspect disclosed the nature of the scheme, according to the warrant. “There's people who sell lists of inactive drivers from their platform. You call them and get access to their account. Afterwards you take the preloaded card and get gift cards,” the suspect wrote, per the warrant.

Lawyers for the defendants had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication. Court dockets show the men have been charged with wire fraud but are yet to file a plea. The DOJ did not respond to a comment request.

The FBI said Instacart reported a loss of just over $16 million as a result of the fraud carried out over 5,500 compromised shopper accounts. Shipt lost $14.3 million and had 2,215 accounts hacked.

Shipt VP of communications Evangeline George confirmed the company had cooperated with police on the investigation. She said the privacy of Shipt’s members and staff is a priority.

Instacart said only a small number of its 600,000 shoppers’ accounts were compromised. “There was no breach of Instacart's systems, and we quickly detected unauthorized activity and proactively engaged law enforcement,” said spokesperson Charlotte Healow. “We’re grateful for their efforts and pleased to see the bad actors held accountable.”

It’s not the first time fraudsters have targeted Instacart’s gig workers. In 2021, the company said hackers had broken into accounts by using login information leaked online from previous data breaches. As a result of the attacks, Instacart has been adding new layers of security, including “biometric screening” where workers are asked to provide a selfie that matches their government-issued driver’s license.

As global economies grapple with inflation, labor market fragility, and shifting consumer habits, the question arises: Which retail stocks can serve as a hedge against consumer caution? The answer lies in value stocks—companies with durable business models, essential offerings, and a track record of weathering downturns.

The Retail Sector in a Slowdown: A Tale of Two Sectors

The retail landscape is bifurcated. Food retail has shown remarkable resilience, with sales growth of 3-4% in 2024 and EBITDA margins of 6-7% of sales. Consumers, facing inflation and job insecurity, have embraced ""trading down,"" opting for private-label products and budget-conscious essentials. In contrast, non-food retail—including apparel, home goods, and discretionary items—has struggled, with EBITDA margins contracting to 7-8% of sales. This divergence underscores the importance of sector selection for investors.

E-commerce, once a pandemic-era savior, now faces headwinds as growth plateaus in mature markets. Meanwhile, the rise of second-hand markets and localized brands adds complexity. Yet, within this volatility, certain value stocks stand out for their structural advantages.

Value Stocks: The Bedrock of Resilience

Value stocks in the retail sector are defined by essential products, recurring revenue streams, and robust balance sheets. These companies thrive when consumers prioritize necessity over luxury. Below are five standout examples:

1. McDonald's (MCD): The Franchise Powerhouse

Dividend Yield: 2.2%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 48 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -3% vs. -55% for S&P 500

McDonald's operates on a franchise model, where 95% of its restaurants are owned by independent operators. This structure shields the parent company from operational costs, leaving it with high-margin royalty income. During the 2020 pandemic, when dine-in traffic plummeted, digital orders and at-home dining surged, ensuring revenue stability. Its real estate portfolio also acts as an inflation hedge, with properties generating steady rental income.

2. PepsiCo (PEP): The Staple of the Pantry

Dividend Yield: 4.3%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 60 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -35% vs. -55% for S&P 500

PepsiCo's portfolio of snacks, beverages, and ready-to-eat meals ensures consistent demand. During the 2020 pandemic, at-home consumption drove revenue growth, while its pricing power allowed it to offset input cost inflation. With a BBB+ credit rating and a payout ratio of 55%, PepsiCo balances growth and shareholder returns.

3. General Mills (GIS): The Staple of the Cabinet

Dividend Yield: 4.4%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 126 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -12% vs. -55% for S&P 500

General Mills' brands—Cheerios, Yoplait, and Nature's Resource—anchor household pantries. During the 2008 crisis, its sales fell by just 0.5%, and it maintained pricing power through its diversified product mix. Its BBB credit rating and strong distribution network further insulate it from volatility.

4. Colgate-Palmolive (CL): The Staple of the Bathroom

Dividend Yield: 2.3%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 130 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -22% vs. -55% for S&P 500

Colgate's oral care and household products are non-discretionary. Its ability to offer products across price tiers allows consumers to trade down without abandoning the brand. During the 2008 crisis, its revenue dropped by less than 3%, and its BBB rating ensures financial stability.

5. Genuine Parts (GPC): The Staple of the Garage

Dividend Yield: 3.5%

Uninterrupted Dividend Streak: 60 years

2007-09 Recession Return: -46% vs. -55% for S&P 500

As the largest automotive parts distributor, Genuine Parts benefits from the inelastic demand for vehicle maintenance. High used car prices and supply chain bottlenecks during the pandemic boosted its sales. Its conservative payout ratio (50%) and BBB rating reinforce dividend reliability.

Strategic Considerations for Investors

While these stocks offer resilience, investors must remain selective. Key criteria include:

- Essentiality: Products or services that consumers cannot easily forgo.

- Pricing Power: Ability to pass on cost increases without losing market share.

- Balance Sheet Strength: Low leverage and strong liquidity to withstand shocks.

- Dividend Sustainability: A history of consistent payouts, even during downturns.

The current macroeconomic environment—marked by rising interest rates and a fragile labor market—favors companies with recurring revenue and low debt. For example, McDonald's and PepsiCo's franchise and subscription models generate stable cash flows, while General Mills and Colgate-Palmolive's consumer staples portfolios ensure demand continuity.

Conclusion: Anchoring Portfolios in Uncertain Times

The retail sector's resilience during economic slowdowns is not uniform. While non-food retail falters, value stocks in food, utilities, and essential services emerge as safe havens. By investing in companies like McDonald's, PepsiCo, and General Mills, investors can hedge against consumer caution while capitalizing on durable demand. As the U.S. retail market navigates a softening labor market and valuation dispersion, these stocks offer a blend of income, stability, and long-term growth.

In a world of uncertainty, the best defense is a portfolio anchored in value.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:04:46.073834

Risk and Reward: A Value Investor's Perspective Kohl's revival is not without risks.","In the shadow of a struggling retail sector, Kohl's Corporation (KHC) has emerged as a compelling case study in value-driven revival. The company's 2025 turnaround efforts, marked by disciplined cost-cutting, margin expansion, and strategic repositioning, echo the principles that once transformed Hyundai into a global industrial titan under the leadership of its founder, Chung Ju-Yung. For value investors, Kohl's journey offers a blueprint for navigating distressed markets through operational rigor, customer-centric innovation, and long-term vision.

Kohl's 2025 Turnaround: A Blueprint for Retail Resilience

Kohl's second-quarter 2025 results underscore a hard-won pivot toward profitability. Gross margins rose 28 basis points to 39.9%, driven by a shift toward proprietary brands and tighter inventory management. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses fell 4.1% year-over-year, while operating income surged to $279 million—a 68% increase from the same period in 2024. These metrics reflect a company shedding the inefficiencies of its past and embracing a leaner, more agile model.

The strategic pillars underpinning this revival are clear:

1. Operational Discipline: Kohl's has slashed inventory by 5% year-over-year to $3.0 billion, alleviating overstock pressures and freeing cash flow.

2. Customer-Centric Innovation: The full rollout of Sephora shop-in-shops across all stores has created a $2 billion beauty business, while new home brands like Miryana and Mingle & Co. are revitalizing stagnant categories.

3. Omnichannel Integration: A $400 million investment in digital upgrades and return partnerships (e.g., with Amazon) is streamlining the customer journey, even as digital sales remain a challenge.

Chung Ju-Yung's Legacy: A Parallel in Values-Driven Leadership

The parallels between Kohl's revival and the leadership of Hyundai's founder, Chung Ju-Yung, are striking. Chung's philosophy of strategic frugality—prioritizing innovation over wasteful spending—mirrors Kohl's focus on inventory discipline and expense reduction. During the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Chung famously avoided cutting R&D budgets, instead reinvesting savings into machinery to preserve talent and accelerate growth. Similarly, Kohl's has redirected resources toward high-impact initiatives like Sephora partnerships and proprietary brands, rather than broad-based cost-cutting.

Chung's mantra of “shortening the time”—emphasizing speed and execution discipline—resonates in Kohl's 2025 strategy. Under interim CEO Michael Bender, the company has accelerated its omnichannel rollout and simplified its value proposition (e.g., Kohl's Cash), mirroring Hyundai's rapid pivots during crises. Both leaders also prioritize people-centric cultures: Kohl's has emphasized inclusion and ESG stewardship, while Chung's profit-sharing programs and worker-centric ethos built loyalty during Hyundai's rise.

Risk and Reward: A Value Investor's Perspective

Kohl's revival is not without risks. The company still faces declining in-store traffic and a high-interest debt burden (e.g., $360 million in 10% senior secured notes issued in July 2025). However, its progress in margin expansion, cash flow generation ($598 million in Q2 2025 operating cash flow), and strategic partnerships suggests a path to sustainable growth.

For value investors, Kohl's offers a compelling risk-rebalance trade. Its forward P/E ratio of 4.5x (as of August 2025) reflects skepticism about its long-term prospects but also creates a margin of safety. The company's focus on impulse purchases (30% sales growth in Q2 2025) and family-centric rebranding (“Where Families Come First”) positions it to capture underserved segments in the retail market.

Investment Thesis: A Retail Renaissance in the Making

Kohl's turnaround aligns with the principles of value investing: buying into a business at a discount while betting on management's ability to unlock intrinsic value. The parallels to Chung Ju-Yung's leadership—frugality, execution discipline, and a long-term vision—add credibility to its revival. While the road to profitability remains challenging, the company's Q2 2025 results and strategic clarity suggest it is no longer a distressed asset but a resilient contender in the evolving retail landscape.

For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, Kohl's represents a high-conviction play on retail resilience. The key will be monitoring its ability to sustain margin improvements, execute its omnichannel strategy, and navigate debt obligations. Those who recognize the parallels between Kohl's and Hyundai's historical turnaround may find themselves positioned for a meaningful return as the retailer's value proposition gains broader acceptance.

In a market where many retailers are still reeling from the post-pandemic shift in consumer behavior, Kohl's has taken a page from Chung Ju-Yung's playbook. By marrying operational rigor with customer-centric innovation, it is proving that even in distressed sectors, value can be created—and sustained.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:08:52.874038

Now, the firm has set its sights on the Porsche 911 Turbo-series, announcing its own take on the classic rear-engined car for the company's 40th anniversary earlier this morning.

RML is calling its Porsche 911 Turbo S-based rocket the GTH and says the Barney-colored sports car is inspired by Le Mans racers such as the Porsche GT1 of the late 1990s. The RML internal codename for this modified Porsche is P39, since it is the 39th model produced by the UK firm, and the aftermarket brand says it fulfills the mission of being the ultimate grand touring model. That is all well and good, but its on-paper performance suggests that it is really competing with supercars.

Power figures are set at a solid 920 hp from its twin-turbo 3.7-liter flat-six. Torque figures rise to 737 lb-ft, a feat that RML credits to tuning partner Litchfield Motors. Active aerodynamic features are a big help for a road-going model with so much thrust, but RML went one step further and allows the driver to select certain aerodynamic options themselves. Other performance upgrades include selectable ride height adjustment, a rear roll cage, and a rear seat delete. RML also prides itself on the actively-adjusting dampers fitted to the car, which the firm says provide a properly cushioned ride on the road.

""This is a proud day in RML history. I could not be more thrilled with how the GT Hypercar has turned out. It was an ambitious project but it has beaten even my exacting expectations on road and track. I congratulate and thank the whole RML team for making my and our customer’s dream cars come true,"" Michael Mallock, Board Member responsible for the RML's Bespoke Division, said.

The striking addition of Storm Purple paint and carbon fiber body structure are a testament to RML's bespoke capabilities, which it says are nearly limitless. We may have personally not opted to slather our fire-breathing RML GTH in purple paint, but the unusual color shows off its impressive aero kit well. Gold brake calipers and other pieces of hand-painted gunmetal trim are included to offset the boisterous body color.

The interior of the RML GTH receives a similar treatment, with retrimmed standard seats featuring Crayon-colored stitching. The seatbelts have also been color matched to complete this Crayon-inspired interior. The roll cage is predictably wrapped in Storm Purple while other essential panels get a layer of visual carbon fiber. It makes for a handsome, if slightly unusual, package inside.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rmlgth1-68af13b89cc6d.jpg?crop=0.846xw:0.635xh;0.0946xw,0.190xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-08-27 17:06:51.568135

People are asking, ‘Does this star actually care about this brand?’,” Jones told SJ Denim.
We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.
Earlier this month, Calvin Klein unveiled its Fall 2025 denim collection with a campaign fronted by Mingyu of K-pop group Seventeen.
CEO Michelle Gass even stated during a recent earnings call that “The Levi’s brand has never been stronger.” “Gap and Levi’s share some common elements that work for them,” Labunski said.","In 2024, consumers (specifically Gen Z and millennials) went feral for celebrity-driven campaigns.

Take 32-time Grammy Award winner and global icon Beyoncé, for example. Her highly anticipated album “Cowboy Carter” not only topped the charts but also fueled a blockbuster campaign with Levi’s.

Launched in September 2024, the collaboration generated more than 4.3 billion impressions and over $65 million in estimated earned media value (EMV) by April 2025. Combined with the release of her viral track “Levii’s Jeans” last March, Levi’s reported a 12 percent boost in net revenue and a 44 percent surge in net income to $183 million by the end of Q4 2024, according to the company’s earnings report.

Country music star Lainey Wilson followed suit. Riding the momentum of her album “Whirlwind,” she dropped her first collab collection with Wrangler which became the brand’s most successful global collaboration.

Meanwhile, Charli XCX’s chart-topping album “Brat” marked a cultural reset in both music and fashion. The rule breaker revived the indie sleaze aesthetic, brought club culture back into focus and toppled Clean Girl minimalism with her simple (yet effective) lime-green album cover.

Heather Ibberson, retail analyst at EDITED tracked the ripple effect, noting “Lime green apparel arrivals were low within retailers’ Spring 2024 collections. However, we saw a 171-percent spike in June 2024 vs. 2023 when the album launched, and fans used the slime hue to signal their Brat girl status.”

Charli XCX’s influence translated into sales, too. For example, Her Skims cotton rib collection campaign reached a 35 percent majority sell-out rate—meaning more than half of SKUs sold out—within its first three months in the U.S., while her collaborations with Acne Studios generated an estimated $1.5 million in media mentions in its first 48 hours, a figure “significantly higher than other campaigns during the same period,” according to Launchmetrics data.

So, if celebrity campaigns sparked cultural moments and measurable returns last year, why aren’t they striking the same chord in 2025?

Well, according to Stacy Jones, founder and CEO of pop culture marketing agency Hollywood Branded, it’s because “consumers are savvier now.”

“Last year’s multi-collaborations felt exciting because they were fresh combinations. This year, the saturation is showing. People are asking, ‘Does this star actually care about this brand?’,” Jones told SJ Denim. “There’s a fatigue factor, but it’s also a demand for deeper storytelling. The campaigns that will resonate moving forward are the ones that go beyond a single ad and actually create experiences or narratives people want to be part of.”

If there was one campaign that showed just how tricky the formula has become, it was American Eagle’s “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” campaign.

While AE’s president and executive creative director Jennifer Foyle said the goal was to add “a little mischief” to the company’s marketing strategy, it instead sparked an online uproar.

In one video, Sweeney delivers a mock science lesson, stating “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color…my jeans are blue,” she says, playing on both the denim she’s wearing and her own blue eyes. The clip then cuts to a voiceover saying “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.”

“The creative was clever, but it lacked layers. It relied too heavily on a single pun without the cultural scaffolding that [others] have built, [leaving] it more vulnerable to backlash and interpretation instead of universal resonance,” Jones said. “The partnership wasn’t necessarily wrong…but without diversification across talent or storytelling, the weight fell entirely on her shoulders, making the campaign easier to critique.”

AI-powered geospatial insights company Pass_by reported that AE’s in-store traffic decline accelerated in the wake of the controversy. For the week of Aug. 3–9, visits were down 8.96 percent year-over-year, following a 3.9 percent drop the previous week.

That’s not to say the campaign didn’t generate attention, though.

In fact, the move actually sparked a surge in online conversation, with daily mentions of the brand jumping from an average of 67 to 33,000, according to Marketplace Analytics Platform Systems (Maps).

“This isn’t just a debate about denim; it’s a discussion about identity, belonging, power and status,” Hillary Herskowitz, founder and CEO of H2 Marketing Group, told SJ Denim. “[Consumers] continue to engage with it because controversy gives us a sense of control (especially when sharing our opinions)… but that doesn’t always translate to sales or increased foot traffic like we saw [with AE].”

With backlash mounting, AE eventually addressed the criticism in an Instagram post, clarifying that the campaign “Is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.”

But the saga didn’t end there. Today, AE announced a limited-edition collaboration with Tru Kolors by Travis Kelce—dropping just one day after the NFL star and global icon Taylor Swift revealed their engagement. The collection, which AE said has been more than a year in the making, was positioned as an extension of Kelce’s sportswear and lifestyle brand built on connection and self-expression.

Still, the timing is already drawing criticism. One TikTok user wrote, “Oh. Um… how did we go from hearing the most exciting and happy news yesterday to Travis supporting a company that ran a eugenics campaign? I’m not ok with this.” Another added, “As someone who studied advertising…these things take MONTHS if not years to come out. This is just snaky timing on AE’s end.”

“Signing on Travis Kelce isn’t so much a pivot as it is an expansion. He, no doubt, is part of the long-term effort to turn the campaign toward men’s clothing,” Baruch Labunski, CEO at digital marketing firm Rank Secure, told SJ Denim. “He is a good choice because he is a well-known football celebrity now engaged to Taylor Swift, who is incredibly popular with the target group of young women. In fact, the engagement announcement is almost too perfectly timed with the announcement of this ad campaign. Timing had to be coordinated.”

Calvin Klein (CK) is in the same boat as AE.

While the PVH-owned brand managed to avoid controversy this time—unlike its infamous 1980 ad starring 15-year-old Brooke Shields declaring “Nothing comes between me and my Calvins”—its latest effort still failed to resonate, Jones noted.

Earlier this month, Calvin Klein unveiled its Fall 2025 denim collection with a campaign fronted by Mingyu of K-pop group Seventeen. Unfortunately, the drop landed on the very same day Gap launched its headline-grabbing Katseye campaign.

“Dropping the Seventeen campaign the same day as Gap’s Katseye ad meant the attention economy was already spoken for,” Jones said. “Timing is everything, and Calvin’s push didn’t feel differentiated enough to cut through. It shows how even big brands with history can fail to spark conversation if they don’t align creative, timing and cultural context.”

Herskowitz agreed, adding that Calvin Klein has spent decades chasing the shock value of its most controversial campaigns but “keeps missing.”

“The Seventeen campaign felt like going through the motions rather than having something to say,” she said.

In contrast, Gap was striking gold.

Gap’s “Better in Denim” fall campaign starring rising global girl group Katseye was a unanimous hit.

The concept positions denim as a blank canvas for individuality and freedom of movement. All six Katseye members appear in head-to-toe denim, dancing with high energy to Kelis’s early-2000s hit “Milkshake.”

Like AE’s Sydney Sweeney ad, Gap’s campaign went viral—but this time for positive reasons.

As of today, the commercial had racked up more than 40.1 million views on Gap’s Instagram account and 3.9 million likes on TikTok, where fans are busy re-creating the dance. Launchmetrics also reported that the Katseye campaign reached an EMV of $1.7 million shortly after its launch, quickly becoming its most viral campaign.

One Instagram commenter captured the online mood: “I can’t wait to tell my children about the great denim wars of 2025,” to which another replied, “There is no war…Gap clocked AE fair and square.”

“Star power alone isn’t enough anymore. If it feels transactional, audiences tune out. Katseye work[s] because they’re believable extensions of the brands,” Jones said. “Denim is foundational in fashion, but when every brand is trying to own the same cultural spotlight in the same season, the noise drowns out weaker executions. That’s why Gap…broke through while American Eagle and Calvin Klein struggled to cut through.”

Levi’s, which recently launched a campaign starring country/pop star Shaboozey, is another brand managing to keep customers hooked.

According to Levi Strauss & Co.’s April earnings update, the company generated $1.53 billion in sales for the first quarter—up 3 percent on a reported basis and 9 percent on an organic basis versus Q1 2024. In Q2 of 2025, Levi’s reported $1.4 billion in sales and a 6 percent uplift in net revenue. CEO Michelle Gass even stated during a recent earnings call that “The Levi’s brand has never been stronger.”

“Gap and Levi’s share some common elements that work for them,” Labunski said. “Both lean on music and lifestyle storytelling rather than putting a single celebrity at the center. The ads feel authentic, and that matters—especially to Gen Z, which statistically doesn’t care as much about brands as it does about authenticity. That’s why Levi’s and Gap are connecting, while others are [struggling to get traction].”

In 2024, consumers (specifically Gen Z and millennials) went feral for celebrity-driven campaigns. Take 32-time Grammy Award winner and global icon Beyoncé, for example.

The investor believes a fairer price would be higher, but did not specify the amount.

San Francisco, July 02, 2025 — Think Investments LP, a significant shareholder with a 10.7% stake in TaskUs, Inc. (Nasdaq: TASK), has publicly opposed the company's proposed take-private transaction with Blackstone and TaskUs' founders. The investor, which holds 3.7 million Class A shares, has raised concerns about the $16.50 per share buyout price, stating that it undervalues the company [1].

Think Investments' opposition is detailed in a presentation that outlines several key points. The investor argues that the proposed transaction price substantially undervalues TaskUs. Their analysis of relevant comparable transactions and the company's recent operating outperformance indicates that a fair valuation for TaskUs is $25.00 per share, more than 50% above the proposed buyout price [1]. Additionally, TaskUs has significantly outperformed financial expectations since the announcement of the transaction, further warranting a re-rating [1].

The presentation also highlights the skewed process that led to the proposed transaction. Think Investments believes that the TaskUs Board of Directors' Special Committee failed to undertake a comprehensive process to determine a fair price for the company. The fairness opinion appears to deliberately and exclusively include precedent transactions and public comparables with low valuation multiples [1]. Notably, the most relevant precedent transaction, the acquisition of WNS by Capgemini, was omitted from the company's valuation materials. This transaction implies a fair value for TaskUs of approximately 12x LTM EBITDA, in contrast to the fairness opinion's 6.8x median precedent transaction multiple [1].

Think Investments also contends that the transaction would prevent minority shareholders from realizing TaskUs' significant value creation potential, particularly in AI services. AI Services constitute the fastest scaling portion of the business, with 65.5% YoY growth in H1'25. Coupled with strong momentum coming out of the first half of the year, Think Investments believes the transaction's contemplated price fails to compensate minority shareholders for the Company’s intrinsic value [1].

The transaction is conditioned on approval by a majority of the unaffiliated vote, and Think Investments' opposition could impact the vote's outcome. The investor plans to vote against the transaction, believing that TaskUs has significant value creation potential, particularly in AI services, and that minority shareholders would be prevented from realizing this upside [1].

(Aug. 27, 2025) — With the start of the school season officially upon us, many families across Michigan are feeling the financial pinch with their back-to-school shopping this year as the tariff-driven costs of school supplies, clothing, and everyday essentials continue to soar. Last week, in an effort to tackle these rising prices and help Michiganians save on their back-to-school shopping list, Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) introduced legislation to implement a Back-to-School tax holiday and allow residents to claim a refund for sales and use taxes paid on eligible purchases during an annual two-week period.

“The start of the new school season should be an exciting time, but thanks to skyrocketing prices fueled by Trump’s reckless tariffs, many families across the state are instead feeling the burden of trying to afford their back-to-school shopping list on top of their already increasing everyday expenses,” said Sen. Irwin. “From helping them save on backpacks and notebooks to new shoes for their kiddos, this legislation would not only deliver economic relief that Michiganians need — it would also ensure our students are set up for success in the classroom from day one.”

With tariff-driven inflation on the rise, many major retailers, like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Amazon, and Costco, have announced their plans to continue increasing prices. And, the burden of ballooning prices is already being felt across the country, with about 20% of back-to-school shoppers saying buying supplies for the new year is straining their budgets, according to one recently released report, and a separate report showing that 39% of parents can’t afford their back-to-school shopping altogether.

83% of women CFOs say automation, particularly AI, is enabling new expertise and pathways into finance leadership

75% of women finance leaders identify digital literacy and strategic leadership as important skills for the future CFO role; yet only 24% rely significantly on AI tools today.

BIRMINGHAM, Mich., Aug. 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Leading enterprise finance management platform, OneStream, today released the findings from a global study of 1,146 finance leaders, professionals, and business executives. The research explores the measurable business value of diversity in finance leadership, the routes to achieving the CFO role, barriers women face on the path to CFO, and the accelerators that help them advance.

The report – entitled ""The Glass Chair"" -- shows that women CFOs are not only driving strong business results but are also helping shape the skills and capabilities required for the future of finance leadership. Companies led by women CFOs deliver an average 4.5% annualized shareholder return, outperforming industry benchmarks by approximately 0.2% per year across Europe, the UK, and the US.

Notably, these findings are consistent with earlier independent research from S&P Global Market Intelligence study which found that companies appointing women CFOs generated 6% higher profitability and 8% higher stock returns in the first 24 months post-appointment.

Part of the ongoing Finance 2035 Initiative, the study found that women are prioritizing the capabilities most critical for tomorrow's CFO role. Eighty-three percent of women CFOs say automation – especially AI -- is enabling different types of expertise to enter the role, and three-quarters identify digital literacy and strategic leadership as essential skills for the future.

""The data is clear: advancing women into CFO roles enhances innovation, competitiveness and modernizes a critical business function,"" said Pam McIntyre, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller, OneStream. ""At a time where CFOs are being asked to do more and navigate increasing complexity, women leaders are accelerating digital transformation, outperforming benchmarks and bringing strategic and leadership skillsets businesses need to thrive in an uncertain future.""

Broader Experience, Deeper Impact

The research reveals that women take longer and less linear routes to the CFO seat — averaging 18 years at Global Fortune 500 and 20 years in the FTSE 100. Along the way, they change roles and companies more frequently, and according to the LinkedIn analysis in the study, 35% of women CFOs in the sample group have backgrounds that reflect a non-linear career trajectory, including operating or cross-functional roles outside of core finance.

As a result, women often have a broader enterprise-wide perspective, deeper operational acumen, and stronger leadership experience for the CFO role. This positions them to balance financial strategy with people development, risk management, and cross-business collaboration — all qualities critical to the modern CFO.

Skills that Define the Future CFO

The research shows that women CFOs are more likely to align with leadership personas that emphasize financial governance, strategic planning, and team development, defined as:

The Strategic Architect – balancing long-term finance planning with executive team development

The Financial Guardian – emphasizing transparency, governance, and risk management

These qualities align directly with the skills most needed for today's CFOs, as today's finance leaders embrace AI and automation to free up capacity for strategic guidance and decision-making.

Women are also helping lead in digital adoption. Most cite (83%) that automation is enabling different expertise to enter the role, and three-quarters identify digital literacy and strategic leadership as the top skills for the future. Nearly 70% report that technology has already helped equalize opportunities, while many also point to data analytics and cybersecurity as essential capabilities for tomorrow's CFO.

The study highlights powerful opportunity: While 73% of women are eager to build AI skills, only 24% expect to rely significantly on AI tools today, according to our recent pulse survey on Finance Talent. Women finance leaders' focus on transparency, governance, and risk management offers one reason why they've been slower to adopt more generic AI toolsets, which lack the context, accuracy, and transparency required for effective financial decisions and performance. Closing this gap in AI transparency and accuracy is one of the fastest ways for women to build confidence and competence in AI adoption across finance — and an accelerant to empowering women leaders who already demonstrate competencies in other areas critical to the future CFO role.

The Rising Value of Women in Finance Leadership

While women CFOs bring the diverse skillsets, resilience, and enterprise-wide perspective that the modern CFO role demands, many cited several structural barriers that slowed their progression, despite them being capable for the CFO role. These include economic downturns disrupting organizational structures, complex workplace politics, limited access to mentorship, challenges balancing work and personal life, and skills gaps within finance teams.

These barriers delay advancement and in doing so, postpone the value businesses could be capturing sooner. Companies that prioritize breaking down these obstacles will unlock leaders who not only deliver higher returns, but also bring broader skillsets needed to steer finance into the future

About the Study

The Glass Chair study is the latest installment in OneStream's research exploring the future of finance leadership. Following the global Finance 2035 study – conducted with 1,500 business leaders and 500 investors across six countries – The Glass Chair builds on those insights with a focused examination of women in senior finance roles. Conducted between February and July 2025 in partnership with Man Bites Dog, the study combines economic analysis of more than 100 publicly traded companies, opinion research among 700 senior finance professionals across the US, UK, France, Germany, and Australia, and LinkedIn career data from 346 CFOs worldwide from the Fortune Global 500 and FTSE 100.

To enrich these findings, OneStream convened an advisory board of senior women in finance to provide context and perspectives to contribute a qualitative dimension to the research. Together, these findings offer a comprehensive view of the progress of women CFOs, the pathways to leadership and the business value of diversity in finance leadership.

On August 27, 2025, at 10:45, Cushman & Wakefield's 15-minute chart analysis revealed a significant technical indicator event: a KDJ Golden Cross, accompanied by a Bullish Marubozu pattern. This development suggests a notable shift in the momentum of the stock price towards an upward trajectory, with potential for further growth.

The KDJ Golden Cross, a technical indicator that combines the moving averages of the Kijun-sen, Tenkan-sen, and Senkou Span B, signals a shift from a bearish to a bullish trend [1]. The Bullish Marubozu candle, characterized by its lack of wicks and a full body, further supports this bullish trend, indicating strong buying pressure [2]. The combination of these technical indicators suggests that buyers are in control of the market, potentially leading to continued upward movement in the stock price.

Investors should closely monitor Cushman & Wakefield's stock price and technical indicators to make informed decisions. The recent technical signals suggest a potential uptrend in the short term. The dominance of buyers in the market suggests that bullish momentum is likely to continue.

The revision reflects Barclays' positive assessment of Tesco's recent financial performance and strategic direction, although operational challenges and market volatility remain factors for consideration.

The revised price target from Barclays follows an earlier adjustment in October 2024, when the target was raised from 375p to 405p.

That initial increase was spurred by Tesco’s first-half performance in the 2024-25 fiscal year, where retail EBIT and retail free cash flow surpassed consensus estimates. The robust figures prompted management to elevate its annual target for retail EBIT, signaling internal confidence in sustained performance.

On Tuesday, following the target increase, Tesco shares rose over 1%, closing at 432p per share. However, the stock has declined 0.9% so far on Wednesday, now at 428.1p.

Nvidia’s China revenues have been an issue since the Biden administration restricted the sale of advanced artificial intelligence chips in the country in 2022.

UBS’s Timothy Arcuri says the inclusion of China sales could lift Nvidia’s forecast by as much as $3 billion.

The firm’s on-again, off-again sales in the word’s largest market for semiconductors have been a source of confusion for Wall Street. Third-quarter revenue projections for the company are roughly $15 billion apart, twice the difference between the highest and lowest estimates in the second quarter and the widest in percentage terms in at least a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Nvidia’s China revenues have been an issue since the Biden administration restricted the sale of advanced artificial intelligence chips in the country in 2022. But they’ve been further complicated under President Donald Trump, who stopped chip sales to China in April, then reversed the order earlier this month on the condition that the US government gets 15% of the proceeds.

And now Beijing is reportedly urging local companies to avoid using Nvidia’s less-advanced H20 processors.

“It does complicate the setup,” heading into results, said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager of equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “The uncertainty to me is going to be centered around if they’re able to guide to some inclusion of China-based revenues or not, and whether or not that matches up with consensus estimates.”

The back and forth over Nvidia’s China sales are causing headaches for Wall Street analysts. For example, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland is refusing to put sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips, which were designed for China, back into his model. UBS’s Timothy Arcuri says the inclusion of China sales could lift Nvidia’s forecast by as much as $3 billion.

Investors are already skittish about chipmakers’ exposure to China. Several weeks ago, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares tumbled more than 6% after the company failed to deliver a clear outlook for its Chinese sales, overshadowing generally solid guidance for the business.

AI Spending Clues

As the biggest beneficiary of the AI craze, Nvidia’s earnings will also be closely watched for a read into spending on the technology.

“Investors expect both the results and the guidance to be a couple billion better than consensus,” said Brian Colello, equity strategist at Morningstar Investment Services. “There’s so much fast money in the market, if there’s just a headline number that doesn’t live up that will likely cause a volatile reaction one way or the other.”

In addition, the report could have major implications for the broader market, given Nvidia’s stature as the world’s most valuable company. With a $4.4 trillion market capitalization, it has an 8.1% weighting in the S&P 500 Index, meaning the stock has the power to swing the entire market. Options traders are pricing in a move of about 6% in either direction for Nvidia shares the day after results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Wall Street expects Nvidia to report $46.2 billion in revenue for the second quarter and adjusted earnings per share of $1.01, both up roughly 50% from the same period a year ago. For the third quarter, consensus estimates project revenue of about $53.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21.

Analysts and investors are eagerly awaiting Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang’s remarks on China, including the development of the B30 chip, which could replace the H20 chip. Of course, Chinese sales aren’t the biggest story for Nvidia, as demand for its Blackwell chips in other markets appears to be so strong that Nvidia could beat estimates without any contribution from the country.

That said, with the chipmaker’s stock price less than 1% from a record high and up 35% since its first quarter earnings report in May, a strong China outlook could be key to keeping the rally going.

“The overall story in Nvidia can still play out with everything else going on,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC, adding that any inclusion of revenue from China is “just icing on a cake.”

Tech Chart of the Day

Chinese AI chip designer Cambricon Technologies Corp., which competes with Huawei Technologies Co. to provide accelerators for developing and hosting AI models, swung to a record profit in the first half. Its results reflect a wave of demand for Chinese chips after Beijing encouraged the use of homegrown technology in a post-DeepSeek AI boom.

Fulton for sale.","The owner of a loft office building near the doorstep to the Fulton Market District has put the property on the market with just more than a year to go before a deadline to pay off its mortgage.

A venture led by Glencoe-based investor Randy Rissman has hired brokers from Cushman & Wakefield to seek a buyer for the nine-story office building at 600 W. Fulton St., according to a marketing flyer. The Rissman venture has owned the 214,768-square-foot property at the northwest corner of Fulton and Jefferson streets since buying it for $31.7 million in late 2006, according to Cook County property records.

There is no asking price listed for the building, but it is almost certainly worth less than that amount today amid weakened demand for workspace and elevated interest rates. Despite the property's location sandwiched between a major public transportation hub and one of the city's trendiest corporate destinations in Fulton Market, many institutional investors and lenders have been wary of pursuing office deals anywhere in Chicago.

That makes it a difficult time to test the market for Rissman, who made his fortune years ago from the creation of toys such as Furby and Giga Pets. It's unclear what prompted him to put the property up for sale against that ugly backdrop, and a spokeswoman for the building's ownership did not provide a comment. But the offering comes as the Rissman entity stares down a November 2026 maturity date on a $27 million loan it borrowed from Lincoln National Life Insurance when it refinanced the building in 2016, property records show.

Sources familiar with the building said Rissman's venture is expected to receive bids close to $20 million, or under $100 per square foot. It's unclear whether Lincoln would accept a sale at a price below the loan balance, and a spokeswoman for the lender's Radnor, Pa.-based parent company said in a statement that Lincoln does not ""comment on the details of individual real estate investments.""

Several landlords of prominent downtown office buildings have explored sales ahead of loan maturities, hoping buyers might emerge at prices that would allow them and their lenders to avoid a lengthy foreclosure process. Among other examples, Boston-based Beacon Capital Partners and its lender, U.S. Bank, are both poised to endure financial blows with the sale of a 40-story office building at 190 S. LaSalle St.

Making Rissman's Fulton Street property a tougher sell is that the building is just 58% leased, according to the Cushman flyer, below the record-low 73% average for downtown office buildings. The property has eight tenants and a weighted average lease term of 4.2 years, a measurement of tenants' remaining lease commitments to the building.

Design, engineering and construction firm Epstein Global is the largest tenant, according to a source familiar with the building, with a lease for just under 43,000 square feet across the top two floors that expires in 2029.

Cushman frames the listing as an opportunity for a new owner to buy the property at a discount and lease it up, taking advantage of its proximity to the vibrant Fulton Market neighborhood and $10.5 million that Rissman's venture has poured into building renovations over the past decade.

Office properties in desirable locations with modern amenities have largely outperformed the rest of the local office market in the wake of the pandemic. The Rissman entity most recently redesigned the lobby and tenant amenity spaces in 2022, according to the flyer.

The building was originally built around the turn of the 20th century as the Sears Roebuck & Co. headquarters and distribution center and was converted into a loft office building in 1982, according to Cushman.

Rissman sold Tiger Electronics to Hasbro in 1998 for $335 million and since then has invested in Chicago real estate, among other ventures. He leads an entity that purchased the office property at 220 N. Green St. in Fulton Market for $40.8 million in early 2018, according to property records, a redevelopment mostly occupied today by co-working provider Workbox.

Another Rissman venture owns the office building at 500 Davis St. in north suburban Evanston, which it purchased for $32.3 million in 2018, records show.

The Philips Hue Play Wall Washer is a substantial upgrade for anyone running a Hue Sync Entertainment setup. Its broad, vivid gradients and impressive brightness leave the likes of the Hue Light Bar trailing, and the sculptural aluminum design actually works in plain sight. It’s not a budget product - in classic Hue fashion - and it reaches its full potential only if you’re fully embedded in the Hue ecosystem with a Sync Box or the Sync app on your TV. For those already committed though, it’s one of Signify’s most striking ambient lighting options yet.

Pros

Slick design

Fantastic lighting effects

Amazing Hue Sync performance

Great brightness and control

Cons

Premium price tag

Need Hue Sync for full experience

Ugly power brick and cable

Key Features

Three lights Individually controlled, the three integrated lights can cover a wall in colour.

Compatible with Hue HDMI Sync box Can be used in your entertainment setup.

Introduction

Signify officially unveiled the Philips Hue Play Wall Washer back in June; a compact smart lamp aimed at creating eye-catching lighting effects without taking up much space.

The Wall Washer is available in black or white, priced at $219.99 for a single unit or $384.99 for a two-pack in the US, or £169.99 / £299.99 in the UK. While this places it at the premium end of the Hue range, it comes with the ColorCast projection optics first seen on last year’s Twilight bedside lamp.

The wide-beam ColorCast system can either project gradients you set manually in the Hue app, or react in real time to whatever you’re watching or playing on a TV when paired with a Hue Play Sync Box or the Hue Sync app.

Design and build

Three light sources

Available in black or white

The Play Wall Washer is meant to be seen, not hidden. Its matte aluminum body, frosted projection window, and sculptural profile make it feel more like modern décor than a tech gadget.

The white version (tested here for this review) fits neatly into minimalist spaces, while the black variant should blend easily with darker AV setups.

Turn that slick design around and inside the frosted window are three LED modules, each angled slightly differently. These work together to create the wide, blended gradient effect that defines the fixture.

The light-facing side is elegant, but the rear is more utilitarian and not something you want on display, or even close to eye level for long periods.

Measuring 15.7cm tall and 9.1cm wide, and weighing 0.85 kg, it’s compact enough for most AV or gaming setups without taking over. Build quality is solid, though the lack of braided cables that we’ve seen on the likes of the Hue Iris is a shame. Instead it’s the regular rubberised cables, which is a bit of a disappointment, and you’ll want to hide them from view.

Power comes from the same chunky three-port adapter used with the Hue HDMI Sync Box. It can power up to three wall washers at once, which is convenient, but means multiple units need to be within reach of the same block. UK and EU adapters are included in the retail box.

Features and performance

Bluetooth or Bridge support

Compatible with Hue HDMI Sync Box

Setting up the Wall Washer follows Hue’s familiar routine. You can pair it directly via Bluetooth for a quick start, which gives access to most of the app’s color and brightness controls.

However, for the full Hue experience – including scenes, automations, and Hue Sync features – pairing with a Hue Bridge is necessary. The good news is that setup is straightforward; simply scan the QR code, connect to your Bridge, assign a room or zone, give it a name, and you’re ready in a few minutes.

Hue bulbs can also connect via Zigbee through compatible Amazon smart speakers, including the likes of the 3rd-gen Echo Show 8, Echo Hub, and Echo Show 21. This allows Alexa integration without needing the Hue skill.

Once paired, you have two main ways to use the Wall Washer – as a regular ambient smart lamp or as part of a Hue Sync Entertainment area.

In the former, the Wall Washer behaves like a standard Hue White and Color Ambiance light. You get full control over 2000–6500K white temperature, plus an expansive colour palette.

Each of the three LED modules can display different colors, allowing for instant gradient effects that look fantastic beamed onto a wall.

Brightness can be adjusted per LED or for the entire unit, or you can also use Hue’s built-in scenes and effects, making the Wall Washer a strong mood light even without media syncing.

But in order to fully maximise the Wall Washer experience you’ll want to get them setup with your Hue Sync Entertainment zone.

You can create a new Entertainment area or add it to an existing one. It will sync in real time with your content via the Hue Play HDMI Sync Box or the Hue Sync app on compatible LG and Samsung TVs (or gaming PCs).

Placement is easy with the Hue app’s 3D drag-and-drop tool, allowing you to set height, orientation, and distance from the wall.

If you pull the fixture back, you cover a wider area or move it closer for a more focused beam. Each of the three LED modules reacts individually to on-screen content, producing smooth, cinematic color transitions that are far superior to the single-zone Hue Light Bar.

It’s a fantastic effect and perhaps the best option I’ve tested so far with regards to Hue Sync-ing.

Brightness, as a regular smart lamp is superb, at 1,035 lumens in cool white at 4,000K, which is roughly double the Light Bar’s output.

With Hue Sync active, the ColorCast optics create vivid wall gradients that track games, movies, and music in real time.

The transitions are smooth, cinematic, and immersive, rather than segmented or harsh, delivering a more refined experience than cheaper competitors.

Outside of Sync, it still performs brilliantly as a standard Hue lamp, with the full 2000–6500 K range, high color accuracy (CRI ≥ 80), and access to all the usual Hue scenes and effects.

It’s also very cool how you can create your own effects, splitting the Wall Washer into three different segments and creating amazing effects on a wall. You can even edit Hue’s preset effects to have movement, ripples, flickers and the like too.

A single Wall Washer can also double as a nifty sunrise wake-up light on your nightstand. You can use the Hue app’s built-in automations to have the lamp gradually brighten and cool its colour temperature, mimicking a sunrise to gently wake you up by a specific time.

Final Thoughts

The Hue Play Wall Washer delivers on almost every front: premium design, wide gradient projection, strong brightness, and the versatility to serve as both a mood light and a reactive Entertainment fixture.

As a standalone lamp, it adds color and warmth with style. In Entertainment mode, it transforms a room into an immersive visual experience.

As is often the case with Hue, the price remains the biggest barrier. Govee’s Uplighter Floor Lamp offers a broad range of effects at a similar price, while the Lifx Luna can create a comparable wall wash effect for less than half the cost.

Neither, however, integrates with Hue Sync, meaning they can’t match the seamless, real-time syncing that makes the Wall Washer so compelling for existing Hue users.

For those already invested in Hue, this is one of the most rewarding upgrades you can add to your AV or gaming setup.",https://www.trustedreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/08/hue-wall-washer-hero.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:12:52.960060

The AI-powered robots have been successfully used in real production environments for years, the company said.. They are designed to automate tasks like sorting, palletising, and depalletising – relieving warehouse staff from repetitive and physically demanding work. The robots are deployed rapidly as a performance-based service, without requiring a large upfront investment, an approach challenging traditional automation models.

Now, Rebl explained it is entering a new phase with comprehensive agreements with H&M and IKEA. Since the summer of 2024, H&M has been using Rebl's robots at its Nordics online sales warehouse in Sweden. This combination of process supporting technology and teamwork has produced positive results, by enhancing production predictability and efficiency. More locations are planned to follow, Rebl added.

To accelerate its global expansion, Rebl Industries has appointed Nicholas Tengelin, a seasoned executive from the automotive industry, having held senior leadership roles at Volvo Cars, Hedin Mobility Group and Hogia, as its first external CEO. His mandate is to rapidly scale and industrialise Rebl's position as the global leader in next-generation robotics.

“We're excited to partner with international companies like H&M and IKEA. Our AI-powered robots quickly step into warehouse operations, supporting a decrease in repetitive tasks for employees and an increase in overall efficiency. This game-changing technology opens new automation possibilities for sectors previously unable to leverage robotics,” says Nicholas Tengelin, CEO of Rebl Industries.

Rebl offers RaaS agreements, which the company says holds the unique advantage that customers pay for the work performed rather than the hardware itself. The robots, equipped with proprietary software, AI, and advanced sensors, can identify, pick, move, and load unsorted goods of varying sizes and packaging in real time. They feature an intuitive interface for human interaction and are part of a neural network that enables shared learning, continuously improving their performance.

Founded in 2018, Rebl Industries operates out of Gothenburg, Borås, and Skövde in Sweden. Since 2021, the company has been backed by the privately owned Pulsen Group, led by Jonus Bartholdson.

In line with the global shift towards diversification and strategic realignment, India is actively pursuing a diversified trade strategy to sustain its resilient trade performance, the ministry said.
Earlier this month, S&P Global upgraded India’s sovereign ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB-', after a gap of 18 years.
The deregulation efforts by the states, such as lifting restrictions on women working night shifts and improving the ease of doing business, will further enhance productivity and stimulate economic growth, it said.","The downside risks to global growth are likely to keep international commodity prices in check, partly offsetting the impact of higher tariffs, but the ongoing India-US trade negotiations is crucial to curtail the risks to India's growth, the finance ministry said on Wednesday.

In this Monthly Economic Review for July report, the ministry said that while the immediate impact of recent US tariffs on Indian exports may appear limited, their secondary and tertiary effects on the economy pose challenges that must be addressed. ""In this context, the ongoing India-US trade negotiations will be crucial,"" it said.

While near-term risks to economic activity, principally exports and capital formation, remain due to tariff-related uncertainties, the government and the private sector, acting in tandem and concert, can keep the disruptions to a minimum, the ministry noted, adding that setbacks eventually make us ""stronger and more agile"", if handled properly.

""If the near-term economic pain is absorbed more by those who have the ability and the financial strength to do so, then small and medium enterprises in downstream industries will emerge stronger from the trade imbroglio. Now is the time to demonstrate an understanding of national interest,"" said the ministry.

In line with the global shift towards diversification and strategic realignment, India is actively pursuing a diversified trade strategy to sustain its resilient trade performance, the ministry said. This includes the recently concluded FTA with the UK and EFTA and ongoing FTA negotiations with the US, EU, New Zealand, Chile, and Peru. ""But, these initiatives will take time to show results and may not fully address the shortfall in exports to the United States that may arise if the current tariff rates on India persist,"" said the ministry.

On the domestic front, aided by above-normal precipitation and better sowing of kharif crops, the headline inflation may remain moderate in the near term. An increased market arrival in Q1, comfortable buffer stocks and better output prospects, coupled with stable global oil markets, might keep the prices of food grain moderate, the ministry noted.

The government is proactively managing risks and seizing opportunities by strengthening domestic capacity, promoting exports, diversifying supply chains and securing alternate import sources, it added.

To enhance economic growth amidst the challenging global landscape, the creation of a Task Force for next-generation reforms aims at further simplifying regulations, lowering compliance costs, and fostering a more enabling environment for start-ups, MSMEs, and entrepreneurs, the ministry said.

Second, the planned rollout of the GST reforms in the coming months, with an emphasis on reducing the tax burden on essential items, is expected to provide direct relief to households and boost consumption demand, it said. ""Complementing these measures, the rating upgrade (by S&P Global) is anticipated to reduce the borrowing costs, attract greater foreign capital inflows, widen the access to global capital markets, boost disposable income, reduce inflationary pressures, cut input costs for businesses, and support growth."" Earlier this month, S&P Global upgraded India’s sovereign ratings to 'BBB' from 'BBB-', after a gap of 18 years.

Amid global uncertainties, these government initiatives are charting a growth trajectory driven by long-term reforms that will boost disposable income, reduce inflationary pressures, and reduce costs for businesses, the ministry noted.

The deregulation efforts by the states, such as lifting restrictions on women working night shifts and improving the ease of doing business, will further enhance productivity and stimulate economic growth, it said.

On liquidity, the ministry said that favourable financial conditions in the economy support domestic activity. ""Sufficient liquidity in the banking system has facilitated the transmission of the policy repo rate cuts to the credit markets, and the overall flow of financial resources to the commercial sector has remained at almost similar levels during April-July 2025 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year,"" it said.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/08/20250827093046_Modi-Trump-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:14:08.407997

According to Barclays strategists, the collapse in volatility has spurred an “institutional equity buying spree,” lifting exposures in the U.S. above average, although analysts warn that September’s seasonality remains a headwind.

Flows have tilted toward bonds and short-duration credit as investors price in lower U.S. rates.

“As U.S. rate cut expectations gathered steam, credit and short duration inflows have picked up, with long-only (LO) and CTA positioning showing a preference for bonds over equities,” strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote.

Still, the record $7.2 trillion sitting in money market funds provides what the bank called “dry powder to keep buying dips” alongside steady buyback activity.

Strategists also pointed out that nearly half of the 2025 buyback authorizations have yet to be executed, with repurchases typically picking up in September.

They note a nascent broadening in market participation, with lagging sectors in U.S. non-Big Tech and overseas equities outperforming on Fed cut hopes, geopolitical easing and better data.

In Europe, cyclical laggards rallied on improved PMIs and Ukraine peace talks, narrowing the gap with defensives. Yet positioning in high-beta and short-cycle names remains cautious, leaving scope for further upside if momentum holds.

Rotation trends are also changing across regions. U.S. investors and CTAs have turned sellers of Europe, redirecting flows into American markets, while France has become a weak spot with outflows tied to political risk.

Domestic European investors remain the main buyers, while Germany’s inflows have moderated.

Meanwhile, inflows into Japan are holding up, and foreign demand for Chinese equities continues despite broader emerging-market outflows.

Barclays cautions that the Fed’s support could backfire if labor market conditions deteriorate. A rise in unemployment would likely slow equity inflows and risk unwinding household allocations.

For now, resilient activity data and positive earnings revisions underpin the bank’s overweight call on equities, though the analysts stress that “positioning risk is more two-sided now” given how far exposure has already risen.

They add that index volatility remains subdued, making hedges relatively cheap and providing investors with tools to manage both upside and downside risks.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEL730R1_L.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:01:55.210530

Albertsons on Tuesday named Sunil Gopinath as CEO of Albertsons Companies India, its new global technology and innovation center located in Bengaluru.

Albertsons Cos. India will serve as the grocery company’s global innovation hub, helping the U.S. and Manila, Philippines, teams collaborate on technology solutions and develop proprietary, AI- and data-driven solutions aimed at boosting the customer experience, according to the announcement. The center is run by a subsidiary of Albertsons.

Albertsons said the new center marks a strategic investment in developing scalable technology solutions to fuel the company’s growth.

Gopinath will lead the development of the Bengaluru center, which will onboard workers over the next 18 months. “Bengaluru’s rich talent pool in retail technology and thriving innovation ecosystem make it an ideal location for this journey,” he said.

In July, The Times of India reported that Albertsons employs roughly 300 people in India and is looking to hire nearly 1,000 employees in the next 18 months.

At the start of the year, Albertsons confirmed to BoiseDev that it held corporate layoffs with plans to move some roles to other countries.

Gopinath brings over 25 years of experience in building and scaling global technology operations to the CEO role. Prior to joining Albertsons, Gopinath worked at cash-back shopping platform Rakuten for nearly a decade, according to his LinkedIn profile. He has also worked for Qualcomm, Intel, eBay and Flipkart.

“[Gopinath’s] deep expertise in scaling innovation hubs and leading transformative digital initiatives makes him the ideal leader to shape our Bengaluru global capability center into a powerhouse of retail technology,” Albertsons Chief Technology and Transformation Officer Anuj Dhanda said in a statement.

Establishing a technology center in India is the latest move by Albertsons this year to bolster its operations as the company charts a new future after its failed attempt to merge with Kroger. In February, Albertsons confirmed it was undergoing a division restructuring that included combining its Intermountain and Denver divisions into a new division called the Mountain West Division. In May, Susan Morris took over the CEO role from Vivek Sankaran.

The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open this month, surveyed 600 telemedicine patients across five states: Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder. The drug reduces a patient’s cravings for opioids and reduces the likelihood of a fatal overdose.

The most common reason that patients had trouble was that buprenorphine was unavailable at the pharmacy, followed by coverage-related issues and the pharmacy’s hesitancy in filling a telemedicine prescription.

Previous research has shown that some pharmacists, fearing scrutiny, hesitate to dispense buprenorphine, which is a controlled substance. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say people with opioid use disorder “who need buprenorphine [should be] able to access it without undue delay,” the authors note.

Roughly half of the patients who participated in the survey were covered by Medicaid. A majority of patients had been in treatment for at least six months, and half lived in rural areas.

The analysis didn’t find statistically significant differences between patients in rural and non-rural areas. But the authors noted that the study only surveyed participants from those five states, and results might be different in other ones.

In general, they noted, patients living in rural areas might have a harder time finding buprenorphine and other opioid use disorder drugs at a pharmacy because there are fewer pharmacies in rural areas.

The study underscores recent data suggesting a lack of access to opioid use disorder medication. An analysis released last year by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2022, only a quarter of people with opioid use disorder received recommended medications. About 4% of U.S. adults have opioid use disorder.

Other research has shown many pharmacies lack buprenorphine. Two studies found that between 42% and 51% of U.S. pharmacies did not have buprenorphine in stock, and availability varied widely across states.

The JAMA Network Open study was led by Workit Health, a telemedicine addiction treatment app that operates in four of the states included in the survey.

Johnson & Johnson has signed a $2 billion deal to secure space at Fujifilm Biotechnologies’ Holly Springs, North Carolina, facility, as part of a larger strategy to invest heavily in U.S. manufacturing in the coming years.

The 10-year deal will expand the biopharma giant’s manufacturing capacity with a new 160,000-plus-square-foot facility, according to a news release. It will also create 120 jobs in the Raleigh area.

The investment is part of a larger $55 billion commitment to support U.S. manufacturing, technology and research and development projects over the next four years. J&J said it plans to share more expansion details in the coming months.

Dive Insight:

J&J and Regeneron will be some of the first tenants of Fujifilm Biotechnologies’ Holly Springs facility when it opens later this year.

The recent deal allows J&J to manufacture “the vast majority” of its advanced medicines in the United States to meet national demand, the New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company said. J&J manufactures medicines for the oncology, immunology, neuroscience and cardiopulmonary fields, according to its website.

Currently, J&J operates 23 U.S. facilities, comprising about a third of its global manufacturing footprint, according to its 2024 annual report. The company has been building out its domestic operations as tariffs complicate international trade and more tax incentives become available for manufacturers that do business in the U.S.

“It’s hard to know what is going to happen ultimately with tariffs,” J&J CEO Joaquin Duato said during a July 16 earnings call. “But what we do know for sure is that the tax policies that just passed are already creating American jobs and driving innovation.”

The current administration’s tax law enhanced manufacturers’ ability to deduct business expenses for costs related to domestic R&D and certain production properties.

Fujifilm Biotechnologies’ Holly Springs facility will be the company’s largest cell culture biopharmaceutical facility for contract development and manufacturing organization manufacturing in North America, according to its website. Parent company Fujifilm has invested more than $3.2 billion into the project so far, with plans to bring 1,400 jobs to the area by 2031.

Earlier this year, Regeneron, a manufacturer of large bulk drugs, inked a $3 billion supply deal with Fujifilm Biotechnologies that is expected to nearly double its U.S. manufacturing capacity as tariffs stir global tensions.

Last month, President Donald Trump threatened tariffs of up to 250% on pharmaceutical imports over the next year and a half. However, this is likely to vary by country. Most recently, the U.S. struck a deal to cap its tariffs at 15% for EU pharmaceuticals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/j1NB8WJAPwcKQOyNey7wbiuXXeYX9XjzA8rCkt_38Ok/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ib2xseS1TcHJpbmdzLU5DLUFwcmlsLTIwMjUuanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-27 17:07:52.015144

The FBI says false calls are not only costly to law enforcement, but also to the mental health of those directly affected by them.

Just last week, , as well as

Over the weekend, the received a false bomb threat, and the

Monday, several similar calls occurred:

Regardless of the severity of the situation, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers says law enforcement is always ready to respond.

""You constantly get called thinking you could die on this call, and it keeps being a false alarm. You know, you never solve those issues inside you.""

The false reports at UTC and the Chattanooga Airport led to temporary lockdowns. But the affects of those calls could last for some.

Vince Champion. Regional Director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, says it leaves some fearful of what may come next.

""What is the reason? Are they just pulling a prank? Are they trying to call to get us to go to one area, so they can go do a crime in another area? Are they testing to see what law enforcement response time is?""

Champion says regardless of the reason, law enforcement must treat the call like the real deal.

""We have to respond. We have to answer. There has to be some type of response, because the one time we don't, that would be the one that would be the real one, and would cause some mass casualties.""

According to providing false information to emergency service agencies like calling in a bomb threat can lead to a prison sentence of up to 5 years.

FBI officials tell us...

“The FBI is seeing an increase in swatting events across the country, and we take potential hoax threats very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk. Knowingly providing false information to emergency service agencies about a possible threat to life drains law enforcement resources, costs thousands of dollars, and, most importantly, puts innocent people at risk.""

Champion says these situations hurt everyone involved.

""I just wish people would find another way to amuse themselves other than scaring everyday citizens who are trying to live and taking cops away from doing their job.""

says these threats of violence can affect the mental health of students as well.

In Australia, the demand for strong, secure, and flexible software has only gone up.

The numbers prove it. In 2024, the Australian software market touched $15.7 billion. By 2030, it’s expected to cross $40 billion. That’s not a small bump — it’s a massive jump, driven by businesses that want custom systems, cloud platforms, and enterprise tools built for scale.

Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane are leading this shift. Global giants have set up strong bases here, and homegrown players are expanding fast. For a business, the real question is simple — who do you trust to build your software backbone?

Enterprises often bring them in for large transformation journeys, when the goal isn’t just “new software” but a full modernization of IT systems. Their focus is on long-term partnerships rather than one-off builds.

5. HCLTech

HCLTech is engineering-driven at its core. In Australia, they specialize in custom enterprise platforms for manufacturing, retail, and finance.

Their edge comes from applying new tech in practical ways like IoT-enabled systems, AI-driven dashboards, and scalable enterprise tools. They also stand out for post-deployment support, ensuring clients get stability alongside innovation.

6. IBM

IBM has been around for more than a century, and it remains a heavyweight in Australia. They’re not the go-to for small app, their focus is large-scale, secure, and compliance-heavy software.

Governments, banks, and healthcare providers rely on IBM when complexity is high, whether it’s hybrid cloud platforms, AI engines, or blockchain-based systems.

7. Infosys

Infosys is well known in Australia for consulting and software delivery. Their strength is process, making sure projects stay on track and bring efficiency.

They serve industries like telecom, finance, and energy, delivering custom enterprise software and modernization projects. For businesses that want tried-and-tested expertise, Infosys is a safe choice.

8. Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra blends innovation with stability. In Australia, they’re big in telecom and logistics industries that move fast and need real-time systems.

They bring in next-gen tools like 5G-ready platforms, IoT, and AI integrations. Their balance of experimentation and reliable delivery makes them a trusted partner.

9. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)

TCS is one of the largest IT companies in the world, and in Australia they play a huge role. Their strength lies in scale plus customization.

They can handle multi-country projects, yet still adapt software to local Australian needs. Energy, banking, and logistics firms often choose TCS for their ability to deliver long-term, stable software ecosystems.

10. Wipro

Wipro has been delivering IT and software services since 1945. In Australia, they’re strong in software development, cybersecurity, and cloud integration.

They also bring a sustainability-first mindset, designing platforms that aren’t just fit for today but adaptable for years ahead. That future-proofing is what makes them stand out.

Conclusion

Australia’s software industry is growing fast — and the companies listed above are at the heart of it. Some are global giants with decades of experience, while others are newer firms pushing innovation. Each brings a different strength to the table.

For businesses, the choice depends on what matters most.

If scale and reliability are critical, firms like Appinventiv, Accenture, IBM, and TCS stand out.

If innovation and speed are the priority, Appinventiv and Tech Mahindra are strong bets.

If industry knowledge is key, Appinventiv, Infosys, HCLTech, and Wipro are often preferred.

What’s clear is this — the need for secure, custom, and enterprise-ready software in Australia will only get bigger. Companies that choose the right partner now will be better placed to move faster, stay compliant, and keep their systems ready for the future.",https://programminginsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Software-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:04:27.425537

The exit of its investment in Bold Orange by Mountaingate represents yet another highly successful outcome for Mountaingate in a tech-enabled and analytics-driven services platform. Mountaingate partnered with Bold Orange and its Founder/CEO, Margaret Murphy, in 2018, to support the growth and development of the business from its inception. Today, Bold Orange has expanded to over 160 employees and serves a blue-chip client base across multiple highly attractive end markets, including manufacturers & dealer networks, financial services, healthcare, software, and multi-unit retail & eCommerce. Bold Orange leads the transformation of customer experience through integrating data, strategy, technology and creativity to deliver personalized experiences at scale.

Through significant investments in the company's infrastructure and operations, two strategic add-on acquisitions, and broad-based expansion of the team and talent base, Bold Orange became a leading independent full-service CX company turning customer data into business driving experiences. Bold Orange operates in three key disciplines — Strategy & Insights, Experience Design & Delivery, and Technology Solutions — that together provide the expertise clients need to navigate the complex CX landscape.

""It has been a pleasure to partner with the Bold Orange team from inception through over seven years of transformative growth. The superb execution of the strategic plan we developed at the outset of our partnership led to exceptional growth and major new client wins,"" said Jay Royston of Mountaingate. ""Congratulations to the entire team at Bold Orange on the tremendous outcome and thank you to the team at Canaccord Genuity for supporting us in finding an ideal partner to support the future success of the business.""

Aegis is a NYC-based venture studio that partners with entrepreneurs and health systems to launch and scale meaningful healthtech startups that drive healthcare forward.

Driscoll, a veteran entrepreneur and operator, has led organizations including Walgreens Boots Alliance, Castlight Health, Medco, CareCentrix, and Surescripts. Ross, one of the nation's most respected CIOs, spearheaded Mayo Clinic's digital transformation and held senior technology roles at CVS Health and Optum. As Venture Partners, they will help Aegis surface and evaluate opportunities for new company creation and advise portfolio companies on commercialization, integration with health systems, and strategic partnerships.

""I've seen what it takes as an entrepreneur to help build great companies, and I'm excited to bring my experience to Aegis as they have built a unique model that brings entrepreneurs, novel technologies, and health systems together to create companies designed to win,"" said Driscoll. ""I'm looking forward to helping Aegis work across the healthcare ecosystem so we can improve health outcomes and lower costs for patients, payers, and health systems.""

""As a former health system CIO, I fully appreciate the importance of seamlessly integrating technology into workflows, and addressing the disconnect that often exists between health systems and the innovators working to support them, which can slow adoption and erode trust,"" said Ross. ""What drew me to Aegis is its commitment to building a bench of leaders with true domain expertise who can partner with health systems to solve their most pressing challenges. I'm excited to join this team and help extend that trust-based approach across the broader healthcare ecosystem.""

""I'm thrilled to welcome John and Cris to the Aegis leadership team. Their careers embody the values we hold most dear at Aegis: the courage to challenge inertia, the capacity to unify diverse stakeholders to drive change, and the acumen to bridge bold vision with disciplined execution. With John and Cris aboard, we are better positioned than ever to advance our mission of launching category-defining companies that transform the healthcare experience for patients and caregivers,"" said John Beadle, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Aegis Ventures.

John Driscoll has led some of the healthcare industry's most influential companies. He was CEO of CareCentrix, later acquired by Walgreens, and previously served as President at Castlight Health and Group President for New Markets at Medco, which was recognized by Fortune as the most admired company in healthcare services. Earlier in his career, he built SureScripts into the nationwide standard for electronic prescribing across pharmacies, PBMs, and health plans. Today, Driscoll chairs the boards of Waystar Corporation, UConn Health, and Magnit Global.

Cris Ross brings more than 30 years of leadership experience spanning healthcare, technology, and government. As CIO of Mayo Clinic he led an enterprise-wide EHR convergence initiative, advanced data and AI collaborations with Google and Microsoft, and scaled innovation in analytics and machine learning. Ross has also chaired the Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) and served on advisory committees for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Veterans Administration.

Driscoll and Ross join fellow Aegis Venture Partners Dr. Ash Zenooz, former CEO of Commure and Chief Medical Officer at Salesforce, and Dr. Steve Gipstein, former head of Worldwide Healthcare Markets at Apple. They add to a leadership team that also includes Dr. David Feinberg, Executive Chairman of Aegis and Chairman of Oracle Health, and Dr. John Noseworthy, Chairman of the Aegis Digital Consortium and CEO Emeritus of Mayo Clinic.

Since its founding, Aegis Ventures has pioneered a new model of healthcare innovation built on deep partnerships with leading health systems. Working closely with a national consortium that now includes 11 major providers, Aegis has launched and scaled five AI-powered companies tackling some of healthcare's toughest challenges — from automating workflows to accelerating clinical trials. With this proven track record and an expanding ecosystem that now includes payers, life sciences, and technology leaders, Aegis is redefining how transformative solutions are created, scaled, and trusted across the healthcare industry.

Editor’s note: Any and all references to time frames longer than one trading day are for purposes of market context only, and not recommendations of any holding time frame. Daily rebalancing ETFs are not meant to be held unmonitored for long periods. If you don’t have the resources, time or inclination to constantly monitor and manage your positions, leveraged and inverse ETFs are not for you.

Investing in the funds involves a high degree of risk. Unlike traditional ETFs, or even other leveraged and/or inverse ETFs, these leveraged and/or inverse single-stock ETFs track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification. Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying stock’s performance over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments. The Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Bull Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases, and the Bear Fund will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance decreases, over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his or her investment in a single day. Investing in the Funds is not equivalent to investing directly in each underlying security.

Direxion Shares ETF Risks – An investment in the ETFs involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The ETFs are non-diversified and include risks associated with concentration that results from an ETF’s investments in a particular industry, sector or company, which can increase volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. The ETFs do not attempt to, and should not be expected to, provide returns which are a multiple of respective underlying security for periods other than a single day. For other risks including leverage, correlation, daily compounding, market volatility and risks specific to an industry, sector or company, please read the prospectus.

One exhibition is Scott Burton: Shape Shift, a critically acclaimed exhibition surveying the seminal—and subversive—art of Scott Burton (1939-89). By the time of his death at the age of 50 from an AIDS-related illness, Burton—who once described his work as “sculpture in love with furniture”—had succeeded as sculptor, public artist, performance artist, social choreographer, art critic and exhibition curator.

This landmark exhibition spans that career, bringing together works from the 1960s to the ‘80s, including some 30 sculptures and more than 40 photographs, drawings and ephemera. The exhibition is installed on Wrightwood 659’s third and fourth floors.

The Joffrey + Ballet in the U.S., the second display, is a large-scale exhibition celebrating the history of The Joffrey Ballet and the life of Robert Joffrey. The exhibition premiered at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center in 2024, marking the first major retrospective of the company.

Highlights include rare film from the original performance of the groundbreaking ballet Astarte and Anna Sokolow’s Opus 65, as well as costumes, props, pointe shoes, posters, correspondence and other ephemera from the company and Robert Joffrey’s life.

The third exhibition is Ellen Altfest: Forever —a selection of 15 oil paintings by the U.S. representational painter Ellen Altfest, known for her painstakingly labor-intensive canvases and her observation of things in the world often overlooked in art.

Kodiak Sciences is a ""pure spec"" stock and Texas Pacific Land Corporation is not a good investment due to disappointing sales results. Cramer advises against investing in Kodiak Sciences, but notes that those who like the company should be prepared to accept the risks.

Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" shared his insights on various stocks during the latest ""Mad Money Lightning Round"" [1]. Among the stocks discussed, Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) and Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) received favorable recommendations, while Kodiak Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:KOD) and Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL) were advised against.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO)

Cramer highlighted Oklo as a ""buy"" recommendation, citing the company's focus on advanced fission power plants and nuclear fuel recycling technology [2]. He noted that the stock's significant gains are due to a ""pro-nuke"" administration, suggesting that the company's potential aligns with current political and regulatory trends. Oklo's stock performance has been notable, with a year-to-date gain, and the company's innovative approach to nuclear power could position it for growth in the clean energy sector.

Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR)

Cramer also recommended Carrier Global, noting that the stock is ""too low"" and advised investors to ""do some buying"" [1]. The company's better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report bolstered Cramer's confidence in the stock, with shares rising by 0.7% on Tuesday, August 26 [3]. Carrier Global's focus on technology and communications services could make it an attractive investment for those looking for growth in these sectors.

Kodiak Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:KOD)

Cramer classified Kodiak Sciences as a ""pure spec"" stock, advising caution for investors [3]. While the company posted a second-quarter loss, Cramer acknowledged that it could be an acceptable risk for those who are willing to take it. Kodiak Sciences operates in the utilities sector, which may appeal to investors seeking exposure to this sector, despite the higher risk associated with the stock.

Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE:TPL)

Cramer was not positive about Texas Pacific Land, advising against investing in the stock due to disappointing sales results [3]. The company reported worse-than-expected second-quarter sales, with an earnings per share of $5.05 falling short of analyst estimates of $5.48. Institutional investors, such as Candriam S.C.A., have increased their stakes in Texas Pacific Land, reflecting a growing interest in the company [4]. However, the stock's recent performance and earnings miss may indicate that it is not a good investment at this time.

Conclusion

Jim Cramer's insights provide valuable guidance for investors, highlighting the potential in Oklo and Carrier Global while cautioning against Kodiak Sciences and Texas Pacific Land. As always, investors should conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

There's also in his mind,” Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said on Tuesday.
And the Eagles just watched Big Fred start six games in the Super Bowl season and play at a pretty high level in those starts.
“Just someone that we feel really good about having here.” The Eagles gave up a 2026 seventh-round pick to get Johnson back.
Last year, Johnson started five games at left tackle and one at right tackle.","When the Eagles had an opportunity on Sunday to bring back swing tackle Fred Johnson in a trade, they pounced.

Which might make you wonder why they didn’t just re-sign him in free agency.

“I think from our perspective, to just go, 'Why not sign him?' There's also in his mind,” Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said on Tuesday. “He understands that we have two All-Pro-level offensive tackles. He's in a stage in his career where he played really well and he was looking for an opportunity.

“So just because we didn't sign him doesn't mean we weren't trying to sign him. I think for him, he was looking to see what he could do somewhere else because of the situation that we had.”

Johnson, 28, signed a one-year deal with the Jaguars in March with hopes of getting more opportunity to play. And the Eagles did at least try to replace him.

They signed veterans Kendall Lamm and Matt Pryor and then after failing to draft an offensive tackle on the first two days of the draft, selected Myles Hinton and Cameron Williams in the sixth round.

But it was really clear during training camp that none of them were adequate backup options to Jordan Mailata and Lane Johnson going into the 2025 season. And the Eagles just watched Big Fred start six games in the Super Bowl season and play at a pretty high level in those starts.

“When the opportunity arose to bring him back, we jumped at it,” Roseman said. “Just someone that we feel really good about having here.”

The Eagles gave up a 2026 seventh-round pick to get Johnson back.

The Eagles first signed Johnson to their practice squad in November of 2022 and he began working with offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, whom Johnson has credited for helping save his career. After not playing much in 2023, Johnson was a huge part of the Super Bowl season in 2024.

He seems pretty happy to be back.

So much of the Eagles’ offense is predicated on leaving their tackles on islands and they don’t like to change the whole offense when a starter is out. Backup tackles are important across the league but you can argue they’re even more important in Philly.

Last year, Johnson started five games at left tackle and one at right tackle. His best performance came against the Bengals and All-Pro Trey Hendrickson, whom Johnson held without a sack or QB hit.

There’s a good chance the Eagles will need Big Fred again in 2025.

“That offensive tackle position, just like the quarterback position, you can never have too many of those guys that come in and play for you over the course of a season,” Roseman said. “We're trying to play a lot of games here. Over the course of those games, you're going to need guys to step up in back-up roles. Fred's shown he can do it at a championship level, and so just really excited to bring him back.”",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/08/Johnson-F-USATSI-25380594.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-27 17:07:57.231469

A setback in school fueled the idea for Mr. Fresh.
Mr. Fresh also offers branded merchandise, including T-shirts and hats, that feature a cartoon image of Danrich.
Mr. Fresh is also an acronym: Faith to Rescue Every Son from Hurt.
Getting Mr. Fresh on the shelves of Walmart is just the beginning, according to Danrich.","One of Joshua Danrich’s goals is to own a sports car dealership, which might explain the idea behind St. Louis-based Mr. Fresh—a company that specializes in air fresheners and deodorizers for automobiles as well as homes. But cars are just one facet of the 16-year-old entrepreneur’s business; the bigger mission is to show other young men that they can succeed.

After Danrich recently pitched his fresheners at Walmart’s Open Call in Bentonville, Arkansas, alongside thousands of entrepreneurs of all ages, his products earned a spot in the store’s automotive department. Now, Mr. Fresh products are available at 150 Walmart stores across Missouri, in select stores in Illinois, and also online. Danrich’s company is also partnering with Feeding America, a nonprofit, charitable organization that Walmart also supports.

A setback in school fueled the idea for Mr. Fresh. When Danrich and his mother, Shay, learned that he would have to repeat the fourth grade, Shay suggested he accept the situation and focus on something positive to rebuild his confidence.

“I came to my mom with a heartfelt position,” says Danrich, whose mother has a background as a business consultant. “I was like, ‘Mom, I want to start a business.’”

The mother-son duo took Danrich’s passion for cars and turned it into something that can enhance any vehicle’s interior: air fresheners and deodorizers.

The company now sells six types of natural, oil-based fresheners, ranging from scents like yellow rose to baby powder at $11.99 each. Mr. Fresh also offers branded merchandise, including T-shirts and hats, that feature a cartoon image of Danrich.

“I wanted everything to be just like me,” Danrich says. “And I wanted bright, bold colors so they stand out and pop.”

However, a deeper meaning lies beyond Danrich’s cartoon depiction. Mr. Fresh is also an acronym: Faith to Rescue Every Son from Hurt.

“I’m proving to the world that age is no barrier to success, and I’m inspiring youth just like me that anything is possible,” Danrich says.

In 2019, Joshua appeared on Good Morning America during one of the program’s Kidventor segments. The exposure drew new interest to Mr. Fresh products, and after returning from New York City, Danrich wanted to take things to the next level—expanding the brand’s reach and preparing it for wider distribution.

“When we got back I was like, ‘Yeah, this is serious,’” Shay says. “That’s when I knew that the brand needed to be trademarked.”

With guidance from Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, Danrich became the youngest client of its Microenterprise Program—and arguably one of its most successful. Launched in 2011, the initiative from LSEM has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs and small business owners with legal support and tools to solve business challenges.

Getting Mr. Fresh on the shelves of Walmart is just the beginning, according to Danrich.

“I want to be the biggest air freshener brand in the world,” he says. “I’m in Walmart now so you can imagine where I could be in the next four years.”

Now a sophomore at Chaminade College Preparatory School, Danrich is looking to attend the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University to further his entrepreneurial skills and study engineering. He also has dreams of becoming a motivational speaker.

“I want everyone to hear my message that anything is possible and to invest in yourself,” he says.",https://www.stlmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/4652067679185093525.webp,N,,2025-08-27 17:16:13.487521

The scheme, which closed to new applications at the end of June 2025, was designed to help those with smaller deposits to access the property market.

In total, 56,389 mortgages were completed with support from the scheme during its operation, representing 1.4% of all residential mortgage completions in the UK for the period. The initiative allowed lenders to obtain a government guarantee on loans where the borrower’s deposit was less than 10%, provided the property value did not exceed £600,000 and the mortgage was not for buy-to-let or a second home.

As the original scheme concluded, the UK government introduced a permanent Mortgage Guarantee Scheme in July, rebranded as Freedom to Buy. The new programme aims to help homebuyers secure a property with deposits as low as 5%. Under Freedom to Buy, lenders will receive a government-backed guarantee on 91–95% loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages, insuring them against a portion of potential losses. Officials expect this to encourage more lenders to offer high LTV products, supporting up to 36,000 additional mortgages for first-time buyers in the first year.

During the previous scheme’s operation, the government provided £1.7 billion in guarantees, backing £11.5 billion in mortgage lending. Properties purchased or remortgaged under the scheme had a combined value of £12.2 billion.

The mean property value for completions through the scheme was £215,467, below the UK average house price of £271,000. Most completions were for homes valued at £250,000 or less, with terraced and semi-detached houses making up the largest share at 35% and 30% respectively.

HM Treasury statistics also indicated that 42% of households using the scheme had incomes up to £50,000, with a median household income of £53,711. Households earning above £80,000 represented 18% of completions.

Regionally, 71% of completions took place in England, followed by Scotland at 21%, Wales at 5%, and Northern Ireland at 3%. Scotland’s share of completions was notably higher than its proportion of the overall UK mortgage market.

AXA Mansard Insurance has urged operators to support the Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act (NIIRA) 2025 through disciplined execution.

The company made the appeal in a statement issued in Lagos on Tuesday by its Chief Client Officer, Rashidat Adebisi.

Adebisi said that restoring trust and deepening industry growth required credible implementation beyond policy announcements.

She noted that industry credibility would not be judged by balance sheet size alone but by the number of Nigerians adequately protected through insurance.

She described recapitalisation and the risk-based capital framework under NIIRA as a historic chance to reposition Nigeria’s insurance industry.

However, she cautioned that capitalisation or digitisation reforms without effective execution would neither enhance customer experience nor strengthen investor confidence.

Adebisi recalled the 2004 banking recapitalisation which cut the number of banks from 89 to 25, while tripling capitalisation and improving public confidence.

She urged the insurance industry to replicate such transformation for sustainable growth.

“The NIIRA presents our industry with an opportunity to support Nigeria’s one trillion dollars economy by addressing demand, supply, and operational challenges,” Adebisi stated.

She explained that the framework empowers insurers to enhance service delivery, improve customer confidence, and strengthen trust.

On the risk-based capital framework, Adebisi described it as “primarily a customer protection tool, and secondarily a regulatory tool”.

She said aligning capital buffers with underwriting risks would enforce better product design, pricing discipline, and prudent investment, assuring stronger policyholder protection.

Responding to consolidation concerns, Adebisi said mergers should be seen as renewal for a stronger industry, not as loss.

She explained that consolidation would enable insurers to invest in technology, speed up claims, widen distribution, and compete regionally.

Adebisi lamented Nigeria’s insurance penetration remained below one per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

She compared this with 17 per cent in South Africa, three per cent in Kenya, and two per cent in Ghana, noting Nigeria’s figure was still weak.

“If NIIRA is well executed, insurance can unlock long-term funds for infrastructure, provide MSME cover, and boost investor confidence,” she said.

She emphasised that MSMEs represent over 90 per cent of Nigerian businesses, making their protection essential for national growth.

“Regulators have provided the framework. It is now up to us, the operators, to rebuild trust, embrace digitisation, and deliver inclusive products,” she said.

Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).","HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) will release earnings results for the third quarter, after the closing bell on Wednesday, Aug. 27.

Analysts expect the Palo Alto, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at 75 cents per share, down from 83 cents per share in the year-ago period. HP projects to report quarterly revenue of $13.71 billion, compared to $13.52 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

With the recent buzz around HP, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, HP offers an annual dividend yield of 4.29%, which is a semi-annual dividend amount of 29 cents per share ($1.16 a year).

So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $139,696 or around 5,172 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $27,928 or around 1,034 shares.

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.16 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.16 = 5,172 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.16 = 1,034 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

View more earnings on HPQ

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

HPQ Price Action: Shares of HP fell 1.8% to close at $27.01 on Tuesday.

On May 28, HP reported worse-than-expected second-quarter adjusted EPS results and issued third-quarter adjusted EPS guidance below estimates.

Headline Takeaway: Ralph Lauren's stock is under pressure, down -2.96% recently, despite a generally optimistic analyst outlook. The technical indicators, however, suggest caution with a weak internal diagnostic score of 3.95 (0-10).

News Highlights

Walmart's Agentic AI Strategy: Walmart unveiled plans for personal shopping agents powered by agentic AI, signaling a shift in retail innovation. While not directly tied to Ralph Lauren, the trend reflects broader shifts in consumer engagement and could influence competitor strategies.

Nykaa's Retail Expansion: Nykaa, an e-commerce player in India, expanded its retail footprint significantly with 50 new stores. While unrelated to RL, it highlights ongoing investment in physical retail by fashion brands, which could pressure Ralph Lauren to maintain its omni-channel strength.

Modine's Acquisition: Modine acquired L.B. White, a heating solutions company, in a $112 million deal. While not related to fashion, such strategic moves highlight capital allocation trends that investors might consider when evaluating Ralph Lauren's own initiatives and capital efficiency.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The analyst community remains cautiously optimistic about Ralph Lauren. The simple average rating is 4.30, while the performance-weighted rating is higher at 5.25, suggesting that the higher-rated institutions have shown stronger historical performance. However, there is notable dispersion in ratings—despite 10 total predictions in the last 20 days, the ratings span from ""Strong Buy"" to ""Buy,"" indicating mixed views on timing and entry points.

These analyst scores are out of step with the recent price trend, which has been negative (-2.96%), showing a mismatch between expectations and current market sentiment.

Key Fundamentals and Model Scores

Gross Profit Over Assets (GPOA): 16.99% (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

EV/EBIT: 93.87 (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

Net Profit Margin (NPM): 8.57% (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

Cash Conversion (UP): -106.24% (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

Cash Ratio (MV): -151.21% (internal diagnostic score: 6.44)

Asset Turnover (MV): -87.95% (internal diagnostic score: 3.95)

Profit Turnover (MV): -88.00% (internal diagnostic score: 3.95)

Revenue Turnover (MV): -14.32% (internal diagnostic score: 3.95)

Income Tax / Total Profit: 21.79% (internal diagnostic score: 3.95)

These mixed scores highlight that while some fundamentals are healthy, others—like cash and asset turnover—indicate inefficiencies. The overall fundamental score is 4.47 (internal diagnostic score), showing moderate strength.

Money-Flow Trends

The fund-flow analysis reveals a mixed picture. Large investors are trending negative (block trend negative, score 7.79—internal diagnostic score), but small retail investors remain cautiously optimistic (small trend positive). The overall inflow ratio stands at 49.36%, suggesting that while money is flowing in, it's not overwhelming. Notably, medium-sized flows are positive, while large and extra-large flows show negative sentiment, signaling caution among institutional players.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, Ralph Lauren’s chart is concerning. With an overall trend described as “weak” and a score of 3.95 (internal diagnostic score), the recent signals include:

Williams %R Oversold: Score: 3.8 (internal diagnostic score). This is a bearish signal, suggesting potential for a rebound, but it has historically led to -0.03% average returns and a 55.17% win rate—so caution is warranted.

Marubozu White: Score: 1.61 (internal diagnostic score). This is a very weak signal, indicating indecision. Historically, it has resulted in -1.48% average returns and a 41.67% win rate—another bearish sign.

Recent chart patterns are clustered around the 2025-08-25 date, where both Williams %R Oversold and Marubozu White signals were detected. This suggests a period of consolidation and weak momentum. The technical insight notes that bearish signals (2) are dominant over bullish ones (0), and the trend is not clear, suggesting the stock is in a volatile and uncertain phase.

Conclusion

Ralph Lauren faces a mixed landscape. Analysts are generally optimistic, but the technical and fundamental indicators suggest caution. The weak technical signals (3.95 internal diagnostic score) and negative cash and asset turnover trends point to a stock that is struggling with internal efficiency and momentum. The recent price decline (-2.96%) further underscores this.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:13:56.578588

SMS to ugrade hot strip mill with inductive heating

The new inductive heating system, which will come fitted with heat insulation hoods, will be installed upstream of the finishing mill entry section

US steelmaker ArcelorMittal Calvert has placed an order with SMS group to modernise its hot strip mill (HSM) in Calvert, Alabama. The 2,050mm HSM was supplied by SMS group and started operation in 2010. ArcelorMittal Calvert plans to enhance the HSM to roll ‘state of the art’ steel grades and advanced hot strip products, while at the same improving rolling efficiency. SMS will ensure the smooth integration of the inductive heating system into the HSM, including the extension of the automation system.

The new inductive heating system, which will come fitted with heat insulation hoods, will be installed upstream of the finishing mill entry section. As a system solutions provider, SMS will deliver an advanced guiding and protection concept, including an entry-side wiper roll unit, two entry roller tables with side guides, inductive heating system, exit-side roller table with side guide, and exit-side wiper roll unit.

The inductive heating system is designed to heat the transfer bars to the required temperature and will ensure optimised downstream processing. The temperature of the transfer bar will be homogenised over its width and length within a tight tolerance range.

To ensure homogeneous heating of the transfer bar, including the strip edge area, the Elotherm inductive heating technology package includes a combination of both longitudinal flux inductor (LF) and transversal flux inductor (TF), thus guaranteeing maximum efficiency. The inductive heating system to be supplied to ArcelorMittal Calvert consists of four longitudinal and two transversal flux inductors. Moreover, the system can be retracted — moved in and out of the line — providing not only for production flow flexibility but also for safe and easy maintenance. With each heater having a nominal output power of 4.8MW, the inductive heating system is ultra-efficient.

A key element of the success story of the HSM at ArcelorMittal Calvert is the X-Pact electrical and automation system. It underscores the fruitful and longstanding collaborative partnership between ArcelorMittal Calvert and SMS since the original delivery of a complete electrical and automation equipment package, which was commissioned back in 2010. This was followed in 2018 by the integration of a transfer bar cooler.

Currently ongoing activities include the gradual upgrade of the L1 automation hardware for the HSM, scheduled to be completed in 2027. By then, ArcelorMittal’s personnel will be fully trained and more than ready for when the induction heating project comes on-stream. All the mechanical equipment for the Elotherm inductive heating system will be pre-assembled and function-tested in the SMS workshops prior to delivery. This provides the best possible preparation for a smooth final assembly and commissioning.

The project schedule was designed to minimise disruption to production. Where possible, the construction of the new equipment will take place in parallel with ongoing operations. The start of hot commissioning is scheduled for the end of November 2026.

However, G-Power's website also lists a few other ""Bi-Turbo"" setups, including outputs of 620, 670, or 720 horsepower. The claimed top speed for the most powerful setup reaches a ridiculous 205 mph for a convertible.

Interestingly, the social posts from G-Power for this convertible G4M Bi-Turbo claim it only makes 700 horsepower, which isn't an upgrade level listed on its website. It's possible it's the same as the coupe's ""720"" setup, just with changes for the different convertible body.

Other Goodies Included

The website says the G4M Bi-Turbo package also includes a Deeptone stainless-steel exhaust setup with carbon fiber tailpipes. There are forged 20- or 21-inch wheels available with Michelin rubber, a Venturi hood replacement, and a carbon rear wing. The company promises the mods are completely street legal. There are also swaths of carbon fiber throughout the interior, with a special carbon steering wheel with integrated LEDs as an option.

You have the option of leaving exterior carbon panels exposed or painted, and it looks like you aren't stuck with the orange wheels in the images if you want something a little less flashy. The car naturally comes adorned with plenty of reminders that G-Power has had their hands on it, with a unique orange engine cover, replacement badging of the traditional BMW roundels, and little marques throughout the cabin and on the usual trunklid spots.

But It Ain't Cheap

Pricing for the lowest G4M Bi-Turbo 620 tune and setup will set you back at least $30,000 for the upgrade alone, converting from Euros to US currency. The 670 pack is $34,750, and the big 720 tune pack is a whopping $41,500. Once you factor in approximately $85,000 to buy the actual car, the total price jumps in a hurry. But again, you're getting supercar performance figures in a classic BMW convertible package, which is probably amazing to listen to, and more importantly, amazing to drive.

If you don't want any of the three available so-called ""Bi-Turbo"" packs, you can also mix and match other upgrades as you see fit. G-Power offers tunes at various levels, including outputs of 600, 650, and 700 horsepower. Finally, there's a very orange full-leather interior upgrade package on the site, though it suspiciously says that pricing is inquiry only, so it's more likely a very custom affair tuned to the tastes of the customer.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/g-power-g4m-bi-turbo-bmw-m4-convertible-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:07:05.132151

An employee and two customers got into a fight Friday in the Walmart on 2014 S. Irby St., according to the Florence Police Department (FPD).

Officers responded to the scene around 4:45 p.m. when they were informed of the incident.

Police were told that an employee stopped two people on the way out for a receipt, leading to a brief exchange of words.

It was reported that the employee then approached the man and punched him, starting a fight between the two.

Another person broke up the fight, and the two customers fled the scene before officers arrived.

The employee was taken to the hospital but did not appear to have a major injury.

Parts of the incident were caught on security camera footage and were used in the investigation.

FPD said they were also made aware of a shoplifting incident on Saturday at the 230 N. Beltline Dr. Walmart.

Advances in mobile data, programmatic digital OOH (pDOOH) and cross-channel analytics now reveal how exposure drives behaviour across the funnel, from recall and recognition to consideration and purchase.
Digital formats add another layer.
Used together, these formats deliver both reach and impact.
Younger demographics often show bigger uplifts in purchase intent, while older groups lean toward positive brand perception.","For years, out-of-home (OOH) advertising was measured by audience size and impressions. Easy to report, yes – but those numbers only tell us who might have seen an ad, not whether it connected or drove any shift in awareness, perception or intent.

Attribution changes the game. It measures how many people not only saw a campaign but remembered the right brand. It asks a far better question than reach ever could: not “how many passed by,” but “how many remembered us.”

Measuring OOH has always been tricky. Billboards and forecourt screens don’t live in closed, trackable feeds like digital display ads. But tools have caught up. Advances in mobile data, programmatic digital OOH (pDOOH) and cross-channel analytics now reveal how exposure drives behaviour across the funnel, from recall and recognition to consideration and purchase.

Success isn’t about who sees your ad. It’s about who remembers it

Brand lift studies show how powerful OOH can be when creative, format and placement align. One of Tractor Outdoor’s static OOH campaigns for a leading e-commerce brand, built around a single high-traffic site in Cape Town with clean creative, achieved a +17-point lift in brand attribution and 55% ad recall, which is among the best global benchmarks. The lesson is simple: strategic sites, clear messaging and repeated exposure embed brands in memory.

Digital formats add another layer. Tractor’s programmatic campaign for a software brand delivered a +37-point uplift in brand image and +32 in ad likeability, showing how dynamic delivery and real-time optimisation deepen resonance. By reaching the right people at the right moment and adjusting mid-flight, pDOOH combines OOH’s visibility with digital precision.

Attribution also highlights the unique roles of different formats. Large-format DOOH captures attention and builds brand visibility, often outperforming benchmarks for recall. Proximity placements near points of sale, like forecourts, are especially effective for influencing purchase decisions – one snack brand campaign saw a +34 uplift in consideration among 18-34-year-olds.

We’ve seen that static OOH builds long-term brand presence, while DOOH adds flexibility, fine-tuning frequency and context for efficiency. Used together, these formats deliver both reach and impact.

Attribution reveals what works and where to go next

At Tractor Outdoor, attribution insights inform every stage of planning. We use data to understand which formats and environments consistently shift perception or intent, applying those learnings to media mix, site selection and creative refinement. Sometimes, the fix is as simple as making the logo more prominent or reinforcing distinctive brand cues. These small tweaks can have measurable impact.

It also deepens understanding of audiences. Younger demographics often show bigger uplifts in purchase intent, while older groups lean toward positive brand perception. These insights shape campaigns that speak differently to different segments, ensuring every placement works harder.

Challenges remain. Consumers move fluidly between channels, making OOH’s role harder to isolate. Data quality and inconsistent benchmarks complicate comparisons. But these are opportunities, not barriers.

By combining mobility analytics, surveys and behavioural data, we’re building a fuller view of how outdoor media influences the wider journey – and that journey is becoming more dynamic every day. Programmatic DOOH is shifting attribution from retrospective reporting to real-time optimisation. Soon, campaigns will adapt mid-flight based on live attribution signals, reallocating spend, refining creative and amplifying what works. Advances in mobile data, AI and modelling will push this further, showing not just whether the campaign worked but which message, screen or moment drove the strongest result.",https://biz-file.com/c/2508/785166.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:13:44.077729

Insurance stakeholders have called on operators in Nigeria to back the landmark Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act (NIIRA) 2025 with disciplined execution, stressing that the credibility of the sector will be judged not by the size of balance sheets but by how many Nigerians and businesses it can protect.

Speaking in a televised interview, Rashidat Adebisi, chief client officer at AXA Mansard Insurance Plc, described the NIIRA Act as a historic opportunity to reposition the sector.

However, she warned that reforms on paper would amount to little without operational discipline and customer-centred execution.

“Recapitalisation and risk-based capital standards create the right foundation, but capitalisation alone will not improve customer experience nor boost investor confidence. Execution is what will transform this industry,” Adebisi noted.

The NIIRA 2025 raises capital requirements significantly: life insurance operators must now maintain a minimum of ₦10 billion (up from ₦2 billion), general insurers ₦15 billion (up from ₦3 billion), while reinsurers must hold at least ₦35 billion (up from ₦10 billion).

Adebisi explained that these thresholds will likely shrink the number of players in the industry but leave behind more resilient institutions. According to data from NAICOM, about 46 percent of insurers already meet the requirements.

“I anticipate a slightly smaller industry but one that is more stable, resilient, and better able to support clients. Beyond stronger balance sheets, recapitalisation should ensure insurers create real safety nets for corporates, SMEs, government, and individuals,” she said.

She added that consolidation, mergers and acquisitions, and new investment flows could mirror the experience of Nigeria’s banking and pension sectors, where stronger institutions emerged after recapitalisation drives.

Both Adebisi and other industry leaders stressed that NIIRA’s provisions on compulsory insurance enforcement, policyholder protection, and digitisation are as crucial as the capital hike.

“Compulsory insurance is not just about collecting more premiums. It is about consumer protection. We must not leave the government alone to shoulder the burden of unexpected events,” Adebisi emphasised.

She noted that Nigerian insurance penetration remains below one percent despite decades of market potential, partly because of affordability barriers, weak consumer trust, and cultural perceptions such as “God is my insurance.” With NIIRA, she said, the industry has a chance to shift that narrative through stricter enforcement of claims payment, transparent pricing, and value-based conversations with customers.

Digitisation, she argued, is central to that transformation. “The world is digital. The insurance industry must adapt. From valuation of assets to claims transparency, technology is how we can prove value and build trust.”

The Act also aligns with the government’s ambition of positioning insurance as a key pillar of Nigeria’s proposed $1 trillion economy by 2030. Adebisi pointed to the Nigerian Insurance Association’s (NIA) innovation hub as an example of how the sector is already moving in that direction.

“Imagine all of this coming together at the right time—recapitalisation, digitisation, compulsory insurance, policyholder funds. Insurance can then become a very strong pillar of Nigeria’s trillion-dollar economy ambition,” she said.

Also speaking on the NIIRA, Akinjide Orimolade, chief executive at Stanbic IBTC Insurance, described the Act as timely and transformative. He emphasised that its provisions will improve consumer protection, restore confidence, and give insurers the financial muscle to pay claims promptly.

“Why are we in business? It is to pay claims, and not just pay but pay on time. With this new capital base, companies can settle claims as due and that builds trust in the market,” Orimolade said.

He explained that the recapitalisation drive will not only enhance insurers’ balance sheets but also allow them to take on larger risks in critical sectors such as oil and gas, construction, and power—areas previously ceded to foreign insurers.

The new law also mandates insurers to set aside 0.25 percent of gross premium income as policyholders’ funds, a development he said would further strengthen governance, accountability, and customer satisfaction.

Enforcement and inclusion

Orimolade highlighted NIIRA’s empowerment of the regulator, NAICOM, to enforce compulsory insurance policies across motor, building construction, public buildings, and group life schemes for organisations with more than three employees.

He stressed that enforcement, alongside financial inclusion, would expand insurance reach across Nigeria. “It is not just about big players. There is space for microinsurance and takaful to serve low-income segments. With risk-based capital, smaller operators can focus on niche areas while still contributing to overall penetration.”

Technology as a driver

Both experts agreed that digitisation will be a game-changer, not only in onboarding customers but also in claims settlement. Orimolade noted that technology investments—enabled by higher capital—will make products more accessible and affordable, while ensuring transparency in service delivery.

“With robust digital platforms, onboarding becomes seamless, e-KYC can be done easily, and claims can be paid faster. That simplicity will change how Nigerians see insurance,” he said.

Looking ahead, Adebisi predicted a leaner but better-capitalised industry with deeper digital integration, stronger enforcement, and improved customer solutions.

“I expect deeper market penetration, improved consumer trust, and stronger resilience for businesses and individuals. This recapitalisation is not just about money—it is a recipe for trust,” she stated.

Adebisi, however, stressed that financial recapitalisation alone will not transform the industry. She highlighted the importance of awareness and sustained engagement, noting that greater education and industry-wide sensitisation are critical to unlocking the sector’s potential.

Orimolade agreed, adding that the reforms position Nigerian insurers to “collaborate, innovate, and ultimately become credible global players.”",https://businessamlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Rashidat.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:01:00.853427

If it feels like pumpkin spice season creeps up earlier every year, you’re not imagining it.

But this early surge came with a faster cooldown, with demand taking a dip by the end of the month. There’s also a reliable second spike in late November, likely driven by Thanksgiving’s fondness for all things squash and spice.

In today’s fast-paced financial markets, technology and consulting companies hold significant influence on global stock exchanges. Among these giants, Capgemini stands out as one of the leading IT services and consulting firms. Founded in 1967 in France, Capgemini has grown into a multinational leader specializing in digital transformation, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and IT consulting services. The company is listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: CAP), and its stock performance attracts both institutional and retail investors across the world. Understanding the dynamics behind the Capgemini share price is essential for investors who want to make informed decisions.

Capgemini Share Price Overview

The Capgemini share price has historically reflected the company’s strong fundamentals and its ability to adapt to technological changes. Over the past decade, Capgemini’s stock has delivered steady returns, driven by consistent revenue growth, strategic acquisitions, and expansion into high-demand areas such as cloud services, cybersecurity, and AI-driven business solutions.

For investors, Capgemini is often seen as a balanced stock it offers stability due to its global presence and long-standing reputation, while also providing growth opportunities through innovation and expansion in emerging markets.

Key Factors Driving Capgemini Share Price

1. Financial Performance and Earnings Reports

Capgemini’s quarterly and annual results significantly impact its share price. When earnings exceed analyst expectations, the stock usually experiences a positive rally. Conversely, weaker margins or revenue dips can trigger short-term corrections.

2. Global IT Spending Trends

The global IT services market continues to expand as companies across industries invest in digital solutions. Capgemini benefits directly from this trend, as its services are aligned with enterprise demand for automation, AI, and digital consulting. A rise in IT budgets often translates to growth in Capgemini’s share price.

3. Innovation and Strategic Acquisitions

Capgemini has consistently strengthened its portfolio through acquisitions, most notably its purchase of Altran, which expanded its engineering and R&D capabilities. This has reinforced its leadership in next-generation services, giving investors more confidence in long-term share price appreciation.

4. Macroeconomic Environment

Like other global companies, Capgemini is affected by economic cycles, inflation trends, and interest rate changes. During times of strong global economic growth, the demand for IT consulting rises, positively influencing the Capgemini share price. On the other hand, economic slowdowns may temporarily reduce investor confidence.

5. Competition in the IT Consulting Sector

Capgemini operates in a competitive industry alongside Accenture, Infosys, Wipro, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Any shift in client market share or major deal wins can impact its stock performance. Investors often monitor how Capgemini positions itself against these rivals to assess long-term strength.

Historical Performance and Market Sentiment

Capgemini’s stock has shown resilience over the years. Even during global uncertainties, such as the pandemic and economic slowdowns, the company managed to deliver revenue growth by adapting to client needs in cloud computing and remote digital solutions. This adaptability has built strong investor confidence, contributing to consistent upward momentum in its share price.

Analysts note that Capgemini’s focus on AI, digital transformation, and sustainability initiatives has positioned it as a future-ready company. Market sentiment remains largely bullish, especially as enterprises continue shifting toward technology-driven solutions.

Is Capgemini a Good Investment?

For long-term investors, Capgemini is often considered a safe yet rewarding investment option. Its solid financial base, wide client network, and innovative strategies make it appealing for portfolio diversification. Unlike highly volatile tech startups, Capgemini offers a mix of stability and moderate growth potential.

However, short-term investors should be cautious. Like any stock, the Capgemini share price can fluctuate due to quarterly results, currency exchange rates, or global market downturns. Therefore, monitoring earnings updates and global IT spending trends is crucial before making entry or exit decisions.

Future Outlook of Capgemini Share Price

The future of Capgemini looks promising, with analysts expecting steady revenue growth supported by:

Artificial Intelligence & Automation: Increasing adoption of AI-driven business solutions.

Cloud Computing Services: Enterprises accelerating their migration to cloud platforms.

Engineering & R&D Services: Expansion through Altran and other acquisitions.

Sustainability and Green Tech: Rising focus on eco-friendly IT solutions, which appeals to ESG-focused investors.

If Capgemini continues to execute its growth strategy effectively, its share price could see long-term appreciation. Investors with patience may benefit significantly as digital transformation accelerates worldwide.

Conclusion

The Capgemini share price serves as a reflection of both the company’s strong fundamentals and the broader global IT landscape. With its consistent financial performance, focus on innovation, and strategic acquisitions, Capgemini has positioned itself as a reliable stock in the technology sector. While short-term fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term trajectory for Capgemini looks strong, making it a solid choice for investors seeking stability combined with growth opportunities.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/68aeb97d9fa938001e42e952.png",N,,2025-08-27 17:04:31.924130

Negative imagery (itchy, dry, flaky skin) is primarily depicted using black models, while positive, healthy skin is shown on a white model.
The portrayal of skin conditions on black models taps into harmful stereotypes about ""dry/ashy"" black skin, which can be a source of embarrassment or shame.
The ad's production choices (close-ups, exaggerated scratching, harsh color grading) amplify distress on black skin and position white skin as the ideal.
The ad could have been less offensive if the same model or a more balanced, diverse cast was used throughout.","The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) decision to uphold two complaints against Colgate-Palmolive's TV ad for Sanex Skin Therapy (20th August 2025) would suggest that even when advertisers try to be inclusive, with diverse casting, they often end up being found to have caused serious or widespread offence.

For those who missed the lather-splattered headlines, the ad opened on two black women, their skin depicted as cracked or clawed by invisible fingernails. Cue the solemn voice-over: ""To those who scratch day and night..."". Thirty seconds and one patented amino-acid complex later, we cut to a white woman luxuriating under a steamy shower while the voice-over promises ""24-hour hydration feel"" and on-screen text reassures us that ""RELIEF COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A SHOWER"".

The ASA decided that far from cleansing the nation's epidermis, the ad had washed up an offensive racial stereotype. By juxtaposing uncomfortable, problem skin exclusively with darker tones and revealing healthy, hydrated derma only once the palette had lightened, the spot all but scribbled ""before = black, after = white"" across the nation's flatscreens. Two complaints were enough to get the watchdog scratching an itch of suspected discrimination. Having inspected the evidence under its regulatory magnifying glass, the ASA concluded the execution breached BCAP Code rule 4.2 for being likely to cause serious or widespread offence on grounds of race. In short: Sanex tried to sell inclusivity, but the message left viewers feeling distinctly excluded.

Colgate-Palmolive and Clearcast argued that the ad merely dramatised dryness and itching in a stylised way, that nobody's melanin was meant to be the punch-line, and that diversity boxes had been faithfully ticked. The ASA was having none of it. Intent, meet Impact: one can be squeaky-clean, but the other can still leave a nasty mark on the bathroom tiles.

Sanex: scratching the surface of stereotypes.

To be honest, when I first watched the ad, I wasn't sure why it would cause so much offence. I therefore asked three colleagues who are black for their opinion. Two are female, one is male, and all three are in their twenties and either qualified solicitors or training to be a solicitor. Their responses fascinated me, serving as a reminder that if you are not a member of a specific group that is subject to discrimatory treatment, it's difficult, if not impossible, to really understand the impact of certain tropes. These were their observations:

The ad's opening scenes are abrupt and jarring, with harsh lighting and dramatic music, creating a negative and unsettling effect.

Negative imagery (itchy, dry, flaky skin) is primarily depicted using black models, while positive, healthy skin is shown on a white model.

The portrayal of skin conditions on black models taps into harmful stereotypes about ""dry/ashy"" black skin, which can be a source of embarrassment or shame.

The contrast between the suffering of black models and the calm, pristine appearance of the white model reinforces problematic before/after and aspirational dynamics.

The ad's production choices (close-ups, exaggerated scratching, harsh color grading) amplify distress on black skin and position white skin as the ideal.

The ad could have been less offensive if the same model or a more balanced, diverse cast was used throughout.

All three agree the ad was insensitive and offensive, and support the ASA's decision to intervene and recommend re-editing.

The ruling is more than a slap on the wrist with a damp loofah. First, it reaffirms that the ASA will not hesitate to pour cold water on executions that place protected characteristics on the wrong side of a ""before/after"" divide - no matter how inadvertent the slight. Second, it reminds creatives that diversity isn't a palette you can dip into selectively: representation without equitable portrayal is just window dressing (or, in this case, shower-screen dressing). Finally, it highlights that even a brand whose entire USP is ""healthy skin for everybody"" can trip over its own strapline if the visual grammar sends a different signal.

Will Sanex sales nosedive? Unlikely. Controversy, like exfoliation, can paradoxically leave brands looking brighter in the short term. But the longer-term residue can be harder to rinse away. Consumers have elephantine memories when it comes to campaigns that suggest their skin - literal or metaphorical - needs ""fixing"" more than the next person's.

So what should advertisers take into the next creative brainstorm (along with the biscuits and the mood boards)?

Check your ""before"" pictures. If the problem is always illustrated by the same demographic, your ""after"" won't save you.

Interrogate your palette. The camera never lies, but it can certainly imply. Ask whether the grading, lighting or model sequence creates an unintended hierarchy.

Diversity does not equal immunity. A mixed cast isn't a get-out-of-ASA-jail-free card. It's only stage one.

Meanwhile, somewhere at Colgate HQ, an emergency team is probably story-boarding a follow-up spot featuring a rainbow of skin tones, each glowing like freshly waxed marble. My humble suggestion: perhaps ditch the ""before/after"" trope altogether and celebrate real-world skin exactly as it shows up - cracked, smooth, freckled, melanin-rich, melanin-light and everything in between. Your product can still be the hero; it just doesn't need to imply that some complexions are the villain.

And if you absolutely must do a transformation narrative, try starting everyone in the same shower. We all sing off-key under those echoey acoustics, after all. Now that's inclusivity you can take to the bank - or at least to the bathroom.

In the end, however, it comes back to the conclusion that was reached by another black colleague, AJ Wynter, writing about the controversy caused by a Heinz ad last October. The Heinz ad caused offence by showing the wedding of a mixed race couple but where the black bride's father was apparently absent. AJ asked, ""Will brands take this as an opportunity to embrace diversity authentically, or will they tread the line of performative representation? More crucially, will the voices that need to be amplified - the voices from the communities being depicted - finally be heard?""

Sadly, the answer appears to be 'not yet'. And there is no soft soaping that particular irritation.

"" ""I would have suggested either re-cutting the ad to balance the depiction of symptoms across ethnicities or, better, leading with a neutrally lit mixed-cast montage so no single model is saddled with the ""problem"" visual. I also would have flagged the need to avoid hyper-real audio of scratching, which risks ridicule when attached to a marginalised group."" Angel Skyers, Trainee Solicitor, Lewis Silkin LLP ""

Traders interpret this as a signal that buyers controlled the market from the opening to the closing, often using such patterns to make informed decisions about future price movements.

Notably, Infosys and Phoenix Mills were among the stocks that formed this pattern, suggesting a potential upward trend in these stocks. The ""White Marubozu"" pattern is a strong bullish indicator, often used by traders to anticipate price increases.

Separately, Vertex Minerals (VTX:AU) announced a significant update on August 24, 2025, regarding the Reward Gold Mine Production [2]. The company's Reward gold mine has a current mineral resource estimate of 419,000 tonnes at a high-grade of 16.7 grams per ton (g/t) gold for 225,000 oz contained gold.

Vertex Minerals employs gravity separation technology, a widely recognized, environmentally friendly method for gold recovery. This technique harnesses the natural force of gravity to separate gold from waste rock, significantly reducing the need for harsh chemicals. The company's gravity processing plant is expected to yield several positive outcomes, including an accelerated production timeline, a significant increase in throughput capacity, enhanced operational efficiency, and sustainable mining practices.

The company is led by a highly experienced management and technical team with a successful track record, committed to upholding the company’s strategic objectives and delivering shareholder value. Vertex Minerals is focused on the historic, high-grade Hill End gold property, with the ultimate goal of becoming Australia’s high-grade, green gold producer.

However, the momentum of the stock price is shifting towards the upside, suggesting that it has the potential to continue increasing.

Diageo plc (NYSE: DEO) experienced a significant drop in stock price, triggering an RSI oversold signal and a KDJ golden cross on August 26, 2025, at 13:30. This technical indicator suggests that the stock has reached a support level and may be poised for a rebound. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, while the KDJ (Keltner Channels) are used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

According to the most recent 13F filing with the SEC, Wellington Management Group LLP reduced its stake in Diageo by 0.5% during the first quarter, selling 6,014 shares [1]. This move, along with a semi-annual dividend increase to $2.5192 per share, reflects a shift in investor sentiment [1]. The stock received a mix of ratings, with Goldman Sachs upgrading it from ""sell"" to ""neutral"" while four analysts rated it as a Buy and three maintained a Hold rating, resulting in a consensus rating of ""Hold"" [1].

Several institutional investors have recently added to or reduced their stakes in Diageo. Venturi Wealth Management LLC boosted its holdings by 3.6% during the first quarter, while Aptus Capital Advisors LLC increased its holdings by 5.4% in the fourth quarter. Grove Bank & Trust and Malaga Cove Capital LLC also increased their positions, indicating a mixed sentiment among institutional investors [1].

The current stock price of Diageo is $114.3990, with a 50-day moving average of $104.78 and a 200-day moving average of $107.81. The stock has a market cap of $63.64 billion and a PE ratio of 16.70. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 1.64, and its quick ratio is 0.67 [1].

Despite the recent price drop, the KDJ golden cross and RSI oversold signal indicate that the stock may be undervalued and has the potential for price appreciation. However, investors should remain cautious and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. It is essential to consider both technical and fundamental factors when analyzing a stock.

Over the past 2 years, Agilent has exceeded earnings expectations 100% of the time.

Agilent Technologies (A) is set to release its fiscal Q3 2025 earnings on August 27th, with a consensus EPS estimate of $1.37 and revenue estimate of $1.67 billion. Over the past two years, Agilent has consistently exceeded earnings expectations, a track record that investors are closely watching.

The company's Q3 2025 guidance reveals stark contrasts across its operating segments. The Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) is projected to deliver a staggering 75.2% year-over-year revenue increase to $720.15 million, driven by strong demand for consumables, automation, and services. Conversely, the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group (LDG) is expected to contract by 19.3% to $631.29 million, reflecting softness in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and biopharma markets, as well as normalization post-pandemic [1].

Agilent's Ignite Transformation program has emerged as a critical driver of resilience. The initiative, which focuses on supply chain diversification, pricing discipline, and organizational efficiency, is projected to deliver $130 million in FY25 profit. Early wins include $80 million in annualized savings from organizational agility improvements and $50 million from procurement centralization. These gains are expected to fully offset tariff-related costs by FY26, shielding margins from geopolitical risks [1].

Historically, Agilent's stock has experienced significant volatility. A 35.5% surge in 2021—driven by pandemic-era demand for diagnostics—was followed by declines of 5.5% in 2022, 6.4% in 2023, and 2.7% in 2024. As of July 2025, the stock trades at $120.35, 27.8% below its 52-week high of $153.84 but 19.9% above its 52-week low of $96.43. This range-bound behavior suggests a market that values Agilent's long-term potential but remains cautious about near-term risks [1].

Wall Street analysts have assigned Agilent a “Moderate Buy” rating, with a mean price target of $139.77 (16% above current levels). While eight analysts advocate a “Strong Buy” and eight recommend a “Hold,” the mixed sentiment reflects diverging views on the company's ability to sustain growth in a post-pandemic world [1].

Investors considering an entry into Agilent should weigh the company's strategic pivot toward high-growth areas like PFAS testing and advanced therapies, particularly as its Ignite savings begin to fully materialize in FY26. However, the LDG's underperformance and macroeconomic risks, such as U.S. funding uncertainties for academia and government labs, warrant caution [1].

For now, the stock's 16% upside potential and “Moderate Buy” consensus justify a watchful approach. Those who can stomach near-term volatility may find Agilent's mix of innovation and operational discipline a rewarding long-term bet [1].

Ecolab: Raymond James reinstates Market Perform, no rating change.

Ecolab Inc. (ECL), a leading global provider of water, hygiene, and energy technologies and services, has seen its stock price rise by 3.74% recently, but the market remains cautious due to mixed technical signals and divided analyst ratings. Raymond James has recently reinstated its Market Perform rating for Ecolab, indicating that the firm is waiting for a more compelling risk/reward opportunity before taking a constructive stance on the stock.

The company's stock has been trading near its 52-week high at $278.36, reflecting strong fundamentals and a market capitalization of $79 billion. Ecolab has maintained dividend payments for 55 consecutive years, further bolstering its appeal to investors seeking steady income. However, analysts are divided, with one ""Strong Buy,"" one ""Buy,"" and one ""Neutral"" rating in the last 20 days, indicating a mixed outlook on the company's prospects [1].

Technical indicators for Ecolab are mixed, with the technical analysis score of 4.07 suggesting a ""Weak technology, need to be cautious"" stance over the last five days. Recent indicators include a ""WR Overbought"" signal with a 62.2% win rate and an average return of 0.28%, and an ""RSI Overbought"" signal with a 20% win rate and an average return of -0.45%. These conflicting signals suggest market indecision and volatility, advising investors to wait for clearer trends before acting [2].

Fundamental factors for Ecolab are also mixed, with some strong cash flow metrics but weak growth indicators. The company's net cash flow from operating activities per share has declined by 14.74% year-over-year, and the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio is highly elevated at 148.64. However, the equity multiplier is moderate, and the current ratio remains adequate, indicating liquidity is not a major concern [3].

Recent news has highlighted developments across various sectors that could indirectly benefit Ecolab. Safex Chemicals announced a new manufacturing facility in India to boost crop protection solutions, which could indirectly benefit Ecolab given its presence in industrial and institutional markets. In the U.S., changes to the COVID-19 vaccine policy have sparked uncertainty in healthcare sectors. Meanwhile, Genentech’s Itovebi made headlines with a successful trial in advanced breast cancer, potentially signaling growth in biotech-linked sectors. These events could impact Ecolab’s peers in related industries but may not directly affect Ecolab’s core operations [1].

In other recent news, Ecolab Inc. announced a definitive agreement to acquire Ovivo Electronics for approximately $1.8 billion in cash. This acquisition is aimed at bolstering Ecolab’s capabilities in water solutions for semiconductor manufacturing. Ovivo Electronics is projected to generate sales of $500 million in 2025, and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approvals. Jefferies has responded to this acquisition by raising its price target for Ecolab to $315 from $310, maintaining a Buy rating. Additionally, RBC Capital has reiterated its Outperform rating for Ecolab with a price target of $294 ahead of the company’s investor day [2].

Ecolab's board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.65 per share, marking 88 consecutive years of dividend payments. This dividend will be payable on October 15, 2025, to shareholders recorded by September 16, 2025 [2].

Given the mixed signals and divided analyst ratings, investors should approach Ecolab with caution. While the company's fundamentals and recent acquisitions suggest growth potential, the high PE ratio and weak operating growth indicators are red flags for long-term value. Investors should closely monitor price movements and wait for clearer trends before taking a directional bet [3].

“This year, we have achieved several milestones in renewable energy, including securing an additional 160MW bringing the total renewable energy secured in South Africa, to more than 900MW.
“We are proud to partner with Sasol and Air Liquide, delivering an efficient and cost-effective solution to their decarbonisation needs.
As one of the most successful developers of renewable energy in South Africa, Mainstream is well positioned as a partner of choice for private PPAs.","The Damlaagte PV Facility (“Damlaagte”) has established its commercial operation date, marking the start of a 20-year operational period for this 97.5 megawatt (MW) site. It formally started commercial operations on Saturday 23rd August 2025.

Located near Parys in the Free State province, Damlaagte connects to the Eskom grid and will provide approximately 270 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of clean electricity in its first year of operations. The Damlaagte PV Facility is owned by Mainstream Renewable Power (“Mainstream”), uBuzwe Energy (Pty) Ltd (“uBuzwe”) and the Thembelihle Trust. The site, constructed and operated by Mainstream Renewable Power, is the first renewable energy project to supply power under a landmark joint procurement program by its strategic partners, Air Liquide and Sasol.

The renewable energy from Damlaagte will be supplied to the Secunda site, where Air Liquide owns and operates the world’s largest oxygen production site, following its acquisition of the facility from Sasol in 2020. This PPA is the first to come online from a joint initiative between Air Liquide and Sasol to procure a total of nearly 700 MW of renewable power for these operations. This program is a key enabler for both companies’ ambitious decarbonization roadmaps.

“ Damlaagte PV Facility coming on line marks yet another great accomplishment for us in our journey towards lower carbon intensity ” said Simon Baloyi, Sasol’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “This year, we have achieved several milestones in renewable energy, including securing an additional 160MW bringing the total renewable energy secured in South Africa, to more than 900MW. We are well on track to meet our 2030 Renewable Energy target of up to 2 GW.”

“The Damlaagte commercial operation is a major milestone for the decarbonization of our operations in Secunda, the world’s largest oxygen production site. It is a crucial step toward our goal of reducing CO₂ emissions from the Secunda operations by 30% to 40% by 2031, and a powerful demonstration of our global commitment to decarbonization,” said Nicolas Poirot, CEO, Africa, Middle East & India (AMEI) for Air Liquide.

Energy policy and supply is not only about technology, but also has a substantial influence on economicgrowth and socio-economic development. Construction of Damlaagte started in November 2023, employing almost 2000 people from nearby communities, including Tumahole, Schonkenville, and Vredefort. Damlaagte and its partners, Power China Maanda, LeadEPC, and Tractionel Holdings, utilised the services of local businesses where applicable and established a skills development programme that trained over 100 people.

“uBuzwe, a member of the Kholosani Group of Companies, is an infrastructure investment company, with a portfolio of 17 Renewable Energy assets that are part of our portfolio, uBuzwe has experience in the Solar, Solar Thermal and Wind power generation sectors and currently generates over a 1000 GWh per annum of clean energy. We drive impactful solutions for the development and improvement of critical infrastructure projects across South Africa,” says Indiran Pillay, uBuzwe Director.

“We are proud to partner with Sasol and Air Liquide, delivering an efficient and cost-effective solution to their decarbonisation needs. As one of the most successful developers of renewable energy in South Africa, Mainstream is well positioned as a partner of choice for private PPAs. These agreements are crucial to unlocking the country’s energy constraints, as they can make a significant contribution to our energy security and loadshedding challenges quickly and cost-effectively.

Stocks Look Toward Nvidia and the Fed

The market is solid. It is within a whisker of the high. But this is the last week of August. What will it do when investors start really paying attention again after Labor Day?

There has been some back and forth recently. The indexes pulled back as technology and the AI trade ran out of gas. But then stocks rallied again after the Fed Chairman indicated at the Jackson Hole speech last week that the central bank would finally cut the fed funds rate in September. Wall Street loves rate cuts.

Normally, nothing happens in the market during the last week of August. Investors tend to focus on squeezing in the last bit of summer fun and put everything off until after Labor Day. But artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) will report earnings on Wednesday. The report is important because the AI rally fizzled earlier this month and there is growing speculation of a pullback ahead. Nvidia earnings may determine the near-term direction of tech stocks and, consequently, the market indexes.

But many other stock sectors will be more interested in the Fed. Wall Street is highly confident in a September rate cut. It is largely already priced into stocks. That means speculation about the timing of the next rate cut will move the market next month. The inflation and employment reports, as well as GDP, will be closely watched.

Tariffs are fading as a major market concern. The tech rally may continue or pause. The major focuses will be interest rates and the economy. Investors will be hoping for the Goldilocks scenario where the economy isn’t strong enough to deter the Fed or send longer-term rates higher but not weak enough to adversely affect earnings.

The next couple of weeks will likely determine whether the market rally fizzles or accelerates.

High Yield Tier

AGNC Investment Corporation (AGNC – yield 14.7%) – The mortgage REIT got some long-awaited good news last week when the Fed indicated it is likely to cut the fed funds rate at the September meeting. Lower short-term rates will lower costs for AGNC and raise profit margins. Lower rates will also have a positive effect on net asset value (NAV), which tends to dictate the stock price. Although AGNC has been trending higher since April, it is still well below the 52-week high. AGNC had several rough years during inflation and rising interest rates and is due for much better performance. The rate cuts may finally trigger a sustained rally in the price. HOLD

Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (CQP – yield 6.1%) – The LNG export partnership reported earnings this month that beat on top line and missed slightly on earnings. Revenues jumped over 30% as new capacity came online, but earnings were a few cents below what was expected because of volume snafus and cost overruns. CPQ did reiterate guidance for the year. Parent company Cheniere Energy (LNG) reported an 85% surge in net income on stronger demand and higher cargoes. The two companies will be in sync eventually. Meanwhile, the new deal with the EU features Europe buying $750 billion worth of U.S. energy over three years, the bulk of which will be natural gas. Although CQP has been bouncy, there is mostly good news for the country’s largest LNG exporter, no matter how you slice it. (This security generates a K1 form at tax time.) BUY

Enterprise Product Partners (EPD – yield 6.9%) – The midstream energy partnership reported sluggish earnings as slower natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes somewhat offset record volumes in other areas. Enterprise reported an increase of 7% in distributable cash flow over last year’s quarter. NGL volumes were hurt by tariff and trade uncertainty. But things are about to get better. Enterprise has $6 billion in new projects coming online in the second half that are sure to boost growth. In addition, the trade deal with Europe should ensure high NGL volumes for years to come. EPD is a great buy while it’s still sleeping ahead of likely better days. (This security generates a K1 form at tax time.) BUY

Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN – yield 6.7%) – This more established and conservative BDC remains in the portfolio after FS KKR Capital Corp. (FSK) was sold two weeks ago. MAIN has more dimensions than FSK and can more successfully navigate market changes. The BDC reported strong earnings that beat expectations as net interest income rose 9% and net asset value per share increased 15%. Main also recorded the largest capital gain in its history upon the sale of equity stakes. The regular dividend was raised 2.9% and a supplemental dividend of $0.30 per share was declared, payable in September. But future performance will depend on the economy. HOLD

The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB – yield 3.5%) – After three strong years, WMB has mostly just bounced around this year. It has still returned about 7% YTD, so the performance may be uninspired, but it isn’t bad. Midstream energy companies had been hot for a long time, and this appears to be a consolidation period. But the environment is still highly positive and getting even better. The company expects a higher level of earnings growth in the second half because of rising volumes, pipeline expansions, and a recent acquisition. William also raised yearly guidance slightly. I consider the report a speed bump that makes the stock cheaper and worth acquiring at this price if you don’t own it already. BUY

Dividend Growth Tier

AbbVie (ABBV – yield 3.2%) – Although there is tariff news on drugs still pending and holding back the stocks, ABBV has started moving higher anyway. It’s up over 11% in August and now within 4% of the all-time high. The recent positive news is successful trials in hair loss for the superstar drug Rinvoq. It’s more good news for the immunology drug, which, along with Skyrizi, has combined revenues that already exceeded peak Humira sales when it was the bestselling drug of all time. The company is moving well beyond the Humira patent loss, which had been holding ABBV back. The drug company reported earnings that beat expectations and raised revenue and earnings guidance for this year. ABBV has been moving higher since, as three analysts raised price targets. The tariff issues are still unresolved, but ABBV should be a big winner beyond that issue. HOLD

Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY – yield 3.0%) – After pulling back in July, the online banker stock is up over 10% in the last two weeks and not far from the highest price since last fall. ALLY is getting a boost from last week’s dovish Fed statements about interest rates. In the car loan business, lower rates make loans more affordable, and demand rises. Ally reported earnings earlier this month that soundly beat expectations. Auto-loan applications volume increased, and the company sees credit trends improving. Hopefully, the increasing momentum continues to push the stock price higher. The economy is nowhere near recession. Interest rates are still high but more likely to trend lower from here. HOLD

Broadcom Inc. (AVGO – yield 0.8%) – The AI juggernaut has pulled back from the high and is at the same level as a month ago. The torrid ascent has stopped, for now. That’s not a bad thing. No stock soars higher forever. AVGO is still up 112% from the April low and 30% YTD. There is also important news on the way that could potentially reignite the rally. Bellwether AI company Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings this Wednesday. The market views the results of the company as indicative of the current state of AI. Then, Broadcom reports earnings in the first week of September. The longer-term prognosis is strong because of soaring revenues. The next couple of weeks will likely determine the near-term direction of AVGO. HOLD

Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG – yield 0.8%) – The country’s largest exporter of natural gas reported stellar earnings with 43% revenue growth and an 85% net income increase over last year’s quarter on strong NGL demand and higher margins on its cargoes. Cheniere also reported progress on its expansion and the share buyback program. Meanwhile, the framework of the EU deal involves Europe buying $250 billion in U.S. energy per year, a dramatic increase from previous levels. Natural gas is the most in-demand energy source, and Cheniere is the largest U.S. exporter of natural gas. Trends highly favor strong performance of LNG going forward. BUY

Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG – yield 0.5%) – This nuclear, and soon natural gas, power provider stock has pulled back from the epic rise that peaked early this month. It’s down 12% from the early August high. But it was bound to run out of gas eventually. A consolidation is healthy and overdue. Meanwhile, earnings were solid. But the excitement surrounding the company and the stock is about future growth. The company announced huge deals with Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), and management indicated that more deals were likely on the way. Constellation is in the ideal position to benefit from a massive trend. HOLD

Eli Lilly and Company (LLY – yield 0.7%) – Shares of the drugmaker stock crashed 18% after the second-quarter earnings report revealed disappointing trial results for its oral weight-loss drug Orfoglipron. The market was excited about the hype of the oral drug and was disappointed. But it was likely an overreaction, and LLY has rebounded 14% from earlier this month.

Lilly’s earnings results were spectacular. The company smashed expectations with 38% revenue growth and 91% net income growth over last year’s quarter. Lilly also raised guidance for the year. Existing weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, are killing it with 68% and 172% year-over-year sales growth, respectively. An estimated 30% of Americans are overweight, and the market is massive. Mounjaro sold $5.2 billion in the quarter, putting it on track to be the best-selling drug of all time, and Zepbound, the newer drug, sold $3.4 billion. Even with the still-existing tariff uncertainty, LLY is at a bargain price that is likely to be significantly higher in a year. BUY

Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (FNF – yield 3.3%) – The title insurance giant got a boost last week after the Fed statements. The lower interest rates will be conducive to better affordability, and FNF is up over 12% since early this month. Earnings were solid with 15.1% revenue growth and 22% earnings growth over last year’s quarter. The stock has a great track record and should be poised to thrive if the housing market takes off. In the meantime, performance will depend on the economy and the direction of interest rates. BUY

McKesson Corporation (MCK – yield 0.4%) – The supply chain pharmaceutical company posted earnings that beat expectations. Revenues grew 23.4% but earnings shrank year over year because of a divestiture and rising costs. MCK has pulled back this month and is down 8% from the 52-week high made in early July. The company can overcome the cost issues. It has in the past. Its market continues to grow all by itself because of the aging population. The health care sector is under pressure and will continue to be so in the weeks ahead as pricing and tariff issues are front and center. HOLD

Oracle Corporation (ORCL – yield 0.8%) – Like most of the technology sector, and AI stocks in particular, ORCL has pulled back a little this month. It’s down about 10% from the high. It’s an overdue consolidation after an epic run. Meanwhile, the cloud business is soaring and exceeding expectations and will likely continue to do so. Massive new business deals were announced that will take earnings and revenues to a whole new level in the years ahead. Oracle has morphed from a solid-growth large tech company into an AI darling that is in an ideal position to benefit from the biggest growth catalyst in a generation. The longer term is solid, and Nvidia’s earnings this week could determine the near-term direction of the price. HOLD

Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL – yield 0.7%) Earnings – The homebuilder company reported earnings last week that beat expectations. Toll Brothers reported record sales in the quarter with 8% revenue growth and 3.6% earnings per share growth over last year’s quarter. The environment is one of subdued homebuying because of high mortgage rates. But the future looks strong, and Toll Brothers has a massive backlog of houses to sell going forward.

The previously beleaguered luxury homebuilder stock has been trending higher since April and is getting a big boost lately. The longer-term supply/demand dynamic for housing is hugely favorable to Toll Brothers, as there aren’t nearly enough houses to satisfy the demand. The near-term impediment had been high mortgage rates. Rates have moved lower, as the Fed is likely to cut the short-term rates in September. HOLD

Waste Management, Inc. (WM – yield 1.4%) – WM has pulled back a little amid the market rally following the Fed’s indication that it will lower interest rates in September. It’s not a negative development for the company, but cyclical stocks rallied on the news and WM got neglected. The garbage king reported stellar earnings. The company soundly beat estimates with 19% revenue growth and projected 11.7% earnings growth over the next year. WM tends to be bouncy, although in an upward trend. It can also get neglected when aggressive stocks are rising. The defensive earnings will make WM attractive in a flat or down market, yet it has a history of solid performance in good markets, too. BUY

Safe Income Tier

American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP – yield 3.3%) – This has been a solid utility that has come as advertised. It outperformed in a crummy market and underperformed in good ones. But there is a strong chance that the skyrocketing growth in electricity demand will transform performance into something much better than it has been. Of course, the end of summer malaise, combined with the fact that AEP is a utility, has resulted in zero price movement since it was added to the portfolio two weeks ago. That’s okay. It is well positioned for growth ahead as well as a possible market selloff after Labor Day. BUY

NextEra Energy (NEE – yield 3.0%) – The nation’s largest electric utility reported strong earnings with 9% year-over-year earnings growth, which is very strong for a utility. The company also expects 8% earnings growth through at least 2027 and annual 10% dividend hikes. NEE is near the high end of the recent range but it has pulled back every time it has been around this level over the past year. But the future should be bright as this strong utility also benefits from growing electricity demand. NEE is knocking on the door of recent highs again and hopefully it can break out this time. BUY

USB Depository Shares (USB-PS – yield 5.7%) – Interest rates have remained peskily high this year. But fixed income got a boost over the last week after the Fed indicated a rate cut is coming in September. The recent Fed statement indicates that the trend for interest rates is more likely to be lower than higher in the months ahead. The high yield is safe, and the price could rally over the rest of the year. BUY

Vanguard Long-Term Corp. Bd. Index Fund (VCLT – yield 5.3%) – Ditto for VCLT. The long-term corporate bond ETF loves falling interest rates and hates rising ones. There will be more price pressure if rates continue to rise and vice versa. But the situation over the course of the year should be more positive than it has been.

En pasarela, se presentaron los nuevos productos Lumi y Paradise Big Deal, dos lanzamientos que reflejan las tendencias internacionales más buscadas: piel luminosa y pestañas con volumen extremo.

Un desfile parisino en clave argentina

El reconocido diseñador Fabián Zitta fue el encargado de vestir a las modelos con piezas de alta costura, mientras que Estefanía Novillo, maquilladora oficial de la marca, potenció cada look con los nuevos iluminadores y máscara de pestañas. La gran sorpresa de la noche fue el regreso de Valeria Mazza a la pasarela, acompañada por Mariana Genesio Peña, Anabel Sánchez, Candela Ruggeri y Michelle Masson, Agustina Casanova, entre otras. ¿Los conductores? Fueron Iván De Pineda y Teté Coustarot.

Los lanzamientos estrella

La protagonista indiscutida fue la línea Lumi, que incluye rubores e iluminadores diseñados para usarse solos o combinados. La última incorporación a esta línea fue Lumi Le Stick, los primeros iluminadores en barra de la marca, que ofrecen dos acabados distintos: Le Glass (efecto mojado y reflectivo) y Le Glow (intenso y satinado).

La otra gran novedad fue la máscara de pestañas Paradise Big Deal, con un cepillo cónico de cerdas cruzadas que aporta 20 veces más volumen, y gracias a su efecto construible alarga y separa las pestañas dejando una sensación ligera, sin grumos.

Invitados de lujo

La gala reunió a personalidades de la moda y el espectáculo como Pampita, Zaira Nara y Juana Tinelli, quienes disfrutaron de una experiencia única entre música, belleza y alta costura. Claudia Morinigo, Líder de Marketing de la categoría maquillaje de la marca en Argentina, destacó: “Buscamos generar un concepto donde el maquillaje y la moda se fusionen, dos elementos que forman parte del ADN de L’Oréal Paris. En la Lumière Gala quisimos que los invitados vivieran una experiencia de desfile al estilo parisino con foco en el maquillaje, celebrando las principales incorporaciones al portfolio de este año y creando un espacio de interacción con nuestros productos”.

ID26,L’Oréal,2025-08-27 01:32:35+00:00,www.thetimes.com,AstraZeneca among firms accused of 'funding Putin's war chest' - The Times,"Alex Ralph, James Hurley, Guy Taylor",,,,,https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/economics/article/astrazeneca-russia-ukraine-war-jbj2j09n5,"The Times reported in May that sales and taxes at the Russian business of AstraZeneca rose sharply last year, according to accounts filed at the Moscow tax office.
AstraZeneca’s Russia boss is also a member of Business Russia, a leading Russian business organisation whose congress in May was attended by President Putin.
However, Sir Rocco said selling the Russian hotels “would be very counterproductive”.
Inditex said it ceased Russian operations in March 2022 and exited the market entirely in April 2023.
It said details of the sale were sent to Spanish regulators in October 2022 and that terminating Russian operations cost it about €231 million.","The FTSE 100 pharmaceutical group paid $43 million, making it the 18th highest of the international companies that remain in Russia. It was the only British-based company in the top 20. Other multinationals in the top 20 included Pepsico and L’Oréal.

The report, “Corporate complicity: How global firms bankrolled Russia’s war chest in 2024”, alleged that international firms still operating in Russia had seemingly “chosen profit over principle” and continued “to pay corporate taxes and provide goods, services, and technology” that helped sustain “its war effort”.

Just over half (55 per cent, or 2,326) of the international companies with ties to Russia at the start of 2022, shortly before Russia invaded in February that year, have continued to do business there, the report found.

The remainder have announced they are “completely shutting down” or that they are temporarily reducing operations, it said.

The report said the tax contribution from international companies “is equivalent to nearly half of Russia’s projected military budget for 2025”, showing how foreign companies had continued to bankroll the “Russian war economy”.

The total revenue of foreign businesses in Russia was $201 billion last year, slightly higher than in 2023. Net profit in 2024 was $19.5 billion, the highest level in the past three years.

The report also found that increasing numbers of foreign companies have stopped publishing their financial reports, particularly large corporations, which it said “may reflect an effort by companies to avoid further reputational damage linked to” their Russian operations. Researchers therefore estimated some company figures based on data from previous years “to ensure comparability”.

• Russia faces yet more sanctions. But do they actually work?

Businesses from countries “aligned with the Kremlin”, particularly China and Turkey, continue to grow in the Russian market, the report found.

So-called “unfriendly” countries accounted for 82 per cent of total foreign business revenue last year, down from 95 per cent in 2021.

However, the share of American companies has remained “relatively stable” and the US and Germany, two of Ukraine’s largest bilateral donors, are the biggest corporate contributors to Russia’s economy.

The finance and payments sector was the top profit tax contributor and the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector remained the top revenue generator.

The growth in AstraZeneca’s operations in Russia has come under increased scrutiny this year, given the support from the British government for Ukraine.

The Times reported in May that sales and taxes at the Russian business of AstraZeneca rose sharply last year, according to accounts filed at the Moscow tax office.

Research by The Times has also revealed that AstraZeneca was the main sponsor of a large business event in April where the company’s Russia chief executive spoke alongside senior Kremlin figures, including a politician who is under British sanctions.

AstraZeneca’s Russia boss is also a member of Business Russia, a leading Russian business organisation whose congress in May was attended by President Putin. Its chairman has referred to Ukrainians as neo-Nazis.

• Business live: the latest on companies, markets and economics

Sir Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, vowed in February to continue making payments to Russian doctors and healthcare organisations after analysis by The Times of data issued in Russian showed that the business had spent about £45 million since the war against Ukraine began.

Soriot, 66, said in February that AstraZeneca had a big portfolio in Russia and its “mission is to bring new medicines to patients all over the world”, while “we try to stay away from politics”.

He added that medicines are excluded from sanctions “because they have a responsibility to bring those products to patients”.

A spokesman for AstraZeneca said: “Seven million patients in Russia rely on access to our essential and life-saving medicines … We make these available in line with all regulatory requirements.”

Sir Rocco Forte, the veteran hotelier, also decided to stay, keeping his hospitality group’s two hotels in St Petersburg operating following the 2022 invasion.

Rocco Forte Hotels has an investment in two hotels in the Russian port city and the latest filings show that they produced a pre-tax profit of £900,000 for the London-based group in the last financial year, bringing total profits from its Russian hotels since the war began in 2022 to £2.2 million, research by The Times found.

The luxury hotels owner and operator, which has sites across Europe, calls the 113-year-old Hotel Astoria in St Petersburg an “illustrious landmark” that “sits directly across from St Isaac’s Cathedral”. The group also includes The Angleterre, adjoined to the Astoria.

B4Ukraine, a coalition of nearly 100 civil society organisations that advocates the withdrawal of western firms from Russia, accused Rocco Forte Hotels of a “shameful example of greed triumphing over morality”.

However, Sir Rocco said selling the Russian hotels “would be very counterproductive”. Current rules in the country require a sale at 40 per cent of market value and payment of a 35 per cent “exit levy”, he said. The Russian government or a Russian citizen would be a possible buyer at a “knockdown price”.

Sir Rocco added that the hotel’s business was now entirely from Russian customers so the hotels were not bringing outside investment into the country’s economy. Profits in the subsidiary are effectively ringfenced, he added, due to Russian restrictions on how much money can be extracted from the country.

“We have fully complied with all the sanction rules,” he said, including holding the Russian hotels indirectly via a 60 per cent shareholding in a Russian company.

Inditex, the Spanish owner of fashion brands including Zara, is also facing scrutiny.

The Times has learnt that B4Ukraine wrote to Óscar García Maceiras, Inditex’s chief executive, last month, accusing the owner of Zara of a “fig leaf” departure from Russia.

A Financial Times investigation earlier this year revealed Inditex had injected €65 million into its Russian business and written off €120 million in loans, just before it was sold to the Lebanese Daher family for an undisclosed sum in 2023.

Nataliia Rybalko, a researcher at the Kyiv School of Economics, said at the time she “could think of no other examples of a western company putting money into the Russian business it was selling”.

It has been alleged that senior Inditex employees transferred to the Daher Group ahead of the sale, to help set up four replacement brands selling near-identical products in Russia to Inditex’s own marques.

B4Ukraine questioned whether the departure was “a genuine divestment” or “a transactional restructuring designed to” lay the groundwork for re-entry.

Inditex said it ceased Russian operations in March 2022 and exited the market entirely in April 2023. It said it does not “participate in any way in Daher’s business in Russia nor provides any kind of support to their commercial activities” there. It said details of the sale were sent to Spanish regulators in October 2022 and that terminating Russian operations cost it about €231 million. It said 4,000 people were transferred to the buyer and preservation of jobs was a “priority” of the deal.

Inditex said it had not “done anything improper in relation to its exit from the Russian market”.

A spokesman for L’Oréal said: “Right from the beginning, L’Oréal publicly condemned the invasion. We have gone above and beyond the required EU and US sanctions.

“We’ve closed our own stores in Russia, our directly operated counters in department stores and our own brand ecommerce sites. We’ve also suspended all industrial and state-owned media investments and stopped selling 80 per cent of our brand portfolio, including all brands from our luxury division.

“Our aim has been to keep our operations at a level that would allow us to continue to protect and support our Russian employees and our assets.”

Pepsico was approached for comment.

A UK government spokeswoman said: “Sanctions have deprived Russia of over $450 billion, equivalent to four more years of funding for Russia’s invasion. We have also implemented a wide range of prohibitions on investments in relation to Russia.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fa1adc49f-5b62-482c-bf19-62d25a9e260e.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-27 17:09:55.458904

The closing price is around $4.25 million, sources said.

Christophe Marque’s purchase comes as the Big Apple gears up for New York Fashion Week in mid-September, although Gucci — which was part of February’s New York fashion week — does not appear to be a participant for the spring/summer 2026 shows. Instead, the Italian luxury brand is focused on a reboot, according to reports.

Before joining Gucci, Marque held top roles at DFS Group, an LVMH subsidiary, leading global merchandising and marketing. He started his career at L’Oréal Luxe, working with tony brands like Lancôme, Yves Saint Laurent, and Giorgio Armani, before making his name at Hermès.

The listing hit the market in May.

The ritzy residence is at 420 E. 75th St. — a boutique, seven-story building with just six units that was completed earlier this year.

The turnkey three-bedroom, 3.5-bath unit is 2,350 square feet, takes up a full floor and boasts two private balconies.

A private elevator landing opens to a large center hall. The smashing spread also features a formal library — plus an open great room for entertaining that boasts a wall of oversized windows with tree-top views of East 75th Street, and access to the home’s north-facing balcony.

The unit is also anchored by a roomy chef’s kitchen with a 10-foot island, a trash chute and a hidden walk-in pantry.

The primary bedroom suite features a walk-in closet, a spa-like bath with radiant heat and a south-facing balcony.

Building amenities feature a landscaped roof deck with elevator access and a barbecue. There’s also a residents’ library and a double-height lounge — as well as a private garden, a gym, a pet spa and a bike room.

On Thursday, Ross CEO James Conroy told investors that the chain’s top-performing category for its last quarter was beauty.
But unlike TJX, Ross does not offer online sales.
In February, Conroy took over the CEO role for Ross Stores from Barbara Rentler who led the company for nine years.
Beauty brand Frilliance By Fiona Frills climbs 38,000% on TikTok and plots app launch.","Beauty sales in the off-price category have held strong amid economic pressures. Last week, TJX, parent company to TJ Maxx and Marshall’s, reported 4% comparable sales growth and plans to open an additional 1,800 stores. While the company doesn’t share category sales breakdowns, CEO Ernie Herrman told investors that “customer transactions increased at every division,” and the company raised its annual guidance after its fiscal 2026 Q1 and Q2 exceeded expectations.

TJX has been expanding its beauty portfolio for years with offerings that often mirror that in Target, Sephora and Ulta Beauty, thanks to featured brands like Laneige, Clinique, Kate Somerville, Laura Mercier and Murad, among many others.

Now, Ross Dress for Less is also seeing growth in its beauty section. On Thursday, Ross CEO James Conroy told investors that the chain’s top-performing category for its last quarter was beauty. The off-price chain, which has more than 1,800 locations in the U.S., reported a 5% sales increase to reach $5.5 billion during its Q2 2025 earnings call on Thursday.

“We feel very good about the momentum coming out of the quarter,” said Conroy. During the call, he told investors that “cosmetics was the best merchandise area” for the quarter, with the top sales in beauty found in the Southeast and Midwest. “Kudos to that merchandising team that has gotten that business up,” said Conroy. He added that beauty sales were “better than the chain average” and called beauty a category “that’s gotten a lot of attention over the last few years.”

Similar to TJX, top beauty brands sell into Ross to boost cash liquidity, offload older products or liquidate products after packaging changes or reformulations. They also look to the retailer as a sampling marketing endeavor or to reach consumers trading down for cheaper products, among other reasons. But unlike TJX, Ross does not offer online sales.

Ross shoppers have shared their hauls on TikTok, Reddit and YouTube. Videos and posts reviewed by Glossy have included brands like Urban Decay, Josie Maran, Ole Henriksen, First Aid Beauty, Buxom, Hourglass, COSRX, Briogeo, Too Faced, Nars, Clinique and many more.

Ross launched in 1982 and currently operates 1,847 stores in 44 states, as well as 358 dd’s Discount stores in 22 states. The company opened 28 new stores in the first half of the year and plans to add 52 more this year, with a focus on locations in New York City and its first locations in Puerto Rico.

In February, Conroy took over the CEO role for Ross Stores from Barbara Rentler who led the company for nine years. His CV includes Boot Barn and Claire’s. His arrival could mean a shift in focus toward beauty.

According to Placer.ai, a location analytics firm that charts foot traffic, Ross foot traffic was up 5.8% during its Q2 and 7.1% in July. It beat competitors TJX and Burlington in repeat customer visits. According to the firm, the share of visitors frequenting Ross at least twice a month in Q2 2025 grew to 28.9%, up from 27.0% in Q1 2025 and 28.4% in Q2 2024.

“A divide has emerged between value-oriented and discretionary retail,” said R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. “Q2 earnings reports highlighted this split … as consumers hunt for bargains.”

Executive moves:

Michael Fiddelke will take over the CEO role of Target effective February 1, 2026. Fiddelke is Target’s current COO and will replace Brian Cornell as CEO after an 11 year tenure. The change was fueled by two and a half years of flat or falling sales for the retailer and ongoing protests around the retailer’s DEI policy rollbacks.

Natasha Vaquer is the new co-head of brand partnerships of UTA Talent Agency’s UTA Creators division. Vaquer previously served as SVP of talent partnerships and influencer strategy at Refinery29.

News to know:

L’Oréal is investing $80 million into the expansion of its manufacturing facilities in Mexico. It’s part of the industry’s wider investment in near-shoring manufacturing into Mexico as brands work toward diversifying their supply chains away from Asia. The conglomerate plans to use the $80 million to expand its facilities in San Luis Potosí and Mexico City in 2026.

Australian sunscreen brand Ultra Violette is pulling its Lean Screen sunscreen from shelves after a June investigation by Choice, an Australian consumer advocacy publication, found that it provided less sun protection than advertised. The brand first denied the claims that its formula did not offer the SPF level printed on the package but acknowledged its mistake on Friday after completing its own tests. In a message to consumers, the brand said it would no longer be working with the contract manufacturer that made the formula or the testing company Ultra Violette employed. It will also be revamping its own internal testing protocols.

Louis Vuitton’s first cosmetics line, called La Beauté, is set to launch on Friday in Louis Vuitton stores and online. The line has already made headlines thanks to its sky-high price points: $250 for eyeshadow and $160 for lipstick, available in 55 shades, and lip balm, available in 10. Makeup artist Pat McGrath serves as the line’s creative director.

Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty has partnered with Mexican seasoning brand Tajin for a cheek and lip color set inspired by the iconic product’s red hue. The duo is available for $30 DTC and through Sephora.

In an era where body- and skin-care brands are launching hair care, Tracee Ellis Ross is going the opposite direction. The star’s hair-care brand, Pattern Beauty, entered the body-care category with Thursday’s launch of body wash, oil, cream and more. The line will sell DTC and through Ulta Beauty and Sephora in the coming weeks. Pattern Beauty was incubated by Beach House Group.

Stat of the week:

The U.S. prestige beauty market grew by 2% to reach $16 billion during the first half of the year, while sales at mass merchants increased 4% to reach $34.6 billion, according to a new report from market research company Circana. Standouts include prestige fragrance and hair-care sales, which each increased by 6%.

In the headlines:

With the rise of the chief AI officer, it’s time to examine ‘czar’ culture. Many Target stores will stop fulfilling online orders. Beauty brand Frilliance By Fiona Frills climbs 38,000% on TikTok and plots app launch. Rise in foodie perfumes may be linked to weight-loss drugs. Is petcare the next luxury opportunity?

Repatha was first approved in 2015 and has been used by more than 5 million people worldwide.
By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.
Repatha is approved in more than 74 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union.","Aug. 25, 2025 — Amgen has announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has broadened the approved use of Repatha (evolocumab) to include adults at increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) due to uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), commonly known as ""bad cholesterol."" The update removes a prior requirement for a patient to have been diagnosed with cardiovascular (CV) disease.

""Far too many adults at risk of cardiovascular disease are not achieving their LDL-C goals, despite it being one of the most modifiable risk factors for a heart attack or stroke,"" said Murdo Gordon, executive vice president of Global Commercial Operations at Amgen. ""This label update highlights the real-world need for additional treatment options for at-risk patients. Repatha is an effective therapy for reducing LDL-C, particularly in patients whose disease remains uncontrolled with statins or who cannot tolerate them.""

In addition to expanding Repatha's label to include adults at increased risk of MACE, the FDA also:

expanded the use of Repatha alone (monotherapy) to include patients with a rare, genetic form of high cholesterol known as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH); and

emphasized that Repatha should be used alongside diet and exercise for managing high cholesterol.

Repatha was first approved in 2015 and has been used by more than 5 million people worldwide.

Repatha is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels. The clinical benefits and safety of Repatha have been studied for 15 years in 50 clinical trials with over 57,000 patients.

Repatha is approved in more than 74 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.",http://www.dicardiology.com/sites/default/files/Amgen%20Repatha.png,N,,2025-08-27 17:03:45.170530

Goldman Sachs has downgraded Deutsche Bank (DBK:GR) stock to Neutral from Buy, while maintaining a price target of EUR34.00. The investment bank cited the stock's recent rally and a valuation that is now considered ""broadly fair"" [1]. Despite the downgrade, Goldman Sachs expects Deutsche Bank to continue improving its profitability and outperform consensus earnings expectations for both 2025 and 2026.

The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.36x, which is slightly undervalued based on Fair Value estimates. However, GuruFocus estimates suggest a potential downside of 49.89% relative to its GF Value of $18.45.

Institutional investors have shown strong interest in Deutsche Bank, with Wellington Management Group LLP increasing its holdings by 301.7% during the first quarter. Other institutional investors, such as GAMMA Investing LLC, have also significantly increased their stakes, indicating robust interest in the stock [2].

Deutsche Bank reported a quarterly revenue of $9.21 billion, exceeding analysts' forecasts despite an earnings miss of $0.54 EPS against an expected $0.78. Analysts from BofA Securities anticipate that changes in Germany’s fiscal policies will benefit Deutsche Bank starting in the second half of 2026. They project Germany’s GDP to grow by 1.5-1.8% in the third and fourth quarters of that year [1].

The bond repair giant has acquired the Boston-based biotech company for an undisclosed sum as part of “its commitment to product innovation”.

Purvala Bioscience was founded in 2020 by Dr Bradley Olsen and develops bio-inspired technologies with applications across the health and beauty industries.

Dr Olsen, who also serves as a Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT in the US, is focused on the creation of molecules inspired by naturally occurring biological structures.

“Since the very beginning, Olaplex was founded on the concept of innovation, with its original groundbreaking technology designed to empower stylists and their clients to achieve transformative results,” said Olaplex CEO Amanda Baldwin.

“Scientific breakthroughs are what continue to inspire us as we remain committed to delivering the best possible products for our stylist community and our consumers.

“What we have accomplished to date has already left such a meaningful impact on our industry.

“And we believe that with Purvala Bioscience we have the potential to create the next generation of disruptive science-backed product innovation alongside our patent-protected bond-building technology, Bis-amino.""

This is the first acquisition Olaplex has made since launching more than ten years ago.

The hair care brand is best known for its bond-building product formulations.

Beauty mergers and acquisitions have been hotting up this year.

L’Oréal has bought both hair care brand Color Wow and vitamin A skin care specialist Medik8 to strengthen its portfolio.

Unilever has snapped up male grooming brand Dr. Squatch and personal care brand Wild to further cement its position in the personal care space.

Plus, Hailey Bieber’s Rhode has been acquired by e.l.f. Beauty for US$1bn.

L'Oréal, Modelo, Moët & Chandon and others. With Nauta's platform, importers have reduced detention costs by up to 80 percent, increased operator ...","Nauta Raises $7M to Modernize Global Logistics with AI

Co-founded by Valentina Jordan, who led product and engineering teams at logistics unicorn Rappi, and Rafael Santiago, who led one of the preeminent importing logistics companies in the Caribbean, Nauta addresses this opportunity by equipping importers who own, generate, and manage this data, with an AI-powered, single source of truth and control center. With its flexible, agentic capabilities, Nauta automates routine workflows, gives importers the control they need to grow margins, and drives agile, data-driven actions.

“Nauta is built by and for operators,” said Valentina Jordan, CEO and co-founder of Nauta. “We truly understand the variability in their day-to-day work and are focused on helping them control the controllable. In logistics, every container tells its own story, but the systems involved rarely speak the same language. With AI, Nauta helps companies make faster, more proactive decisions about every shipment, reducing risk, improving cash flow, and growing margins.”

Since its launch in Q1 2025, Nauta is now servicing importers in seven countries and works with leading distributors of globally recognized brands, including New Balance, Ashley Furniture HomeStore, L'Oréal, Modelo, Moët & Chandon and others. With Nauta’s platform, importers have reduced detention costs by up to 80 percent, increased operator productivity by 30 percent, and improved container processing times by 75 percent. In addition to the institutional funds, participation in this round includes angel investors Simón Borrero (CEO and co-founder, Rappi), Waikit Lau (Founder, RemoteHQ), and Juan Jose Gonzales (CEO, Windmar Energy) as well as a range of early Nauta customers and partners including Soriana, one of the largest retailers across the Americas.

“Supply chains don’t just move goods, they also move data and money,” said Camila Saruhashi, Partner at Construct Capital. “That complexity increases significantly with cross-border shipments, where every touchpoint adds layers of documentation, compliance, and coordination. With so many stakeholders and systems involved, Nauta’s AI platform is well-positioned to bring structure and visibility to this vital process, connecting the dots between every node, from manufacturers to ports to warehouses.”

Global Trade Requires AI-Native Solutions

In 2024, U.S. trade in goods surpassed $5.3 trillion, with imports from Asia and Latin America alone exceeding $2.3 trillion. Food distributors and CPG companies are especially vulnerable, navigating demand fluctuations, delivery delays, and cost volatility with tools ripe for evolution. According to McKinsey, over 70 percent of supply chain leaders say they’ve had to reconfigure their global footprint in the past 12 months, yet most teams are still stuck reacting to issues after they’ve already occurred.

“Importers don’t just need visibility, they need the power to act before problems occur,” said Rafael Santiago, COO and co-founder of Nauta. “We built Nauta because we lived through the pain of fragmented information and manual workflows prone to costly mistakes. Operators deserve modern AI tools that anticipate issues and enable action at the speed of trade.”

The new capital will accelerate Nauta’s global expansion. The company is actively recruiting sales and partnerships talent; interested candidates can visit www.getnauta.com.",http://hfbusiness.com/portals/0/logo_HFB_fb1.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:10:30.826472

The Naira came under foreign exchange (FX) pressure on Tuesday, August 26, as its value further weakened against the US Dollar in the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market (NAFEM) at the close of transactions.

According to data obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Nigerian currency lost N1.11 or 0.07 per cent against the greenback yesterday to sell for N1,537.61/$1, in contrast to the N1,536.51/$1 it was traded on Monday.

However, the domestic currency appreciated against the Pound Sterling in the official market during the session by N1.47 to close at N2,074.24/£1 compared with the previous day’s N2,075.71/£1 and gained N4.45 against the Euro to close at N1,793.17/€1 versus Monday’s closing price of N1,797.62/€1.

In the parallel market, the Nigerian Naira depreciated against the Dollar yesterday by N2 to trade at N1,547/$1 compared with the preceding session’s rate of N1,545/$1.

There has been a rising demand for the US Dollar by eligible corporate FX users seeking foreign payments, pushing the central bank to inject FX into the system.

AIICO Capital Limited, in a note, said the interbank NFEM saw increased FX demand against a limited supply.

Meanwhile, Nigeria’s external reserves could rise to about $45 billion by the end of the year, according to market analysts. According to Cowry Assets Management, the momentum of reserve growth appears likely to continue, supported by steady offshore inflows and potential external borrowings planned by the government.

But, this is hinged on global risk conditions remaining broadly supportive and offshore flows not significantly disrupted. With the reserves position strengthening, the CBN will have greater flexibility to sustain its interventionist approach in the FX market.

As for the cryptocurrency market, it grew during the session as traders jumped back in after Monday’s sell-off. Traders seized lower prices as an opportunity to re-enter the market.

Analysts warn of overheated sentiment ahead of Friday’s PCE inflation data, a key signal for the US Federal Reserve next move.

Also, investors and traders remain widely optimistic due to expectations of monetary easing and increased institutional demand, with Solana (SOL) expanding by 7.4 per cent to $203.06.

Dogecoin (DOGE) appreciated by 4.5 per cent to $0.2205, Ethereum (ETH) rose by 3.7 per cent to $4,594.36, Cardano (ADA) increased by 2.9 per cent to $0.8642, Ripple (XRP) grew by 2.8 per cent to $3.00, Litecoin (LTC) jumped by 2.2 per cent to $113.48, Binance Coin (BNB) soared by 1.6 per cent to $859.24, and Bitcoin (BTC) advanced by 0.9 per cent to $111,273.21, while the US Dollar Tether (USDT) and the US Dollar Coin (USDC) closed flat at $1.00 each.",https://businesspost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alternative-Bourse-NASD-Securities.png,N,,2025-08-27 16:58:58.594174

Dive Brief:

Colgate-Palmolive plans to optimize its global supply chain as part of a three-year, $200 million to $300 million productivity program, CFO Stanley Sutula told investors on an Aug. 1 earnings call.

The initiative will also include restructuring parts of the personal and home care company's organizational framework and streamlining operations to reduce overhead and increase efficiency, per the company's Q2 earnings statement.

""We're not going to go into detailed specifics here, but as we said, it would be a combination of optimizing our supply chain and then looking at areas where we think that we can optimize where we have our allocation of resources,"" Sutula said.

Dive Insight:

Colgate-Palmolive, like many manufacturers, is leveraging its supply chain as a source for higher productivity, lower costs and operational efficiency. In June, Procter & Gamble unveiled plans to reorganize its network as part of a two-year restructuring project.

Colgate-Palmolive's latest productivity program comes less than 12 months after it completed a two-year initiative that included streamlining the company's supply chain to reduce structural costs, per the company's latest annual report.

However, the company’s subsequently leaner supply chain faces different macroeconomic conditions than when Colgate-Palmolive completed the effort at the end of 2024.

""Colgate-Palmolive is dealing with volatile and rising costs due to tariff increases, higher raw and packaging material costs and lower category inflation, which leaves less room to raise retail prices in response to rising costs in other parts of the business,"" CEO Noel Wallace said on the earnings call.

Colgate-Palmolive's supply chain has also had to respond quickly to demand changes fueled by consumer uncertainty, Wallace said. That includes adjusting to consumer preferences when they shift between more expensive product multipacks and less expensive single packs or smaller sizes.

""We can then leverage our global supply chain's breadth, resiliency and agility to respond to these changes in consumer preference,"" Wallace said.

In releasing its Q2 earnings, Colgate-Palmolive lowered its projected 2025 tariff costs to $75 million from the $200 million stated in its Q1 earnings call. The latest estimate is based on tariffs announced and finalized as of July 31, per an earnings presentation.

3. Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab has received a mixed but generally optimistic set of ratings from analysts:

Simple Average Rating: 4.00 (out of 5)

Historical Performance-Weighted Rating: 5.47

Rating Consistency: Mixed, with one ""Strong Buy,"" one ""Buy,"" and one ""Neutral"" rating in the past 20 days.

Price Trend Match: Current price is up 0.63%, aligning with a weighted optimistic market expectation.

Key fundamental factor values (with internal diagnostic scores) include:

Net cash flow from operating activities per share (YoY growth rate %): -14.74% — score: 1 (weak)

PE: 148.64 — score: 4 (cautious)

Net cash flow from operating activities (YoY growth rate %): -15.02% — score: 2 (very weak)

Total profit / EBIT (%): 90.59% — score: 2 (cautious)

Cash-UP: 0.65 — score: 3 (moderate)

CFOA: 2.96% — score: 3 (moderate)

Cost of sales ratio (%): 55.48% — score: 1 (weak)

Equity multiplier (DuPont analysis %): 255.14% — score: 3 (moderate)

Current ratio: 144.15% — score: 2 (cautious)

Cash-MV: -53.95% — score: 1 (very weak)

While some fundamentals remain strong, the recent operating cash flow and net profit margins are weak indicators. Investors should monitor upcoming earnings and balance sheet changes.

4. Money-Flow Trends

Big-money flows show a positive overall trend, with large and extra-large institutional flows at 50.79% and 50.15% inflow ratios respectively, indicating confidence from major investors. In contrast, retail flows are negative, with small investors showing a net outflow at 49.79%.

This contrast between institutional and retail sentiment suggests a divergence in market psychology. Big money remains optimistic, but individual investors appear cautious or bearish in the short term.

5. Key Technical Signals

Technical indicators present a mixed and uncertain market. The internal diagnostic score is 4.17 (0-10), with weak technology and a need for caution as the main takeaway. Here's a breakdown of the recent signals:

RSI Overbought: internal diagnostic score: 1 — bearish bias, with a 20% historical win rate.

Marubozu White: internal diagnostic score: 1 — bearish bias, with a 12.5% win rate.

Bearish Engulfing: internal diagnostic score: 7.82 — bullish bias, with a high 71.43% win rate.

These patterns suggest a highly volatile market with conflicting signals — bearish and bullish — over the past five days. The lack of a clear trend reinforces the need for caution.

6. Conclusion

Ecolab presents a mixed investment outlook. Fundamentally strong, with a solid institutional flow, it is currently facing conflicting technical signals and weak cash flow growth.

Ecolab (ECL) shares have seen a mixed performance recently, with a 3.74% rise but facing uncertain technical signals and mixed analyst ratings. The stock's technical analysis score of 4.07 indicates a need for caution, with indicators like the RSI being overbought and bearish engulfing signals present [1].

Analysts have shown divided ratings, with one ""Strong Buy,"" one ""Buy,"" and one ""Neutral"" rating in the last 20 days. The average rating score is 4.00, while the performance-weighted score is 5.47. Despite the optimistic ratings, fundamentals reveal weak operating growth and a high 148.64 P/E ratio, with net cash flow from operating activities declining by 14.74% year-over-year [1].

Strong institutional and retail inflows, with an inflow ratio of 0.51, suggest market optimism. However, the overall technical picture is volatile, with conflicting signals and no clear direction. The recent expansion of Safex Chemicals in India and growth in Asia-Pacific ETFs could indirectly benefit Ecolab, but broader market risks, such as U.S.-China export restrictions, pose concerns [2].

Ecolab's current market position is precarious, with mixed fundamentals and technical indicators. The best course of action for investors may be to wait for a clearer trend before committing to a directional bet. A pull-back or breakout in the near term could provide a better entry point.
