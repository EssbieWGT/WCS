The company is rolling out a new prompt-based video editor inside Adobe Firefly, along with additional third-party image and video models, including Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 and Topaz Labs’ Astra.

Until now, Firefly’s video tools were largely generation-only. If one part of a clip didn’t work, you had to regenerate the entire video from scratch. The new editor changes that.

You can now make precise, text-based edits to existing video clips, using prompts to tweak specific elements like colors, lighting, subjects, and even camera movement. Think instructions such as “Change the sky to overcast,” or “Zoom in slightly on the main subject,” applied directly to the clip instead of starting over.

Firefly also gets a timeline-based editing view, making it easier to adjust frames, audio, and other details in a way that feels closer to traditional video editors.

Under the hood, Adobe is expanding Firefly’s model lineup. Through Runway’s Aleph model, users can issue targeted visual instructions, while Adobe’s own Firefly Video Model now lets you upload a reference frame or a sample camera movement and ask Firefly to recreate that motion in your video.

On the quality side, Topaz Astra is being added for AI upscaling, allowing creators to enhance videos up to 1080p or 4K. And on the image side, FLUX.2 is coming to Firefly across platforms immediately, with availability for Adobe Express users starting in January.

Adobe is also introducing collaborative boards, hinting at a more team-oriented future for Firefly as it competes with fast-moving AI image and video platforms.

To drive adoption, Adobe is offering a temporary perk: subscribers to Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, and the 7,000- and 50,000-credit plans will get unlimited generations from all image models and the Adobe Firefly Video Model inside Firefly until January 15.

This update caps off a busy year for Adobe’s AI push. In 2025 alone, Firefly expanded from standalone image generation into a full cross-platform app with mobile support, subscriptions, and a growing ecosystem of third-party models.

The chaos started during the Christmas weekend, and its impact is still being felt, as thousands of flights were disrupted by a powerful winter storm. The storm, which caused widespread cancellations and delays, has forced these airlines to ground planes and scramble to rebook stranded passengers.

Delta, along with its counterparts like JetBlue and United, was hit hard, with hundreds of flights canceled and thousands of travellers left in limbo at airports across the country. This Christmas nightmare has led to a travel hell for many, making it one of the most challenging holiday seasons for both passengers and airlines.

As we move into Sunday, the new update shows that the situation remains critical, with little relief in sight. If you’re flying in the coming days, be prepared for more disruptions. Travel And Tour World urges readers to keep reading to understand the full impact of this travel nightmare and how these airlines are responding to the ongoing crisis.

The US is reeling from the impact of Storm Devin, a catastrophic winter weather event that has crippled airports and disrupted air travel during the peak holiday season. This storm has caused chaos across the country, with JetBlue, Delta, American Airlines, and United Airlines among the hardest-hit carriers. More than 1,800 flights have been cancelled, and 22,000 flights delayed, creating a nightmare for holiday travelers. From New York to California, the storm has affected flights nationwide, leaving passengers stranded in airports for hours. As severe weather continues to wreak havoc, these airlines are scrambling to rebook passengers, but the disruptions aren’t expected to end anytime soon. This article takes a deep dive into the airline cancellations and delays, shedding light on how this unprecedented winter storm is reshaping holiday travel in the United States.

JetBlue Hit Hard by Winter Chaos: Over 350 Flights Canceled

The winter storm Devin has wreaked havoc on JetBlue Airways, which has been one of the most affected carriers during this brutal storm. Over 350 JetBlue flights have been cancelled due to the extreme weather conditions sweeping through the Northeast US. Major hubs like JFK, Boston Logan, and Newark Liberty were particularly impacted, with hundreds of passengers stranded in terminals. According to Reuters, JetBlue quickly waived change fees for affected travellers, providing rebooking options to help them get home during the busy holiday season. Despite these efforts, delays and cancellations continue to mount. With snowstorms and freezing rain battering the Northeast, it’s clear that the airline is facing one of its toughest holiday seasons yet.

The storm didn’t just affect JetBlue’s operations but also brought travel chaos to major East Coast airports. JFK Airport, known for its high traffic during the holidays, had significant delays as JetBlue scrambled to accommodate rebooked passengers. As the storm raged on, passengers were left frustrated by long queues, limited services, and heightened tension. The situation remains challenging, with more cancellations expected as the storm continues.

Delta Airlines Struggles to Keep Up: Over 200 Flights Canceled

Next up, Delta Air Lines has been hit hard by the storm, with over 200 flights cancelled during the peak of the winter chaos. Like JetBlue, Delta also has a heavy presence in New York, Atlanta, and Detroit, which all saw widespread disruptions. Passengers reported significant delays and confusion at terminals as Delta tried to manage the high volume of affected travellers. In the wake of this disruption, Delta activated its flexible travel policies, allowing passengers to change their flights without incurring additional fees. However, with over 22,000 flights delayed nationwide, the airline’s efforts to rebook passengers have been limited by the sheer scale of the storm’s impact.

The cancellations and delays have been particularly concentrated at major Delta hubs such as Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, Minneapolis-Saint Paul (MSP), and LaGuardia Airport. Passengers were advised to check with the airline for real-time updates on their flights and expected wait times. Delta’s quick response to waive change fees is a crucial step to helping ease the burden on travellers, but the delays continue to affect their operations well into the holiday period.

American Airlines Faces Mass Disruptions

American Airlines was not immune to the storm’s wrath, with over 140 flights cancelled due to hazardous weather conditions. With severe snowstorms gripping the Northeast and the Midwest, American Airlines struggled to maintain operations during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. Major airports like Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) and Chicago O’Hare saw high numbers of cancellations and delays, with many passengers left stranded.

American Airlines was quick to respond with flexible rebooking options, offering customers the chance to change their flight schedules without penalties. However, given the large number of affected travellers, passengers were still facing long waits, extended processing times, and overcrowded terminals. The holiday travel surge was already a challenging prospect, but the storm made it much worse. For those lucky enough to rebook, many faced connections that were severely delayed, further disrupting their holiday plans.

United Airlines and the Storm’s Lingering Effects: 97 Flights Grounded

While United Airlines wasn’t as severely affected as some other major carriers, it still faced 97 cancellations as a result of the storm. As one of the top airlines in the Midwest, United Airlines operates many flights through airports like Chicago O’Hare, which experienced significant disruptions. The airline was also impacted by snowstorms and icy conditions in other parts of the country, particularly affecting flights to and from airports like Denver International and San Francisco International.

United Airlines took swift action to help passengers, waiving rebooking fees and offering flexible travel options to assist those who were unable to make their originally scheduled flights. While the storm’s impact on United was less intense compared to other airlines, it still created a ripple effect across the network, with thousands of passengers facing delays as they waited to board their rescheduled flights.

Storm Devin: A Travel Nightmare for Thousands of Passengers

Storm Devin has proven to be one of the most severe winter storms in recent memory. According to reports, the storm caused widespread disruptions across the Northeast, causing over 1,800 flight cancellations and leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded in airports. This storm doesn’t just affect the airlines; it also has a knock-on effect on the American economy, with travel spending declining as people delay or cancel their holiday plans.

In the wake of this storm, many airports, including JFK, Boston Logan, and Philadelphia International, experienced significant delays and cancellations. With limited staffing due to the holidays, managing this influx of affected passengers has been a monumental challenge. Passengers are advised to stay updated with their airlines and consider alternate routes if possible. The extent of the storm’s impact has left many questioning how the airline industry will cope with future weather-related disruptions.

The Holiday Travel Surge: A Look at the Bigger Picture

While Storm Devin may have caused major disruptions, it highlights a bigger issue facing the airline industry: the increasing strain on airports and air traffic during peak seasons. The holiday period is always a busy time, but the recent surge in flight cancellations and delays due to severe weather demonstrates how vulnerable the system is to such events. As the US continues to face unpredictable weather patterns, airlines must invest in more robust systems to handle such crises efficiently.

Airlines like JetBlue, Delta, American, and United are doing their best to mitigate these issues, but as the storm continues to wreak havoc, many flights are still up in the air — quite literally. The recovery process will take days, if not weeks, with some passengers still stranded or rebooking their flights at the last minute. This article serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of holiday travel and the importance of preparing for unexpected disruptions.

On December 16, S&P Global Ratings reiterated a B- Issuer credit rating for Strategy Inc (NASDAQ:MSTR), citing the company’s stable outlook.

According to the ratings firm, the establishment of a US$ reserve is a credit positive that affirms the company’s ability to mitigate liquidity risks associated with funding preferred dividend and coupon payments. The reserve is expected to prefund payments for 12 to 24 months before the company defers payments or sells Bitcoin.

While the company has lost about 40% of its market value due to a decline in Bitcoin prices, it maintains strong access to capital markets. It raised $700 million in November through a euro-denominated preferred stock offering. It has also funded its nearly $1.5 billion in reserves through the issuance of common stock.

Meanwhile, on December 5, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brett Knoblauch reiterated an Overweight rating but cut the price target to $229 from $560. According to the research firm, fears about the company are overblown, as it is not under any obligation to sell Bitcoin. Likewise, the company has enough cash to fund dividends for 21 months, with Bitcoin valued at $60.7 billion.

In den USA erhielten die Dänen eine Zulassung für eine oral zu verabreichende Variante des Abnehmmittels Wegovy. Es ist das erste Medikamente dieser Art, welches bereits im Januar seinen Marktstart feiern soll.

Damit ist Novo Nordisk der Konkurrenz einen Schritt voraus, was zu Wochenbeginn noch mit Kursgewinnen von mehr als sieben Prozent bedacht wurde. Am Freitag ließt die Stimmung an der Walltstreet aber wieder etwas nach. Der höhere Kurs konnte sich konsolidieren. Für weitere Kursgewinne reichte es indes nicht.

Immer schön vorsichtig

Eine Rolle dürfte dabei eine Einschätzung von BMO Capital gespielt haben. Dort blickt man eher nüchtern auf die jüngsten Neuigkeiten und warnt davor, dass der zeitliche Vorsprung vor der Konkurrenz nur von kurzer Dauer sein dürfte. Tatsächlich plant Eli Lilly derzeit damit, im Frühjahr einen Zulassungsantrag für eine Abnehmpille in die Wege zu leiten.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Novo Nordisk?

Die Analysten bleiben letztlich bei einet neutralen Einschätzung und das Kursziel von 46 US-Dollar sieht nun sogar eine spürbare Korrektur vor. In Panik gerieten die Aktionäre deshalb zwar noch nicht. Doch am Freitag ging es um 0,3 Prozent bis auf 52,40 Dollar abwärts.

Novo Nordisk unter Beobachtung

Ankommen wird es nun darauf, dass Novo Nordisk seine Zulassung auch zu neuen Umsätzen und Gewinnen nutzen kann. Dabei bleibt manche Frage offen. Etwa, wie viele neue Kunden sich für das frische Medikament finden lassen und wie viele schlicht von Abnehmspritzen wechseln. Grenzenlose Euphorie kommt offenbar noch nicht auf und trotz der Erholung vor den Feiertagen bleibt der Chart ein eher trauriger Anblick.

Editor's note: This interview was filmed on Dec. 17, 2025.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you for making time.

BANK OF AMERICA CEO BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's great to be here. Good to see you again.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about the state of the economy, because our CBS polling is showing that the most Americans asked this question say their holiday items are hard to afford.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah.

BRENNAN: They're pulling back because incomes are not keeping up with inflation. But it's a very different story. When you look at the upper income brackets, I know you see data of actual transactions. Are people doing what they tell us they're doing?

MOYNIHAN: So- so we not only see it in the aggregate, we also see it in pieces. And so if you look in the aggregate, the amount spent through the Thanksgiving weekend, on you know, Black Friday and Cyber Monday through all the month of November and the first part of December, it's- it's up four- four and a quarter, four and a half percent versus last year's November. And so it's growing. And then if you look by terciles, three buckets of income levels, it's clear the people in the bottom income level, at lower income levels are spending a little faster growth rate, but still growing and in the middle and upper faster. So, you know, what they're telling you is, what they feel, what they're actually seeing, is spending is really solid, reasonably solid heading into the end of the year, and it's been kind of going along like that all of December. Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending they have good credit quality. They are employed, and wait- we can see wages growing in as people's paychecks come in at a 3% clip. So it's a- it's pretty solid right now.

BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper income brackets? Is it that K shaped economy some people talk about--

MOYNIHAN Our team puts the- looks at this. Yes, it the growth rate difference is higher, but all of- all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing.

BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?

MOYNIHAN: That's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.

BRENNAN: Why do you think people have sentiment that's low but spending that's higher?

MOYNIHAN: It's- you hear about it, you've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that- because we had a very, a very strange process from 20 through now, we had COVID lockdown, then we had all the stimulus, and we had high inflation, and then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, Here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's- they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times, and so they saw the inflation and 20 and 23 and 24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist, and it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into 26 having come through 25 the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at they think inflation keeps working its way down. But it's- it's what people feel, and you can't discount that. And it's also at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on. But, but it's, it's not widespread at four, you know, 4.6% unemployment in the last number they publish, that's still in the- in our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly,

BRENNAN: And what do you see then as the biggest risk to the economy?

MOYNIHAN Well, when you look out ahead, it's, it's it's the question wars is another thing that could really shake up the markets. But the real question is- is- will the consumer keep spending in the US? We have the US economy growing about 2.4% next year. We have in- but that's dependent upon a consumer that stays engaged. If the consumer becomes less engaged as we move into 20- from 25 into 26 and slows down their spending. That's going to slow down the economy. So that's a risk. You just don't see it anywhere now. The second risk is wars and other things that could go on that could create shocks to the market. And you know, then there's the usual things, cyber events and things like that. But the real risk is, will the Americans, if the companies of America employ people and pay them a little bit more, they will spend an economy in the US will be fine, and then you have these investments in the stimulus from the uh, the tax act, you have the stimulus from some of the investments coming in that are keep kicking in. And that's why our team went from one and a half percent, probably four months ago, to two and a half percent, 2.4% for 26 now, yeah.

BRENNAN: Okay, so in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system. It was a big concern, but Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?

MOYNIHAN: Well, I think- if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses--

BRENNAN: There was shock--

MOYNIHAN: --and medium size businesses--

BRENNAN: There was shock.

MOYNIHAN: They were shocked.

BRENNAN: There was shock on liberation day.

MOYNIHAN: The sheer size, the volume, the dollars, across the board, et cetera. What you say now, as times moved on, it's sort of a 15% on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the US, or won't commit to lowering their non tariff barriers and things like that. And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean--or foreign CEOs--you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be- drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15% to go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to- it's starting to de escalate, and that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15% here 17 different numbers. When you put China, China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case. And I think also between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly in the world, you can see sort of the end point here and now they've just got to (INAUDIBLE)- it's got to work through the system.

BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B of A is the largest small business lender.

MOYNIHAN: So we're the largest small business lender. If we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very- because rates have gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow a floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit? But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit, so they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern. It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So if you think across four policy regimes, tax-trade-tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation. You've seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability. How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable. They're here. So give me a set of rules and I'll go play with them. But I need to be clarified what the rules are.

BRENNAN: The labor scarcity issue, people just can't find folks--

MOYNIHAN: The- dependability and people who are probably not anything to do with what the policies are about feel- feel differently, and that's if they don't feel they can go to work, if they don't feel they can do things that that just has to resolve. And small businesses are generally most impacted because they don't have our wonderful research team to figure it all out and talk and talk to the big clients who have other teams to do it, and that's trickier. So I think, and by the way, the administration understands that they're working on it, they're trying to figure out how to get that part put together so it's clear what the policies will be and won't be, so that, or aren't, or, more importantly, aren't, really what the people that the ill settled down, but that that issue of labor was a 23 issue after the great resignation disappeared from small, medium sized businesses came back in literally because of where, where we are from this summer on.

BRENNAN: One of the other big factors, it seems in the jobs market, is this question of artificial intelligence. How much is B of A relying on AI to do things like predict loan defaults or identify risks?

MOYNIHAN: Well, so I think the way that the consumer would feel AI at Bank of America is Erica. So if you go on our mobile app- you there's a bot there. It's an agent. It's been there for many years. It does 2 million customer interfaces a day. So it's not small. 20 million customers actively use it. It can answer 700 questions. So that's real and been going on. And so that's the way a customer would feel it. If you're a corporate customer, you'd feel with Erica's embed in our cash pro- so your portal you go to as a company to make payments or FX transactions, and you want to ask questions, Erica is there. So that's- that you're asking about something different. We have used models for years about predicting defaults. So we do stress testing. Those are all models to predict the outcome. We have loss given defaults, default predictions. That's all there. Can these help us make us more informed? Yes, can they help different types of employees operate faster? Absolutely. So we're deploying across all our teammates AI, have access to AI tools. The- there are specialized AI tools in certain areas, but we think the highest best use near term is either discrete process application or in helping us build intelligent to high levels. But to interface to a customer, you have to have your data right. You have to have the controls right, because you can't give the customer the wrong answer, whether it's, I'm going to approve your loan or not, and that's why this will be a little- take a little more care to implement in customer facing business with trust, which is what financial services is.

BRENNAN: Well, I ask it because there's that question of how many human jobs get replaced, right? And when you look at that recent Business Roundtable Survey of CEOs, they predict that while there is spending on technology and AI, they're not looking at hiring going up. They see it actually reducing.

MOYNIHAN: So, so there's a couple things that is what's on people's minds, and that's when we talk to our teammates. We're saying, Hey, we're going to bring AI and make it more efficient, and then we got to produce more activity. And you don't have to worry. If you capture AI and use it in your day to day work, that's a great thing. And so it's not a threat to their jobs. But on the other hand, I think people are now assuming they're going to get benefits, and we'll see if they get those benefits. But you know, if you think from 1969 to 2019, it was 50 years, a lot of technology came in America employs twice as many people in 2019 as we did in 1969. So will this wind up? I don't know, and nobody really knows for sure, because we haven't ever had it. But on the other hand, there's a capability in our company. The commercial bankers are calling on commercial customers. If they get 10% more efficient, we may not add a lot to grow, but doesn't mean we're gonna take away and get the efficiency- we want to grow. We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent- the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think.

BRENNAN: So, it's a problem for the new college grad, but it's not necessarily a layoff that you're making, essentially.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah, well, we just hired 2000 plus new college grads in July, so it's- we didn't change the size of class- my advice to those kids, if you ask them if they're worried about, they say they're worried about- these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people. They came into our company. If you ask them, if they're scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I- says, harness it, and you shouldn't. It'll be your world ahead of you.

BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the mortgage business. You've got a big one. The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?

MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it. One is the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up. So that's slowing down that activity. The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country. Some single- you could have single family, multi small multi floor units, things like that. Or even more, bigger multi family, major cities, but there's a universal housing shortage, because for so many years it's been hard to get housing permitted, and so the advice I give to anybody is you're probably not going to see the 10 year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of three and but the tenure rate stays between four and four and a half, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than this today, but if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that is probably the solution. Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people 3% mortgage rates, that's not going to be changed. And by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession. So we shouldn't be cheering for 3% mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.

BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down is a good thing? You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.

MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market, because there's 60 million- there's 130 odd million households in America, half of them don't have a mortgage. This is this whole lock in question is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring- rental affordability is a question. Or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that. So it's a very complex thing, but simplistic- simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through. But we had a very different rate environment for a lot of years, and that's- that's hard for people to think about, because people under the age of 40, 2,3, 4, no, were not out working in an environment where we had a 3% Fed funds rate, which is more the norm than not.

BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie. Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The Treasury Secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake. Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But- but for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?

MOYNIHAN: I don't talk about client relationships, but look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And- and the administration knows that, Secretary Bessent knows it that guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30 year mortgage. Because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels, there are more advantageous to borrow. You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be okay, or a lot of years. So that guarantee is critical to U.S. getting fixed rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability, and then they've run the things pretty responsible since financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason. One of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them. And as soon as prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful all that, and I think- but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been. They're a great company. They're a iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.

BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May. For someone at home, how much does that job matter to the consumer. How do you explain that?

MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things. So the President's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. Presidents throughout- since the Federal Reserve, 100 plus years ago, was founded, have done that, it's not new. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's he should do it. There's- my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not- we're a country- we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer- all these people drive our economy. The idea that we are like hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get- since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy. That's what they're supposed to do. That went away number of years ago. It came back a little bit in COVID. They're a lender of last resort. They're there to stabilize markets and price- but other net you shouldn't know they exist quite frankly--

BRENNAN: --So you don't worry about all this, you know, handwringing of political interference with the Fed, once that new position is--

MOYNIHAN: --The market is a- will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed. And everybody knows that.

BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Trump accounts. They're trying to build generational wealth. The administration says by having these wealthy donors, state governments, employers put money in these tax advantage accounts for kids as an addition to the federal government putting some money into some of them, are you going to have a role in that program? And what do you think more broadly about expanding the number of people putting money in the stock market, in these index funds.

MOYNIHAN: So I think number one, if- at our company starting 2017 we- after the tax act from that year, a lot of companies gave their employees $1,000 bonus. We started doing something else the next year, which we kept going and I've gone since. So our 200,000 plus employees every year get an award of stock across the whole board, and that's built up to be s--

BRENNAN: --Many corporations do that, restricted stock.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah, but it's gone on for now. A lot of them did it once, didn't do it, but very few have done it that much. And that's like $6 billion of stock have gone into those employees. And so I believe in stock ownership by everybody. I believe in holding that stock and appreciating. And so we believe in that, we have a 401k, that people can invest, we have 7% match and all that stuff. These accounts, I think, are also good. The question is, you know, the parents have to make the contributions, and the government will put some money in, but the broader products available for parents, it'll be good to save. But I think we shouldn't- we should do this, but we also have to remember financial education. Because if you can get an education generally, in skills training, because if somebody could earn $10,000 more a year than they'd otherwise earn, or they can balance their budget and be cash flow positive to $10,000. That goes on for their, you know, from their first job, 21,18, all the way through 65 that is a lot of money. Where this for 18 years, will be a lot of money, but it'll be- it'll stop where that will go on forever. So we need this type of work. And I expose the equity markets underinvesting in America and all those things, very low cost where the index funds doesn- it had basis points where they were saying that's all the right way to do it. By the way, it was back to privatization, Social Security in those days and that stuff.

BRENNAN: Is this basically a way to do that? I mean, every baby suddenly has a stock market investment.

MOYNIHAN: It'll- I mean, we'll have to see. You and I won't be around 50 years, 60 years from now, maybe you will be, I won't be around 60 years from now to think about it. But it- you know- it'll, it'll do that. But equity investment by people holding that and having have to hold it so they can't churn it and sell it. And that's, that's a good thing. So I think it's a great product. I think it's wonderful that people are stepping up and contributing to it. We all have to think about an employer, because we have that stock program, which is several thousand dollars to employees. And, you know, we have our 401k match. And if we do this, how does that work? And stuff like that. But- and if you do it for kids, what do you do for the rest of people? You have this question that not everybody in our company has kids. And so if I put the match in for- if I put the money for people with kids, what I do with people without kids? So there's a little more complex, but it's a good thing, and I think we'll figure out how to participate and make it happen.

BRENNAN: So back in August, when we spoke, you talked about these allegations of banks playing politics and discriminating against conservatives. You pushed back pretty hard in that moment. But earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six page report. There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?

MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been- have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on. So if you read the website, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was that's not what was going- never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clear so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others. And we'll, we'll look at anybody who, who feels we- believe me, they- people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, 'you've closed my account, why?' And we can tell them. But I think people are forgetting the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And, and believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be a fail as a company, and therefore we're going to write you up.

BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration that kind of--

MOYNIHAN: --even–

BRENNAN: --social pressure you're saying--

MOYNIHAN: --20 years ago--

BRENNAN: 20 years ago, okay--

MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up, and then it's and then the second thing is that, that for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at 10,000 and you have two things, if it goes above that, you have to pour it down, if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972. That number would be 80,000 today, so what we thought was material then--

BRENNAN: --in terms of, like, suspicious transactions.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah, and so and so. There's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to- if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful. So there's sort of the ESG side of it, those things I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff. Because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter and then the reputation risk, which to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.

BRENNAN: because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House. But this issue the president himself really dug into and he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, it's- do you know what he's talking about?

MOYNIHAN: We- I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we--

BRENNAN: He said it on television, about you.

MOYNIHAN: I know that. People- if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television it- you know, I'd be rich. So at the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers. We have tens of thou- we have the biggest small business lender in the country period and stop. You know? And so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's, it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their, and their points of view. But look, some of these policies, we were pushed to places that we've been able to bring back to the center and America ought to feel good about that.

BRENNAN: And you think the things are copacetic now. You put this behind you with the White House?

MOYNIHAN: Yes.

BRENNAN: Okay, I'm getting a wrap over here on time. So thank you for making time for us.

MOYNIHAN: Happy Holidays, thank you.

As a result of this partnership, Baidu’s Apollo Go RT6 will join ride-hailing platforms in London by 2026. In addition, Wayve, which is a London-based startup, is also expected to launch its trials in 2026, driven by roughly $1 billion in investment from Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and SoftBank. The company will test its mapless, AI-driven technology with the launch.

That said, on December 18, Nikhil Devnani from Bernstein reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $110 to $115. The analyst noted that they remain optimistic on the stock despite the pressure from the emerging AV industry, driven by increased competition from players like Waymo, Zoox, and Tesla. Devnani noted that the increased competition from the AV industry has moderated the margins for the company to some extent, as the company is investing in its core mobility segment and also allocating significant capital towards AV initiatives. However, regardless, the firm expects Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) to exceed Gross Bookings and EBITDA estimates.

In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), Vitarich said it has entered into a compromise agreement with AXA Philippines Life and General Insurance Corp. to settle its insurance claim under Civil Case No. 662-M-2014, entitled “Vitarich Corp. vs. Charter Ping An Insurance Corp. (now AXA Philippines).”

On May 31, 2023, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos City, Branch 15, rendered its decision, finding the insurer liable to pay Vitarich ₱247.62 million with interest, in addition to the amount previously awarded through a summary judgment.

The insurer filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA) and, without admitting any fault and to avoid a prolonged legal process, agreed with Vitarich to a settlement valued at ₱400 million.

The settlement, containing customary provisions mutually beneficial to both parties, was accepted by Vitarich President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ricardo Manuel M. Sarmiento, who has been authorized by the board of directors.

The company expects the settlement, which takes effect on Dec. 19, 2025, to have a material impact on liquidity and capital resources.

“The settlement will provide the company an estimated additional ₱196 million in net income and ₱267 million in net cash flow.”

For the first nine months of 2025, Vitarich reported revenues of ₱9.17 billion, net income of ₱120.6 million, and earnings per share of ₱0.04.

Revenues slightly declined by 0.5 percent year-on-year, primarily due to the continued drop in chicken prices, which also affected the valuation of biological assets, as well as the limited availability of day-old chicks (DOC) during the first half of the year.

This was partially offset by the company’s entry into the day-old pullet segment.

Gross profit rose to ₱1.12 billion, a modest 4.1-percent increase from the prior year, driven by favorable chicken prices during the early part of the year and improved production efficiencies in the feeds segment.

Operating income, however, dropped by 32.4 percent year-on-year to ₱240.2 million, mainly due to higher operating expenses (opex) arising from increased marketing activities, freight and handling costs, corporate events, and employee training programs.

""Walmart is slowly swapping from cardboard to plastic packaging with their pasta,"" the Redditor captions the image that shows the two packaging options side by side.

While switching from cardboard to single-use plastic may make the packaging lighter, it's still not ideal for the planet for a few reasons.

First, cardboard boxes are fully recyclable, and most municipalities process cardboard in their recycling programs. Recyclable cardboard is often made from post-consumer materials, and it has a high recyclable success rate of 70%.

Second, Walmart recently announced a shift toward electric trucks for some deliveries, helping to reduce its carbon footprint and decrease its production of carbon pollution. Shipping fully-recyclable containers on pollution-free trucks is better for the planet virtually 100% of the time.

Using plastic means dirty energy sources are still involved in the product, since plastic is a byproduct of dirty energy. And while some single-use plastic bags can be recycled, not all can. These flimsy bags often tear, making them not an ideal reuse candidate. Plastic is also a leading ocean polluter, poisoning wildlife and exacerbating the overheating of our planet.

Redditors were quick to blast the retail giant's decision. ""[Y]ou would hope the swap would be the other way,"" wrote one user.

""We are heading in the wrong direction,"" wrote another user.

One Redditor shared some insight as to why Walmart may have made the shift. ""I work in packaging,"" they wrote. ""There have been intermittent paper shortages since COVID.

Increased U.S. production doesn’t fundamentally change the picture, but it does increase the risk to Canada.”","This story is part of a selection of our top news from 2025 that we’re republishing during the holiday break. We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

With Donald Trump pledging a “Drill, Baby, Drill” agenda for fossil fuels that would pour an estimated four billion tonnes of additional climate pollution into the atmosphere, nervous private investors emerged early this year as a force that could impede the oil and gas industry from keeping Trump’s promise.

Their demands for bigger, faster returns on their fossil investments, coupled with heightened fear of declining oil demand and surging clean energy alternatives, had independent analysts and even some industry insiders concluding there’s no sudden oil boom on the horizon.

It isn’t that the industry didn’t want to ramp up production after the U.S. presidency changed hands Jan. 20. It’s that cautious investors might prevent them from doing that.

The U.S. fossil fuel industry spent US$219 million to elect the country’s next government, Yale Climate Connections reports, most of it on Republican campaigns. That was after Trump invited about 20 oil and gas executives to his Mar-a-Lago estate in April to present what one independent journalist called a “breathtakingly corrupt proposal: If they raised a billion dollars to help him retake the White House, he would roll back any policy they didn’t like when he took office.”

In the end, the election result was a bargain at one-fifth the price Trump asked the industry to pay. Not long after the dust settled on last fall’s presidential vote, the American Energy Alliance (AEA) declared itself pleased with Trump’s cabinet nominations.

“Throughout his campaign, President Trump expressed his unwavering commitment to American [fossil] energy, and his selections show how serious he is about unlocking our country’s resource potential,” AEA President Thomas Pyle said in a Nov. 26 statement. “He has chosen strong candidates to comprise his energy team,” all of whom “share a vision for energy dominance and economic growth.”

Those plans could pour an extra four billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere by 2030, Carbon Brief concluded last March.

Funnelling Cash Out of Production

But the industry’s behaviour is not matching up with its rhetoric. As far back as March 2023, with analysts predicting (as it turned out, over-predicting) $100-per-barrel oil and U.S. President Joe Biden urging companies to increase production, industry leaders were directing their record profits to investor dividends and share buybacks, diverting funds that would previously have been devoted to seeking out and developing new oilfields.

With shareholders basking in a $128-billion financial windfall, “oil executives who in years past were rewarded for investing in gigantic, long-term energy projects are now under the gun to funnel cash to investors who are increasingly convinced that the sunset of the fossil-fuel era is nigh,” Bloomberg Green reported at the time.

“At the heart of the divergence is growing concern among investors that demand for fossil fuels will peak as soon as 2030, obviating the need for multi-billion-dollar megaprojects that take decades to yield full returns,” the news story stated. “In other words, oil refineries and natural-gas fired power plants—along with the wells that feed them—risk becoming so-called stranded assets if and when they are displaced by electric cars and battery farms.”

Projections that oil consumption will peak this decade may have begun with the IEA, but the chorus of agreement now includes private energy analytics firms like Wood Mackenzie and Rystad Energy, as well as oil giants like BP and Exxon.

Against that backdrop, the June 2024 World Energy Investment report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) traced the decline in capital expenditures back nearly a decade. It said global investment in “upstream” oil exploration and extraction activity was set to fall to its lowest level since 2017, with state-owned oil corporations in the Middle East and Asia accounting for a far larger share of the total and the major private oil companies cutting investment by about one-quarter.

Among the world’s 30 biggest upstream oil producers, dividends and stock buybacks exceeded [pdf] capital spending in 2022 and 2023, with investment in exploration and extraction falling from more than 75% in 2015 to less than 50% of the total.

The same IEA report showed the world investing nearly twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels.

Borrow Billions, Hand It All Over to Investors

Now, some of the world’s biggest fossil producers are facing down a new layer of risk: with oil demand collapsing, prices staying stubbornly low, and investors still laser focused on short-term returns, four of the world’s five oil “supermajors” saw fit to borrow $15 billion to fund share buybacks between July and September, Bloomberg reported in late October.

With their quarterly profits at their lowest since 2021, down by half from record highs in 2022 and by 12% from the previous quarter, analysts said colossal fossils ExxonMobil, Chevron, TotalÉnergies, and BP wouldn’t have enough cash on hand to cover the dividends and share buybacks their investors were demanding. While Exxon and Chevron had “plenty of room to borrow to fund buybacks,” Bloomberg wrote, “the European majors have higher debt levels, allowing less room to manoeuvre,” with BP posting the worst financial performance based on its ratio of debt to capital assets.

“Borrowing to buy back shares isn’t uncommon in the oil business,” Bloomberg explained. “but a dimming outlook for oil prices next year means the cash shortfall is apt to continue over the longer term,” while investors’ expectations for immediate returns continue.

Another Day, Another Debt

Going deeper into debt to hand money over to shareholders “could be a good use of cash while companies have reasonably strong balance sheets,” Kim Fustier, head of European oil and gas equity research at HSBC Plc, told the news agency. “The question is, ‘How sustainable will it be?’”

“While it is common for companies to borrow to maintain dividends during lean periods on the premise of a cyclical recovery, it is quite another thing to do the same when the decline is structural,” agreed Guy Prince, a senior analyst on Carbon Tracker’s oil, gas and mining team, in a December 2023 analysis tracking the financial decline of 40 different petrostates—particularly Saudi Arabia.

“Falling oil demand will have varying impacts on companies,” he wrote. “However, for Saudi Aramco, with its self-imposed production targets (to shore up prices) and fixed dividend payments to the Saudi government to fund its fiscal spend (they need $80 a barrel), it is particularly painful.”

Over a nine-month span in 2024, Aramco’s financial position “has moved from net cash of $27.4 billion to net debt of $8.9 billion,” Bloomberg energy and commodities columnist Javier Blas wrote on social media. “That means in 2024 Aramco has spent ~$130 million daily that it didn’t have.”

The overall financial picture points to a rather less aggressive picture of the next four years of fossil fuel development than Trump’s and the industry’s chatter about making “American Energy Great Again”, just months after U.S. crude production set an all-time record under Biden.

Low Oil Prices Mean Falling Profits

It’ll be that much harder for Big Oil to deliver on all the big talk as long as it’s caught between two converging trends: jittery investors and relatively low prices driven by faltering demand for oil.

“Oil consumption in China—the powerhouse of world markets for the past two decades—has contracted for six straight months through September, and will grow this year at just 10% of the rate seen in 2023,” Bloomberg reported in mid-November, citing IEA analysis. Consistent with other recent analysis, a senior IEA official said it was possible that China’s oil demand had already peaked.

The result: global oil consumption will still rise this year, but at less than half the rate of 2023. And crude oil prices fell 11% between early October and mid-November.

“It’s not just the economy and the shift, the slowdown in the construction sector,” the agency’s head of oil industry and markets, Toril Bosoni, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s the transition to electric vehicles, high speed rail, and gas in trucking that is undermining Chinese oil demand growth.”

That shaky picture of future demand had the U.S. Energy Information Administration rolling back its 2025 price projection for West Texas Intermediate crude oil—from an estimate of $79.63 per barrel last September to $73.13 in October and $69.12 in December. Falling prices will only erode profits and available funds that companies are already redirecting from exploration and production to shareholder returns.

Those same price dynamics had the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries and its petrostate allies (OPEC+) balancing an “unpalatable choice” between the mounting financial pain of restraining production and the risk that bringing new oil supplies online would just drive down prices farther and faster, Bloomberg wrote in late November. By mid-December, the cartel was “gradually conceding defeat”, the news agency said, slashing its estimates of future demand growth and bringing them closer to the IEA’s—which Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman had previously dismissed as “La La Land” for its recent emphasis on net-zero scenarios.

California-based Chevron also announced a $2-billion capital expenditure cut, its first since the COVID-19 pandemic, in early December, a decision the Financial Times placed in counterpoint to Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda. That left Exxon as a major outlier, with announced plans to increase production by nearly one-fifth and continue boosting capital spending through the end of this decade.

Oil Producers Tap the Brakes

But even Exxon is throwing cold water on Trump’s pledge to drill everything, everywhere, all at once.

“I think a radical change is unlikely because the vast majority, if not everybody, is primarily focused on the economics of what they’re doing,” the company’s Upstream President Liam Mallon told a conference audience in late November. If Trump follows through on plans to open up public lands in the U.S. to oil and gas production, “You would be able to drill more, assuming you have the quality and met your economic threshold,” he added. “But I don’t think we’re going to see anybody in the ‘Drill, baby, drill!’ mode. I really don’t.”

“Maybe he has a magic recipe to push them to drill like mad,” added TotalÉnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne. But with companies committed to returning cash to shareholders, “it’s not only decisions by politicians” that will determine how much oil the U.S. produces.

The skepticism extended beyond the oil and gas executive suite.

“There is a recent media narrative that the second Trump administration will lead to a surge in U.S. oil production, with producers eager to drill and produce more when unincumbered [sic] by perceived Biden-era bureaucracy,” wrote Standard Chartered Bank Energy Analyst Emily Ashford in a post-election analysis. But U.S. oil production “has changed significantly since Trump first took office in 2017, and there are substantial barriers to rapid production increases within the time frame of a presidential term.”

Another take on that history is that, with U.S. production now at record levels, Trump can’t do much more because Biden has already given the industry pretty much everything it wants.

There are certainly steps Trump may try to take to boost the industry. But notwithstanding his campaign trail claims that U.S. oil production would have been “four, five times” higher if he had stayed in the White House after losing the 2020 election, Politico says oil companies “are already signaling they will pull back on drilling next year as crude oil prices sag.” They’re also “wary that Trump’s threatened tariffs will worsen trade tensions, driving up their costs and risking closing off foreign markets for their energy exports.”

Hazards Ahead for Canadian Oil

The global trends have Canadian politicians and analysts fretting that “three years of roaring oil prices” are coming to an end. “Both investors and companies have become used to these [high] prices,” Raoul LeBlanc vice-president at S&P Global Commodity Insights, told CBC in early November. “Whereas five years ago—let’s say 2017, 2018, and 2019—prices at $62 [a barrel] would have seemed fantastic, they don’t seem fantastic now.”

Echoing the analysis in the U.S., LeBlanc said the Canadian industry will still be expected to deliver strong returns to investors, even if it means cutting back on plans to increase production.

Around the same time, the Globe and Mail reports, University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe said Alberta will lose C$4.5 billion in its next fiscal year if oil prices stay at their present level, making future provincial deficits “a near certainty.”

The combination of rising population and falling oil prices had Premier Danielle Smith acknowledging her government might not be able to balance its budget after projecting a $2.6-billion surplus for 2025-26—and previously promising a personal income tax cut that would reduce provincial revenue by $1.4 billion.

“It is a serious problem,” she told media. “We have a number of different pressures coming our way. And we have to be honest with people about what we’re facing.”

Hadrian Mertins-Kirkwood, senior climate policy researcher at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said the Alberta oil sands could be uniquely vulnerable as global oil demand weakens.

“There is a real and growing possibility that demand for Canadian oil exports will fall sooner and faster than anticipated,” he wrote in a November 2024 special edition of CCPA’s ShiftStorm e-newsletter, “not only because of falling demand for oil in general, but specifically because the oil sands are among the costliest and most emissions intensive sources of oil in the world.”

Mertins-Kirkwood agreed with other analysts that Trump isn’t likely to deliver the dramatic production increase he’s been touting.

“You can claim ‘Drill, baby, drill!’ all you want, but that doesn’t change the long-term demand picture, which the oil companies are well aware of,” he told The Energy Mix in an email. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see an increase in new U.S. oil and gas investment under Trump, but it won’t be a dramatic change from business-as-usual for the industry.”

Either way, Mertins-Kirkwood sees serious jeopardy ahead for Alberta and Canada.

“Canada’s fossil fuel industry has assets currently worth half a trillion dollars, and those companies also hold hundreds of billions of dollars in debt. Any decline in production ahead of plan introduces a huge risk of stranded assets,” he wrote.

Even if countries fall short of their declared 2050 deadline to hit net-zero emissions, “We’re going to see a big risk of stranded assets in Canada within 20 years. Increased U.S. production doesn’t fundamentally change the picture, but it does increase the risk to Canada.”

The government picked up 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece, making it one of the company’s largest shareholders. The deal has already paid off, with the government’s stake now worth nearly $9 billion more than it paid for the stock.

OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle, in January, jointly announced a massive AI data center project called “Stargate,” in which the companies plan to invest up to $500 billion over the coming years to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S.

Stargate, the companies said, will create 100,000 jobs. Plans were announced in September for five new AI data centers. Stargate will be set up as a separate company, which OpenAI said in a social media post “will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.”

OpenAI and Oracle

In September, OpenAI signed a contract with Oracle to purchase $300 billion in computing power over the next five years, one of the largest cloud contracts ever. The contact will begin in 2027, but it did draw some concern from some analysts, who noted the value of the deal was much greater than OpenAI’s current revenue and Oracle will need to take on substantial debt to build out the hardware and infrastructure for the project. News of the agreement sent Oracle stock up 43 percent when it was announced. (It has since lost all of those gains.)

Pepsi and Poppi

Founded in 2020, Poppi started as an experiment in Allison Ellsworth’s kitchen, an attempt to make gut-healthy drinks that tasted good. The probiotic soda quickly grew into a popular, nationally recognized brand during the pandemic, landing Poppi at No. 148 on this year’s Inc. 5000 list, with a three-year growth rate of 2,638 percent. In May, Ellsworth and her husband Stephen, who is also a co-founder, sold the company to Pepsi for $1.95 billion.

Prada and Versace

The news in April that Prada would buy Versace for $1.51 billion was the ending to a very long story. Prada began chasing the luxury fashion house during the pandemic, but the parties couldn’t make the deal work. When Versace parent Capri’s sale to Tapestry was scuttled due to antitrust concerns, Prada tried again and was able to negotiate a price that was lower than the $2 billion Capri paid for the brand in 2018. The acquisition closed earlier this month.

Dick’s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker

Dick’s Sporting Goods had a strong 2025, raising its full-year sales growth guidance last month to a range of 3.5 to 4 percent up from 2 to 3.5 percent previously. Its acquisition of struggling competitor Foot Locker in May for $2.4 billion gave it a competitive advantage in the Nike sneaker market as well as access to international markets and a wider customer base. Foot Locker will continue to operate as a standalone business, though Dick’s does plan to close an undisclosed number of stores to protect the company’s profits.

Sycamore Partners and Walgreens Boots Alliance

Private equity firm Sycamore’s $10 billion purchase of the pharmaceutical chain in March ended almost a century of Walgreens being a publicly traded company. Walgreens, at one point in time, boasted a market cap of nearly $100 billion, but changes to the healthcare industry, acquisitions of rivals and reduced margins on drug sales shrank that number precipitously. Sycamore has a history of buying distressed companies, with other holdings including Staples, Nine West and Talbots.

Keurig Dr Pepper and JDE Peets

Keurig Dr Pepper’s U.S. coffee business needed some help, so it made an $18 billion bet in August that the Dutch coffee and tea company could boost earnings. Keurig Dr Pepper owns Green Mountain Coffee (as well as Dr Pepper, 7Up and Snapple), which has seen sales decline in recent years. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, after which Keurig Dr Pepper will split its coffee and other beverage units into two separate companies, both of which will remain listed on U.S. stock exchanges.

Whoever lands the new role will be expected to keep up with evolving AI risks, and oversee the company's ""preparedness framework as new risks, capabilities, or external expectations emerge.""
Reports about burnout at the AI firm have been building for some time, as per reports from publications like Wired.
Disclosure: Ziff Davis, PCMag's parent company, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in April 2025, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.","If you’re interested in a high-stress, high-compensation role, where you get to battle the emerging threat of frontier-grade AI systems being used for malicious cyberattacks, OpenAI might have the job for you.

The ChatGPT firm has announced it’s hiring a Head of Preparedness. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman said the position would work on mitigating the growing threat of AI being used aggressively by bad actors in the world of cybersecurity. He claimed we are now “seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.”

The CEO’s statements about LLMs posing growing risks to cyberdefenders are backed up by other firms in the industry. Last month, OpenAI rival Anthropic posted a report about how a Chinese state-sponsored group manipulated its Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration of “roughly thirty global targets,” including large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies, “without substantial human intervention.”

Altman called for candidates who “want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting-edge capabilities” while still “ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.” According to the job spec, other major risk areas the successful candidate is set to work on include “biosecurity.” In this context, biosecurity could mean advanced AI systems being used to design bioweapons, a risk more than 100 scientists from universities and organizations across the planet have warned about.

Whoever lands the new role will be expected to keep up with evolving AI risks, and oversee the company's ""preparedness framework as new risks, capabilities, or external expectations emerge.""

Though the compensation package on offer looks generous—north of $500k plus equity—it doesn’t look like a gig for the faint of heart. Altman said it is set to be “a stressful job” that will see the successful candidate “jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.”

There’s a good chance the CEO isn’t exaggerating when it comes to the position’s stress levels. Reports about burnout at the AI firm have been building for some time, as per reports from publications like Wired. Former technical team executives like Calvin French-Owen have posted first-hand accounts of a secretive, high-pressure environment, with a heavy emphasis on Twitter ""vibes"", alongside anecdotal reports of 12-hour days being plentiful on social media.

One way to prove you’re beyond playing your annual elimination game against the Bulls in April is to beat them in December.
A home game against New Orleans on Jan. 7 might be the only one in which the Hawks are favored.
He finally staggered Young and Johnson to keep one on the court at all times, avoiding some of the bench unit disasters that have plagued the Hawks in previous losses.
It also offers more rest: Saturday was the Hawks’ league-leading 33rd game and they only have four back-to-backs after Jan. 3.","ATLANTA — The irony was hard to miss: The visiting coach in Atlanta Saturday night was New York’s Mike Brown, who was fired by Sacramento exactly one year ago to the day after his team lost a fifth consecutive home game.

Welp.

Quin Snyder’s seat hasn’t been rumored to be hot, but the Hawks lost their fifth straight home game and sixth straight overall on Saturday, 128-125 to the Knicks, as Nickeil Alexander-Walkers’s 3-point attempt rattled out just before the buzzer. That this losing streak has coincided with the return of Trae Young for the last four games — something that theoretically should make the Hawks significantly better — only adds to the local angst about this team.

Instead of moving up in the East hierarchy, as many expected at the start of the season, Atlanta is stuck in extremely familiar territory: jousting with the Heat and Bulls for positioning in the play-in tournament. This home losing streak began with two losses to Chicago, including one where the Hawks gave up a staggering 152 points. One way to prove you’re beyond playing your annual elimination game against the Bulls in April is to beat them in December.

Atlanta is now 15-18, in tenth place in the East, and the upcoming schedule offers few reprieves with games against the Thunder, Wolves and Knicks again. Eight of the next 10 games are on the road; eight of the next nine are against teams with winning records. A home game against New Orleans on Jan. 7 might be the only one in which the Hawks are favored. Yikes.

The Hawks haven’t always played badly in this stretch; they lost at the buzzer to a good Knicks team and were beaten by a phantom call in the second loss to the Bulls. The underlying stats still say they’re more an average team than a bad one — 16th in offense, 17th in defense, 18th in Net Rating.

But they also face-planted in a winnable, rested game against Miami and played no defense in the first loss to the Bulls. And more importantly, the expectations were for more this year after acquiring Kristaps Porziņģis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker in the offseason.

That said, the feeling internally after Saturday’s game was slightly different from what you might expect; Atlanta took encouragement after rallying from an 18-point deficit to briefly take the lead in the fourth quarter, coming on the heels of a team meeting after the moribund loss to Miami the night before.

“We had a real sit-down with the whole crew and said we need to be better,” said Alexander-Walker, “and I think you can feel it in the game, in the stretch where we were able to kind of stop the bleeding, we fought.”

“I was proud of how we competed,” said Snyder. “You would like to get a win because that’s affirming of how you played, but we did the things we need to do to be successful.”

“We told each other we need to be serious,” said Jalen Johnson. “A lot of guys spoke. I think it was a good sign.”

Snyder may have also finally landed on something that works rotationally after experimenting, mostly unsuccessfully, with his bench units for much of the year. He finally staggered Young and Johnson to keep one on the court at all times, avoiding some of the bench unit disasters that have plagued the Hawks in previous losses. Guards Keaton Wallace and Luke Kennard, who featured in some of the worst-performing units and have a minus-11.5 per 100 net rating as a two-man unit, combined for just eight total minutes over the last two nights.

“We had more urgency; we were more dialed in,” said Onyeka Okongwu of the Hawks’ rally. The 6-foot-8 center had 31 points and 14 rebounds despite giving up many inches.

“We need to challenge ourselves to play a whole game and not go through lapses.”

Alas, the Hawks face a size deficit every night without the 7-3 Porziņģis, whose POTS syndrome has him sidelined; he has only played 13 games this year. That and a season-ending injury to third center N’Faly Dante have left the Hawks bereft of size, an especially noticeable deficit against New York’s Karl-Anthony Towns and Mitchell Robinson. Atlanta is 27th in Rebound Rate, ahead of only Milwaukee, Sacramento and Washington, and their nightly Ls in the possession battle have made for a burdensome math problem.

The flip side of the Hawks’ tough upcoming schedule is that it gets Charmin soft starting in February, with a surfeit of Charlottes and Washingtons on the docket and only 10 road games after the All-Star break. It also offers more rest: Saturday was the Hawks’ league-leading 33rd game and they only have four back-to-backs after Jan. 3. But they may be down so bad by then that it won’t matter.

The tough schedule also raises the stakes for what might be next for this franchise, whether at the trade deadline or in the offseason. Atlanta has to make its deadline decisions without the benefit of seeing how many wins its soft late schedule might yield. Meanwhile, Young’s return has yet to impact the bottom line while perhaps detracting some from the electric Johnson, especially late in games. Young’s $49 million player option looms as a major hinge point for the offseason.

Both Johnson and Young have also been guilty of glaring defensive gaffes. Here’s Young standing at the free-throw line while Miami runs out for a lay-up in Friday’s fourth quarter:

Meanwhile, when Snyder lamented after the Miami game that the Hawks would stop a driver and then get beat on a back cut, it wasn’t hard to identify what play was on his mind. Here’s Johnson falling asleep on the weak side, something that’s happened way too often this year in what has otherwise been an All-Star-caliber campaign:

Porziņģis, of course, is another giant question mark. He’s an All-Star-caliber weapon when available, but on an expiring $31 million deal that could end up being an important trade chip at the deadline.

Atlanta still owes its first-round pick this year to San Antonio from the Dejounte Murray trade, so they have no incentive for a fire sale. But if this team can’t escape the gravitational field of the play-in tournament for a fifth consecutive season, it raises an important question for the front office as it tries to build around a young core, a likely high lottery pick from New Orleans or Milwaukee and … it remains to be seen what else.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/28003002/GettyImages-2252986226.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-28 08:58:23.038951

Mergers old and new reshaped the agency landscape; regulators pushed back against the giants; and Google quietly admitted something few thought possible - that the cookie era might be here to stay after all.

Omnicom and IPG: The year’s defining merger

Last December’s news that Omnicom would acquire IPG sent shockwaves through Madison Avenue. The deal, worth an estimated USD$25bn, promised to create the world’s largest agency network - a marketing behemoth with combined billings dwarfing even WPP’s. Unsurprisingly, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stepped in, flagging concerns that the tie-up could limit competition across media buying, creative services, and data management.

For months, the transaction hovered in limbo. But a revised framework for “cross-stack ad competition” introduced midyear gave the merger new life. By late summer, the FTC cleared the deal, followed in December by unconditional approval from the European Commission. Almost immediately, Omnicom announced a sweeping restructure: 4,000 roles set to go before year-end as it moves to consolidate overlapping units and unify its data strategy under a single global platform.

Consolidation everywhere you look

The mergers kept coming. French-based Equativ sealed its long-discussed union with Sharethrough, forming one of the largest independent ad tech platforms outside the walled gardens. The combined group now boasts significant reach across CTV, programmatic, and supply optimisation.

Meanwhile, Publicis made headlines with its acquisition of Lotame. The move adds Lotame’s data reservoir - roughly 1.6 billion user profiles - to the Groupe’s increasingly ID-driven data stack. Publicis wasted no time folding those audience graphs into its Epsilon offering, pitching enhanced precision targeting just as fragmentation across identifiers reached new highs.

The battle for Warner Bros

In media, the year’s most extraordinary rumour mill centred on Warner Bros Discovery, which officially put itself up for sale. Both Netflix and Paramount Skydance made plays - and Netflix seemed to have the agreement in place. Paramount then lobbed in a USD$108.4bn hostile bid, aiming to outmuscle Netflix’s already massive USD$72bn offer. The board, though, recommended rejecting Paramount’s offer - but few expect this story to end before 2026.

TikTok survives again - with a new flag

Across the Atlantic, political drama continued to define TikTok’s fate. In September, a newly re-elected Donald Trump signed an executive order forcing Chinese parent company ByteDance to transfer US ownership to American investors. The move, framed as a national security measure, effectively prevented a TikTok shutdown in the States - and marked the culmination of a years-long tug of war over the app’s future.

ByteDance eventually reached a binding deal with groups including Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. If completed in early 2026, the agreement will create a separate joint venture for TikTok’s US business, finally putting the app’s legal limbo to rest - at least for now.

Google’s rough year in court

No year-in-review would be complete without Google’s legal woes, and 2025 delivered them in spades. The search giant faced a crushing verdict in April, when Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that it maintained two illegal monopolies across ad tech - one in publisher ad servers, another in exchange technology.

The decision unleashed fresh lawsuits from Magnite and PubMatic, both seeking damages for what they describe as years of exclusionary practices.

Yet the more draconian remedies - a forced breakup or Chrome divestiture - seem increasingly unlikely. Judge Amit Mehta spared the browser from sale in Google’s parallel search antitrust trial, and Brinkema has signalled similar hesitation in the ad tech case. Pending verdicts aside, the industry’s response has been pragmatic: frustration, but little shock. The perceived imbalance between regulators’ power and Big Tech’s legal muscle remains, for now, intact.

AI upends traffic and trust

While courts debated competition, the open web faced a different kind of existential challenge. As AI chatbots and search tools proliferated, referral traffic to publishers cratered. Appfigures and SimilarWeb both recorded steep double-digit declines in click-throughs to news sites across major markets, with much of that traffic diverted to AI-generated summaries.

Publishers responded with lawsuits, block lists, and pleas for licensing deals. Yet the scraping continued and 2025 became, by consensus, the year that open access content was effectively subsumed into large language model training data. One board member of the Independent Publishers Alliance estimated that Google’s new AI-powered search could push a third of its members into closure within a year.

What AI giveth in efficiency, it taketh away in discoverability.

The cookie that wouldn’t crumble

And finally, the year’s most unexpected twist: the third-party cookie lived to see another day. After half a decade of phased plans, pilot schemes, and developer summits, Google officially scrapped its deprecation timeline. Privacy Sandbox was quietly wound down, its core tools shuttered.

The decision, reportedly tied to both antitrust pressure and publisher backlash, sent shockwaves across the ecosystem. After years spent preparing for a “post-cookie world”, advertisers and platforms alike found themselves back where they started - albeit older, wiser, and more cynical about Google’s willingness to change its own rules.

For some, that retreat marked the end of an era. For others, it was a fitting conclusion to a year defined by circular upheaval: consolidation without clarity, innovation without confidence, and regulation without resolve.

So, for 2026, companies should totally keep the live demos.","In 2025, Google, Apple, Samsung, and everyone else who announced new tech products delivered beautifully curated keynotes that told us exactly what they wanted us to hear about the said devices.

I agree that Google went above and beyond this year for its Pixel 10 launch, delivering something that felt less like a Keynote and more like a massive production hosted by Jimmy Fallon. On the opposite end, Meta literally winged it with live demos of their new smart glasses. While the demos didn't go as planned, they stayed fairly realistic, which is what we, as consumers who pay a hefty price for electronics, would appreciate seeing.

If tech companies want launch events to matter in 2026, they need to stop giving us Keynotes that could have been emails or overcomplicating them to the point where we lose interest. Instead, they need to offer more clarity and a better understanding of how an average person seeking to buy a new anything will perceive and use these products.

Here's what I'd love to see change in 2026 — and what's worth keeping.

Give it to me straight — in plain English

Too often, companies end up explaining features the way they'd talk to engineers and not, well, us. We hear about ""tokens per second,"" model sizes, or how ""Siri now has a deeper understanding of your personal context.""

There's a ton of technical jargon, and not much about how those things show up in the real world. Launch events need to answer questions when explaining a new feature — It comes down to the basics: ""Why would I actually need it, when would I use it, and what problem would it solve?""

If I don't understand the practicality of a new feature and how it would help me in the real world, then what's the point of having some elaborate speech about it?

Take Google's Gemini, for instance: instead of telling me it's faster, smarter, and more ""multimodal,"" tell me whether Gemini can look at a photo I took and explain why it looks bad and how to fix it before I share it. Even Samsung and Apple end up using loads of jargon in their Keynotes.

Apple loves to show off those emotionally hitting polished stories — the Apple Watch saving a life, the iPhone shooting a fancy music video (with tons of extra gear, post-production edits, of course). Samsung often bombards viewers with so many features so quickly, with little guidance on which actually matter.

But they skip the messy part: regular people trying to use that same tech and ending up with a terrible photo, bad lighting, or just a picture that looks nothing like the ad. In 2026, I want to see companies balance those magical tales with what these features actually look like for a totally average user. Because great stories definitely make people care, but great explanations push people to buy the product.

Keep consumer launches and developer events separate

Google's I/O and Apple's WWDC keep developer updates separate from their launch events, but they sometimes blur the line between the two. For example, this year's I/O featured major product announcements, including the launch of Android 16, a demonstration of Gemini's multimodal capabilities, and a preview of a prototype of Google's XR glasses.

This mix at an event aimed just for developers is definitely cool. Google's probably trying to get more than just coders interested in I/O, but it's also leaving people confused about whether they should be glued to I/O or just watch the ""Made by Google"" for consumer-focused announcements. If you ask me, I'd say keep the two separate, don't overcomplicate it. That way, the audience knows what to expect at each event and won't miss anything of interest.

Keep the live demos — even if they fail

Both Google and Meta actually tried live demos in 2025, and sometimes, despite practicing it a zillion times before D-day, they don't go as planned. WiFi dropped, or connectivity lagged, leading to awkward pauses during a live show.

But that necessarily isn't failure. While people pick on these moments to criticize the company, make a ton of memes, they can also work to the company's favor. It showed us the reality that mistakes happen — especially with common issues like connectivity problems, and this to me comes across as more authentic and raw, rather than scripted videos.

It also gives companies a real-world moment to look at what works and what still needs work before a product reaches consumers.

So, for 2026, companies should totally keep the live demos. But they could try to swap out the celebrities for everyday people to make things more relevant for someone watching on their couch at home. You know, parents, students—those who don't care about the techy buzzwords but who will actually be using these cool new devices and features.

And just keep things simple, to the point, showing us how features will help normal people, rather than over-the-top shows with so much going on that people forget about it as soon as the show's over.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DyDo9YEbk6cWzp3Y9jRBvW-2560-80.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 12:13:32.249701

Trade Mechanics & Money Flow

Trade Mechanics: What Happened?

The trading mechanics on December 26th suggest a quiet, holiday-thinned market, with institutional players making targeted bets rather than a broad retail chase. The relatively low volume indicates a lack of aggressive, widespread participation, typical for the period between Christmas and New Year’s.

Trading volume was subdued at approximately 137-139 million shares, well below the daily average.

Options activity shows strong bullish sentiment, with significant open interest in calls at the $195 and $200 strike prices.

A large block trade of 26,000 calls expiring in September 2025 suggests institutional conviction in long-term upside.

How Is The Money Flowing?

The footprint of this move appears to be primarily institutional. The subdued volume combined with large, strategic options trades points towards smart money positioning for future growth rather than a retail-driven frenzy.

The quiet nature of the 1.0% move on low volume is characteristic of institutional accumulation.

Retail participation was noted, but the significant block trades in the options market indicate a larger institutional hand.

The stock closed near the psychologically important $190 level, setting up a potential test of higher resistance.

What Next?

FOLLOW. The next key level to watch is $200. This is not just a psychological barrier but also where a significant cluster of call option open interest resides. A decisive break above this level, particularly on increasing volume, would signal a continuation of the uptrend, likely forcing options market makers to hedge their positions and potentially creating a gamma squeeze that could accelerate the move higher.

I think President Trump, you know, his his, he's not a career politician.

A major winter storm, Storm Devin, hit many parts of the Northeast and Midwest immediately after Christmas, leading to thousands of cancellations nationwide — although many U.S. airlines reacted to the storm in the best way possible for passengers.

Meanwhile, on Friday, December 26, American Airlines was forced to cancel 109 flights, one of the highest numbers of cancellations, according to FlightAware. This was in part due to its high number of departures compared to other carriers.

American Airlines has since issued a press release announcing a new flight schedule for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), which will provide “greater resilience and less adverse impact” in the event of bad weather. Here's a closer look at this new plan and how it will affect passengers.

American Airlines Reacts To 109 Cancellations With A New Flight Schedule

On Friday, December 26, American Airlines announced significant changes at its largest and busiest hub, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The carrier plans to invest millions of dollars to offer a smoother airport experience, enhance connections for travelers on layovers, and improve resilience in case of weather disruptions.

For years, American Airlines’ schedule at its Dallas hub has been divided into nine banks, a term referring to a group of flights operating roughly at the same time. Beginning in April, the airline will introduce a 13-bank structure, adding new time options. Changes to the schedule will become visible today, Saturday, December 27.

What does this mean for passengers?

American Airlines customers will be able to choose from more departures during ""highly desired"" time windows, as well as fewer early-morning flights. According to the carrier, this is ""especially good news for customers making morning connections through DFW.""

These changes will also help the airline recover better when bad weather hits.

“No other airline recovers from bad weather and irregular operations better than American, and the airline has demonstrated that time and time again,"" the company's press release states.

Now, the airline has stated that its new schedule structure will ensure it will ""recover even quicker and get customers on their way as soon as the weather clears."" American Airlines is also investing millions of dollars in remote deplaning capability, which will help the carrier divert fewer flights away from DFW.

American Airlines Canceled 3% Of Its Flights On Boxing Day

On Boxing Day, Friday, December 26, New York, along with many parts of the Northeast and Midwest, was hit by a heavy winter storm, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations. According to the latest advisory from the National Weather Service, published at 5:20 a.m. EST on Saturday, December 27, a winter storm warning will remain in effect until 10 a.m.

Delta Air Lines was the U.S. carrier with the most cancellations on Friday, with 254 flights canceled, representing about 7% of its scheduled departures for the day. JetBlue followed it with 232 cancellations, representing 23% of its total flights.

American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest only had to cancel 3% of their scheduled departures. The airports that were hit hardest were John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), which reported 159 and 107 cancellations, respectively.

At the moment, it seems that travel disruptions will continue today. Flight Radar reports 131 cancellations at JFK, 85 at La Guardia Airport (LGA), and 70 at Newark Liberty (EWR). For now, American Airlines has been forced to cancel 1% of its departures, for a total of 57 flights, while JetBlue is at the top with 159 cancellations. However, American, along with United Airlines and JetBlue, have responded in kind to passengers amid all the Storm Devin cancellations; the three told Reuters they have waived change and re-booking fees.

According to American Airlines’ press release, bad weather is a serious issue for the carrier, especially at DFW, where thunderstorms have recently forced the entire airport to pause. Apart from the new flight schedule at DFW, the carrier is also investing in a better airport experience for its customers and smoother connections.

American Airlines Is Focusing On Better Connections And Airport Experience

Apart from the new schedule, American Airlines has also announced a few other changes to make connections easier and improve the airport experience for travelers. The new schedule is now reducing extremely short layovers, leading to a less stressful travel experience.

In addition, the company launched an AI tool at DFW Airport in May 2025. This helps connecting passengers get to their second flight by ensuring pilots wait for them in case of delays, when possible. The company has recently announced it will now use this technology in five additional airports.

The press release also reminded passengers that American Airlines is investing in several projects at DFW airport. These include modernizing its airport facilities and adding extra piers, resulting in 31 new gates by 2030.

While American Airlines claims to be the best U.S. carrier at handling flight disruptions caused by bad weather, on December 27, it reported the same cancellation rate as United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Only time will tell whether this new schedule will make a real difference.",https://static0.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2233806869-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-28 04:57:54.001434

Ethiopian Airlines has marked a significant milestone by completing Africa’s first full strip-and-paint process on its Airbus A350-900 fleet, setting a new standard in aircraft maintenance on the continent. This achievement highlights the airline’s advanced maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) capabilities, reinforcing its leadership in operational efficiency and fleet durability.

Advancing Maintenance Capabilities

The full strip-and-paint procedure involves the meticulous removal of all existing paint layers, followed by a comprehensive repainting of the aircraft. This complex process is essential for preserving the structural integrity of the aircraft, enhancing its aesthetic appeal, and improving fuel efficiency by reducing aerodynamic drag. By investing in the necessary technology and infrastructure to perform such high-level maintenance internally, Ethiopian Airlines has significantly reduced its dependence on external service providers, thereby strengthening its competitive position within the aviation sector.

The airline’s technical team ensured that the process adhered to stringent international standards, underscoring Ethiopian Airlines’ unwavering commitment to safety and operational excellence. The Airbus A350-900, renowned for its fuel efficiency and cutting-edge technology, forms a critical component of the airline’s long-haul fleet. Maintaining these aircraft in optimal condition is vital to delivering a safe and comfortable experience for passengers.

Industry Context and Strategic Implications

This development occurs amid heightened industry scrutiny over quality and software issues affecting Airbus’s A320 family. While Ethiopian Airlines’ current focus remains on the A350-900, the broader concerns surrounding Airbus products may prompt competitors and regulators to intensify their examination of fleet maintenance practices. Such scrutiny could influence investor confidence, as apprehensions about potential operational disruptions and the impact on Airbus’s reputation may affect purchasing decisions and fleet management strategies across the global aviation industry.

Ethiopian Airlines’ successful execution of the full strip-and-paint process on both its Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-900 fleets places it among a select group of global carriers capable of conducting such advanced maintenance in-house. This strategic initiative aligns with the airline’s broader vision to expand its MRO capabilities, fostering greater self-sufficiency and resilience in an increasingly competitive market.

As Ethiopian Airlines continues to set new benchmarks in African aviation, its dedication to technical excellence and fleet reliability establishes a standard that resonates beyond the continent, influencing the global aviation landscape.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/3b2e79b53e074917bcb698077a8f77cb.avif,N,,2025-12-28 04:57:47.394202

The last week of December is infamously known for a spike in returns, with one out of every eight returns in the 2024 holiday season taking place between Dec. 26 and Dec. 31, according to Adobe Analytics. This year, the trend is expected to continue.

Between Dec. 26 and Dec. 31, returns are expected to rise by 25% to 35% compared with returns between Nov. 1 and Dec. 12, Adobe said, and it expects returns to remain elevated through the first two weeks of January, up 8% to 15%.

According to a report from the National Retail Federation, about 19% of online sales are expected to be returned in 2025.

But as shoppers head back to stores, they may find that some stores charge fees for returns.

Gift returns: Can I return items for free?

Most retailers, such as Amazon, Target and Walmart, have free returns for most items. For the holiday season, many of these retailers have an extended return window that expires in January.

Nordstrom and other department stores also do free returns, especially when done in person.

Return policies have gotten much tighter in recent years, with Marshalls and T.J. Maxx charging a fee for returns not made in person. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, owned by TJX, charge a $11.99 fee for mail returns.

Clothing stores such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Urban Outfitters, Zara and others charge a fee, ranging from around $5 to $7, for items returned by mail.

JCPenney charges an $8 fee for online returns by mail. Macy's waives its online return fee for Star Rewards members. For non-members, a $9.99 return shipping fee plus tax, where applicable, will be deducted from the refund.

Best Buy has a $45 return fee for products that require activation, such as smartphones and tablets.

Why it matters: Social media has been full of questions about what the unusual arrangement means for Groq employees — both those heading to Nvidia and those staying put.

Catch up quick: Groq and Nvidia on Wednesday announced a ""non-exclusive licensing agreement,"" with media reports accurately pegging the deal value at around $20 billion.

The companies said that Groq CEO Jonathan Ross and president Sunny Madra would join Nvidia, while Groq would continue to operate as a standalone company led by new CEO Simon Edwards (who had been CFO).

It's an unusual structure, but the latest in a recent spate of Big AI deals that seem designed to avoid tripping antitrust wires.

Behind the scenes: Most Groq shareholders will receive per-share distributions tied to the $20 billion valuation, according to sources.

Around 85% will be paid up-front, while another 10% is paid midyear 2026 and the remainder at the end of 2026.

Around 90% of Groq employees are said to be joining Nvidia, and they will be paid cash for all vested shares. Their unvested shares will be paid out at the $20 billion valuation, but via Nvidia stock that vests on a schedule.

There are also around 50 members of that group whose entire stock packages are being accelerated and paid out in cash.

Remaining Groq employees will also be paid for vested shares, plus will receive a package that includes economic participation in the ongoing company.

Any Groq employee — staying or leaving — with the company for less than one year will have their vesting cliff dropped, so they can get some up-front liquidity.

By the numbers: Groq had raised around $3.3 billion in venture capital funding since its 2016 founding, including a $750 million infusion this past fall at nearly a $7 billion post-money valuation.

Backers include Social Capital, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, Samsung, 1789 Capital, Cisco, D1, Cleo Capital, Altimeter, Firestreak Ventures, Conversion Capital and Modi Venture.

The company has never done a secondary tender for either employees or investors.

The bottom line: Everyone gets paid. A lot.",https://images.axios.com/IuuZHNJ-YNSHsXAi9obgpBydckU=/1366x768/smart/2025/01/07/185953-1736276393554.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 20:57:36.236246
