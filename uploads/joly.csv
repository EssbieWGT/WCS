Falling short of the Pact's 2025 circular economy for plastics goals, these companies have decided to withdraw their participation and focus on more attainable sustainability initiatives.

What's happening?

Launched in 2020 as part of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Plastics Pact Network, the U.S. Plastics Pact started as a coalition of over 60 plastics industry leaders, major corporations, government agencies, and research institutions. These leaders were all referred to as ""activators,"" dedicated to achieving a circular economy for plastics. The Pact has grown to over 100 current activators, including major brands such as Aldi, Kraft Heinz, Coca-Cola, and Target.

The Pact's mission is not to deny the use of plastic in business operations, but to minimize the unnecessary use of plastic and ""ensure that the plastics we do need are reusable, recyclable, or compostable, and circulating all the plastic items we use to keep them in the economy and out of the environment."" per the USPP website.

At its start, the USPP set ambitious goals for activators to achieve by 2025. These goals included converting 100% of plastic packaging to reusable, recyclable, or compostable plastic, recycling or composting 50% of all plastic packaging, and achieving an average of 30% responsibly sourced or recycled plastic content.

USPP's Roadmap 2.0, or goals for 2030, continues to drastically reduce plastic waste and encourage greater environmental responsibility by businesses and consumers alike.

The activators who pulled out of the Pact — specifically Walmart and Mars — realized that, despite the strides the companies had taken to reach the Pact's goals, they would still fall short of achieving the target numbers.

""While we have made significant progress towards our ambitious 2025 goals for recycled content, virgin plastic reduction and packaging recyclability, we expect to fall short of achieving these goals by 2025,"" Walmart expressed in a sustainability press release.

Other activators, like the National Stewardship Action Council, felt that the effort invested in achieving the Pact's 2025 goals outweighed the benefits the Pact offered, hence the withdrawal of their participation.

Why is a circular economy for plastic important?

Despite falling short of the target Pact goals, these former activators still made progress toward the mission of achieving a circular economy for plastic, keeping its waste out of landfills.

For example, Walmart calculated that the company successfully diverted 83.5% of operational waste from landfills in 2023. Nestlé has made 89.5% of all its plastic packaging recyclable or reusable by year-end 2024. Nestlé also reduced its use of virgin plastics in packaging by 21.3% by the end of 2024, according to their website.

The progress these companies have made toward reducing the unnecessary use of plastic and responsibly using plastic in cases where it is necessary significantly helps conserve resources and reduce the pollution created by the dirty fossil fuels burned during plastic production.

What can I do to help?

Reducing the use of plastic is not only a corporate responsibility. Everyday consumers can also play a significant role in reducing plastic use.

Some plastic swaps you can make at home include ditching plastic food containers, plastic grocery bags, plastic water bottles, and others for reusable products such as glass lunch boxes, reusable bags, and reusable water bottles.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/U.S.-Plastics-Pactimage-recVHLDviRJ8nNwrv-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 17:00:20.884898

The strikes, which are being led by UFCW Local 7, will be limited to four cities on Sunday, but will expand as the strike goes on, the union said on Saturday.
The limited strike locations include Safeway and Albertsons grocery stores in Estes Park, Pueblo and Fountain, along with a distribution center in Denver.
“At Albertsons Companies, we are committed to productive discussions with UFCW Local 7.

The limited strike locations include Safeway and Albertsons grocery stores in Estes Park, Pueblo and Fountain, along with a distribution center in Denver.

“It’s too bad that things have come to this point with Safeway/Albertsons, but the ongoing unfair labor practices, including bad faith bargaining, as well as surveilling and threatening workers, have given us no choice but to strike”, said Monique Trujillo, a Safeway worker from Fountain, Colorado, in a statement.

In May, Albertsons provided FOX31 with a statement about its ongoing negotiations with the union.

“At Albertsons Companies, we are committed to productive discussions with UFCW Local 7. We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and are negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers and allows our company to remain competitive,” the company stated.

Strike to expand as it goes on

The union said starting the strike on a limited basis will give the public “time to understand the problems” that they argue the workers are facing and allow Safeway and Albertsons time to “understand the seriousness of the workers’ resolve.”

Starting the strike in a limited manner will also reduce hardships for shoppers and workers, the union said.

The union said it had hoped the recent vote to authorize the strike would have led to a “breakthrough” in negotiations, but that that “did not happen.”

“I wish that Safeway/Albertsons had taken negotiations more seriously, obeyed the law, and respected the workers who make the stores run, but wishing doesn’t make it so,” said Kim Cordova, President of UFCW 7, in a statement.

Negotiations held on Wednesday did not achieve a “hoped-for agreement,” according to the union, which said it then issued a 72-hour notice that night to begin a countdown to terminating the contract extension agreement.

Strike follows failed negotiations

The union said the strike comes after more than seven months of contract negotiations with the grocer in an effort to bargain a new contract, which UFCW Local 7 says had an original expiration in January.

UFCW Local 7 said Albertsons and Safeway — a subsidiary of Albertsons operating under the banner of Albertsons Companies — initially showed signs of wanting to reach an agreement, but, instead, “linked arms with King Soopers and City Market” in seeking concessions from workers and retirees on fixed incomes.

“Instead of working with the union, Safeway/Albertsons has instead put its faith in its supposed competitor King Soopers and City Market in an attempt to drive down healthcare and pension benefits for active workers and retirees alike,” Cordova said.

Workers in metro Denver, Boulder, Broomfield, Castle Rock, Conifer, Estes Park, Evergreen, Fountain, Grand Junction, Idaho Springs, Parker, Pueblo, Salida, Steamboat Springs and Vail voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike by 99%, according to the union.

The strike votes were held in late May and early June.

A region-wide strike involving at Kroger-owned King Soopers stores over unfair labor practice claims previously took place earlier this year in February. UFCW Local 7 said that, at that time, an extension agreement was in place with Safeway/Albertsons.",https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/06/AP25037795843703.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-14 16:01:59.723203

Weeks ago, Parade reported how union Kroger drivers at one fulfillment center in Georgia ""overwhelmingly"" voted to authorize a strike, and now we've learned unions in several other states have either approved to strike or already planned one.

Union employees at Albertsons and Safeway (which is owned by Albertsons) in Estes Park, Fountain and Pueblo, Colo., are taking to the picket lines on Sunday morning, according to the Denver Post. It comes after United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 7 rejected the latest offer from Safeway and Albertsons, claiming it failed to address key demands for staffing, livable wages and the protection of workers’ health and pension benefits.

The outlet said that the strike could expand to other stores in metro Denver, including Boulder and Castle Rock, as well as ones in Conifer, Evergreen, Grand Junction, Idaho Springs, Parker, Salida, Steamboat Springs and Vail should the current labor dispute continue.

This is the first time in almost 30 years that Safeway employees in Colorado have walked out to protest unfair labor practices, with the last strike recorded in 1996, per the Denver Post.

“It’s too bad that things have come to this point with Safeway/Albertsons, but the ongoing unfair labor practices, including bad faith bargaining, as well as surveilling and threatening workers, have given us no choice but to strike,” Monique Trujillo, a Safeway worker in Fountain, said in a statement shared with the publication.

Members of other local unions representing 45,000 grocery store workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions locations across Southern California also voted overwhelmingly to authorize a similar strike earlier this week.

“For four months, we’ve negotiated with Kroger and Albertsons, offering solutions to the staff shortage crisis that hurts store operations, working conditions and customer service. The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were ‘anecdotal,’ downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily,"" the bargaining committee for UFCW Locals 324 and 770 said in a statement.

""We’re at the breaking point. We are disrespected, overworked and undervalued by Kroger and Albertsons. We’re tired of asking these corporations to invest in their workers and customers, only to see no results,"" it added, noting that the strike authorization doesn't mean employees will walk off the job immediately, but the pressure and promise to do so is there.

""This strike authorization vote means that we expect the companies to return to the bargaining table, negotiate a deal that works for everyone and desist from their unlawful tactics before we walk out and hit the picket lines,"" the statement concluded.

The group's efforts are part of a nationwide effort that includes approximately 100,000 union grocery workers employed by Kroger and Albertsons and should the strikes happen, it could lead to “the largest grocery strike in modern history, and a major labor disruption for two of the nation’s largest grocery chains this summer, their busiest season of the year,” union workers say.

In response to the vote, a spokesperson for the Kroger family of companies–which includes Ralphs, among other big names like Dillons, Fry's, and Fred Meyer–shared a statement with local KTLA reporters which read in part: “Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading healthcare and a pension…These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer.""

Details of the sentiment remain sealed. Yet, both Allen and Chicago-based McDonald’s USA released statements addressing the end of the suit.

McDonald’s admits no wrongdoing. Still, the corporation stated its commitment to working with Black-owned media where “mutually beneficial.”

“We are pleased that Mr. Allen has come to appreciate McDonald’s unwavering commitment to inclusion, and has agreed to refocus his energies on a mutually beneficial commercial arrangement that is consistent with other McDonald’s supplier relationships,” McDonald’s USA said in a statement. “Our company’s unique three-legged stool model relies on mutual respect, and we look forward to ESN’s contributions to the betterment of our system.”

In the joint statement, Allen insinuates he has clarity about the structuring of the company’s ad tiers. A better understanding that will allow him to move forward doing business with the company.

“We are pleased to find a resolution that maintains our business relationship,” Allen said. “During the course of this litigation, many of our preconceptions have been clarified, and we acknowledge McDonald’s commitment to investing in Black-owned media properties and increasing access to opportunity. Our differences are behind us, and we look forward to working together.”

This is not Allen’s first time holding a corporation accountable for alleged discrimination. The media mogul has taken both Comcast, Direct TV, and Charter Communications.

In 2020, Allen’s suit against Comcast made its way to the Supreme Court after battling through the court system for five years. Allen claimed racial discrimination when a carriage deal between the companies fell through. The high court dismissed the case stating Allen needed to prove race was the sole reason for the failed negotiations as opposed to one element. After the case was sent back to a lower court Comcast chose to settle, The Los Angeles Times reports.

Most of the settlement terms remain undisclosed. Still, Allen soon negotiated to add Comedy.TV, Recipe.TV, and JusticeCentral.TV — on Comcast’s Xfinity cable television packages. He also negotiated a larger distribution package for the Weather Channel.",https://blackenterprise-prod.b-cdn.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/02/img_11920.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 16:02:40.971158

The union went on strike against 77 Colorado stores in the King Soopers and Kroger grocery chain in February.
The earlier King Soopers strike started at 77 stores on its first day.
Local7 said the coming strike against Safeway stores would be smaller in comparison in its first day, but would expand should the strike continue.","With the clock winding down toward Saturday night's deadline for new contract negotiations, a Colorado union has announced locations where grocery employees are set to walk off the job on Sunday in protest.

The strike will start at Safeway/Albertsons stores in Estes Park, Fountain and Pueblo, plus a Denver distribution center, according to a press release from the United Food and Commercial Workers Local7.

The union issued a required 72-hour strike notice to the grocery chain Wednesday night following a negotiations session which failed to produce a new contract agreement or an extension to negotiations. The deadline is 11:59 p.m. Saturday. The current contract expired in January. Union members approved the strike in a vote last week - with 99% approving the strike action, per the union.

More union members who work at stores in Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, Greeley, Loveland, and Longmont are expected to vote Monday and Tuesday on whether to strike or not.

The union went on strike against 77 Colorado stores in the King Soopers and Kroger grocery chain in February. The two sides agreed to continue negotiations and end the walkout a week and a half later, and a ""limited"" contract agreement was reached in May.

But that agreement came after the union filed a lawsuit against King Soopers in April, claiming it violated the agreement it and the union signed at the end of the strike.

King Soopers, in return, filed two countersuits of its own against the union.

""I wish that Safeway/Albertsons had taken negotiations more seriously, obeyed the law, and respected the workers who make the stores run, but wishing doesn't make it so,"" stated Kim Cordova, President of UFCW 7, in the union's press release. ""We are fighting for better stores so that shoppers and workers alike can have a better experience. Instead of working with the union, Safeway/Albertsons has instead put its faith in its supposed competitor King Soopers and City Market in an attempt to drive down healthcare and pension benefits for active workers and retirees alike.""

The earlier King Soopers strike started at 77 stores on its first day. Local7 said the coming strike against Safeway stores would be smaller in comparison in its first day, but would expand should the strike continue.

""It's too bad that things have come to this point with Safeway/Albertsons, but the ongoing unfair labor practices, including bad faith bargaining, as well as surveilling and threatening workers, have given us no choice but to strike"", Monique Trujillo, a Safeway worker from Fountain, stated in the union's press release.

Why it matters: This is a major pivot for once-proud corporate America and puts at risk critical services for LGBTQ+ individuals in Denver.

State of play: Denver Pride is the largest annual fundraiser for The Center on Colfax, a nonprofit that offers free mental health support and programs for transgender and gender-diverse individuals in the community.

In April, the center reported a $230,000 decrease in sponsorship for its two-day Pride event that features a festival, 5K and parade.

New sponsors are helping fill the gap, but spokesperson Ashley Schoenbauer tells us fundraising still lags previous years.

The intrigue: The center declined to name the sponsors it lost, but its website shows top-level donors decreased from 16 to 11 this year.

Nissan, Target, Verizon and Walmart are among the names that no longer appear on the sponsor website for Denver Pride, an Axios Denver review found.

Other big names decreased their level of giving, such as Starbucks, JPMorganChase and Cupcake wines.

Between the lines: The reasoning varies, Schoenbauer tells us, including shifting budget priorities and economic concerns. But the rollback of DEI initiatives is a key factor.

One top-level sponsor standing firm is Molson Coors. The beverage company received blowback in 2023 for its sponsorship at a time when other big brands were pulling back from supporting the LGBTQ community.

The big picture: 39% of corporations are limiting external Pride Month engagements this year, according to Gravity Research data.

Roughly 6 in 10 companies cite the Trump administration as the top reason for this change, while conservative activists come in second, and conservative policymakers come in third, per Gravity Research.

This is a sharp increase from last year, when only 9% said they were changing their external Pride engagement.

Let yourself be driven’, the ‘Have a drink, order an Uber’ campaign has partnered with hundreds of bars and cafes to offer customers 30% discounts on Uber rides home. The three-month trial is part of AB InBev’s broader Smart Drinking global responsibility programme.

AB InBev’s OB Beer division in South Korea commenced a responsible drinking activation ahead of the country’s university festival season. ‘Cass 0.0 Attack’ uses quizzes and games to promote non-alcoholic beverages as alternatives to regular alcohol consumption and heavy drinking at university festivities, and will visit universities around the country this summer.

In Japan, Kirin partnered with Waseda University’s student health association to raise awareness about the importance of responsible drinking. Timed to coincide with the beginning of the academic year, the ‘Kirin Responsible Drinking Seminar’ advises new students on how to deal with anxiety and peer pressure, warning against binge drinking or drinking while still underage.

Back to South Korea, and Lotte Chilsung unveiled ‘Drink Responsibly’ labelling (below), starting off with the company’s main brands. A new drink-driving warning symbol has been added to Lotte’s existing label warnings, which concern consumption during pregnancy and underage drinking. While recent legislation requiring a drink-driving warning on alcohol packaging will take effect in 2026, a spokesperson said Lotte was introducing its changes “preemptively” to help establish a “responsible drinking culture.”

Pernod Ricard joined over 20,000 revellers to promote responsible drinking at the Tomorrowland winter festival on the Alpe d’Huez slopes in France. The company distributed reusable water pouches to festivalgoers throughout the daytime, and at night moved among the crowds with ‘Drink More Water’ carts to underscore the importance of staying hydrated.

In late April, Pernod Ricard also attended the ChangeNOW sustainability summit in Paris to lead a workshop called ‘Rethink your Drink: A Bold Take on Responsibility’. The group highlighted several of its responsibility campaigns, including ‘Drink More Water’, and discussed ongoing actions to make moderation cool, mindful choices easy and responsible drinking the new norm.

Aware.org conducted a nationwide survey in South Africa to evaluate teenager’s awareness of the risks associated with underage drinking, as part of its flagship ‘#NOtoUnder18’ initiative. Researchers found high awareness among the country’s teens, who mostly recognise the negative effects of underage drinking. Aware.org commented that the survey results will allow its experts to move from assumption to evidence when designing harm-reduction strategies.

Staying in South Africa, and the Drinks Federation of South Africa launched an industry-wide initiative to promote responsible alcohol marketing. The ‘Small Print, Big Impact’ campaign is designed to make the self-regulatory Alcohol Industry Communications Code of Conduct more widely understood and implemented across the sector, from producers through to marketers and communication teams. The code outlines important marketing standards to ensure that ads are socially responsible, do not target minors, avoid misleading claims and do not glamorise alcohol.

Asahi partnered with the British Beer & Pub Association and Zero Carbo Forum in the UK to produce a report on the significant climate risks facing the country’s barley and hop crops. The report warns that both crops face diminishing yields and quality due to drier summers and wetter autumns, and offers advice on how brewers, farmers and the Government can work together to mitigate these risks through a whole-of-society approach.

Asahi also switched on its recently-constructed solar farm in the UK, which will provide all of the company’s electricity needs in the country for the next decade. The company’s unit in the country will be implementing a range of biodiversity initiatives at the site, which will generate 22.3GWh of electricity per year.

Carlsberg’s Švyturys-Utenos Alus has become the first climate-neutral brewery in Lithuania. A new 7.5MW solar power plant and a 6MWh battery storage park on site has fully decarbonised the facility.

And in Vietnam, around 200 Carlsberg staff and managers marked World Environment Day 2025 with a coastal clean-up initiative. The volunteers collected over three tons of rubbish from beaches in Phuoc Tinh, helping to restore the natural beauty of the shoreline. Representatives from Denmark’s embassy in the country also joined the volunteers, highlighting the importance of cross-sector environmental partnerships.

Suntory unveiled its mid- to long-term plans for utilising hydrogen in Japan, with the intention of becoming the first business in the country to engage across the entire green hydrogen value chain, from production to sales. The ‘Suntory Green Hydrogen Vision’ builds on a history of public-private partnerships under the Government’s 2017 Basic Hydrogen Strategy. Suntory collaborated with regional authorities and other partners to create Japan’s largest 16 megawatt Power-to-Gas System in Yamanashi Prefecture, to supply green hydrogen to both of its manufacturing facilities in the region, as well as other neighbouring businesses. The group also plans to use the project to establish a ‘local production for local consumption’ model for green hydrogen supplies in inland regions.

Companies said these issues included being barred from obtaining insurance, taking out loans and opening a bank account – which stops employers paying staff or suppliers.
Small defence manufacturers produce the vital parts used in military hardware, from the tiny components used in tanks to artillery cases.
“Our sovereign defence financing capability is not only a matter of national security; but an absolute necessity at this moment in time.
It doesn’t get directed at the defence industry, or maybe it does, but banks are more visible.","British defence companies vital to national security claim they are being debanked because high street lenders see them as a threat to their reputations.

In an alarming report about the financial challenges facing UK-based manufacturers, nearly three quarters surveyed said they had experienced “issues” accessing basic banking services as major lenders become wary of taking on clients involved in arms.

Companies said these issues included being barred from obtaining insurance, taking out loans and opening a bank account – which stops employers paying staff or suppliers.

One business owner quoted in the report, which was carried out by the ADS – the trade body representing more than 1,500 small defence companies – said their bank account was shut down after being told they did not meet the bank’s “terms and conditions”.

The report will raise fresh questions over the Government’s push for Britain to become “battle ready” as it prepares to counter growing threats from countries such as Russia.

Earlier this month, the strategic defence review said that Britain must be ready to once again “fight and win” a full-scale war by rearming and upgrading its equipment.

But according to the ADS, the companies that will be instrumental in achieving this objective are facing financial barriers so severe they “risk going under”.

Small defence manufacturers produce the vital parts used in military hardware, from the tiny components used in tanks to artillery cases.

Of 200 owners surveyed by the ADS, 72 per cent reported issues accessing banking services.

One owner quoted in the report said: “Our bank account was actually forced to be closed and the only explanation they could offer was that they didn’t meet our terms and conditions.”

The report said banks’ reputational concerns have been a “key driving factor” in a more hesitant approach in providing their services to defence firms.

Some banks, the report claims, described being lobbied not to support the defence sector, while others referenced pro-Palestinian protests targeting high street branches with perceived links to the Israel-Hamas war.

Last June, activists from Palestine Action attacked up to 20 Barclays bank branches across the UK by throwing red paint and smashing windows as part of their demand that the bank divest from “Israel’s weapons trade”.

One owner of a small defence company, quoted in the report, said: “The financial sector has completely decimated the defence industry, they’d rather have an account with the local car-wash than a firearms dealer or somebody in the defence industry.”

Santander and Lloyds closed 300 accounts belonging to “public administration and defence” companies last year alone, according to correspondence with MPs on the Treasury select committee.

Luke Charters, a Labour MP and chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on financial technology, told The Telegraph: “As war rages on our continent and Russia continues to mobilise their wartime economy at pace, we have to ensure the [small defence companies] who will keep us safe aren’t being blocked from banking access.

“Our sovereign defence financing capability is not only a matter of national security; but an absolute necessity at this moment in time. We cannot risk it being undermined by historical red tape, that has persisted for far too long.”

A spokesman for the ADS said: “The scale of the issue with regard to smaller businesses accessing financial services is increasing in magnitude – and without appropriate options, smaller businesses risk their ability to deliver on their full potential.

“The long-term effect of this is that exciting businesses – that deliver the capability responsible for protecting our national security – risk going under, or are unable to deliver the pace, scale and innovation that our increasingly unstable environment requires.”

An interviewee for the report, described as a “financial stakeholder”, said: “People chucking bricks at windows, ATMs, chucking paint at staff. It’s horrible.

“Banks do take threats to their staff seriously and that is difficult. It doesn’t get directed at the defence industry, or maybe it does, but banks are more visible. They’ve got this high-profile, high-street presence that people can target.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2025/06/14/TELEMMGLPICT000380329955_17499171501040_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-06-14 15:00:36.827093

That’s the message Technology Secretary Peter Kyle delivered this week (Friday 13 June) as he brought together leading tech firms for a first round of focused talks.

Peter Kyle met the likes of Amazon, Barclays, BT, Google, IBM, Intuit, Microsoft, Sage, and Salesforce, as a new government-industry partnership unveiled by the Prime Minister during London Tech Week formally kicked off its work.

The talks focused on how industry and government can work together to deliver on this joint ambition, including identifying future skills needs and making training more accessible. During the meeting, the group worked towards agreeing terms of reference and a schedule of regular meetings helping to track its progress.

Science, Innovation, and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said:

Artificial Intelligence is the new economic frontier, and we want to get Brits ready for jobs of the future so we can spark the growth powering our Plan for Change.

If we want to realise AI’s incredible potential though, we need to make sure people of all ages and from all parts of the UK have the skills they need for jobs both in and with the technology – especially given we expect around 10 million workers to be using AI in their day-to-day role by 2035.

Within days of announcing that we’re partnering with some of the world’s biggest tech leaders to help us do exactly that, we’re getting them around the table – representing a vote of confidence not only in Britain’s workers, but in the potential we offer as a global AI powerhouse.

Companies who have signed up to this partnership will all bring a different area of expertise to its work. Microsoft have already committed to upskilling 1 million workers in AI by the end of the year, while firms including SAS and Sage will provide high-quality AI training resources for workers, boosting their confidence in using and adopting the technology. IBM are also set to tap into the power of its IBM SkillsBuild training programmes to roll out targeted training modules for workers, arming them with the tools they need to confidently adopt and use AI.

In the 12 months since the government took office, the UK has attracted more than £44 billion in AI investment, with 13,250 jobs being created since the Prime Minister launched the AI Opportunities Action Plan in January.

With a growing number of firms looking to Britain to support their AI ambitions, the collective focus of leading companies and Ministers will now work to equip people across the country with the skills they need to thrive in the age of AI.

Industry reaction

Alison Kay, Vice President and Managing Director, UK and Ireland at AWS, said:

Democratising access to digital skills training will be key to helping the UK unlock the full potential of AI, boost productivity, and support the transformation of the UK’s digital economy.

That’s why at Amazon, we’re proud to support the UK government to achieve its goal to train 7.5 million people in AI skills through initiatives like this, and through programmes such as AWS Educate, AWS Skill Builder, and the Skills to Jobs Tech Alliance, which are free for learners.

Working together, we’ll help ensure the benefits of AI are accessible to everyone, and build a pipeline of talent across all nations and regions that can seize the AI opportunity today and in the future.

Craig Bright, Group Chief Information Officer and Deputy Group Co-Chief Operating Officer, Barclays, said:

Partnering to deliver AI education at a national scale reflects our commitment to inclusive innovation -equipping communities with the skills and understanding needed to thrive in the future.

Allison Kirkby, Chief Executive of BT Group, said:

Harnessing AI and the digital infrastructure underpinning it are the growth opportunity of the decade. BT is investing record levels in the networks that enable the AI economy, and we know how important it is that everyone benefits. That’s why we’re so proud to support government’s AI upskilling partnership.

As we equip our people to work with AI-driven tools, we look forward to partnering with government and other businesses to help the wider workforce too.

Google EMEA President, Debbie Weinstein, said:

Our AI Works report uncovered the most effective ways to accelerate nationwide AI adoption and upskilling.

We are thrilled to have this opportunity to work alongside the government and wider industry to apply these learnings, enable more people to reap AI’s benefits, and unlock a £400 billion economic boost that will benefit the country for generations to come.

Leon Butler, Chief Executive, IBM UK and Ireland, said:

AI is helping to transform every industry - opening opportunities to innovate and unlock new forms of value. Creating a workforce that understands digital technologies will be crucial to boost AI adoption and so realise its huge benefits for business and society.

IBM is proud to support the government’s efforts to train more of the UK workforce in AI.

Leigh Thomas, Vice President for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), at Intuit:

AI is a growth enabler for the UK economy, levelling the playing field for smaller businesses, by giving them the opportunity to access the sort of technology solutions that larger businesses already enjoy.

Businesses embracing AI are 13 times more likely to report increased revenue. This initiative to upskill 7.5 million workers on AI by 2030 will help to improve prosperity for all, and we look forward to accelerating knowledge, understanding and adoption by those that need it most.

Steve Hare, CEO, Sage, said:

This initiative is exactly what the UK needs - skills-focused and future-looking. At Sage, we see every day how small businesses want to embrace AI but are held back by a lack of confidence and know-how.

By working together across government, industry, and education, we can give people the tools they need to unlock AI’s full potential and drive real productivity across the economy.

Zahra Bahrololoumi CBE, CEO of Salesforce UK and Ireland said:

Ensuring the UK workforce has the skills to work effectively with AI is crucial for driving economic growth. At Salesforce, we are committed to equipping our teams and communities with essential AI skills.

We welcome the government’s goal to train 7.5 million UK workers in AI by 2030. Having opened our first AI centre in 2024, this week we strengthened our vote of confidence in the UK by awarding $2.35 million to organisations dedicated to digital and AI literacy.

Together with government, these investments will enhance productivity, boost prosperity, and ensure that humans and AI thrive together in the new era of work.

Glyn Townsend, Education and Academic relationships lead for SAS EMEA, said:

Artificial intelligence is reshaping work faster than any previous technology, and doing so across an unprecedented 5 distinct generations active in the UK labour market.

The UK already ranks third in the global AI league - we must therefore equip every worker, from apprentices to octogenarians, with the ability to seize the opportunities this revolution creates and leverage new innovative technologies from our world-leading universities and entrepreneurs.

By backing this programme, we will ensure equitable access to the skills that drive both meaningful careers and sustainable economic growth.

Besides answering customers' questions about their ancestry, 23andMe's genetic data is valuable as a way to identify possible health risks, and in the case of Regeneron, as a tool for identifying drug targets.

It's not completely clear what Wojcicki intends to do next, but 23andMe's announcement includes a list of customer data and privacy protections TTAM Research Institute has agreed to, including continuing to allow customers to delete their data and opt-out of research, establishing a Consumer Privacy Advocacy Board and promising to ""not sell or transfer genetic data"" in the event of another bankruptcy — unless the buyer agrees to the same privacy protections.

Maintaining control of the company's assets has been Wojcicki's plan since 23andMe declared bankruptcy in March 2025. She originally resigned as the company's CEO to make a bid on the company.

""I am thrilled that TTAM Research Institute will be able to continue the mission of 23andMe to help people access, understand and benefit from the human genome,"" Wojcicki says. ""We believe it is critical that individuals are empowered to have choice and transparency with respect to their genetic data and have the opportunity to continue to learn about their ancestry and health risks as they wish.""

23andMe had a turbulent few years prior to declaring bankruptcy, suffering a data breach in 2023 that impacted millions of customers and mass layoffs in 2024 that affected 40 percent of the company's staff.

Chinh made the suggestion at a meeting on Friday with Borje Ekholm, Ericsson's president and CEO, within the framework of his official visit to Sweden.

Ericsson is one of the world’s leading telecom groups, especially in 5G infrastructure. Making its presence in Vietnam in 1993, the giant has provided equipment and solutions for major telecom operators like Viettel, VNPT, and MobiFone across all generations of mobile technology, including GSM, WCDMA, LTE, and 5G.

I leave knowing the company is in capable hands and look forward to continuing my work and mission of supporting Nigerian businesses through SME Scale Up,” he says.

Sari El-Khalil’s appointment marks both continuity and renewal.

The announcement was made during a ribbon-cutting ceremony held at the site. Once operational later this summer, the solar park will generate enough clean energy to power over 23,000 homes, contributing to the state’s growing renewable energy capacity.

As Michigan’s largest producer and investor in renewable energy, DTE has been steadily expanding its clean energy infrastructure. Since 2009, the company’s renewable energy projects have helped create an estimated 20,000 jobs across the state. The Polaris Solar Park is expected to bring substantial tax revenue to Gratiot County, including Washington and North Star Townships. These funds can support essential public services such as road maintenance, emergency response, libraries, and other community needs. This comes in addition to the $42 million in tax revenue already generated by DTE’s three existing wind parks in the county.

Matt Paul, president and chief operating officer, DTE Electric, mentioned, “DTE is committed to growing our portfolio of clean, Michigan-made renewable energy as part of our broader generation mix to support the evolving energy needs of our customers. This continues to be the most active period of renewable energy development in DTE’s history, which also enables us to partner with local communities to help drive economic development and improve the lives of residents in towns across Michigan.”

Jim Wheeler, President of Greater Gratiot Development, a non-profit organization that promotes economic activity in Gratiot County, said in a statement, “Polaris Solar is a significant investment in Gratiot County, a project that will benefit police departments, county parks, and local government entities throughout our local communities. Where some counties are looking at cutbacks, we haven’t had to do that. Here, renewable energy helps improve the overall quality of life for the county and the people who live in it.”

Polaris Solar is the third new solar park DTE is bringing online in 2025. It is part of a broader expansion that includes five more solar parks currently under construction. All of these projects are funded through CleanVision MIGreenPower, DTE’s voluntary renewable energy program, which is the largest of its kind in Michigan. Through this program, residential and business customers can support clean energy development by enrolling in solar and wind energy options.

To date, MIGreenPower has enrolled nearly 100,000 residential customers and around 1,200 businesses. These enrollments are playing a key role in advancing DTE’s clean energy goals, including achieving net zero carbon emissions and meeting Michigan’s renewable energy standard of 60% by 2035. By the end of 2025, DTE’s renewable portfolio will be capable of powering more than 800,000 homes in the state. Looking ahead, the company aims to increase that number significantly, with plans to power the equivalent of nearly 6 million homes with clean energy by 2042. The completion of the Polaris Solar Park marks another step forward in DTE’s long-term commitment to sustainability, economic development, and community partnership across Michigan.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pexels-photo-356036-4.jpeg,N,,2025-06-14 12:04:31.949792

After President Donald Trump announced the finer details of his plan for tariffs on April 2, the reality of how they would affect Americans' everyday lives started to sink in.

💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵

Some of the biggest retailers in the country, from Walmart to Target, soon indicated that prices may have to rise in order to offset tariff cost increases.

In other words, the businesses were planning to pass the costs along to the customer, something no one in the country struggling with an already-high cost of living wants to hear.

Customers quickly pivoted in response, pulling back on luxuries like eating out, getting coffee on the go, and vacation planning. In a recent survey from McKinsey & Company, 43% of consumers reported rising prices as their top concern, with more than half planning to cut back on nonessential spending.

Retailers are scrambling as profits are dropping before their eyes, trying to find ways to coerce customers to spend, despite the current climate of uncertainty.

Starbucks is taking an unusual approach to that, not only promising big in-store changes, but admitting that it made a big misstep.

Starbucks CEO admits the company took a wrong turn

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol recently told Axios in an interview that pulling back on in-store seating was a mistake, saying, ""We had this strategy that I think was just a misfire of a purpose-driven store.""

More Retail:

Huge retail chain closing more stores soon (locations revealed)

Struggling drugstore chain announces second bankruptcy

Beloved discount grocery chain has massive US plans

Now Niccol says the focus needs to move away from purpose-driven efficiency and towards what he calls ""community connection.""

As a part of its Back to Starbucks plan announced in September 2024, Niccol says new menu items are coming. Currently in testing is a ""chocolate protein cold foam"" and banana bread lattes.

But another innovation Niccol mentioned is of significant interest: food that's actually baked in stores. Starbucks has traditionally stocked frozen foods that it reheats before serving to customers, but this approach would support Niccol's plan to attract a community who would prize fresh over frozen foods.

Niccol also told Axios that the company has to create new ""fastballs"" for the business, like its oh-so-famous Pumpkin Spice Latte.

Starbucks is also investing heavily in its workforce as a part of the plan.

""Starbucks is expanding its workforce by adding at least one full-time assistant store manager to most company-operated stores nationwide beginning this fall,"" TheStreet's Fernanda Tronco reports.

Lastly, Starbucks is also working on a plan that will make many customers happy: its ""Green Apron Service Model,"" which aims to deliver drinks into customers' hands in four minutes.

Where Starbucks stands today

While Niccol's planned changes sound promising, they're also necessary to revive a struggling business.

Starbucks' sales have fallen for four quarters in a row, and the company reported during its April 29 earnings call that net earnings fell 50% to $384.2 million from the prior year.

Starbucks attributed some of the decline to hiring efforts focused on its turnaround strategy and various restructuring costs.

While tariff fears certainly have had an impact on this year's sales, it's clear that Starbucks' current problem predates that.

Naturally, Niccol's ambitious plans will take time to crystallize.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjEzNDgyNzIwODg0NDM0Nzgx/a-barista-places-an-iced-coffee-in-the-mobile-pickup-area-at-a-starbucks-in-new-york-3.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:04:56.175401

This is due, in part, to the decrease in consumer spending, which has extended even to affordable options like fast food.
As part of this strategy, McDonald's launched a national promotion at the end of May.","Since its beginnings, McDonald's has been synonymous with speed and accessibility. With such a broad presence, its hours have always been consistent, providing fast food at any time of day. However, times are changing, and the chain is ready to make a shift.

This summer, McDonald's has decided to make a significant change. Starting this season, most of its locations in the United States will remain open until midnight, and in some cases, even later. This decision is part of a much broader strategy to adapt to new consumer demands and take advantage of the growing trend of going out later.

A necessary change at McDonald's to keep its relevance

McDonald's has had to react to a drop in its sales in the U.S. market. The chain has seen a 3.6% decrease in its revenue (3.6%), the worst decline since the pandemic. This is due, in part, to the decrease in consumer spending, which has extended even to affordable options like fast food. Faced with this situation, the brand is betting on expanding its availability to attract more customers, especially during the night.

The goal is to reach those who are looking for quick and accessible options during the early morning or outside traditional hours. However, locations in non-traditional settings, such as airports or shopping malls, will keep their usual breakfast hours, as has been confirmed.

McDonald's will provide new employment opportunities

To ensure the success of this new measure, McDonald's has announced that they will hire about 375,000 people during the summer. This increase in staff will allow them to handle the rise in activity during nighttime hours, ensuring that all restaurants can keep quality in their service. In addition, franchisees will have the freedom to decide which products they will offer on their nighttime menus, although the most popular dishes will be available.

As part of this strategy, McDonald's launched a national promotion at the end of May. In key cities like Los Angeles, New York, and Detroit, they handed out gift cards and merchandise at street events and concerts. This campaign included the launch of the new McCrispy Strips, a product that has become one of the most desired by the brand's fans.

Additionally, the viral TikTok phenomenon has also worked in McDonald's favor. A video posted by user @MillyHancockk suggested that a combination of fries and a large Coca-Cola could relieve headaches, which quickly caused hundreds of comments and shares. Although there is no scientific evidence to support this claim, the virality of this ""remedy"" has caused even more visibility for the brand on social media.",https://catalunyadiari.com/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-de-hombre-sorprendido-con-local-mcdonalds-de-fondo-estados-unidos_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-06-14 09:58:27.739525

As Trump wages a trade war against China, U.S. companies have timed shipments in hopes of avoiding the most expensive levies.","The Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, an ad industry conference, awards show and schmoozefest that begins on Monday, is known for its beaches and its sunny atmosphere.

This year, attendees can also expect an existential debate.

For years, ad executives have understood a technological takeover of ad creative was coming, and with it, a power shift from creative agencies to the tech giants that control the platforms. Now, with companies like Google, Pinterest, Snap and Amazon steadily adding powerful A.I. ad creation tools, it feels uncomfortably near.

Anxieties peaked this spring with reports that Meta would soon allow advertisers to make A.I.-generated ads without any agency involvement.

Some believe agencies can effectively embrace generative A.I. (Agencies are a “critical partner” and “an essential channel for the industry,” Dave Dugan, Meta’s vice president of global clients and agencies, said when asked about the company’s new A.I. tools.) Others warn agencies will be displaced by it.

Around half of U.S. digital ad spending annually goes to Google and Meta, and ad agencies give them plenty of data about their ideas simply by running ads on the platforms.

Holding companies want a stake in A.I.-generated ads. They are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in their own platforms. For example:

WPP is investing $400 million a year in its own A.I. platforms. It also has a strategic partnership and an equity stake in the generative content startup Stability AI.

Publicis Groupe has invested in the A.I. content platform Bria and acquired several content creation startups, including Influential, for which it paid $500 million last year.

Omnicom and IPG are in the process of merging in a deal worth $13 billion that the companies say will create more A.I.-driven capabilities and scale.

In 2024, about 12 percent of entries to Cannes Lions used A.I., according to the conference.

Some ad executives see an expanding pie. Stephan Pretorius, the chief technology officer of WPP, told DealBook that making it easier to create ads is not necessarily a bad thing. “A big reason why search was so successful in adding new advertising customers is because anyone could do it,” he said.

Even if A.I. tools turn ads into commodities, they “can’t come up with the kernel of the concept beyond what already exists,” said Donna Sharp, managing director at MediaLink, which helps arrange deals between advertisers and agencies.

A.I. may push ad creatives from producing to consulting. At Cannes, Monks, a marketing technology agency, will showcase a new process that involves a dozen A.I. agents collaborating on strategic and creative work. Wesley ter Haar, a co-founder of the agency, said the agency is becoming a “system integrator” that helps clients with A.I. adoption.

Not all agencies have gone that far, but most major players — and some smaller ones — are aggressively exploring ways to use generative A.I.

Will A.I. investments pay off for agencies? The agencies think so — or at least hope so. But platforms can place A.I. tools in front of advertisers at the same places where they’re purchasing ads. That could lead some advertisers, especially smaller businesses, to question their need for agencies if Google’s and Meta’s tools work well enough.

The agency Goodby, Silverstein & Partners will use Cannes to showcase how A.I. can aid human creativity, screening a trailer made with content generation tools for a screenplay by the artist Salvador Dalí that was never developed.

“What is it that humans are bringing to the game?” said Margaret Johnson, the chief creative officer and a partner at G.S.&P. “The answer is originality. When you’re starting with a script from 1937 that Salvador Dalí wrote himself, you realize how powerful originality is.”

It’s too soon to know if the optimism is in the right place, but it raises another big question: What’s the market rate for a new idea?

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

President Trump pauses immigration raids on farms, hotels and eateries. The decision comes as demonstrations against the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration are planned for today in all 50 states. It suggests the scale of President Trump’s mass deportations is hurting industries and constituents he does not want to lose.

Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel say they’ve reached an agreement to close their deal. President Biden had previously blocked the Japanese steel maker from acquiring its U.S. competitor for $14.9 billion because of national security concerns. A new deal with the Trump administration gives the U.S. government a “golden share” in the company.

The fallout for law firms that cut deals with Trump continues. Seven partners at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which struck an agreement with the president to avoid a crippling executive order, will join Cooley, a firm that helped successfully challenge one of Trump’s orders in court.

He and his colleague, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, sued the Trump administration over their dismissal, accusing the president of executive overreach. DealBook’s Danielle Kaye spoke with Bedoya about that ongoing lawsuit, the direction of the agency and what he’s doing next. The interview has been condensed and edited.

Walk me through your decision to step down.

I tried to keep doing my job as long as I could, but at a certain point, I couldn’t do it any longer. I’m a dad, I need a paycheck, and I can’t draw a paycheck from anyone other than F.T.C. while I hold myself out as an F.T.C. commissioner.

[As he fought to be reinstated, Bedoya had still been following ethics guidelines that prevent F.T.C. commissioners from taking other jobs. He said he had not been paid nor had he been able to vote since his dismissal.]

How do you view the ramifications of your dismissal?

The protections that apply to us are essentially the same that apply to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, to the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to commissioners at the Securities Exchange Commission.

So a world where me and Commissioner Slaughter can be shown the door at a moment’s notice is a world where that same kind of instability affects your retirement account, your checking account — pretty much every aspect of the modern economy.

Do you expect regulators under Trump to continue closely watching tech, as some have indicated?

To his credit, Chairman Andrew Ferguson said — after he was designated but not sworn in — that he wanted to continue to hold Big Tech’s feet to the fire. Assistant Attorney General Slater has a great track record on this.

The reason I’m worried, though, is that in a world where any of them can be removed for no reason at any time, it doesn’t matter what they think. Because either they obey and they stay — or they don’t and they won’t.

You’ve been critical of some recent decisions from the Republican-led F.T.C. That includes the repeal of the pricing lawsuit against Pepsi. What do these actions say about the F.T.C.’s new priorities?

The good is that both Slater and Ferguson have committed themselves to protecting competition in labor markets. The bad is dropping a lawsuit that would have leveled the playing field for small retailers across the country.

What about a potential consent decree in the agency’s review of the Omnicom-Interpublic merger that would prevent the merged company from boycotting platforms because of their political content?

As Trump wages a trade war against China, U.S. companies have timed shipments in hopes of avoiding the most expensive levies. Price changes for shipping a container between China and the U.S. reflect the strategy, Sarah Kessler reports for DealBook.

Early in the year, companies stockpiled goods from China in anticipation of Trump’s taking office. Demand for vessel space soared, making a usual spike in prices ahead of slowdowns after the Chinese New Year and the U.S. holiday season more severe.

In April, when the Trump administration announced a minimum 145 percent rate on Chinese imports, much trade between the two countries ground to a halt. Carriers were able to avoid a major price plunge by reducing capacity.

In May, the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily slash those sky-high tariff rates, setting off a rush to import goods before the end of a 90-day pause. But carriers had already pulled back on capacity, creating a temporary shortage of vessel space as demand surged. Prices shot up, with many hikes starting June 1 before beginning to ease again (possibly because carriers “added too much capacity back to the lane just now,” said Judah Levine, the head of research at the freight booking platform Freightos).

The U.S. and China reached a handshake deal this week, which would leave tariffs on Chinese imports where they are. Whatever happens next, Robert Khachatryan, the C.E.O. of Freight Right Global Logistics, told DealBook, “The uncertainty around the economy, inflation and trade policy are definitely weighing down the factory orders.”

Quiz: Unexpectedly Tame Inflation

Inflation rose 2.4 percent in May, from a year ago, according to new data released by the Labor Department on Wednesday. The report suggests Trump’s tariffs have so far had a limited impact on consumers. Among the possible explanations, reports The Times’s Colby Smith: Companies may have stockpiled inventory before new tariffs went into effect, and consumers may be pulling back on spending.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/14/business/14DB-AI-ADS/14DB-AI-ADS-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 08:59:24.651194

The settlement was reached Friday between the fast food company and Allen’s companies Entertainment Studios Network and the Weather Group. The settlement both dodges the upcoming July 15 court trial and also resolves claims made in a separate but related $100 million lawsuit against the company.

“We are pleased that Mr. Allen has come to appreciate McDonald’s unwavering commitment to inclusion, and has agreed to refocus his energies on a mutually beneficial commercial arrangement that is consistent with other McDonald’s supplier relationships,” McDonald’s said in a statement. “Our company’s unique three-legged stool model relies on mutual respect, and we look forward to ESN’s contributions to the betterment of our system.”

Byron’s pair of media companies Entertainment Studios Network and Weather Group also commented on the settlement.

During the course of this litigation, many of our preconceptions have been clarified, and we acknowledge McDonald’s commitment to investing in Black-owned media properties and increasing access to opportunity,” their statement read. “Our differences are behind us, and we look forward to working together.”

The original lawsuit came out of 2021 pledge by McDonald’s to more than double its spending on American media companies and production shops owned by Black, Asian, Latino, female and LGBTQ people, as well as individual content creators, by the end of 2024. Allen’s lawsuit came in 2023 and called this a “lie” and “false promise,” largely due to what it argued was insufficient spending on Allen’s companies in particular.

In February 2024, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge has dismissed the $100 million lawsuit filed citing California’s anti-SLAPP laws. Judge Mel Recana noted that the suit was filed nearly 2 years before McDonald’s self-imposed deadline, and as such called the accusations within it “purely speculative.”",https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-30.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 09:58:31.187820

NEW YORK, NY – Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA) continues to solidify its position as a global leader in payment technology, demonstrating remarkable financial strength and strategic foresight. Despite macroeconomic challenges, the company’s diversified business model is driving impressive growth, earning it a “GREAT” overall financial health score from recent InvestingPro analysis, with high marks for profitability and growth.

A deep dive into its performance reveals a company firing on all cylinders. Mastercard posted a remarkable 13.1% revenue growth over the last twelve months, pulling in

18 billion in EBITDA. This momentum carried into the first quarter of 2025, where the company reported net revenue growth in the high end of the low double-digits to low teens, successfully navigating foreign exchange headwinds.

This financial strength is built on a solid foundation, reflected in a net debt position of $(2,358) million, which signifies that the company holds more cash and cash equivalents than debt. This provides significant financial flexibility for future investments and acquisitions.

Strategic Diversification: The Twin Engines of Growth

Mastercard’s success isn’t just about processing transactions; it’s about a dual-pronged strategy focused on its core business and innovative new services. The company’s two main growth drivers are:

Payment Network: The traditional core of its business remains as strong as ever, reporting a 16% year-over-year increase in recent quarters. This is fueled by the global shift towards digital and contactless payments.

Value-Added Services (VAS): This rapidly expanding segment, which includes data analytics, loyalty programs, and security solutions, is growing at a high-teens rate. Strategic acquisitions, like the recent purchase of Recorded Future, are set to further enhance VAS offerings and contribute directly to net revenue.

Capitalizing on Global Industry Trends

Mastercard has proven adept at positioning itself at the forefront of major industry shifts. The company’s focus on contactless payments and tokenization has driven higher transaction volumes by improving both security and user convenience.

Furthermore, the company is capitalizing on the rebound in global travel, which has led to an acceleration in high-margin cross-border transaction volumes. Looking ahead, Mastercard is also making a significant push into commercial payments, a vast market that offers a new frontier for growth beyond its traditional consumer base.

A Bright Future Outlook

Analysts and investors have reason to be optimistic. The company has reiterated its positive guidance for the fiscal year 2025, anticipating stable growth trends. Projections for future earnings per share (EPS) stand at

18.44 for 2026, underscoring confidence in sustained profitability.

With its Payment Network projected to grow by 11% and its VAS segment set to maintain its high-teens growth trajectory, Mastercard (MA) is not just navigating the present—it’s building a resilient and sustainable future in the dynamic world of global finance.

By Jody Godoy

(Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta's $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI and hiring of the data-labeling startup's CEO will test how the Trump administration views so-called acquihire deals, which some have criticized as an attempt to evade regulatory scrutiny.

The deal, announced on Thursday, was Meta's second-largest investment to date. It gives the owner of Facebook a 49% nonvoting stake in Scale AI, which uses gig workers to manually label data and includes among its customers Meta competitors Microsoft and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.

Unlike an acquisition or a transaction that would give Meta a controlling stake, the deal does not require a review by U.S. antitrust regulators. However, they could probe the deal if they believe it was structured to avoid those requirements or harm competition.

The deal appeared to be structured to avoid potential pitfalls, such as cutting off competitors' access to Scale's services or giving Meta an inside view into rivals' operations - though Reuters exclusively reported on Friday that Alphabet's Google has decided to sever ties with Scale in light of Meta's stake, and other customers are looking at taking a step back.

In a statement, a Scale AI spokesperson said its business, which spans work with major companies and governments, remains strong, as it is committed to protecting customer data. The company declined to comment on specifics with Google.

Alexandr Wang, Scale's 28-year-old CEO who is coming to Meta as part of the deal, will remain on Scale's board but will have appropriate restrictions placed around his access to information, two sources familiar with the move confirmed.

Large tech companies likely perceive the regulatory environment for AI partnerships as easier to navigate under President Donald Trump than under former President Joe Biden, said William Kovacic, director of the competition law center at George Washington University.

Trump's antitrust enforcers have said they do not want to regulate how AI develops, but have also displayed a suspicion of large tech platforms, he added.

""That would lead me to think they will keep looking carefully at what the firms do. It does not necessarily dictate that they will intervene in a way that would discourage the relationships,"" Kovacic said.

Federal Trade Commission probes into past ""aquihire"" deals appear to be at a standstill. Under the Biden administration, the FTC opened inquiries into Amazon's deal to hire top executives and researchers from AI startup Adept, and Microsoft's $650 million deal with Inflection AI. The latter allowed Microsoft to use Inflection's models and hire most of the startup's staff, including its co-founders.

Amazon's deal closed without further action from the regulator, a source familiar with the matter confirmed. And, more than a year after its initial inquiry, the FTC has so far taken no enforcement action against Microsoft over Inflection, though a larger probe over practices at the software giant is ongoing.

A spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment on Friday.

David Olson, a professor who teaches antitrust law at Boston College Law School, said it was smart of Meta to take a minority nonvoting stake.

""I think that does give them a lot of protection if someone comes after them,"" he said, adding that it was still possible that the FTC would want to review the agreement.

The Meta deal has its skeptics. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who is probing AI partnerships involving Microsoft and Google, said Meta's investment should be scrutinized.

“Meta can call this deal whatever it wants - but if it violates federal law because it unlawfully squashes competition or makes it easier for Meta to illegally dominate, antitrust enforcers should investigate and block it,"" she said in a statement on Friday.

While Meta faces its own monopoly lawsuit by the FTC, it remains to be seen whether the agency will have any questions about its Scale investment.

The U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division, led by former JD Vance adviser Gail Slater, recently started looking into whether Google's partnership with chatbot creator Character.AI was designed to evade antitrust review, Bloomberg News reported. The DOJ is separately seeking to make Google give it advance notice of new AI investments as part of a proposal to curb the company's dominance in online search.

Shein plans to produce, package, and ship closer to customers

By Helen Reid

LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) – Shein’s carbon emissions from transporting products climbed 13.7% in 2024, the online fast-fashion retailer’s sustainability report showed on Friday, and its 2023 transport emissions were 18% higher than previously reported after a recalculation.

Shein uses mainly air freight to send cheap clothes directly from suppliers in China to shoppers around the world, a more carbon-intensive supply chain model compared with traditional apparel retailers that ship more of their products on container vessels.

Shein said it plans to produce, package, and ship closer to its customers as a way to lower emissions and cut delivery times and shipping costs. It increased its use of sea freight and trucking in 2024, according to the report.

Emissions from transporting products to and between Shein facilities, and to customers, including returns, were 8.52 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2024, up from 7.49 million metric tons of CO2e in 2023, according to the report.

Shein’s transport emissions for 2024 are more than three times those of Zara owner Inditex, which reported 2.61 million tons of CO2e for its 2024 financial year.

Shein said its 2023 emissions were recalculated after an update to its methodology. Last year it reported a 2023 figure of 6.35 million metric tons.

Founded in China and headquartered in Singapore, Shein sources most of its products from 7,000 suppliers in China, but also has a growing network of suppliers in Brazil and Turkey.

Steep tariffs imposed by the United States on Chinese goods have made it more urgent for Shein to diversify its supplier base, as the U.S. is its biggest market.

The company aims to go public and has shifted its focus to a Hong Kong initial public offering after failing to win Chinese securities’ regulatory approval to proceed with a planned London listing.",https://bilyonaryo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shein-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 06:58:33.027439

In order to ensure facilitation of passengers through easy access to the airline’s platform, United Nigeria Airlines (UNA) has engaged the services of Sabre Corporation on the Global Distribution System (GDS).

This is just at the UNA prepares for the expansion of its operations outside the shores

With this engagement, UNA has integrated over 50,000 travel agents across 200 countries will be able to access the carrier’s platform more easily.

Prof. Obiora Okonkwo, the Chairman of Una, Friday in Lagos said the migration to the Sabre network would ensure the airline matches its capacity and aircraft type with demand, adding that it would also enhance interlining planning for the airline across its network.

Okonkwo said the partnership will make UNA the third Nigerian carrier on the Global Distribution System (GDS).

He explained that the integration with Sabre was part of its promise at the beginning of the year to enhance its Information Technology (IT) and innovative ideas.

According to Prof Okonkwo, the UNA Lagos-Accra route, slated to commence August 25, 2025, will be given a boost with the migration.

“This is in keeping with our promise to go global as quickly as we can. These are things that we have lined up as part of our objectives that have been a little delayed by the turbulence in the country that we are seeing, especially in the aviation sector, in the last two to three years. We can be delayed, but we can’t be stopped.

He said they were aware of the challenges in the new engagement, but with over 50,000 agents in 200 countries with the capacity to buy our tickets, it means we have more seats to sell. We need to increase our inventory.

He noted that in the next one year, the airline would have increased its capacity by over 2,000 per cent, adding that from October to November this year, they will be introducing into their fleet four big-bodied aircraft, while from February to April next year, six Boeing 737-800NG will be added

Cadillac is currently without a chief marketing officer.

Melissa Grady Dias, who was elevated to the top marketing job at the division in September 2019, departed the automaker two weeks ago, a Cadillac spokesperson confirmed. Dias could not be reached for comment.

The General Motors luxury brand, which saw an 18% jump in U.S. sales in the first quarter, is undergoing a significant transformation, with a commitment to go all-electric by 2030.

The departure is framed as being elected by Dias, according to the spokesperson.

“We thank Melissa for her leadership and contributions to Cadillac and GM’s marketing transformation,” according to a statement.

Dias exceeded the current Fortune 500 CMO tenure, which averaged about 4.2 years in 2023, according to Spencer Stuart, a global professional services firm specializing in executive search.

Previous to the CMO role, Dias was director of Cadillac media and performance marketing, her first role at GM.

An industry veteran, her career has included stints at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service and Motorola. She previously spent 10 years at another automotive luxury brand, Jaguar Land Rover.

She also spent a year on the agency side of the business when she was an account director at Tequila, a unit within TBWA that focuses on below-the-line marketing, including promotions and experiential campaigns.

Dias ascended to CMO after the division’s previous top leader, Deborah Wahl, was promoted to GM’s global marketing chief. Wahl retired from GM in March 2023. CVS Health’s Norm de Greve took the automaker’s top marketing position in July 2023.

Fun Fact:

Did you know? Pepsi was introduced as Brad’s Drink in 1893 by pharmacist Caleb Bradham.

PepsiCo is a major food and beverage company founded by Caleb Bradham. It owns 23 billion-dollar brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Lay’s, Gatorade, Tropicana, Doritos, Quaker, Walkers, Baken-ets, Cheetos Popcorn, and Tostitos. The company also has regional and local brands like Gamesa, Mafer, Tortrix, and Kero Coco. PepsiCo’s marketing strategy drives sustainable growth and success. In 2024, PepsiCo generated $91.9 billion in annual revenue, with $9.58 billion in profit. [1]

To understand PepsiCo’s secret to success, here is a comprehensive analysis of its marketing strategy:

PepsiCo’s Target Market Overview

PepsiCo uses age, behavioral, and psychographic segmentation to define its target market. The company targets consumers aged 15-45 who enjoy carbonated drinks and snacks. Teenagers and young adults dominate this demographic. They’re active and comfortable with PepsiCo’s fizzy drinks. As of 2025, consumers enjoyed PepsiCo’s drinks and snacks over 1 billion times daily in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.

PepsiCo targets different consumer segments with unique products. For example, the Pepsi brand has several labels like Diet Pepsi, Pepsi Max, and Pepsi Next. Each caters to different target audiences. Pepsi Max is recommended for consumers seeking low-calorie drinks. Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Next offer low-sugar beverages for diabetics and health-conscious consumers. [2]

Although PepsiCo targets young people, it is committed to marketing its products responsibly to limit children’s exposure to food and beverage advertising. It supports parents’ role and all stakeholders responsible for guiding kids’ diet and lifestyle choices. This targeting approach builds and preserves consumer trust in PepsiCo brands. In 2022, PepsiCo adopted the International Food and Beverage Alliance (IFBA) Global Responsible Marketing Policy. The company doesn’t advertise products to children under 6, regardless of content. It doesn’t market on TV programs when over 30% of the audience is under 13, unless the item meets nutritional requirements. [3]

PepsiCo’s Positioning

PepsiCo’s positioning strategy is guided by its vision: “To be the global leader in beverages and convenient foods.” It is positioned in the nonalcoholic drink and snack sector. As of Nov 2022, PepsiCo controlled 24.1% of the food and beverage industry. It is the world’s second-largest carbonated soft drink company after Coca-Cola. PepsiCo also ranks second in the global snack and bakery industry, after Nestle and ahead of Mars Inc.

PepsiCo strengthens its position by leveraging innovation, technology, and market strategies. It builds an excellent reputation by investing in communities. Since 2006, PepsiCo has provided 11 million people with safe water. It assisted six million women by investing in their communities and replenished 2.7 billion liters of water in high-risk areas. These efforts position PepsiCo as a caring, responsible, and sustainable company. [4]

PepsiCo continuously refines its positioning to align with ever-evolving consumer needs. Its history is dominated by health concerns about consuming drinks with high sugar concentrations. The company adopted several strategies to improve its positioning and reputation among health-conscious consumers. For example, PepsiCo introduced the low-sugar Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Next with 60% less sugar than the original Pepsi. PepsiCo uses strategic acquisitions to strengthen its market position. In 2024, PepsiCo planned to acquire Siete Foods for over $1 billion. This acquisition will help the company offer healthier grain-free options, including tortilla chips, tortillas, hot sauces, and other Mexican-American staples. [5]

PepsiCo’s Value Proposition

PepsiCo maximizes customer value by prioritizing product diversity, quality, affordability, and accessibility. The company tailors its offerings for different target markets and segments to address consumers’ needs. For example, in Dec 2024, PepsiCo launched Quaker Protein Breakfast Bars for health-conscious consumers, Gatorade Midnight Black, and Doritos Golden Sriracha. These products showcase PepsiCo’s flavor innovation and ability to cater to diverse tastes and lifestyles. The company also introduced Doritos XXTRA Flamin’ Hot and Pepsi Wild Cherry & Cream in 2024, demonstrating its dedication to maximizing customer value with culturally relevant drinks and snacks. [6]

PepsiCo integrates consumer behavior into its product design and development to maximize value for different demographics. “Faced with increasing time pressures in their busy lives, Gen-Z consumers gravitate toward meals that fit their on-the-go lifestyles. Our global brands are responding,” said Mustafa Shamseldin, Category Growth Officer and CMO at PepsiCo. Research shows that 73% of Gen-Z and Millennials view “experiences” as more valuable than tangible products.

The company responded to this insight by offering this target audience away-from-home occasions. In 2024, PepsiCo partnered with Turkey’s restaurant chain Komagene to introduce new Doritos-inspired items. It plans to refine its marketing strategies to present Lay’s potato chips as a brand synonymous with celebrations. [7]

PepsiCo enhances its value proposition through product diversification and innovation. The company has expanded beyond its flagship Pepsi-Cola soda to include Lay’s and Doritos snacks, 7UP, Gatorade, Tropicana, and Quaker Oats food products. In 2024, PepsiCo’s Gatorade introduced a vitamin-enhanced Hydration Line for lifestyle-focused consumers. PepsiCo uses recent acquisitions like Sabra and Obela to meet consumer demands for protein snacks. Its small-sized portion options offer on-the-go convenience and budget-friendly snacks. [8]

PepsiCo’s Marketing Mix (4Ps)

PepsiCo’s marketing mix (4Ps) reflects its strategy to strengthen its market position. The 4Ps are product, price, place, and promotion. Each component drives PepsiCo’s marketing strategy and success. Here is an in-depth analysis of PepsiCo’s 4Ps:

1. PepsiCo’s Product Strategy

PepsiCo offers hundreds of iconic products under 23 global brands in over 200 countries and territories. The company strengthens its offerings through strategic acquisitions. It acquired Frito-Lay in 1965 and Tropicana in 1998 to solidify its positioning. The brand introduced its 1960 “Pepsi Generation” campaign to target younger consumers. In Mar 2025, PepsiCo agreed to acquire the fast-growing poppi brand for $1.95 billion.

PepsiCo acquires brands and products with a consumer-first approach and unique nutritional profiles. These elements nurture a loyal fan base and drive rapid growth. For example, the poppi soda has prebiotics, fruit juice, apple cider vinegar, and less than five grams of sugar per serving. This refreshing low-calorie soda expands PepsiCo’s better-for-you offerings to meet consumer needs. “We’ve evolved our food and beverage portfolio over many years by innovating with our brands in new spaces and through disciplined, strategic acquisitions to offer more positive choices to our consumers,” said CEO Ramon Laguarta. [9]

PepsiCo strives to produce tasty snacks and beverages that help protect the planet and people. Its global expansion strategy adheres to this philosophy. In 2021, the company launched pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) to integrate sustainability into its operations. PepsiCo aims to transition its brands to 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025, reduce virgin plastic and greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2030, and achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. These goals will minimize the impact of PepsiCo’s production and products on the environment. [10]

PepsiCo’s manufacturing capabilities drive its product strategy. It operates hundreds of plants globally. In 2023, PepsiCo Ireland invested €39 million to expand its Cork manufacturing facilities. The plant leverages the latest technology to produce concentrate for Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Gatorade, 7Up, and Mountain Dew. Its expansion will support increased demand for PepsiCo products. It will also extend the company’s innovation pipeline to its global customer base. [11]

PepsiCo integrates innovative design into its product development. The company achieves this goal through its in-house R&D teams and partnerships. For example, in 2022, PepsiCo selected Miro as its product innovation platform. Its teams use Miro to collaborate in one shared virtual space, understand customers, and conceptualize and build on new ideas. Miro helped PepsiCo create and leverage custom templates, scale its Design Thinking approach, and shorten product development. [12]

2. PepsiCo’s Pricing Strategy

PepsiCo combines competitive, dynamic, value-based, and promotional pricing strategies to adapt to market conditions. For example, PepsiCo uses a competitive pricing strategy to set its product prices based on the prices of similar competitors’ items. It ensures PepsiCo’s drinks and snacks remain competitive. PepsiCo’s promotional pricing strategies include discounts, bundle deals, and temporary price reductions to attract cost-sensitive customers.

Another component of PepsiCo’s pricing strategy is market segmentation. The company segments its target market and tailors its pricing to different demographics, geographic locations, and consumer income levels. For example, Pepsi sodas cost more in developed countries than in emerging markets. PepsiCo uses value-based pricing to set prices based on consumers’ perceived product value. It applies dynamic pricing techniques for real-time price adjustments based on demand and market conditions. [13]

PepsiCo’s pricing strategy combines economy and premium pricing models. It offers large packages at lower prices than smaller units to encourage bulk purchases. This economy pricing strategy targets budget-conscious consumers. In early 2025, PepsiCo announced plans to introduce more variety in snack sizes to broaden its appeal to shoppers of all budgets. This “surgical” approach includes single-serve items and smaller multipacks, allowing the company to offer cheaper options without lowering prices. [14]

3. PepsiCo’s Place (Point-of-Sale) Strategy

PepsiCo sells its soft drinks and food products through retailers, groceries, convenience stores, and wholesale channels across 200 countries and territories. The company built a customized direct-to-consumer (D2C) version to connect its hundreds of mobile apps with one consumer data platform. Customers can access PepsiCo’s entire product portfolio through a localized app. In 2023, PepsiCo’s integrated app went live in Mexico and Brazil. North America’s platform was launched in 2024. [15]

4. PepsiCo’s Promotion

PepsiCo integrates promotions into its marketing strategy. It offers branded merchandise, event tickets, monetary awards, getaways, and other prizes to promote its products and boost customer loyalty. For example, in Mar 2025, PepsiCo’s Walkers Snacks brand partnered with Warner Brothers to create A Minecraft Movie. They celebrated the movie’s launch with an on-pack promotion. The promo offered a trip for two to Hollywood and instant prizes, like cinema tickets, hoodies, t-shirts, and backpacks. [16]

PepsiCo leverages media assets like teasers and catchy TV ads to boost the emotional dial with humor. It uses promos to increase customer value and loyalty. For example, in Mar 2025, PepsiCo’s Walkers brand launched its Freelunch promotion in the UK. This promo offered free lunch for a year or a £1,825 cash prize to one lucky shopper and 120 free lunches to 120 customers. [17]

PepsiCo’s Promotional Strategy

PepsiCo’s promotional strategy combines traditional and digital marketing tactics to connect with consumers. The company uses celebrity endorsements, youth-oriented events and sports sponsorships, and social media campaigns. Its iconic Super Bowl ads include Diet Pepsi’s commercial starring Cindy Crawford in the 1990s, Mountain Dew’s “Puppy Monkey Baby” in 2016, and “Michael Bublé vs Bubly” in 2019. In 2023, Apple Music replaced Pepsi as the Super Bowl’s halftime show sponsor. PepsiCo’s prebiotic soda brand poppi joined the Super Bowl ad ring for the first time in 2024.

Another component of PepsiCo’s promotional strategy is traditional marketing. The company hasn’t aired a TV commercial in two years. In 2025, PepsiCo revived its Pepsi Challenge marketing campaign from 50 years ago. It hosted blind taste tests of Pepsi Zero Sugar and Coke Zero Sugar during Super Bowl weekend. “What counts most for the Pepsi brand is reinforcing its connection with football fans and staying involved in Super Bowl conversation, even if that’s not on TV,” said Jenny Danzi, Pepsi’s senior marketing director. [18]

PepsiCo’s promotional tools include direct marketing strategies targeting specific customer segments. For example, the company provides wholesale prices to organizations. Combining these strategies helps PepsiCo maintain a dynamic and relevant brand image, boost customer engagement, and drive sales. It also incentivizes purchases by using package deals, discounts, limited-time offers, and promos. In Feb 2025, PepsiCo partnered with Merlin Entertainments to launch a new on-pack promotion across Frazzles, Chipsticks, and Cheetos brands. This promo offered 5,000 prizes, including four tickets to a UK family attraction. [19]

PepsiCo’s Customer Acquisition & Retention

PepsiCo combines tried-and-tested marketing strategies to attract and retain customers. The company engages with consumers on a human level. In the 2020s, PepsiCo made 4 changes to prioritize customer relationships, enhance customer loyalty, leverage integrated first-party data, and improve decision-making. The company uses first-party data to understand customers and adapt its marketing strategies to meet their needs. Its loyalty programs include Tasty Rewards and Power of One in the US and Canada, KazandiRio in Turkey, and Joy in Mexico. [20]

Retailers play a critical role in PepsiCo’s customer acquisition and retention strategy because they distribute its products. The company seeks to improve its relationship with retailers to attract and retain more customers. In 2022, PepsiCo made customer retention its #1 objective. The soft drink giant collaborated with its retail partners to mitigate “consumer reaction” to inflation. It helps customers overcome the high cost of living, boosting PepsiCo’s acquisition and retention rates. [21]

PepsiCo boosts customer acquisition and retention by creating a sense of community. The company achieves this goal through emotional ads and promotions. For example, PepsiCo launched the Pepsi merch promo in Jan 2025. This free-to-enter promotion offered 10,000 Pepsi-branded merchandise prizes, including clothing, bags, and skateboards. These items make customers feel part of the Pepsi community. [22]

PepsiCo’s Marketing Goals (KPIs)

PepsiCo’s marketing goals and objectives highlight how its strategies strengthen its brand identity and market presence. The company implements marketing campaigns to enhance brand awareness, boost customer engagement, drive product innovation and sustainability, and increase sales. It uses KPIs like sales revenue, gross profit margin, and net income to assess its financial performance and progress toward its marketing goals. For example, in 2024, PepsiCo’s profit grew by 5.6% to $9.58 billion. [23]

PepsiCo uses the Total Communications Plan (TCP) to connect consumer journeys with its objectives across marketing and advertising touchpoints. The TCP visualizes how marketing jobs-to-be-done and sketches will be executed, including channels, messages, and audiences. Then, the company applies a measurement and analysis plan based on its KPI framework. For example, PepsiCo prioritizes channels that drive ROI and ROAS (return on ad spend). It uses these KPIs to measure the effectiveness of its marketing messages and channels. [24]

PepsiCo has a comprehensive strategy to achieve its marketing goals. The company launched pep+ to drive its strategic end-to-end transformation and embed sustainability and human capital operation-wide. The pep+ initiative helps PepsiCo create value and drive growth by inspiring positive change for the planet and people. It uses KPIs like global rankings to evaluate the effectiveness of its marketing strategies. As of Jan 2025, PepsiCo was #42 on Fortune’s “America’s Most Admired Companies” list. It was #44 on Fortune 500 and #123 on Fortune Global 500. [25]

PepsiCo runs marketing campaigns to accelerate its global expansion and strengthen market presence. It seeks to consolidate and increase market share in North America and Europe and enter new emerging markets in Asia-Pacific and Africa. In 2023, PepsiCo had over 1,000 manufacturing facilities worldwide, including 291 company-owned plants. The soft drink giant launched its new “The PepsiCo Way” initiative to strengthen its global supply chain. It also integrated purpose and sustainability in the supply chain to expand sustainably. [26]

PepsiCo’s marketing strategy is paying off. Pepsi is North America’s second most popular soda after Coke. In 2021, Pepsi’s market share in the carbonated soft drink category was 8.9%. PepsiCo aims to outperform competitors by tailoring its marketing efforts and products to fit local cultural nuances and consumer preferences. For example, PepsiCo launched new international flavors in early 2025, including honey butter in Korea, Tzatziki in Greece, and Masala in India. [27]

Such investigations can land organizational leaders across the United States in a hot seat they never saw coming.
The Judiciary Committees’ investigations are staffed by top-notch investigators and do not follow DOJ or FTC guidelines regarding what conduct warrants an antitrust investigation.
This may make it more likely organizations will find themselves in the Judiciary Committees’ crosshairs.
The Committees’ investigations come alongside the well-publicized battle between elite colleges and universities and the Trump administration’s wider pressure campaign on elite institutions of higher education.","Many organizations evaluate antitrust risk by considering potential investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or private action. However, firms should also consider that Congress, particularly the House of Representatives and Senate Judiciary Committees, have been launching a steady stream of antitrust investigations of their own. Such investigations can land organizational leaders across the United States in a hot seat they never saw coming.

The Judiciary Committees’ investigations are staffed by top-notch investigators and do not follow DOJ or FTC guidelines regarding what conduct warrants an antitrust investigation. Instead, the Committees are free to investigate whomever they choose for whatever behavior they choose for whatever reason they choose.

This recent spree of activity from the Judicial Committees has been accompanied by a reported proposed cut to the budget of the DOJ Antitrust Division of approximately $95.2 million. This may make it more likely organizations will find themselves in the Judiciary Committees’ crosshairs.

The Judiciary Committees have recently initiated the following four investigations:

Asset Management Companies: In December of 2024, Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to more than 60 asset management companies accusing them of “colluding with climate activists through initiatives like the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative to collectively adopt and impose left-wing environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-related goals,” which GOP members allege are in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The letters sought documents and communications related to proxy voting engaged in by the companies, among other topics, suggesting that the Republican members are concerned that these companies are using their influence to pressure the executive leadership of various publicly traded companies.

Medical Residency Programs: In March of this year, Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to hospitals, medical associations, the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), and health systems across the U.S. seeking records relating to complaints about the resident doctor matching process; communication about compensation limits and resident doctor working conditions; and the movement of resident doctors among residency positions. Those letters also posited that, according to the Republicans on the Committee, the residency antitrust exemption “has distorted the American medical residency market, undermining free market principles to the detriment of the nation’s doctors and the patients who rely on them.”

Ivy League Universities: On April 8, 2025, the Republican members of the Judiciary Committees sent letters to all eight Ivy League schools. The Committees asserted that the schools had illegally coordinated their financial aid policies and admissions practices to keep attendance prices high while limiting the amount of financial aid available to students. The Committees’ investigations come alongside the well-publicized battle between elite colleges and universities and the Trump administration’s wider pressure campaign on elite institutions of higher education.

CVS Caremark Pharmacies: In December of 2024, the Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee initiated an antitrust investigation into CVS Caremark, specifically, whether CVS Caremark had threatened to rescind independent pharmacies’ “in network” status if they used certain “innovative technologies,” including pharmaceutical hubs, that could have reduced drug prices.

Energy Sector Asset Managers: In May 2025, the DOJ and FTC voiced their support for a lawsuit brought by Republican-led states against asset managers BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. The two federal agencies submitted a statement of interest in the lawsuit, in which Texas and 12 other states assert that these firms (which manage a combined $27 trillion in assets) leveraged their significant investments in U.S. coal companies to stifle competition. This effort stems from a Congressional investigation that started in December 2024.

A review of the Committees’ recent investigations reveals a few common elements that the Committees seem to believe warrant investigation:

The organization previously supported individuals, entities, or groups that have been targeted by the Trump Administration.

The organization previously supported causes, such as environmental activism, the recognition of climate change, or diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which have been targeted by the Trump administration.

The organization allegedly shared non-public, purportedly competitively sensitive information, such as financial aid numbers, tuition rates, proxy voting plans, specific supply prices, prices charged to customers, and planned employee compensation offers.

The organization behaved similarly, voted similarly, or otherwise showed signs that may indicate coordination with their competitors and peers to achieve shared goals.

The organization allegedly engaged in communication and coordination with competitors to achieve a shared goal.

The organization received an exemption from antitrust laws and regulations from past Congresses.

The organization has or is perceived to have an ideological or political agenda that differs from the Trump Administration’s.

The organization has taken actions that may have reduced output or customer choice, particularly if those actions were taken near in time to similar actions by competitors or peers.

There are steps that organizations can take to reduce the chances of receiving letters from the Judicial Committees:

Conduct a comprehensive review of the organization’s public presence to ensure that it emphasizes compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Act.

Avoid discussing information about competitors’ operations, strategies, prices, or related sensitive confidential information if that information is not already publicly known.

Do not discuss pricing, customers, or any other sensitive confidential information with competitors.

Consider direct advocacy before Congress and the Administration, leveraging memberships in trade associations or directly engaging with elected officials to ensure that your organization’s conduct is not drawing unwanted attention.

(UNFI) will shutter a warehouse near Allentown, Pa. and eliminate hundreds of jobs as the result of the loss of a key client, the Matawan, N.J.-based Key Food.

UNFI first partnered with Key Food in 2020 and built the distribution facility specifically to meet the customer’s needs. The facility opened in late 2021, but it is now scheduled to close. More than 700 jobs will be lost.

The agreement will officially terminate on Sept. 20.

“This enables UNFI to exit an unprofitable relationship and further optimize our northeast DC network by ceasing operations at our Allentown facility,” UNFI CEO Sandy Douglas said during the company’s third quarter earnings call on Tuesday.

UNFI said in an emailed statement to Supermarket News that it continuously evaluates its distribution network to ensure it serves customers and suppliers efficiently and effectively, and moving Allentown’s volume to nearby DCs will help meet that goal.

UNFI currently operates 11 distribution centers in the Northeast market. Facilities in Harrisburg, Carlisle, Philadelphia, and York will help absorb the volume from the Allentown closure.

The UNFI–Key Foods deal was originally expected to generate $1 billion per year in sales over 10 years for the wholesale distributor. UNFI supplied branded and private label foods, both conventional and natural, to Key Food’s 300 member stores across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.

At the time of the agreement, UNFI believed the partnership would strengthen its competitive position in the Northeast and allow it to capture market share in the New York metro area.

Will EV sales level off and then grow on the S-curve, or are we heading into a prolonged slump?","It’s a strangely tempting time to buy an electric car in America right now.

There are more options than ever with generous federal and state tax credits, plus big discounts from automakers. Charging networks are expanding quickly and if you’ve driven a modern EV from any brand, you’d know they’re far better to own and drive than their gas counterparts.

And yet, EV sales in the U.S. just slipped for the first time in 14 months. What gives?

In the Friday edition of Critical Materials, we talk about how EVs are caught in a perfect storm that may be stalling momentum. Also on our radar: A fight in Congress could kill key battery manufacturing credits, threatening tens of thousands of American jobs that could damage several Republican-dominated states and districts.

And while EV sales in the U.S. slow down, global EV demand continues to grow—China sold nearly as many EVs in May alone as the U.S. did in all of last year.

30%: America’s EV Sales Cool In April

Photo by: Hyundai

After years of rapid growth and consecutive quarters of record EV sales in the U.S., demand seems to have cooled in April for the first time since February 2024. April EV registrations reached 97,833 units, a 4.4% year-over-year decline, according to S&P Global Mobility data cited by Automotive News.

America’s EV market share also dropped from 7.4% to 6.6%. While the trend is concerning, it’s not necessarily surprising or alarming. The Trump administration, despite once having Tesla CEO Elon Musk on its team, is attacking EVs in all ways possible, ambushing the industry and stalling its growth.

Before we reiterate the administration’s tactics to kill EVs as well as the global headwinds, let’s talk some more numbers, because not every carmaker is suffering.

Tesla’s U.S. EV registrations dropped below 40,000 units in April, marking a 16% decline. Chevrolet, on the other hand, is now America’s second-best-selling EV maker—but still far behind Tesla in the second spot—at 9,160 units, managing a 215% year-over-year growth. So this is mostly a case of winners and losers.

All mainstream General Motors brands are going well, with Cadillac and GMC also clocking serious year-over-year growth. What’s shocking is BMW surpassing Hyundai in April EV sales, with the Korean automaker now clocking back-to-back months of decline—that’s despite offering far more affordable and modern options than BMW does and throwing heavy discounts on them.

Apart from Hyundai and Tesla, the other big automakers facing declining EV sales were Ford, Kia, Rivian and Mercedes-Benz.

EVs are really caught in a perfect storm right now. The Trump administration’s budget bill aims to slash federal credits for consumers and for the manufacturing of EVs and battery plants. It passed in the House and now its fate rests in the hands of the Senate.

Moreover, Congress passed a bill—which the president signed on Thursday—to block California from phasing out gas-only vehicles from 2035. Eleven other states including Colorado, New York and New Jersey were also following California emissions rules, so those states are impacted, too—all of them have high EV adoption rates.

There’s another key reason hurting EV sales, S&P Global Analyst Tom Libby told Automotive News:

Libby said that in addition to anxiety over charging and range, consumers are seeing media reports that government support for EVs is on the chopping block and automaker investments in the technology are slowing, undermining confidence in a product that doesn’t yet have significant organic demand. EVs are often popular at launch when they have strong promotions and fresh looks, then they fade out, he said.

It’s true that the administration acts and then the media amplifies all of that. They’re succeeding in their messaging, flooding the digital town squares and the news cycles with their vision for the auto industry, then backing it up with legislation in Congress. The exact same thing was happening last year with the pro-EV Biden administration, of course in favor of EVs.

Whether this sales slump will linger or prove temporary is anyone’s guess. But when EVs are priced right in popular segments, they sell—just look at the Tesla Model Y or the Chevy Equinox EV. And with more affordable models from both brands on the horizon, it’s far too soon to count out the EV market.

60%: American Jobs At Risk In Republican States

Billions in battery plant investments were supposed to make the U.S. auto supply chain less dependent on China and create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs along the way. But now, Congress is threatening to repeal the manufacturing tax credits that helped get those projects off the ground.

The fallout is already being felt. Some $14 billion worth of clean energy projects have been canceled this year alone, as the nonprofit Zero Emissions Transportation Association (ZETA) points out. And it could get much worse.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) projects the U.S. could lose 130,000 jobs by 2030 if the credits are scrapped. Ironically, Republican-led states like Michigan, Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia stand to lose the most.

If the tax credits are scrapped, job losses are expected across multiple sectors, from vehicle assembly and parts manufacturing to battery production and charging infrastructure installation and maintenance.

90%: The Rest Of The World Is Running Away With EVs

China sold 1.3 million EVs and plug-in hybrids in May alone, nearly as many as the U.S. sold in all of 2024. Let that sink in.

Global EV sales jumped 24% last month, which really must sting for a very solipsistic U.S. While the rest of the world races ahead with high-tech cars, U.S. automakers are being forced to crank out more polluting gas trucks and SUVs instead.

As Reuters notes, the surge was driven by BYD’s booming exports to Mexico and Southeast Asia, plus strong demand across Southern Europe. Meanwhile, North American sales took a hit—thanks in part to Canada ending its EV subsidies.

100%: Is This A Temporary Or Prolonged EV Sales Drop?

Photo by: Kia

Despite generous discounts on high-tech EVs, sales are showing signs of cooling in America. But let’s not forget that there are still some excellent EVs to choose from and more are on the way. Think the next-gen Chevy Bolt, smaller Teslas and other affordable models that could shake things up.

It’s also worth noting that early-year sales are typically slower than the fall, when holiday deals pull buyers into showrooms.

So what do you think? Will EV sales level off and then grow on the S-curve, or are we heading into a prolonged slump?",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/ZnvZ3K/s1/cm-6-13.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 12:04:34.996913

(Reuters) -McDonald's has settled a $10 billion lawsuit by the media entrepreneur Byron Allen accusing the fast-food chain of ""racial stereotyping"" by excluding Black-owned media from much of its advertising budget.

Friday's settlement between McDonald's and two of Allen's companies, Entertainment Studios Networks and the Weather Group, averts a scheduled July 15 trial in Los Angeles federal court.

It also resolves claims raised in Allen's related $100 million lawsuit against McDonald's in Los Angeles Superior Court.

McDonald's said it will buy ads ""at market value"" from Allen's companies ""in a manner that aligns with its advertising strategy and commercial objectives.""

Settlement terms are confidential. McDonald's, based in Chicago, denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.

In a statement, Allen's companies said ""we acknowledge McDonald's commitment to investing in Black-owned media properties and increasing access to opportunity. Our differences are behind us.""

Allen accused McDonald's of falsely labeling Entertainment Studios as a media company that produces content solely for Black viewers, consigning it to its ""de minimis"" ad budget for those viewers instead of its general ad budget.

He also accused McDonald's of lying when it pledged in 2021 to boost national ad spending with those media to 5% from 2% by 2024.

Allen said he relied on that pledge when seeking business from McDonald's, only to be rebuffed, and that his Allen Media Group represented more than 90% of Black-owned media.

Allen's networks include The Weather Channel, Cars.TV, Comedy.TV, ES.TV, Justice Central, MyDestination.TV, Pets.TV and Recipe.TV.

Instead, they rely on their personal AI agent to plan, compare, negotiate, and book every aspect of their trip. This shift marks a seismic change in how travel is discovered and transacted, demanding a fundamental rethink of hotel technology stacks.

Are hoteliers ready for this new class of guests and their digital representatives? Consider how AI-driven website traffic is already having a dramatic impact:

According to Ahrefs, 63% of websites receive AI traffic, with smaller sites experiencing the highest proportion.

A survey by Adobe reveals that traffic from generative AI sources (chatbots or AI-powered search assistants) on U.S. travel websites rose 1,700% from Jul 2024 to Feb 2025.The same survey shows that visitors arriving via generative AI tools show 8% higher engagement, view 12% more pages, and have a 23% lower bounce rate than non-AI traffic sources.

Cloudflare found that monthly traffic to generative AI services grew by 251%between February 2024 and March 2025.

So, what does this all mean for the hospitality industry?

Most hospitality tech stacks weren't built for AI; they were designed for humans, not machines. Legacy systems are slow, fragmented, and incapable of speaking the language of autonomous AI. To stay visible and bookable in an AI-agent-first ecosystem, hotels must rethink their infrastructure from the data layer up, embracing real-time interoperability, AI-native protocols, and machine-readable data formats.

Is your data AI-ready?

The rise of AI agents demands a fundamental shift in how hotels manage and present their data. Traditional website designs optimised for visual appeal and manual navigation are insufficient for engaging with AI-driven tools. Hotels must evaluate their systems against the following criteria:

Structured data formats: Implement schema.org markup to make room availability, pricing, and amenities accessible to AI crawlers.

Real-time accessibility: Ensure APIs deliver fast, accurate responses to queries from AI agents, with latency ideally under 100ms and definitely under 200ms. The 95th percentile for API response times should always be under 3 seconds.

Interoperability: Adopt protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable seamless interaction between hotel systems and external AI platforms.

Dynamic content updates: Automate inventory and pricing updates to reflect real-time changes, ensuring AI agents always access the latest information.

Hotels that fail to meet these standards risk becoming invisible to AI agents, which prioritise systems capable of delivering clean, actionable data. By preparing their data for this new user class, hoteliers can ensure they remain competitive in an increasingly automated travel ecosystem.

Building the foundation: A focused, AI-ready architecture

Modern hospitality stacks begin with unified data ecosystems that aggregate guest profiles, operational metrics, and market signals into cloud-based repositories. This eliminates silos between PMS, CRM, and revenue management systems, creating a single source of truth. Unifying data overlaid with semantic meaning is the prerequisite for AI innovation, enabling real-time analysis of guest preferences, occupancy trends, and competitive pricing.

With clean data pipelines, hotels can deploy AI co-pilots that:

Adjust room rates dynamically using market demand signals

Predict guest preferences (room, meal selection, room settings, etc)

Handle customer inquiries through conversational AI

Optimise housekeeping routes and inventory orders.

These systems learn continuously, improving efficiency and personalisation over time.

Agentic integration: MCP and the rise of the A2A Economy

The emergence of AI agents opens a new paradigm for hotels: active participation in the agentic economy. Hotels can no longer passively rely on traditional distribution channels. To thrive, they must embrace strategies that enable seamless interaction with AI agents, creating new avenues for booking, personalisation, and revenue generation. This starts with understanding and implementing key protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which paves the way for the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) economy.

MCP is a new and evolving protocol that transforms hotels into active participants in the A2A economy. It standardises how AI agents interface with hotel systems, expanding the capabilities of individual agents by enabling them to connect and interact with other specialised agents, leading to richer and more versatile functionalities. This benefits hotels as it allows their systems to:

Offer more comprehensive travel solutions: By connecting with external AI agents, hotels can offer bundled packages that include flights, transportation, and local experiences, all coordinated seamlessly.

Reach a wider audience: Integration with diverse AI travel platforms expands the hotel's reach beyond traditional channels, tapping into new customer segments.

Improve efficiency and reduce costs: Automating interactions with AI agents minimises the need for human intervention in routine tasks, freeing up staff to focus on higher-value activities.

MCP is a rapidly evolving landscape that can potentially eliminate fragile API integrations, allowing properties to connect with numerous services through a single MCP gateway. Imagine a guest's travel agent AI seamlessly booking rooms, spa services, and dinner reservations by interfacing directly with your hotel's agent.

Optimising the agent experience

8Traditionally, websites have focused on the user experience (UX). However, the rise of AI demands a focus on the agent experience (AX) that must consider a different set of technical priorities:

AI-accessible inventory: Expose rooms, amenities, and add-ons through GraphQL APIs and enable multi-property package bookings in a single transaction.

Machine-readable content: Replace visual call to actions (CTAs) with schema.org annotations, reconsider SEO in the context of how LLMs view your brand visibility, and implement tags for preferential crawling.

Agent Experience (AX) design: Develop parallel website versions optimized for API interactions. Semantic consistency and support for multiple data sources, including social and query graphs, are all key.

Dynamic commission structures: Create lower AI-specific affiliate tiers and offer bulk booking discounts for high-intent agent queries.

Transitioning from legacy systems to seize the AI opportunity

The transition to an agent-mediated hospitality landscape is not a distant possibility but an accelerating reality. Hotels that delay implementing MCP capabilities and an agent-friendly infrastructure risk significant market share erosion within 12-18 months as AI travel planning becomes mainstream.

Forward-thinking properties are already capturing early-adopter advantages through strategic partnerships with emerging AI travel platforms. The challenge now is how quickly hoteliers can transform their digital infrastructure to become preferred partners in the A2A economy, where AI agents will increasingly mediate guest relationships.

The journey to an AI-first architecture means hotels must adopt a modern technology stack by:

Phasing out on-premise systems with cloud-native platforms offering open API access.

Adopting composable data and platform architecture using microservices for easy MCP integration.

Considering website SEO and agentic presentation pathways.

Retraining staff on AI-assisted workflows, reducing manual data entry.

Revamped stacks for the Agentic AI era will drive operational efficiency and real-time channel optimisation by automatically redistributing inventory across the most profitable channels and guest profiles. First-mover hoteliers will help shape the new distribution paradigm and have greater control over their digital destiny in the age of AI.",https://www.hospitalitynet.org/picture/153180555.jpg?t=1743020193,N,,2025-06-14 09:59:28.627946

Fine. I register, get a WhatsApp code and scroll through their menu: fruity Americanos, a seasonal kale tea and the coconut milk latte — a bestseller with five sweetness levels.

The menus are something else. This coconut comes from Luckin's own grove in Indonesia, it says, blessed by volcanic ash and ocean nutrients. The milk is cold-pressed within four hours of cracking the fruit open. Sure, Luckin. I click iced, no added sugar.

Elaine Yu | CNBC

Luckin, China's largest coffee chain, is betting its kaleidoscopic offerings and clever pricing can take on Starbucks globally. The chain landed in Hong Kong late last year and now has a dozen stores across the city.

This branch alone has seven other coffee shops nearby, including Cotti Coffee, a rival founded by former Luckin executives (who were ousted over an accounting scandal that got Luckin delisted from Nasdaq. But that's another story). Cotti just opened stores in New York, and Luckin is set to follow.

I try paying with credit card instead of Chinese e-payment options, but that means entering my billing details and address in-app. Too much work. I bail and use the kiosk instead at the higher price. Still need to input my phone number though.

My 16-ounce drink promptly arrives. Chestnut brown in color, my first sip is bitter and refreshing. One stir with the paper straw and it turns pale blonde, the coconut's silky, nutty sweetness taking over. After a few more compulsive sips, it gets heavy.

Elaine Yu | CNBC

Matcha latte with tofu pudding

Mainstream coffee culture is converging globally, and Luckin is making it more digital, efficient — and gimmicky. Their basics — black coffee, oat milk latte — hook customers looking for a cheap caffeine fix (they cost roughly $2 each in Asia). Here, Starbucks has no real edge. ""It comes down to value for money,"" an Australian buying a mocha from Luckin tells me.

Office workers stream through, grabbing drinks pre-ordered on the app. Few linger. Andy Chan, 38, emerges from the nearby subway station and picks up his usual Americano en route to the office. ""It's normal,"" the IT worker says of the quality. ""And quite a bit cheaper than Starbucks.""

Hours later, I walk to the Starbucks down the block. Patrons are on their laptops or deep in conversation. Similar to Luckin, the drink offerings rotate through supposedly regional flavors, like matcha latte with tofu pudding. This branch just went cashless, notable in cash-stubborn Hong Kong.

Elaine Yu | CNBC

I order a yuzu cold brew, which is more like citrus slushy dunked in coffee. Nearly $6 for 12 ounces feels steep after Luckin, but the sign says the cold brews are steeped for 20 hours. I ask for a glass after the barista automatically reaches for a paper cup. The flavors click into focus once the sweet, herbal ice crystals soak up the coffee. As someone who usually drinks black coffee or a flat white at most, my two caffeinated desserts today have me wired.

Coffeehouse theater vs. convenience

Businesses say they reward loyalty. Starbucks' take is getting you to lend them money while locking you in. The Seattle-based chain sits on $1.85 billion from its stored-value cards and loyalty programs as of the first quarter this year. A portion typically goes unredeemed — turning into revenue. Sales have been declining, but Starbucks has tapped interest-free capital this way for years.

Elaine Yu | CNBC

If Starbucks is acting like a bank, Luckin is like the startup gunning for scale. With coffee prices rising, chains like Luckin are grabbing market share through high turnover and compact spaces that drive down costs. Some people want the coffeehouse theater; others prize convenience and live digitally. Out of the latter, Luckin is building a treasure trove of data.

Viral stunts like its Moutai liquor-infused latte help (I wouldn't try their kale tea, but this I would). Luckin launched nearly 120 items in 2024 alone, likely keeping Starbucks' Asian R&D teams up at night.

Coffee is splintering into different worlds. You can get a pricey pour-over with wine-like tasting notes, an espresso at a historical cafe, a cortado at a boutique spot, or a boba-like latte at one of Luckin's 20,000+ outlets. Luckin may be turbocharging coffee fads with its dizzying flavor rollouts, but its core market of price-sensitive consumers aren't going anywhere.

The future has room for different models — there are enough caffeine addicts and social drinkers to sustain various empires. But there's no denying the pressure is on incumbents like Starbucks to refresh their identity before third space becomes third choice.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108158440-1749734216508-Luckin.jpg?v=1749734469&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-14 03:58:13.865367

The Chairman of UNA, Prof Obiora Okonkwo, announced this partnership at its Lagos office on Friday, revealing that with this deal, the airline is now the third Nigerian carrier to join the Global Distribution System (GDS) as it prepares for the launch of its Lagos-Accra route launch on August 25, 2025.

Okonkwo said that the integration to Sabre is part of its promise to enhance its Information Technology (IT) and innovative ideas and commended the Sabre and the airline’s teams for the migration.

He said: “This is in keeping our promise to go global as quickly as we can. These are things that we have lined up as part of our objectives that have been a little delayed by the turbulence in the country that we are seeing, especially in the aviation sector in the last two to three years. We can be delayed, but can’t be stopped. We understand the challenges that this is coming with, but with over 50,000 agents in 200 countries with the capacity to buy our tickets, it means we have more seats to sell. We need to increase our inventory.

“We have good news for you. By this time next year, we would have increased our capacity by over 2,000 per cent. From October to November this year, we will be inducting into our fleet not less than four big body aircraft and from February to April next year, we are adding six Boeing 737-800NG into our fleet. We know it has been very challenging, but we are not less determined, we are not giving up, we will continue to do our best and continue to count on the public, hoping that they will understand what we do to make things better.”

Vice President, Sabre Travel Central and West Africa, Dr. Olayiwola Dare, said the company would supply to the airline with the IT solutions to enhance its performance. He also stated that through UNA would benefit in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which would serve its customers and the travel agents better. He said this integration would enable UNA to have access to all the travel channels that Sabre operates, either via the Online Travel Agency (OTA) or through other desired travel agencies.

“In Sabre, we are very much committed to ensure that our technical capability is well-implemented with United Nigeria as we do for other airlines globally. Also, we have a very big market place with over 200 countries currently and over 50,000 travel agencies globally working on our platform and this will put United Nigeria in that platform and accessible to all travel agencies globally and all those travel management companies like Shell, Chevron, Total and other big firms, irrespective of your location throughout the world. United Nigeria is going to be accessible,” he said. Sabre Corporation’s Director, Africa and Europe, Mr. Robert Brian, commended UNA for adopting the technology and said with this, the company would integrate the airline to the rest of the world.

“We are an American company, but we have been working in Africa for years. Today is special because you can now book through GDS in Nigeria. Travel agencies in Tokyo and New York and anywhere in the world can now see your flight. This shows that the industry in Nigeria is advancing. There are strong players here and United Nigeria has shown what the future can do. So, we are very proud of this and Nigeria,” he said.",https://d1jcea4y7xhp7l.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/united-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 15:00:57.960652

The medtech giant issued a recall notification to customers last month, and it has now been classified as a Class I recall by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

According to the FDA recall notice, there have been 63 medical device reports (MDRs) associated with the outlined issues, including two serious injuries and one death. There are 4,842 devices in commerce, according to the FDA’s recall database.

Medtronic advised discontinuing the clinical use of the affected device versions following an investigation into customer complaints relating to the devices shutting down during use and/or the devices’ shutdown alarms failing to sound effectively. The company said it had identified two separate capacitors on one of the ventilator’s controller printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) as the cause of the issues.

The agency noted that if a ventilator fails and does not provide adequate ventilation, the patient may not be able to breathe on their own, leading to low oxygen levels, high carbon dioxide levels, and potentially severe consequences like brain injury or death.

Also within the FDA’s recall notice, Medtronic added that the affected devices must be removed from circulation and that it will not be correcting the highlighted issues on affected ventilators or service parts and will no longer service the affected ventilators. The recall tag comes just over a year after Medtronic announced it would exit the ventilator market, citing unprofitability.

A recent study published in the BMJ found that almost a third of adverse events (AEs) were reported late – notably, outside of the mandated 30-day reporting window – to the FDA’s centralised Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between September 2019 and December 2022.",https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/06/shutterstock_2426082699-7.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 09:59:23.650087

I shared a graphic and a brief blurb about this in last week’s newsletter but figured it was worth a deeper dive since the physician is a central figure hitting on so many trends and forces shaping healthcare.

In summary, physicians are consolidating, and are increasingly employed by health systems.

Here’s a quick breakdown, visualized by yours truly. And the full AMA report can be found here including methodologies and more color.

Insight #1: Fewer physicians than ever before are owners of their practice in 2024. It’s an interesting and noteworthy trend. The physician workforce is aging, and therefore many are retiring and selling their practices to PE and hospitals. Meanwhile, physicians just entering the workforce tend to be employed by hospitals and health systems, so it’s a double-whammy effect we’re seeing as hospitals are the primary driver of the increase in employed physicians and subsequent decrease in physician PRACTICE ownership. I would wonder about trends in ASC ownership, however.

Insight #2: Physician practices are consolidating into multi-specialty independent groups or being employed as hospital professional entities.

Insight #3: Similar to the above, practice sizes are either increasingly either really big, or really small. As hospitals and PE-backed groups are focused on cornering their respective local markets or specialties to drive higher rates, have greater coverage of important sub-specialists to corner payors, or provide more integrated care, these entities aggregate platform-level, large physician groups of 50+ MDs. Meanwhile the reverse is true in private practice, as you’d expect. 49% of private practices contain 5 or fewer physician, meaning there’s a long tail of fragmented physician practices STILL across the nation.

Insight #4: Hospitals and PE-backed groups are the primary beneficiaries of the private practice squeeze. As expense inflation, need for more expensive equipment, and inability to negotiate with larger payors continues, economics of healthcare favor scale and scale with density in particular – so, naturally consolidation happens.

Insight #5: Physician practices are getting bigger as strategics vie for scale in their markets. And the trend appears to have accelerated in 2024 as seen in the big dip in MDs < 5:

The Weekly Executive Summary

Notable moves, policies, and strategies from around healthcare.

Strategy, Finance, M&A:

Omada’s Successful Public Debut: While the stock has sold off since, Omada notched a successful IPO, raising $150M and signaling stability for health tech IPOs to come.

Duly Acquisition: Duly Health and Care acquired Alliance Clinical Associates to expand its multi-specialty outpatient network in the Midwest, adding 5 new clinical sites. A little bird told me Duly may not stay out of the news in 2025.

Advocate Income: Advocate Health’s operating income jumped 217% in Q1, driven by strong patient volumes and improved cost management. What an incredible jump.

Concentra acquisitions: Concentra completed its acquisition of Pivot Onsite Innovations, bolstering its workplace health and onsite medical services. The deal brings Pivot’s tech-enabled injury prevention and telehealth solutions into Concentra’s network.

Rural Partnership: Homeward and Meijer launched a rural health partnership to bring primary care, chronic disease management, and social support services to underserved Michigan communities.

Stonepeak Walks: Private equity firm Stonepeak reportedly walked away from a $1.9 billion acquisition of a national radiology group over valuation disagreements.

Best Buy Health Impairment: Best Buy Health wrote off $109M mostly related to its healthcare acquisitions (presumably Current?). Probably signals slow decay of the promise of at-home care models, alongside the Dispatch-Medically Home merger.

United’s Comms Snafu: UnitedHealth accidentally leaked a set of prepared talking points for executives to address investors. Whoops!!

Innovation:

OpenEvidence and JAMA Partner: OpenEvidence and The JAMA Network signed a strategic content agreement to deliver peer-reviewed medical insights and clinical summaries to health professionals. OpenEvidence claims it’s used by over a third of doctors and 10,000 hospitals and medical centers nationwide, so it’s definitely a name to watch and a potential Doximity target, eh? Alright…maybe not at a $3B valuation.

Khosla R1 Investment and Palantir Involvement: R1 secured growth capital from Khosla Ventures to accelerate its AI-driven revenue cycle and patient engagement solutions following the launch of R37 with Palantir (extremely notable development). Lotssssss of activity in RCM right now given the prevalence of AI use cases and consolidation plays

Epic Launchpad: Epic introduced Launchpad, a new framework to help health systems deploy and govern generative AI applications within its EHR. The tool provides guided templates, risk controls, and performance monitoring for clinical workflows.

Amazon Pharmacy Launches Support for Caregivers: Amazon Pharmacy introduced a caregiver support feature for Medicare PillPack customers, allowing designated family or professional caregivers to manage prescription orders and dose reminders.

The sandwich generation refers to people who are between the ages of 30 and 40 that are responsible for taking care of their own children as well as their parents aged 65 or older.

In the latest entry in The Career Optimism Special Report Series titled “Moms in the Sandwich Generation,” it was revealed that about 51% of mothers who belonged to this employee segment had left their jobs in order to care for their children and their aging parents. About 55% of sandwich moms were also found to be living in a single-income household, showcasing an alarming lack of financial support that adds to their struggles.

University of Phoenix Chief Strategy and Customer Officer Ruth Veloria pointed out how the report revealed the realities of those who were part of the fastest-growing employee segment across demographics.

“This special report sheds light on the tough compromises many are forced to make and serves as a reminder that more thoughtful support systems are essential—not just to help caregivers stay connected to their careers, but to safeguard the long-term health and resilience of the workforce itself,” said Veloria.

“As more employees take on dual caregiving roles, overlooking these challenges could result in widespread attrition, disengagement, and lost leadership potential,” she added.

The report further found that 62% of sandwich moms said that having a career was a luxury for them and 52% admitted that their pay checks covered caregiving costs. About 64% also said that their PTO and sick time were dedicated for caregiving with 35% skipping networking or career-enhancing activities.

Bernie Sanders weighed in on contract negotiations with UNFI Cub Foods on Wednesday, sending a letter to Andre Persaud, president and CEO of Retail for UNFI Cub Foods, urging the company to sign a contract with workers represented by United Food and Commercial Workers Local 663.

Sanders, a senator from Vermont, who is currently traveling the country holding rallies for the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, also sent letters to Jason Herfel, president of Knowlan’s Festival Foods, and Dennis Brucker, president and COO of Haug’s Cub Foods, urging them to “sign a fair contract that provides better pay, benefits, and working conditions for these union workers as soon as possible.”

Sanders noted in all three letters that workers at the three Minneapolis-area grocery chains have been without a contract since March.

The letter noted that UFCW Local 663 represents 2,300 workers at UNFI Cub Foods. In mid-May, workers rejected contract offers from the retailers and warned that a strike could be coming. That strike could impact 38 stores in and around Minneapolis.

UNFI told Supermarket News in an email that it takes the letter from Sanders seriously.

“Cub cares greatly about its team members and has been negotiating diligently and in good faith with the local union to finalize a new collective bargaining agreement. As part of the negotiations, we’ve offered strong wage increases, continued market leading union health care and significant increases in our contributions to the union’s pension plan to help address underfunding and protect the benefits of all participants. It is our strong hope that the union will choose to meet with us to continue negotiations toward a new contract,” the company said.

Sanders called the company’s actions “absolutely unacceptable.”

These essential workers, who kept communities fed during the pandemic and continue to serve customers every day, deserve better than to be left without a contract for months on end,” he wrote.

He said in the letter to Persaud that workers have claimed that UNFI Cub Foods have urged workers to “drop current unfair labor practice charges and grievances … including what I understand to be approximately $2 million in sick time class action grievances alone.”

“These unlawful tactics, including refusing to negotiate, threatening workers, and surveilling employees over their union activity, are unacceptable and have prompted the filing of multiple unfair labor practice charges,” he said in the letter to Persaud.

Meanwhile, Cub said its working to negotiate in good faith.

“We are in contact with the Senator’s staff about the status of the negotiations. We look forward to the opportunity to provide more information about Cub’s efforts to continue negotiating in good faith,” Cub said.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/bltd850bf871331edae/684c57a735aaa9b1b2563c0f/The_exterior_of_a_Cub_Foods_store.webp?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-14 05:59:01.733565

AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is one of the best stocks for a dividend stock portfolio.

The company announced that the US FDA has expanded the approved use of its oral antiviral drug Mavyret, developed in partnership with Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENTA), for treating Hepatitis C.

The updated approval allows Mavyret—made from the antiviral agents glecaprevir and pibrentasvir—to be used in the US for both adults and children aged three and older with acute or chronic Hepatitis C, provided they do not have cirrhosis or have compensated cirrhosis. Eligible patients can complete treatment in eight weeks.

This decision is based on results from a Phase 3 study, which showed the therapy to be safe and effective for acute cases. Mavyret was initially approved in 2017 for newly diagnosed adult Hepatitis C patients.

AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is an international biopharmaceutical firm dedicated to creating and providing advanced treatments for challenging health conditions. The company concentrates on key areas such as immunology, cancer, neuroscience, eye care, and aesthetics. Its goal is to improve lives by researching, developing, and offering new therapies that address serious medical needs that currently lack effective solutions.

Johnson & Johnson said the first clinical data from its ongoing Phase 1b study of JNJ-4496, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, shows encouraging potential in treating large B-cell lymphoma, or LBCL.

The company said Friday the data show a 75% to 80% complete response rate among evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL who received the recommended Phase 2 dose.

The findings demonstrate the therapy's potential in treating such patients, including those with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which is the most common type of aggressive lymphoma, the company said.

The therapy also showed a promising safety profile, with no cases of Grade 3 or 4 cytokine-release syndrome observed in the cohort receiving the recommended Phase 2 dose, the company said.

Two patients had immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, including one Grade 3 event, which occurred in a patient with central nervous system lymphoma, the company said.

Overall, 84% of patients had Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events. The most common was neutropenia, a reduction in white blood cells, the company said.

The therapy is designed to bind to both CD19 and CD20 antigens, two cell surface proteins commonly expressed on malignant B-cells, in order to potentially address common resistance mechanisms in relapsed or refractory disease, the company said.

The index, an indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories and backlogs based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses, is produced by S&P Global Ratings and GEP.

Global supply chain activity was driven lower by a deterioration across Asia, which reported the greatest degree of spare capacity in almost a year-and-a-half.

The GEP global supply chain volatility index fell to minus 0.46 in May from minus 0.39 in April, indicating rising spare capacity across supply chains. Global supply chain activity was driven lower by a deterioration across Asia, which reported the greatest degree of spare capacity in 18 months. North American supply chains remain underutilised due to considerable weakness in Mexico and Canada.

The quantity of raw materials and components purchased by Asian factories weakened for the second consecutive month in May, signalling stronger retrenchment.

The index for Asia fell to minus 0.40, from minus 0.32, signalling that the region’s supply chains were the most underutilised since December 2023.

China was central to this region-wide decline during May, in which Chinese factories pulled back their purchasing.

North America’s supply chains remain underutilised due to considerable weakness in Mexico and Canada.

The index for North America rose to minus 0.24 from minus 0.34. In the United States, manufacturers continue to be underutilised, but they increased purchases of raw materials and commodities, bolstering inventories to protect against future higher prices or supply disruptions, a release from S&P Global Ratings said.

The index little changed in Europe since April (minus 0.29), down fractionally to minus 0.30. The European industrial sector edged closer to recovery, with activity at the region’s suppliers broadly level with April, which was the strongest for ten months. Manufacturers in the continent have been buoyed by recently announced fiscal stimulus measures, particularly in Germany.

The United Kingdom’s supply chains remain severely underutilised, with the country’s manufacturers retrenching aggressively again in May. The index there rose to minus 0.97 in May from April’s minus 1.12, but still at a level indicative of considerable slack across supply chains, indicating marked weakness across the UK manufacturing industry.

Global demand for raw materials, commodities and components remained subdued, with no improvement seen since April and therefore meaning it remains at its weakest in the year-to-date, a release from S&P Global Ratings said.

Procurement activity in Asia was down at its sharpest in nearly a year-and-a-half, driven by retrenchment among Chinese factories.

Global safety stockpiling reports remain historically low, primarily as a consequence of inventory strategies in Europe, with manufacturers across the continent continuing to favour lean warehouses.

This contrasts to the trend in North America, with safety stockpiling above its long-term average for a second successive month.

The global item shortages indicator, which tracks the availability of critical commodities, common inputs and components, remains below its long-term average, signalling robust global material supply levels. This metric implies that vendors have stock to meet orders from their customers.

Reports of backlogged work rising due to staff shortages ticked up slightly at the global level in May, but overall, they remain close to historically typical levels, indicating that suppliers’ workforce capacity remains sufficient to cope with current demand.

Raised in Sete, Simo attended the elite HEC business school before joining eBay in 2006, first in France then in California.
“She never let herself be intimidated,” recalled David Marcus, who worked at Meta alongside Simo and now serves as CEO of online payment company Lightspark.
As OpenAI’s number two, she’ll free up CEO Altman to focus on research and infrastructure while she tackles the company’s operational challenges.

Reporting directly to CEO Sam Altman, the move to the ChatGPT-maker represents the latest chapter in a career that has taken Simo from a fishing family in France’s Mediterranean port of Sete to the heights of Silicon Valley.

As the current CEO of grocery delivery platform Instacart, she cuts a unique profile: a French woman in the male-dominated American tech landscape — who resists advice to blend in.

“I can put all my energy trying to be someone else or I can be myself and pour all of that energy into what I can create,” she told CNBC in February.

This philosophy will likely be on display when she appears yesterday at the VivaTech conference in Paris.

Raised in Sete, Simo attended the elite HEC business school before joining eBay in 2006, first in France then in California.

“People expect a very business-like story for why I decided to come to the US. It wasn’t. The American Dream was on TV every night and that was an incredibly appealing thing,” she said.

‘Never Intimidated’

In 2011, Simo joined Facebook, now Meta. She was given responsibility for video and monetisation in 2014, a role she considers the defining moment of her career.

Simo championed the company’s pivot to video, which became central to Meta’s strategy despite initial internal skepticism.

“She never let herself be intimidated,” recalled David Marcus, who worked at Meta alongside Simo and now serves as CEO of online payment company Lightspark.

“She had an ability to challenge Mark (Zuckerberg) and push him, when others would have hesitated.”

Joining Instacart in 2021, Simo inherited a company that had been bleeding money for a decade.

Under her leadership, the grocery delivery platform achieved profitability in 2022 through aggressive diversification: data monetisation, expanded retail partnerships and a robust advertising business.

Now Simo faces her biggest test yet. As OpenAI’s number two, she’ll free up CEO Altman to focus on research and infrastructure while she tackles the company’s operational challenges.

Despite being one of history’s most highly funded startups and ChatGPT’s phenomenal success, OpenAI is burning cash at an alarming rate.

The company has also weathered significant leadership turnover, including Altman’s own brief ouster and reinstatement in 2023, raising questions about management stability.

But French investor Julien Codorniou, who worked alongside Simo at Facebook, said she will more than rise to the occasion.

“Fidji’s arrival is a declaration of ambition by OpenAI,” he said. — AFP",https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2025/06/13/282311.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 00:57:20.784845

Yet, only few high-end fashion marketplaces or luxury brand e-shops have deployed a customer service that fully satisfied their buyers.

""Customer advisors become ""superhuman"" thanks to instant access to customer information, proactive suggestions and the ability to write personalised communications,"" the study stated.
The full implementation of AI as a full member of the team would thus make it possible to offer exceptional customer service on a large scale.","With the emergence of chatbot applications driven by artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT or Gemini, web browsing and search habits have evolved considerably. The effectiveness of these tools and the new behaviours they induce have influenced purchases and raised the expectations of luxury brand consumers to a higher level of demand in terms of customer experience. This was a major development to which brands are adapting by redefining the standards of excellence in their customer service.

Yet, only few high-end fashion marketplaces or luxury brand e-shops have deployed a customer service that fully satisfied their buyers. This was one of the first conclusions drawn from a new Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study on Customer Experience and AI in Luxury. According to this document, 56 percent of respondents stated they were not satisfied with their luxury shopping experience.

Luxury customers interviewed in the survey expressed their frustration at having to enter their personal data several times and stated they did not feel recognised or valued when customer advisors had no knowledge of their preferences. They also indicated impersonal and inconsistent follow-up and engagement from advisors after purchase.

Today, most customers (64 percent) still made their purchases in-store, but the share of online purchases increased: 38 percent of customers stated that they shopped more online for luxury goods than three to five years ago. In addition, the study pointed out that even when the final purchase took place in-store, luxury customers spent time researching and planning from their screens.

According to BCG experts, brands had no choice but to implement AI within their teams to design new operating models that would give customer advisors new capabilities. ""Customer advisors become ""superhuman"" thanks to instant access to customer information, proactive suggestions and the ability to write personalised communications,"" the study stated.

The full implementation of AI as a full member of the team would thus make it possible to offer exceptional customer service on a large scale. However, the dose of artificial intelligence used would always have to be used with a great deal of common sense so that the aura of luxury was maintained and the service did not fall into robotisation.

Finally, with extensive personalisation resulting from the collection and processing of vast quantities of customer data, brands would have to ensure they did not lose consumer trust through the use of data deemed too intrusive.",https://r.fashionunited.com/WFYaVrF5ueiSAn4vRed_plw8SBNlf9dEdMyfxsfJzec/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjUvMDYvMTMvcHJhZGEtYXRtLXMyNS0wMDQtMzdjMjJlOXgtMjAyNS0wNi0xMy5qcGVn.jpeg,N,,2025-06-14 04:59:53.761005

(AP) – Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS Health Corp. improperly used customers’ personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.

Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.

As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on June 11 they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.

“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy – your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.

Bill would have banned ownership of both drug stores and pharmacy benefit managers

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.

CVS Health Corp. owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

“These powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,” a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.

CVS says on its website that it “negotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.”

CVS texts included a draft letter opposing the bill

The company’s text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.

“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter read. “They would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care – the consequences would be dire.”

Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers “may shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.”

“No we’re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said.

A GOP lawmaker received one of the texts

Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.

“It’s in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,” he said. “They’ve now taken that to send me political texts.”

CVS sent messages to “large numbers” of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company’s pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.

Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information “for their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,” Murrill told reporters. “That’s not why anybody gave them their phone number.”

Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.

The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee – a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.

“We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,” Thibault said in an email. “Our communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.”

Landry says he may call special session

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state’s legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.

The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.

Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS’s lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn’t be able to access their medications.

“CVS … you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,” Landry said.

The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.

Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.

“Yes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,” Landry said a statement. “It’s that important.”",https://assets.pbn.com/2025/06/AP25163830938818-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 13:01:42.794719

A celebration of milestones—and a renewed call to be the place where human connection thrives.

LAS VEGAS, June 13, 2025.- More than 14,000 coffeehouse leaders from across North America came together this week for a high-energy, three-day rally designed to build on the momentum of the company’s “Back to Starbucks” strategy. The company also hosted the first-ever Global Barista Championship, with partner Sebastian representing Latin America and the Caribbean during the week’s competition.

Here are 7 key highlights that inspired us in Latin America and the Caribbean:

Connection is the way Back to Starbucks

At the heart of LE25 was a simple yet powerful message: getting “Back to Starbucks” means getting back to connection. From the very first moment, partners were reminded that Starbucks has always been more than a coffee company—it is a space where human connection flourishes.

This theme was brought to life in an unforgettable way when ceo Brian Niccol surprised the audience with a guest appearance by Starbucks founder Howard Schultz. Greeted by a standing ovation, Schultz spoke passionately about the enduring relevance of the Third Place. He shared that, people are “longing for human connection,” and Starbucks is uniquely positioned to meet that need. “We are a company steeped in humanity,” he affirmed.

Schultz praised the “Back to Starbucks” strategy as exactly what the company needs today, emphasizing that coffee craftsmanship and the customer experience must remain at the core. He called on leaders to uphold the highest standards, saying every decision should be made with “two chairs in the room”—one for the partner and one for the customer.

This renewed focus took physical form during the largest coffee tasting in Starbucks history, where over14,000 coffehouse leaders gathered with Michelle Burns, Starbucks global head of coffee, to share the first sip of the new Starbucks 1971 Roast™ coffee. Thedark roast coffee set to launch in JanuarySide by side, partners from every corner of North America experienced the coffee together—a moment of deep connection, joy, and pride in the craft.

As Starbucks enters a new chapter, it does so by reigniting the soul of the Third Place, with its partners at the heart of every meaningful connection.

2. The Art of Coffee – and Latin America- on the Global Stage

LE25 was also the setting for the first-ever Starbucks Global Barista Championship, a celebration of craft and connection featuring 12 baristas from Starbucks five global regions—narrowed down from over 84,000. Representing Latin America and the Caribbean, Sebastian took the stage with pride, showcasing the artistry, skill and warmth that defines the green and black apron baristas of our region.

Just before announcing the four finalists, The Starbucks Foundation shared that it would award $10,000 grants to nonprofits in each finalist’s region, extending the championship’s impact far beyond the event itself.

Nobuki representing Japan, earned the title of Starbucks Global Barista Champion and will have the opportunity to co-create a beverage that will be served in Starbucks coffeehouses in North America.

3. A Milestone for the Future of Coffee

At LE25, Starbucks announced that it has fulfilled its $100 million commitment to the Global Farmer Fund, reaching its 2025 goal months early. This financing has enabled thousands of smallholder farmers to invest in new trees, infrastructure and climate-resilient practices, ensuring the future of high-quality arabica coffee for generations to come.

This milestone underscores Starbucks deep-rooted coffee heritage in Latin America and the Caribbean, where more than half of the company’s coffee is sourced each year.

4. Ensuring Coffee’s Future and Innovation – New Coffee Farms in Latin America

Two new Starbucks coffee innovation farms were officially named during LE25:

Highlands of Alsacia, located in Costa Rica, will expand climate-resilient research and agronomy innovation from the iconic Hacienda Alsacia.

Valley of Volcanoes, in Guatemala, will focus on developing sustainable solutions in a volcanic microclimate to enhance yield, quality and resilience.

These farms expand Starbucks global agronomy network and deepen its commitment to the farming communities that have sustained the brand for over five decades.

5. Social Impact with Purpose

Starbucks also shared powerful numbers that reflect its partners’ (employees) commitment to strengthening communities:

More than $5 million in community donations were awarded through the Neighborhood Grants program, fueled by over 56,000 nominations from North America-based partners.

100% of surplus food from the event was donated to Las Vegas’ Three Square Food Bank, along with a $100,000 contribution from The Starbucks Foundation.

6. Technology Enables Human Connection At Starbucks Coffeehouses

From the launch of Green Apron Service—a refreshed model of customer care grounded in warmth and empathy, presence and human connection—to the debut of Green Dot Assist, an AI-powered tool to support baristas in real time, Starbucks showed how innovation isn’t just about technology. It’s about creating simpler ways for partners to show up as themselves and focus on what matters the most: the customer.

Israel ordered the halt of the offshore Leviathan field operated by Chevron Corp. due to security concerns, according to a statement from the Energy Ministry. Energean Plc has also suspended output in the country.

The escalating tensions in the Middle East raise the risk of a wider war in a region that’s key to global energy supplies.

As pipeline gas flows from Israel fell, Egypt cut gas deliveries to some industries and is boosting the consumption of diesel by power plants “as a precautionary measure” so it doesn’t have to resort to power cuts, the Egyptian energy ministry said in a statement.

The disruption to regional supply coincides with rising summer demand in Egypt, which receives pipeline deliveries from Israel. The North African nation sometimes has to resort to heavier use of fuel oil for power generation, if LNG is too expensive or at times of elevated demand.

A prolonged period of lower Israeli supply may force Cairo to bring forward purchases of liquefied natural gas, further tightening global markets. Gas prices in Europe rose as much 6.6% on Friday.

The Leviathan field is located in the eastern Mediterranean, supplying gas to domestic customers as well as Jordan and Egypt.

The pause on exports to both countries together amounts to 35 million cubic meters a day, said Laurent Ruseckas, director of FIRST TAKE LNG Analysis at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Additional demand for cargoes could build quickly if the Israeli outages persist,” he said in an emailed note. “To fully replace Israeli pipeline imports, Egypt and Jordan between them would require another 10-12 LNG cargoes per month.”

Output at Tamar, also operated by Chevron, hasn’t currently been suspended, the Israeli energy ministry said.

Energean’s Karish field only meets domestic demand in Israel, but a stoppage can affect overall fuel balance in the country.

Egypt is already heavily dependent on gas imports after domestic production slumped. It’s ramping up LNG imports, but recently agreed supply deals won’t start until next month.

Jordan can no longer directly import LNG, after a floating terminal that previously met its needs moved to Egypt.

With the arrival of that terminal, whose connection to Egypt’s grid will now be expedited, there are three floating facilities for LNG imports in the nation, but only one is operational at the moment.

The separation will occur via a two step transaction – an initial minority IPO carve-out followed by a split-off of the remaining stake.

Two-Step separation allows investors an early opportunity to assess and value the Diabetes business independently, while Medtronic ultimately divests full ownership over time. Diabetes business could be valued between $8-$11B.

The move will allow Medtronic to focus on its faster-growing, higher-margin businesses such as pulsed field ablation and renal denervation.

AMD launched MI300-355. AMD claims that for training MI355 is on par with Nvidia’s B200. For inference MI355 generates more token per $, has a better TCO. MI350 shipped May-25

AI addressable market: AMD maintains its $500bn by 2028 estimate, 60% Cagr “or exceeding that”. Inference will grow faster, over 80% Cagr.

AMD stock is cheap, has bottomed out, the roadmap is more competitive, etc. For investors looking for an alternative to Nvidia and TSMC, AMD is the best alternative imo.

Shandong Gold Mining Co., Ltd. (600547.SS, 1787.HK) – Scaling Production and Enhancing Margins

By Rahul Jain

EBITDA margin is expected to expand to 19% by FY27, with EPS rising from CNY 0.51 to CNY 1.10, supported by operational efficiencies and a favorable gold price environment.

Shandong Gold aims for 70–80 tonnes of self-mined gold by 2027, with FY25–FY27 revenue projected to reach CNY118.8 billion at $3,400/oz gold price, driven by volume growth & higher prices.

Commodity price volatility, geopolitical risks in international ventures (Argentina, Greece), and state ownership influence pose challenges to margins and shareholder value.

And how long will entrepreneurs continue to believe Oregon is fertile ground on which to build or keep their companies?
And the lingering exhaust fumes from the Oregon companies that are moving on.","This story was produced by the Oregon Journalism Project, a nonprofit newsroom covering the state.

You might think Don Vollum would have made peace by now with the slow vanishing of Oregon-based corporations.

Then came the March announcement that the new owners of Tektronix would move the headquarters of Oregon’s legendary technology company from its Beaverton campus to Raleigh, N.C.

The idea that Tektronix, once the state’s largest employer, would leave Oregon is as daunting as the possibility that Nike, or Columbia Sportswear, would someday give up on its home.

That’s because the Portland-born founders of Tek, Howard Vollum (Don’s father) and Jack Murdock, were deeply rooted in Oregon when they created it in 1946, some 700 patents ago.

“Tek was in Portland because my dad and Jack Murdock were from here,” Don Vollum says. “It had nothing to do with economic development, lower taxes or a better work force. The same is true with Phil Knight [and Nike].”

Microsoft? “They were in Albuquerque, and [Bill Gates and Paul Allen] wanted to go home [to Seattle],” Vollum says. “Businesses begin in a place because they have a connection. The better question today is if and why they stay.

“That next generation of professional managers is when people look at education and taxes and workforce.”

And in Oregon, today’s view and tomorrow’s forecast are bleak.

“The combination of high taxes, poor services and poor schools isn’t a winning one, and that’s where we are,” Vollum says. “You put those pieces together and you have a place that’s not desirable for people if they’re starting or running a business.”

That’s not all you have.

You have Dutch Bros, the state’s second-most-valuable company, moving its corporate headquarters from Grants Pass to Phoenix.

You have REI closing its Pearl District co-op, Adobe abandoning its Southwest 1st Avenue digs, and Keen Footwear shuttering its Swan Island factory.

You have a 35% office vacancy rate in Portland’s central city and its tallest ghost town, the U.S. Bancorp Tower, burning money.

You have door-maker Jeld-Wen—which founder Dick Wendt built into one of America’s largest privately held companies—moving its corporate headquarters from Klamath Falls to North Carolina after a change in ownership. (In May, Jeld-Wen announced it would dead-bolt its Chiloquin factory, adding another 128 people to the ranks of the unemployed in that Southern Oregon county.)

You have distant, detached ownership of several of Oregon’s largest companies: PacifiCorp, Precision Castparts, Teledyne FLIR, and The Standard.

You have Intel, currently Oregon’s biggest employer, on the ropes.

And you have Oregon ranked fifth in the nation for total tax burden. As ECOnorthwest’s Michael Wilkerson told the Oregon Legislature in April, the ongoing migration of high-income households out of Multnomah County alone has produced, year after year, “over $1 billion in income loss.”

That’s the equivalent of a cool one thousand millionaires departing annually, leaving someone else to fund the Oregon Symphony and Preschool for All.

“Why does this matter? That part seems to be missing for the political class, just what this is costing us,” Vollum says. “You see it in philanthropy. We don’t have the next generation or donors for the arts and our cultural institutions.

“The older generations created a lot of wealth, and then gave a lot away, which supported all those institutions. There is not really a younger generation of wealth creators coming along behind them in Oregon, and some of the few who are promptly leave for other states, taking their charitable contributions with them.”

Vollum, the co-founder of Vista Ridge Capital Partners, is damn familiar with how philanthropy serves the region.

The estate of his father’s partner, Jack Murdock, launched the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, which has given more than $1.4 billion to Northwest nonprofits since 1975.

And Vollum, over the years, has chaired the boards at OMSI, the Portland State University Foundation and the Columbia River Maritime Museum, and served as president of the Providence St. Vincent Foundation.

When you live in a city, be that Hermiston or Coos Bay, you are much more likely to invest your time, energy and discretionary income in the upkeep of the neighborhood. Oregon has struggled to attract major sports franchises over the years, but Portland landed an Indy car race in 1984 because Norm Daniels, the CEO at G.I. Joe’s, and Bob Ames, the president at First Interstate Bank, believed their hometown deserved the upgrade.

When Daniels died in 2021, his wife, Rickie, illuminated that connection. “He loved to work. He just loved the company,” she told The Oregonian. “It was his baby because he grew up there. That’s where he wanted to spend his time. But he also cared deeply about what the company could do to service the community.”

It’s one helluva lot harder to care about Oregon’s universities, museums, foundations or communities when company owners are parked in Texas, Omaha or Florida.

Carrie Hoops is executive director of the Miller Foundation, which provided $12 million in arts and education grants in 2024. Recipients included the Painted Sky Center for the Arts in John Day and the Britt Music & Arts Festival in Medford.

As Hoops notes, corporations accounted for just under 7% of charitable giving in the United States in 2023. But, she adds, there’s an “economic ripple effect” when a corporation moves on:

“Many employers encourage their employees to volunteer. When a corporation leaves, it can lead to job losses, which then affects individual donations. People are laid off, and those people don’t have the money to contribute to their favorite charities.”

The slow vanishing of Oregon-based companies may be picking up speed. A January 2025 report by the University of Oregon’s Institute for Policy Research & Engagement found that Oregon businesses are routinely recruited to expand outside the state, leading to a loss of “thousands of potential jobs and billions of potential private investments in the past five years.”

That two-thirds of those recruited businesses have reported “moving or expanding outside Oregon” isn’t surprising.

How much faith can one retain in the local workforce when Oregon’s fourth and eighth grade test scores for reading and writing are among the nation’s worst?

Ponder that for a moment. Even as spending per pupil has soared, Oregon’s test scores have bottomed out. The state is dead last in fourth grade reading and math scores and—thank heaven for West Virginia—the numbers are almost as discouraging at the eighth grade level. Those scores are terrifying forecasts of economic growth and stability.

How does one recruit talented tech workers to Portland’s central city, where they will be forced to pay the highest income tax rates outside the island of Manhattan?

And how long will entrepreneurs continue to believe Oregon is fertile ground on which to build or keep their companies?

“We have so many regulations [that] it is very difficult to do business here,” Jordan Pape, the president and CEO of The Papé Group, based in Eugene, wrote in an email. “[We] need a public policy agenda that wants to lure, rather than lose, business investment.”

Our cultural institutions may not otherwise survive.

Is that panic in the wings?

“Panic? Panic is the wrong word,” Vollum says. “We’re long past the panic stage. We’re in the stages of grief.”

Denial? Anger? Bargaining? Depression?

“I’m more in the acceptance stage. I think all this is fixable…but, ultimately, it seems voters want what they have.”

Inflation expectations for the coming year plunged to 5.1% from 6.6%, and longer-run expectations edged lower, to 4.1%.

Economists still expect the impact of the tariffs will become much more visible this summer.
“Inflation is very likely going to increase,” Marc Giannoni, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, told The New York Times.","Consumer sentiment surged in June, according to a preliminary reading in a survey by the University of Michigan — the first improvement in six months, suggesting American shoppers enjoyed a fresh burst of optimism as President Donald Trump rolled back some of his tariffs and economic conditions, from the job market to inflation, stayed healthy.

The Michigan index of consumer sentiment climbed 16% from last month after having fallen near a record low. “I think this is a pretty significant sign that the worst—the peak pessimism—is behind us,” Tom Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, told The Wall Street Journal.

Inflation expectations for the coming year plunged to 5.1% from 6.6%, and longer-run expectations edged lower, to 4.1%.

“Consumers appear to have settled somewhat from the shock of the extremely high tariffs announced in April and the policy volatility seen in the weeks that followed,” Joanne Hsu, the Michigan survey director, said in a statement. “However, consumers still perceive wide-ranging downside risks to the economy. Their views of business conditions, personal finances, buying conditions for big ticket items, labor markets, and stock markets all remain well below six months ago in December 2024.”

Worries about Trump’s trade war and the economy may have eased some, but they aren’t gone. The sentiment index is about 20% below its level from the end of last year, and while inflation has so far defied expectations of a tariff-fueled jump, expectations for price increases are still higher than they were in the second half of 2024.

Economists still expect the impact of the tariffs will become much more visible this summer. “Inflation is very likely going to increase,” Marc Giannoni, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, told The New York Times. “It is a question of time, not so much of if.”",https://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/cdn/ff/AjbgfxFTI4peaVU-0Ib5NDebCLsIXcf_Idzvw5-mHlg/1748927269/:relative:/themes/custom/tftng_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-14 12:03:54.383496

When Broadcom purchased VMware, IT shops took notice.

The $61 billion deal, finalized in November 2023, signaled a seismic shift in the virtualization software vendor’s expansive and nearly ubiquitous enterprise portfolio, which Broadcom rapidly packaged into just a few subscription service bundles.

As customers grappled with the prospect of steep cost increases for operationally critical technologies, a small group of Michelin engineers sensed a transformation opportunity.

“It was a good time to start checking for an open-source project to replace this vendor solution,” Arnaud Pons, platform architect at Michelin, told CIO Dive.

Digital transformation is rarely a linear process. Modernization journeys often take unexpected turns as enterprises navigate cloud costs, vendor relationships and organization changes.

The VMware acquisition was a fork in the road for Michelin’s platform engineering team, which had been running hundreds of applications in the vendor's Tanzu Kubernetes Grid system for several years. Michelin could either channel its energies into adapting to revamped container services or pivot its own, internally driven strategy.

It wasn’t a difficult decision from an engineering perspective, according to Gabriel Quennesson, Michelin’s container as a service tech lead.

“At the end of the day, we realized that everything that we needed to do was readily available, and possible with open source tools,” Quennesson said in a Thursday case study published by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Michelin joined the CNCF in April, a few months after completing the migration to an in-house platform dubbed Michelin Kubernetes services, or MKS, by the engineering team. The entire process took roughly six months, Quennesson told CIO Dive.

“By having the knowledge of working on the technology for a couple of years, we were able to move rather quickly out of Tanzu — maybe quicker than moving to another vendor solution — because we could identify a migration path that neither VMware nor other vendors could provide us,” said Quennesson.

A team of 11 engineers, including Quennesson and Pons, now manages nearly 450 containerized software applications deployed across 42 locations supporting critical functions, such as ordering and logistics.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zq36YDSeaxAK1Cr5gh.lHg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cio_dive_389/ddc58dca0db90571418d7acc5289dded,N,,2025-06-13 23:00:14.056206

Costco Executive Members Already Have Some Perks

The earlier shopping hour and $10 credit will be added to the perks currently available to Costco Executive Members. These customers already receive a 2% cash back reward on qualified purchases and discounts on Costco services.

While the news of extended store hours sounded like a great idea to customers, Costco employees doesn’t love the new Executive Member perks. Many took to a Reddit thread to air their frustration.

“Corporate announcing this with 3 weeks notice, while in the middle of a hiring freeze, AND severely cutting hours? Costco is not the same company it once was,” someone wrote. “Non executive members are just going to bully themselves in and we will be told to do more with less, as we have been.”

Another Costco employee doesn’t think the new plan for executive members will work.

“Concessions are going to have to be made. I already drop light on Saturdays when we open at 9:15 then make up the difference on Sunday,” they said. “But I’m also super OCD about blocking down my department. I can get the stocking done, but it ain’t gonna be pretty!”

The news of the Executive Membership changes made this Costco customer sad for employees.

“As a regular at Costco this is sad to hear. It should be so obvious if they are going to offer additional service to customers they will need to hire more employees and compensate them appropriately. Friends that were Costco employees used to tell me they enjoyed the job. Happy employees means good customer service and return customers,” they wrote. “Unhappy employees will result in quick turnover of workers, less desirable employees, and eventually loss of customers. Costco please treat your employees right and it will help your bottom line.”",https://inspiremore.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Costco-Executive.png,N,,2025-06-13 23:00:06.518523

United Parcel Service (UPS) is a major player in global logistics and delivery services, impacting millions of lives daily. With its ambitious strategies and commitment to sustainability, UPS demonstrates the crucial role it plays in the economy, particularly as e-commerce continues to thrive. Understanding UPS’s evolving strategies is vital for businesses, consumers, and global trade.

Current Developments at UPS

As of October 2023, UPS has reported significant advancements in its logistics operations. The firm has embraced technology to optimize delivery routes and reduce fuel consumption, aligning with its goals for sustainability. For instance, the company announced that it has incorporated over 1,000 electric delivery vehicles into its fleet, expanding its commitment to green initiatives and reducing emissions by an estimated 10 million pounds annually.

In addition, UPS has improved its package tracking system, allowing customers to monitor their deliveries in real time. This feature has proven invaluable in enhancing customer satisfaction amid increased online shopping demands during the ongoing recovery from the pandemic’s effects.

Impact on Global Trade

UPS’s operations are essential in facilitating global trade. In recent months, the company has expanded its international services to cater to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) looking to penetrate new markets. According to the International Trade Administration, small businesses have played a critical role in boosting the economy, and UPS’s tailored logistics solutions target these enterprises, helping them thrive in the competitive landscape.

Looking Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities

Despite its successes, UPS faces several challenges, such as rising operational costs and intense competition from newcomers in the logistics space. The company anticipates future hurdles primarily related to climate change, which demands innovative approaches and investments in green technology. With governments and consumers pushing for more sustainable practices, how UPS navigates these challenges remains to be seen.

Conclusion

The significance of UPS in modern logistics cannot be overstated. By prioritizing sustainability, enhancing customer experiences, and supporting SMEs, UPS is adeptly shaping the future of logistics and trade. As the company continues to adapt to changing market dynamics, its commitment to efficiency and innovation will be crucial for maintaining its position as a leader in the global logistics arena.",https://infopetitenation.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-military-vehicle-convoy-alberta-g7-22-32x32.jpeg,N,,2025-06-14 11:02:34.083619

The ongoing concerns regarding the water supply for Tesla's manufacturing facility in Grünheide, Brandenburg, have reached a resolution. The American electric vehicle company, led by Elon Musk, has officially signed a new supply contract with the local water provider. This agreement is significant as it addresses the water needs and wastewater management for the Gigafactory, which commenced operations in 2022.

André Thierig, the plant manager of Tesla's facility, confirmed the signing of this pivotal agreement, alleviating previous uncertainties surrounding the water supply for the factory. The new contract outlines the volumes of water that will be supplied to the production site and stipulates terms for wastewater disposal, ensuring that the factory can operate sustainably over the coming decades.

This development comes in the wake of ongoing debates about the environmental impact of the Gigafactory, particularly its water usage in a region that has seen considerable ecological scrutiny. Local authorities and community members had raised concerns about the sustainability of water resources, especially given the factory's extensive water requirements for production.

With the new contract in place, Tesla aims to mitigate these concerns while ensuring that operations can proceed without interruption. The agreement reflects a commitment to responsible resource management, which is essential for both the company's image and its operational efficiency in Germany's competitive automotive landscape.

The implications of this agreement extend beyond just Tesla; it also has ramifications for the surrounding community and local ecosystem. Stakeholders are hopeful that the resolution of water supply issues will foster a more cooperative relationship between Tesla and regional authorities, paving the way for future collaborations and initiatives.

As Tesla continues to expand its footprint in Europe, the company is under increasing pressure to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship. This new water supply agreement is a critical step in addressing these challenges and ensuring that the Gigafactory can thrive while respecting local resources.",https://themunicheye.com/content_images/open-graph-tme.webp,N,,2025-06-14 12:04:09.690489

United Food and Commercial Workers local unions representing 45,000 grocery store workers have voted in favor of authorizing their bargaining team to call for an unfair labor practice strike to protest Kroger and Albertsons’ labor violations throughout negotiations that have prevented workers from getting the fair contract they deserve, the unions announced in a news release.

Kroger and Albertsons are the parent companies of Ralphs, Vons and Pavilions grocery stores.

“The results are in, and we have overwhelmingly voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions throughout Southern California,” the UFCW Locals 324 and 770 bargaining committee said in a news release. “Our message is clear: We are fed up with these corporations’ union-busting tactics designed to intimidate us and prevent us from getting the fair contract that we’ve earned and deserve.”

The union release added: “We’re at the breaking point. We are disrespected, overworked, and undervalued by Kroger and Albertsons. We’re tired of asking these corporations to invest in their workers and customers, only to see no results. We’re tired of asking the companies to respect our labor rights and seeing our co-workers intimidated.

“This strike authorization vote means that we expect the companies to return to the bargaining table, negotiate a deal that works for everyone, and desist from their unlawful tactics, before we walk out and hit the picket lines.”

Forty-five thousand UFCW members across Southern California who work at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions took unfair labor practice strike authorization votes the first two weeks of June. Negotiations are scheduled to continue on June 25, 26 and 27.

Tens of thousands of additional union grocery workers across the country who are employed by Kroger and Albertsons also voted to authorize a strike last week, bringing over 100,000 grocery workers to the brink of a strike at the same time, the release added.

Should the workers call a strike, it could create the largest grocery strike in modern history, and a major labor disruption for two of the nation’s largest grocery chains this summer, their busiest season of the year, the release said.

The companies responded to the unions’ vote with statements saying they are committed to continuing good-faith negotiations.

“We remain actively engaged in bargaining with the union because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption,” a Ralphs spokesperson told Los Angeles TV station ABC7. “Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading health care and a pension. These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer. We remain committed to good-faith bargaining that rewards our hardworking associates and keeps groceries affordable for our customers.”

Albertsons also issued a statement to Supermarket News, saying that it “respects the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining” and is committed to reaching an agreement “that is fair to its employees, good for its customers and allows the company to remain competitive.”",https://signalscv.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/13131429/110222_GROCERIES_RALPHS_DW_01_FILE-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:01:14.351213

“It was a good time to start checking for an open-source project to replace this vendor solution,” Arnaud Pons, platform architect at Michelin, told CIO Dive.
The VMware acquisition was a fork in the road for Michelin’s platform engineering team, which had been running hundreds of applications in the vendor's Tanzu Kubernetes Grid system for several years.
Michelin joined the CNCF in April, a few months after completing the migration to an in-house platform dubbed Michelin Kubernetes services, or MKS, by the engineering team.
The team ran its containers on Azure public cloud but opted against Microsoft’s Kubernetes platform and didn’t turn to a third-party service until it chose Tanzu in 2021.","When Broadcom purchased VMware, IT shops took notice.

The $61 billion deal, finalized in November 2023, signaled a seismic shift in the virtualization software vendor’s expansive and nearly ubiquitous enterprise portfolio, which Broadcom rapidly packaged into just a few subscription service bundles.

As customers grappled with the prospect of steep cost increases for operationally critical technologies, a small group of Michelin engineers sensed a transformation opportunity.

“It was a good time to start checking for an open-source project to replace this vendor solution,” Arnaud Pons, platform architect at Michelin, told CIO Dive.

Digital transformation is rarely a linear process. Modernization journeys often take unexpected turns as enterprises navigate cloud costs, vendor relationships and organization changes.

The VMware acquisition was a fork in the road for Michelin’s platform engineering team, which had been running hundreds of applications in the vendor's Tanzu Kubernetes Grid system for several years. Michelin could either channel its energies into adapting to revamped container services or pivot its own, internally driven strategy.

It wasn’t a difficult decision from an engineering perspective, according to Gabriel Quennesson, Michelin’s container as a service tech lead.

“At the end of the day, we realized that everything that we needed to do was readily available, and possible with open source tools,” Quennesson said in a Thursday case study published by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Michelin joined the CNCF in April, a few months after completing the migration to an in-house platform dubbed Michelin Kubernetes services, or MKS, by the engineering team. The entire process took roughly six months, Quennesson told CIO Dive.

“By having the knowledge of working on the technology for a couple of years, we were able to move rather quickly out of Tanzu — maybe quicker than moving to another vendor solution — because we could identify a migration path that neither VMware nor other vendors could provide us,” said Quennesson.

A team of 11 engineers, including Quennesson and Pons, now manages nearly 450 containerized software applications deployed across 42 locations supporting critical functions, such as ordering and logistics.

“While some of the manpower goes to simply ‘keeping the lights on,’ by ensuring the best platform availability and supportability, the move to open source allows us to start looking at the future and to what features had most value for our end users,” Quennesson said in a March blog post detailing Michelin’s Kubernetes journey.

Pros and cons

From a developer perspective, the case for open source is a relatively easy one: Talented engineers want to build technologies that solve difficult problems. Quennesson and Pons had to make a business argument in favor of migration, too.

After Michelin crunched the numbers, the company determined it could cut its yearly container costs by 44% by building an open-source platform. The open-source shift also lifted the spirits of its engineering team.

“I measure morale first,” Pons said. “It's really better to build a solution to a problem instead of just creating tickets and waiting months for someone at the vendor to call you with a solution that is not a very good one, anyway.”

The business equation was fairly straightforward, as well, according to Quennesson.

“We were more interested in the quality of the solution than the cost, but it’s basic math,” he said. “You are saving the subscription cost, which created a significant cost reduction, and your infrastructure costs are about the same.”

Michelin’s Kubernetes journey began in 2018, when the company first implemented containers using Kubespray to avoid vendor lock-in, Quennesson said in the March blog. The team ran its containers on Azure public cloud but opted against Microsoft’s Kubernetes platform and didn’t turn to a third-party service until it chose Tanzu in 2021.

While Tanzu enabled Michelin to build out and scale its containers both in the cloud and on-premises, the transition wasn’t seamless or without frustrations.

“The Kubernetes ecosystem is large and feature rich,” Quennesson said. “You have to pick and choose what you want and need, so one of the reasons to use a vendor is that this job is done for you.”

VMware’s decisions didn’t always align with Michelin’s needs, according to Quennesson. Relinquishing control to an outside vendor put engineers in an uncomfortably passive role, which created a less inviting atmosphere for developers at a time when tech talent is scarce.

“Skilled engineers were parked in a passive role of opening tickets and interacting with the support teams when they could and most of the time had found out what the issue was and how to fix it,” Quennesson said in the blog post.

Without a vendor to fall back on, the engineering team now has full responsibility for keeping the system up and running. But the tradeoff has been worth it, according to Quennesson.

“It’s created a virtuous circle,” he said. “If you adhere to open source principles and do cool stuff, you attract talent and you make it much easier to retain talent.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/fguhciLqiqYjf4e3d4SvOytSrcBMtTnLLSEDHr-URdc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzQ4Mzg5MzkzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-13 16:16:47.539442

This powerful message echoed through the MARKETING EDGE 2025 Q2 Virtual Summit held on Friday, June 12, via Zoom.

Baba Awopetu, Consultant, Strategy and Marketing at Stragmar, delivered a keynote address that championed data-driven storytelling as the essential skill for future market leaders.

He emphasised that data-driven storytelling drives deeper customer connections, faster innovation, and stronger market performance.

He reminded attendees that in marketing and sales, data isn’t just a resource; it’s a compass for long-term success.

As an experienced marketing professional, Awopetu described data-driven storytelling as a core business capability.

“Data-driven storytelling is no longer optional; it’s the critical capability that distinguishes market leaders from followers,” he said.

He outlined how data brings clarity in uncertain times, detects unspoken customer needs, enables personalisation, and gives companies an edge.

Awopetu stated that companies using data-driven methods achieve 20 per cent higher ROI.

He warned that today’s consumers reject generic messages and expect personalised communication that speaks to their needs.

“Without data, marketing is guesswork, expensive guesswork,” he said.

To show how data shapes strategy, Awopetu shared a study involving 18,000 doctors.

Researchers asked them when they would adopt a new product, from immediate use to waiting until it became standard.

Although 25 per cent claimed to be innovators, only 2.5 per cent truly were.

This revealed the danger of relying on assumptions over objective data.

He noted that innovation adoption depends on context, not just personality.

Researchers cross-referenced preferences with real prescription behaviour, confirming the study’s accuracy in predicting adoption.

He stressed the importance of targeting the right segments early.

He said early adopters provide the fastest path to market share.

“The secret to our success is going to be dependent on us working our way from the innovators and early adopters across over the lifecycle of the product.”

He shared a cautionary tale of a company that focused on late adopters and missed early momentum.

“Because they lacked the data and the insight, they operated based on what they could see.”

The oversight weakened product performance and proved why data must guide decisions.

Looking ahead, Awopetu identified key trends in data-driven storytelling.

These include AI-powered narratives, hyper-personalised campaigns, ethical storytelling, and interactive tools.

He wrapped up his session with five key lessons: data turns guesswork into truth; it brings clarity in uncertain times; it detects needs before they are voiced; customers demand personalisation; and data-driven strategies drive better business outcomes.

The initiative led to a 30% increase in first-party data from consumers, Kellanova said.
Gartner has studied the most effective digital marketing brands and found a correlation between the best-in-class brands and hiring data specialists.
Cotterill guided Kellanova to adopt a new clean room strategy with data platform LiveRamp over the past two years.
But using its data clean room, Kellanova was able to gain insights that allowed it to target both groups—premium and price-conscious shoppers—more effectively.","Launching a new packaged snack is never a sure thing.

In fact, new foods fail within 18 months about 85% of the time, according to Charisse Hughes, chief growth officer of Chicago-based Kellanova, whose brands include Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts and Pringles.

That’s why when Kellanova introduced a new chip variety last year, Pringles Mingles, the brand did so within a new data framework that helped guide everything from product design to flavor profiles to advertising.

“It has given us more confidence in what we bring to market,” said Hughes, emphasizing how product and marketing work hand in hand with data teams.

Kellanova recently launched a pilot data program that brings in data scientists, engineers and analysts at the start of projects, influencing pricing, packaging, product, marketing and distribution. “It’s helped us get more winners from the concept phase into execution,” Hughes said.

Brands have long studied the success of new product lines. But their ability to shape those products before they ever hit the market has been revolutionized with new data platforms and technology. Companies have new methods for collecting data through marketing that drives direct feedback from consumers, including via social media promotions, QR codes and rewards apps.

They are using that data in new environments, such as clean rooms, where they make predictions and identify core and untapped audiences. AI is a growing part of the mix, bringing sophisticated modeling based on brands’ unique data, an edge only they have.

“Customer data is really being viewed as this critical enterprise asset, whereas it used to be more of a marketing asset,” said Rachel Smith, senior principal analyst at Gartner.

How brands get better control of data

“CMOs have to have influence on data architecture,” said Gurdeep Dhillon, CMO of ContentStack, “and data teams need to understand marketing and content strategy.”

ContentStack works with major brands, including Air France and Costco, to manage customer experiences, from apps to checkout kiosks in stores.

Brands have access to data through multiple marketing touchpoints, including websites, apps and in-store digital displays. “Content is data,” Dhillon said. But marketers need a coherent plan to ingest that data, manage consumer expectations around how it is used, and apply it appropriately in marketing and services, Dhillon said.

Kellanova is trying to use its advanced data mindset throughout the company, not just marketing. Factories are using virtual reality and “digital twins” to test production plans before implementing them.

Kellanova is developing AI agents, which are autonomous intelligent bots, and distributing those throughout the workforce. The data Kellanova collects is deeply rooted in marketing through programs such as Pringles Poptopia, which launched last year with a QR code that linked to games, customizable snacks and special offers. The initiative led to a 30% increase in first-party data from consumers, Kellanova said.

“We are building a really strong pipeline that is more consumer-facing and much more consumer-centric versus what I would say many CPGs have done historically,” Hughes said, “which is sort of to replicate what they see in market.”

Instead of reacting to market trends, Kellanova wants to apply sophisticated data combined with advanced modeling techniques to accurately map the future, Hughes said.

Marketers and data scientists bridge the divide

Kellanova is bringing together data scientists, engineers, agency partners, marketers, e-commerce specialists and other specialists in new ways. “I’ve gone from probably three years ago when I had never spoken to a data scientist, quite honestly, to now, I talk to them every single day. I couldn’t do my job without them,” said Louise Cotterill, Kellanova’s senior director of insights and intelligence.

There can be tension within brands while they institute these comprehensive data regimes, Gartner’s Smith said. For instance, in some cases, marketers have gotten used to having unfettered access to data. But as IT teams seek to implement greater controls, this can cause conflicts with other departments, which must be managed.

“The enterprise side is really thinking about the future and how to reduce silos and get the data more centrally managed,” Smith said.

Gartner has studied the most effective digital marketing brands and found a correlation between the best-in-class brands and hiring data specialists. The top digital marketers were five times more likely to be promoting roles that included data science and machine learning in the description, Smith said.

The marketing organization is key to success when making technological changes. “They are oftentimes the ones making the business case for the data, for the tech,” Smith said. “They have that closer connection to growth and to retention and acquisition goals.”

How brands can get an AI edge

AI and machine learning will unlock the next phase for brands to create “separation” from rivals, Kellanova’s Hughes said.

Consumer packaged goods brands often lack direct links to consumers because products are sold through third-party retailers. Creative marketing helps, though, and brands can use campaigns to open direct lines to audiences to collect data about the identity and habits of their customers, with direct consent. That data can then inform brands’ proprietary models that make their operations more effective.

As Hughes said, every marketer has access to the same public data sets available through third parties such as Circana, which has purchase information, as well as Experian and Nielsen. So “the models are what’s going to become a differentiator,” she said. And brands can gain an advantage by building unique in-house data models, she added.

Kellanova is filtering data through new channels, which is leading to interesting marketing collaborations. Last year, Pringles designed a boot with Crocs that had cylindrical chip pockets. The campaign led to 1.6 billion impressions, and the boots can be found for resale on StockX for about $800. It was a quirky campaign, but it was also a direct-to-consumer pipeline.

Cotterill guided Kellanova to adopt a new clean room strategy with data platform LiveRamp over the past two years. Clean rooms are computing environments in which brands can bring data sets from a variety of sources, including third parties, to get a better picture of their consumers, build target audiences and measure ad campaigns.

Clean rooms are challenging for CPG brands to stand up because of their distance from first-party sales data. But Kellanova was able to build an effective clean room using new modeling techniques—and patience, Cotterill said.

She cited an effort involving Special K in the U.K. (Kellanova controls the brand internationally.) Special K’s ad targeting was missing some loyal consumers in the U.K, while other consumers stopped buying the brand because of price concerns. But using its data clean room, Kellanova was able to gain insights that allowed it to target both groups—premium and price-conscious shoppers—more effectively.

It took time to get the results they wanted, however, and Cotterill had to stand in front of leadership to urge patience, she said. “You have to have a chief growth officer who believes in it,” Cotterill said.",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/pringles.png,N,,2025-06-13 16:16:21.136295

As the company continues to evolve its business model and expand its services, investors and analysts are closely watching its performance and future prospects.

Company Overview

Instacart, operating under the corporate name Maplebear Inc. (NASDAQ: ), has established itself as a dominant player in the online grocery delivery market. With a market capitalization of $11.49 billion, the company maintains a ""GREAT"" financial health rating according to InvestingPro analysis, reflecting its strong market position and operational efficiency. Founded in 2012, the company has built an extensive network of partnerships with over 85,000 stores across 1,500 retail banners, covering more than 85% of the U.S. grocery market. This broad reach has positioned Instacart as a critical intermediary between retailers, consumers, and shoppers in the rapidly growing digital grocery space.

The company’s platform facilitates both delivery and pick-up orders from various retail partners, including major chains like Aldi, Costco (NASDAQ: ), and Kroger (NYSE: ). Recently, Instacart expanded its offerings through a partnership with Uber (NYSE: ) to include restaurant deliveries, further diversifying its service portfolio.

Financial Performance

Instacart’s financial performance has shown resilience in a challenging market environment. In its most recent quarterly report, the company reported Gross Transaction (JO: ) Value (GTV) of $8.3 billion, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. Revenue for the quarter reached $852 million, up 11.5% compared to the same period last year. The company maintains impressive gross profit margins of 75.22% and a healthy current ratio of 3.24, demonstrating strong operational efficiency. Want deeper insights into CART’s financial metrics? InvestingPro offers comprehensive analysis with over 10 additional key insights. The company’s EBITDA stood at $227 million, or 2.7% of GTV, demonstrating its ability to maintain profitability while investing in growth initiatives.

Analysts project that Instacart will continue to deliver high single-digit revenue growth, with estimates for fiscal year 2025 revenue ranging from $3.66 billion to $3.71 billion. EBITDA margins are expected to expand, with projections for fiscal year 2025 EBITDA ranging from $981 million to $1.01 billion.

Market Position and Competition

Instacart holds a dominant position in the U.S. online grocery delivery market, with an estimated 70-75% market share among third-party delivery services. The company’s scale and extensive partnerships give it a significant advantage in both small and large basket grocery orders.

However, the competitive landscape is intensifying, with well-capitalized players like Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Walmart (NYSE: ), DoorDash (NASDAQ: ), and Uber expanding their presence in the grocery delivery space. These competitors often have more flexibility to address affordability challenges and may be better positioned to capture market share growth in price-sensitive segments.

Growth Strategies

To maintain its market leadership and drive growth, Instacart is pursuing several strategic initiatives:

1. Affordability: The company is working on making grocery delivery more cost-effective for consumers by offering low-cost delivery options and collaborating with merchants to reduce prices. This initiative aims to drive GTV growth and compete more effectively with lower-priced alternatives.

2. Product Innovation: Instacart recently introduced Smart Shop, a personalized user experience for members that incorporates dietary preferences and shopping habits. This AI-driven personalization is expected to increase customer stickiness and improve retention rates.

3. Expansion of Services: The partnership with Uber to power advertising for its grocery and retail business in the U.S. represents a significant growth opportunity for Instacart’s advertising platform.

4. Capital Allocation: The company has demonstrated a commitment to shareholder value through share repurchases, having bought back $1.4 billion in shares year-to-date and announcing an additional $250 million share repurchase authorization. InvestingPro data reveals that Instacart holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing financial flexibility for continued strategic investments and shareholder returns.

Advertising Revenue

A key focus for Instacart’s growth strategy is the expansion of its advertising business. The company aims to increase its advertising revenue to 4-5% of GTV in the long term, up from the current level of around 2.9%. This growth is expected to be driven by new ad formats, improved targeting capabilities, and the expansion of Instacart’s retail media network (RMN) inventory.

However, some analysts have expressed concerns about the sustainability of this growth, citing persistent budget pressures in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry and increasing competition in the digital advertising space. The company’s ability to navigate these challenges and achieve its advertising revenue targets will be crucial for its long-term profitability and growth.

Bear Case

How might increasing competition impact Instacart’s market share?

Instacart faces significant challenges from well-established players in the e-commerce and delivery space. Companies like Amazon, Walmart, DoorDash, and Uber have greater financial resources and more diversified business models, allowing them to potentially offer more competitive pricing and absorb losses in their grocery delivery segments. This intense competition could lead to market share erosion for Instacart, particularly in price-sensitive customer segments.

Additionally, as these competitors continue to invest in their grocery delivery capabilities and leverage their existing customer bases, Instacart may find it increasingly difficult to maintain its dominant position. The company’s reliance on partnerships with retailers also leaves it vulnerable to disintermediation if these partners decide to develop their own delivery capabilities or exclusive relationships with other platforms.

What challenges does Instacart face in growing its advertising revenue?

While Instacart has set ambitious targets for its advertising business, several factors could impede its growth in this area. The CPG industry, which forms a significant portion of Instacart’s advertising client base, is experiencing budget pressures that may limit the growth of ad spending. This could make it challenging for Instacart to achieve its long-term goal of increasing advertising revenue to 4-5% of GTV.

Moreover, the digital advertising landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with major tech companies and retailers expanding their own advertising platforms. This competition could lead to downward pressure on ad rates and make it more difficult for Instacart to attract and retain advertisers. The company’s ability to demonstrate superior ROI for advertisers and develop innovative ad products will be crucial in overcoming these challenges.

Bull Case

How can Instacart leverage its scale to improve profitability?

Instacart’s extensive network of retail partnerships and its dominant market position provide significant opportunities for improving profitability. The company’s scale allows it to optimize its operations, including order batching and routing, which can lead to improved efficiency and lower costs per delivery. This operational leverage could translate into higher margins as the business grows.

Furthermore, Instacart’s vast trove of consumer data and shopping insights can be leveraged to enhance its advertising platform, potentially commanding premium rates from advertisers seeking targeted access to consumers at the point of purchase. By continuously improving its ad targeting capabilities and expanding its ad inventory, Instacart could drive significant growth in high-margin advertising revenue.

What opportunities exist for Instacart to expand its services and increase customer retention?

Instacart has several avenues for service expansion and customer retention improvement. The recent introduction of Smart Shop, which offers personalized shopping experiences, demonstrates the company’s ability to innovate and enhance customer value. By continuing to develop AI-driven features and personalized offerings, Instacart can increase customer engagement and loyalty.

The company’s partnership with Uber to include restaurant deliveries opens up new growth opportunities beyond traditional grocery delivery. This diversification could help Instacart capture a larger share of customers’ food-related spending and increase order frequency. Additionally, by expanding its enterprise solutions for retailers, such as white-label delivery services and in-store technology like Caper Carts, Instacart can deepen its relationships with retail partners and create additional revenue streams.

In a phase 1b trial of patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, 22 patients who received the recommended phase 2 dose of the CAR-T were included in the efficacy data with a median follow-up of 4 months. Of the 10 patients who had received one line of prior treatment, an objective response rate (ORR) of 100% was recorded, with all signs of cancer were undetectable for eight of the patients, J&J announced in a June 13 release.

For 12 patients who had received two or more previous therapies, the ORR was 92% and the complete response rate was 75%, the New Jersey company said.

In the trial’s 25-patient safety arm, 84% had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, with 28% of patients experiencing serious side effects.

Within the cohort, there were no cases of grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome, the healthcare giant said. One patient experienced grade 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), while another patient with central nervous system lymphoma experienced grade 3 ICANS.

The phase 1b trial’s primary endpoints are the occurrence of adverse events, including dose-limiting toxicities, and the determination of the recommended phase 2 dose, which J&J said in the release was 75 million CAR T-cells. J&J did not mention dose-limiting toxicities in the release.

J&J presented the data at the 2025 European Hematology Association conference in Milan, Italy. A global, open-label component of the phase 1b study is still ongoing.

The autologous CAR-T targets both CD19 and CD20, cell surface proteins commonly expressed by cancerous B cells.

“Only about 40% of patients have long-term remissions with currently available single-antigen-targeting CD19 CAR T therapies,"" Krish Patel, M.D., the director of lymphoma research at Nashville-based Sarah Cannon Research Institute and principal investigator of the study, said in the release. ""The data presented today show encouraging clinical activity and promising safety, and represent a step forward in delivering a potential new treatment option to patients living with the most common type of aggressive lymphoma.""

JNJ-4496 came to J&J through a 2023 collaboration and licensing agreement with Chinese-American biotech AbelZeta (formerly Cellular Biomedicine Group). Through that deal, J&J’s pharma unit Janssen paid $245 million upfront for the ex-China rights to JNJ-4496 (called C-CAR039 in China) and another CD20-targeting CAR T called C-CAR066.

The AbelZeta deal marked J&J’s return to the CAR-T field after the 2022 approval of Legend Biotech-partnered Carvykti.

Only Costco executive members will get these new perks.
Don’t head to a Costco at 9 a.m. just yet, executive members, because the new perks don’t go into effect until June 30, 2025.","Costco members love everything about the store, from the massive key lime pies to the $1.50 hot dog combos in the food court. And for some members, things are going to get a little better thanks to a couple new perks of membership to the warehouse club. Not every member will get them, though. Here’s what’s new, and who qualifies.

There are two new perks of having a Costco membership, according to USA Today. The first is extended shopping hours, where certain members can get into the store early — and probably have shorter lines and fewer people clogging up the aisles.

The second new perk is even better. Some members will get a monthly $10 credit for same-day delivery orders. So if you shop at Costco regularly and have your order delivered, that may be a pretty great benefit.

The early shopping hours for those that qualify for this perk will be 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. Sunday through Friday, and 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Sundays. Normally, Costco opens at 10 a.m. Sunday through Friday, and 9:30 a.m. on Saturday.

Costco also announced that it will be open until 7 p.m. on Saturdays for all customers. Previously, it closed at 6 p.m. on Saturdays.

Some Costco members will get a monthly $10 credit for same day delivery orders. In order to use it, you’ll have to place an order of $150 or more through sameday.costco.com or Costco via Instacart. According to a press release, the credit will be automatically applied to qualifying orders, and can be used once per month.

Of course there’s a catch. Only Costco executive members will get these new perks. That’s the highest level of membership, which means it’s more expensive than gold star membership, the lower tier. An executive membership currently costs $130 per year, but if you plan to use the $10 same day order credit each month, it’ll almost pay for itself over the course of a year.

Don’t head to a Costco at 9 a.m. just yet, executive members, because the new perks don’t go into effect until June 30, 2025.

""Ralphs is cutting back, I know because they force us into self-checkout,"" said Marc Spitz, also from Riverside.","LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Just when grocery prices seemed to be leveling off, Southern California shoppers may soon face another disruption -- this time, at the checkout line.

Thousands of grocery store employees represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers union are preparing for a potential strike. The move follows allegations of unfair labor practices by major chains, including Ralphs, Vons, and Albertsons.

""This authorization is an unfair labor practice strike authorization, which is a little different than an economic strike,"" said Kathy Finn, president of UFCW Local 770. ""So it's not just about the bargaining process.""

Union leaders claim that the dispute arises from a pattern of illegal activity by the companies, including allegations of worker surveillance, intimidation and retaliation against union members.

""You should be treating us right,"" said Kristona Carlton, a grocery worker. ""We're here every day. We deserve respect and they're not doing that for us.""

While no strike date has been set, workers are preparing. At a union workshop in Los Angeles, members created picket signs and coordinated strike teams, getting ready in case negotiations break down.

Shoppers have taken notice.

""I hate crossing picket lines,"" said Peggy Ninneman, a shopper from Riverside. ""And there are very few other stores to go to.""

Others pointed to signs of understaffing and increasing reliance on self-checkout lanes.

""Ralphs is cutting back, I know because they force us into self-checkout,"" said Marc Spitz, also from Riverside. ""They're cutting hours, cutting people, making us check out our own stuff.""

The union said it is pushing for higher wages, better staffing and stronger workplace protections.

In a statement, Ralphs defended its bargaining approach and said it is committed to reaching an agreement without disruption.

""We remain actively engaged in bargaining with the union because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption,"" a Ralphs spokesperson said. ""Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading healthcare and a pension. These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer.

We remain committed to good faith bargaining that rewards our hardworking associates and keeps groceries affordable for our customers.""

Union officials maintain that it's not just about economics, it's about respect on the job.

""As a shopper, I would tell them: listen to your employees,"" said Ninneman. ""Nothing works without workers.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16736303_061225-kabc-5pm-grocery-strike-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-06-13 16:14:35.076810

The membership-only retailer will build what city officials say is the chain’s largest gas station and its first fuel-only location.

Yes, there are many Costcos selling fuel under the chain’s Kirkland brand. It’s a popular membership amenity because the prices are often among the lowest in the market.

Costco also sells gas at one of its warehouses just 2 miles down Cabot Road from the planned site at the Mission Viejo Freeway Center at 25732 El Paseo. However, Mission Viejo documents show that Costco’s new location will be a 40-pump facility – gasoline only, with no retail space or convenience store. And yes, it’s just for Costco members.

The station will be constructed at a shopping center off the 5 freeway between La Paz Road and Oso Parkway. It’s a retail spot best known for South County’s lone Krispy Kreme doughnut shop. The plan includes demolishing a shuttered Bed, Bath & Beyond store.

City spokesman Robert Schick says the city approved the overall plans in March, with grading and building permits now being reviewed. Construction is expected to begin in the fall, with a planned spring 2026 opening.

No-brainer?

Now, selling fuel near one of the nation’s busiest freeways may seem like a no-brainer. But a gas-only location is an against-the-grain tactic.

We’d love to hear the “why?” from Costco. Sadly, the merchant doesn’t comment on store development plans.

Let’s consider industry data. Four out of five gas stations nationwide have a store, too. And while two-thirds of a typical gas-food-beverage store’s sales come from fuel, 60% of the profit usually comes from drinks, food, etc.

Gas-only stations buck two trends: the future of gas-powered vehicles and the higher profitability of non-gas sales. Airports are the spot where the gas-only station grew, because limited competition allows higher profits on fuel, says Jeff Lenard, spokesman for NACS, a trade group for gas-station operators.

David Hackett, an energy expert from Stillwater Associates in Irvine and a regular Costco fuel buyer, likes the gas-only idea. He says one reason California pump prices are so high is that the state has twice as many drivers for every gas station compared with the rest of the nation.

“I think Costco sees this new venture as an opportunity to serve their gasoline-buying members in a new way,” he says. “It will be successful because they are filling a need for more gas stations.”

Price matters

Costco may not need to attach a beloved food court to this Mission Viejo gas station because bargains on gas are a powerful lure.

“It gets people happier than just about anything in commerce,” says Lenard of NACS.

Ponder industry research showing 72% of gas buyers say price is the top motivation for where they buy, but that rises to 86% for shoppers of “big box” stores such as Costco.

“There’s a strong emotional caché with gas prices,” Lenard says. “Costco may be looking to tap into it” with the gas-only store.

Costco also seems to view southern Orange County as a laboratory, of sorts. There’s a car wash at the San Juan Capistrano location – 9 miles down the freeway from the planned gas-only location – one of only 15 nationwide offering that service.

And it’s not the only expansion in this area. Costco is planning a new store in Lake Forest, 10 miles north of the proposed gas station. That would be Costco’s 14th Orange County warehouse store, plus its business center in Westminster.

In a statement, Allen's companies said ""we acknowledge McDonald's commitment to investing in Black-owned media properties and increasing access to opportunity. Our differences are behind us.""

Allen had accused McDonald's of ""racial stereotyping"" by not advertising with Black-owned media, and lying when it pledged in 2021 to boost national ad spending with those media to 5% from 2% by 2024.

He said he relied on that pledge when seeking new business from McDonald's, only to be rebuffed. Allen also said his Allen Media Group represented more than 90% of Black-owned media.

This settlement agreement between McDonald's and Entertainment Studios Network/The Weather Group represents a significant resolution of pending litigation that carries several important implications. The structure of this settlement follows a classic corporate dispute resolution pattern that benefits McDonald's in several ways:

The agreement specifically states McDonald's is not admitting any wrongdoing – a standard but crucial protective clause that helps shield the company from reputational damage and potential follow-on litigation. While the underlying claims aren't detailed in the announcement, the statements from both parties suggest the dispute likely centered around advertising practices related to Black-owned media.

The commercial nature of the settlement – continuing to purchase advertising at market value – indicates McDonald's has avoided potentially costly punitive damages or premium pricing arrangements. This market-standard pricing provision suggests the resolution likely won't have material negative financial implications beyond normal advertising expenditures.

From a risk management perspective, this settlement effectively eliminates litigation uncertainty by securing a dismissal of the lawsuit. The confidential nature of the specific terms is standard practice and benefits McDonald's by limiting public disclosure of settlement details, which could otherwise influence other potential plaintiffs.

The mutually respectful public statements from both parties signal an amicable resolution that preserves business relationships – a far better outcome than protracted litigation that could have damaged McDonald's brand equity in relation to diversity commitments.

McDonald's said it has reached a settlement with two companies owned by media mogul Byron Allen that accused the fast-food giant of discriminating against Black-owned media companies.

The fast-food restaurant company said Friday it would continue to purchase advertising from Entertainment Studios Network in a manner that aligns with its advertising strategy, and the network would dismiss its lawsuit against McDonald's.

Under the confidential terms of the agreement, McDonald's isn't admitting any wrongdoing, and the ads sold would be priced at market value, the company said.

Entertainment Studios Network and The Weather Group had filed a complaint against McDonald's in 2021, seeking $10 billion in damages as they alleged the restaurant chain engaged in a ""discriminatory contracting process and refusals to advertise on Plaintiffs' networks on the basis of race.""

Entertainment Studios Network and The Weather Group said they are pleased with the resolution of the lawsuit.

""During the course of this litigation, many of our preconceptions have been clarified, and we acknowledge McDonald's commitment to investing in Black-owned media properties and increasing access to opportunity,"" the companies said.

McDonald's said it is pleased Allen has come to appreciate the company's commitment to inclusion, and that the commercial arrangement is consistent with its other supplier relationships.

As the company continues to evolve its business model and expand its services, investors and analysts are closely watching its performance and future prospects.

Company Overview

Instacart, operating under the corporate name Maplebear Inc. (NASDAQ: ), has established itself as a dominant player in the online grocery delivery market. With a market capitalization of $11.49 billion, the company maintains a ""GREAT"" financial health rating according to InvestingPro analysis, reflecting its strong market position and operational efficiency. Founded in 2012, the company has built an extensive network of partnerships with over 85,000 stores across 1,500 retail banners, covering more than 85% of the U.S. grocery market. This broad reach has positioned Instacart as a critical intermediary between retailers, consumers, and shoppers in the rapidly growing digital grocery space.

The company’s platform facilitates both delivery and pick-up orders from various retail partners, including major chains like Aldi, Costco (NASDAQ: ), and Kroger (NYSE: ). Recently, Instacart expanded its offerings through a partnership with Uber (NYSE: ) to include restaurant deliveries, further diversifying its service portfolio.

Financial Performance

Instacart’s financial performance has shown resilience in a challenging market environment. In its most recent quarterly report, the company reported Gross Transaction (JO: ) Value (GTV) of $8.3 billion, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. Revenue for the quarter reached $852 million, up 11.5% compared to the same period last year. The company maintains impressive gross profit margins of 75.22% and a healthy current ratio of 3.24, demonstrating strong operational efficiency. Want deeper insights into CART’s financial metrics? InvestingPro offers comprehensive analysis with over 10 additional key insights. The company’s EBITDA stood at $227 million, or 2.7% of GTV, demonstrating its ability to maintain profitability while investing in growth initiatives.

Analysts project that Instacart will continue to deliver high single-digit revenue growth, with estimates for fiscal year 2025 revenue ranging from $3.66 billion to $3.71 billion. EBITDA margins are expected to expand, with projections for fiscal year 2025 EBITDA ranging from $981 million to $1.01 billion.

Market Position and Competition

Instacart holds a dominant position in the U.S. online grocery delivery market, with an estimated 70-75% market share among third-party delivery services. The company’s scale and extensive partnerships give it a significant advantage in both small and large basket grocery orders.

However, the competitive landscape is intensifying, with well-capitalized players like Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Walmart (NYSE: ), DoorDash (NASDAQ: ), and Uber expanding their presence in the grocery delivery space. These competitors often have more flexibility to address affordability challenges and may be better positioned to capture market share growth in price-sensitive segments.

Growth Strategies

To maintain its market leadership and drive growth, Instacart is pursuing several strategic initiatives:

1. Affordability: The company is working on making grocery delivery more cost-effective for consumers by offering low-cost delivery options and collaborating with merchants to reduce prices. This initiative aims to drive GTV growth and compete more effectively with lower-priced alternatives.

2. Product Innovation: Instacart recently introduced Smart Shop, a personalized user experience for members that incorporates dietary preferences and shopping habits. This AI-driven personalization is expected to increase customer stickiness and improve retention rates.

3. Expansion of Services: The partnership with Uber to power advertising for its grocery and retail business in the U.S. represents a significant growth opportunity for Instacart’s advertising platform.

4. Capital Allocation: The company has demonstrated a commitment to shareholder value through share repurchases, having bought back $1.4 billion in shares year-to-date and announcing an additional $250 million share repurchase authorization. InvestingPro data reveals that Instacart holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing financial flexibility for continued strategic investments and shareholder returns.

Advertising Revenue

A key focus for Instacart’s growth strategy is the expansion of its advertising business. The company aims to increase its advertising revenue to 4-5% of GTV in the long term, up from the current level of around 2.9%. This growth is expected to be driven by new ad formats, improved targeting capabilities, and the expansion of Instacart’s retail media network (RMN) inventory.

However, some analysts have expressed concerns about the sustainability of this growth, citing persistent budget pressures in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry and increasing competition in the digital advertising space. The company’s ability to navigate these challenges and achieve its advertising revenue targets will be crucial for its long-term profitability and growth.

Bear Case

How might increasing competition impact Instacart’s market share?

Instacart faces significant challenges from well-established players in the e-commerce and delivery space. Companies like Amazon, Walmart, DoorDash, and Uber have greater financial resources and more diversified business models, allowing them to potentially offer more competitive pricing and absorb losses in their grocery delivery segments. This intense competition could lead to market share erosion for Instacart, particularly in price-sensitive customer segments.

Additionally, as these competitors continue to invest in their grocery delivery capabilities and leverage their existing customer bases, Instacart may find it increasingly difficult to maintain its dominant position. The company’s reliance on partnerships with retailers also leaves it vulnerable to disintermediation if these partners decide to develop their own delivery capabilities or exclusive relationships with other platforms.

What challenges does Instacart face in growing its advertising revenue?

While Instacart has set ambitious targets for its advertising business, several factors could impede its growth in this area. The CPG industry, which forms a significant portion of Instacart’s advertising client base, is experiencing budget pressures that may limit the growth of ad spending. This could make it challenging for Instacart to achieve its long-term goal of increasing advertising revenue to 4-5% of GTV.

Moreover, the digital advertising landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with major tech companies and retailers expanding their own advertising platforms. This competition could lead to downward pressure on ad rates and make it more difficult for Instacart to attract and retain advertisers. The company’s ability to demonstrate superior ROI for advertisers and develop innovative ad products will be crucial in overcoming these challenges.

Bull Case

How can Instacart leverage its scale to improve profitability?

Instacart’s extensive network of retail partnerships and its dominant market position provide significant opportunities for improving profitability. The company’s scale allows it to optimize its operations, including order batching and routing, which can lead to improved efficiency and lower costs per delivery. This operational leverage could translate into higher margins as the business grows.

Furthermore, Instacart’s vast trove of consumer data and shopping insights can be leveraged to enhance its advertising platform, potentially commanding premium rates from advertisers seeking targeted access to consumers at the point of purchase. By continuously improving its ad targeting capabilities and expanding its ad inventory, Instacart could drive significant growth in high-margin advertising revenue.

What opportunities exist for Instacart to expand its services and increase customer retention?

Instacart has several avenues for service expansion and customer retention improvement. The recent introduction of Smart Shop, which offers personalized shopping experiences, demonstrates the company’s ability to innovate and enhance customer value. By continuing to develop AI-driven features and personalized offerings, Instacart can increase customer engagement and loyalty.

The company’s partnership with Uber to include restaurant deliveries opens up new growth opportunities beyond traditional grocery delivery. This diversification could help Instacart capture a larger share of customers’ food-related spending and increase order frequency. Additionally, by expanding its enterprise solutions for retailers, such as white-label delivery services and in-store technology like Caper Carts, Instacart can deepen its relationships with retail partners and create additional revenue streams.

This year’s Super Bowl reached 127 million viewers, and a 30-second ad placement cost about $8 million.
Detert told Campaign that to get the same reach as the Super Bowl, advertisers can spend anywhere between $450,000 and $2 million.
The campaign demonstrates the cost with a supporting out-of-home campaign stating, “Get Super Bowl reach, for the price of 25 Cannes passes.""
“We think that there is a play for not just the big moments like the Super Bowl to amplify, but really having an always-on campaign with creators.","CANNES, FRANCE: Publicis Groupe’s annual Cannes campaign aims to be the most famous lion on the Croisette by proving the power of influencer marketing for a “fraction of the cost” of Super Bowl ads and other traditional media placements.

The “tongue-in-cheek” campaign will begin on Monday, with two wildlife influencers – @shandorlarenty (9.3 million followers on TikTok, 596,000 followers on Instagram) and @Pubity (40 million followers on Instagram, 17 million on TikTok) – sharing a joint post featuring a lion.

Using Publicis’ recent acquisitions of Influential and Captiv8, the campaign will begin engaging other influencers using the platform and its technology to share, talk about and remix the video.

A live “Lion Tracker” at Influential Beach will monitor the lion’s growing audience in real time.

This year’s Super Bowl reached 127 million viewers, and a 30-second ad placement cost about $8 million.

Ryan Detert, Influential’s chief executive, has predicted that the campaign will surpass this within the first 48 hours, using the technology and platforms provided by Influential and Captiv8.

Detert told Campaign that to get the same reach as the Super Bowl, advertisers can spend anywhere between $450,000 and $2 million.

The campaign demonstrates the cost with a supporting out-of-home campaign stating, “Get Super Bowl reach, for the price of 25 Cannes passes."" The billboards will be seen in Nice airport and on the Croisette throughout the festival with a QR code that leads to an interactive platform showing what reach can be gained from different amounts of spend.

It compares four Wall Street Journal full-page ads, a Times Square takeover and a 10-second big game spot, showing how much reach the equivalent spend would get via the Influential and Captiv8 platforms with influencer marketing.

Iterations of the campaign show other “Cannes currencies” including “...for the cost of 10 NYC-Nice business class tickets” and “...170 of the 2,400 awards entries,"" taking a dig at the awards entries that some “flood the system with to rack up metal,"" the agency said.

Publicis Groupe chief strategy officer Carla Serrano told Campaign that the idea aims to show how much brands are spending in Cannes, but also how cost efficient it could be.

While the campaign is putting the power of influencers in competition with traditional media, Detert argued that the point is to prove it as an “and” as opposed to an “or.""

“We think that there is a play for not just the big moments like the Super Bowl to amplify, but really having an always-on campaign with creators. They become your media channel,” he told Campaign.

Serrano added that clients might feel that Cannes is an “indulgence” in a year of economic challenges for businesses. This chimes with group chief executive Arthur Sadoun’s comments calling for a “different approach” to Cannes.

Sadoun said the festival should be providing brands with “immediate” business solutions rather than “AI theory” or “celebrating creativity for its own sake."" This campaign intends to provide practical business solutions for brands.

“At Cannes this year, we’re focused on turning AI hype into business upside – with practical, Monday-ready solutions our clients can put to work immediately,"" he said.

Last year, Publicis’ mocking ""taking the BS out of AI"" Cannes campaign caused controversy, upsetting its agency rivals. The Paris-based holding company's primary PR network is MSL.

Serrano said this year’s campaign is “less provocative” and intends to be “useful”.",https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/150/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/ORP/publiciscannes2025-uwp-cuk.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 15:49:55.741635

The coffee giant is making big moves to get back to its former glory, as the CEO says ""it's time for us to lead again"".

Starbucks is following the trends these days, and is joining the protein coffee game to prove it.

The company is currently testing out a new cold foam option that adds 15 grams of protein to its drinks, along with an unsweetened protein powder.

The new drink being trialled is a sugar-free vanilla latte with banana foam, which is the thing that contains the protein.

Starbucks is testing out the drink at 5 locations currently, and a potential full launch date has not yet been confirmed.

CEO Brian Niccol is being upfront about where his innovation is leading him, and which direction he is going in.

He said: ""It's on trend. It's delicious.""

The CEO also told Axios: ""I was watching people coming to our stores, they would get three shots of espresso over ice.

""And in some cases, they pull their own protein powder out of their bag, or in other cases, they have a protein drink, like a Fair Life and they'd pour that into their drink.

""I'm like, well, wait a second, we can make this experience better for them.

""The good news is now I think we're right on trend, and we can do it I think arguably better than anybody else.""

Other companies, like the coffee chain Dutch Bros, have already jumped on the high-protein train.

It comes as more and more members of Gen Z show an interest in health beverages.

CEO INNOVATION

Brian Niccol has been vocal about the innovative new steps he wants Starbucks to be taking.

Brian Niccol has declared that it is time to ""lead in warm, welcoming coffee houses.

""We’re going to lead in innovation. Innovation to our menu.""

Earlier this year, he oversaw 30% cuts to both beverages and food in an effort to ""clear the noise out both in food and beverage menus.""

Niccol later justified himself in an earnings call: ""That opens the door for better innovation that will hopefully resonate even more so for our customers.

""We’ve taken steps to refocus the business, our mission and our marketing to better align with our identity as a coffee company.""

In place of the cuts, Starbucks is adding new items to its menu for the summer, including two new bakery items.

These include a raspberry croissant filled with jam and a double chocolate cookie topped with flaky sea salt.

The drinks menu is also being updated with new offerings and new twists on familiar favorites.

A new coffee, dubbed the Starbucks 1971 Roast, is coming to Starbucks spots in the US and Canada this winter.

The drink offers a dark roast blend of beans from Sumatra, Colombia and Brazil.

Starbucks is also celebrating the 30th anniversary of its iconic Frappuccino with the Strato Frappuccino.

Strato, which means ""layer"" in Italian, adds a cloud of cold foam on top of any Frappuccino flavor.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/04/2016-starbucks-corp-scheduled-release-720864610.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-06-13 15:50:09.217116

An early indication that providers now have a strong voice in federal antitrust matters came in March, when the Justice Department sided with the health care providers, rather than the health plans, in connection with a big wave of health care provider antitrust suits.

Regulators could give hints about their current thinking if they include many employers, benefits advisors or representatives from benefits organizations on the listening session agendas or if most of the speakers are representatives from the pharmacy, biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturing sectors.

Her observation was reflected in the retailer’s first-quarter results, which showed sales at the Toronto-headquartered company rose 6.7 per cent to $40 million.

Article content

Much of the boost came from the company’s direct-to-consumer business, which includes its retail stores and e-commerce operations.

Sales from that division totalled $34.6 million for the period ended May 3, up from $31.4 million a year earlier. The segment also saw comparable sales growth of 14.1 per cent.

Roach attributed the increase to existing products resonating with customers who she said responded well to the company’s latest releases, too.

The loss amounted to 20 cents per share for the quarter compared with a loss of 22 cents per share in the same quarter last year.

The results fit Roots’ usual cadence, Roach said. Typically, the company generates 30 per cent of its sales in the first half of the year, when it tends to generate a loss. The back half usually brings profit.

This year Roots has been working to close “underperforming” stores and reallocate resources to “high potential” locations where the brand is resonating and there are opportunities for traffic growth.

Customer feedback and in-store analytics have also pushed the company to give some stores a makeover that has introduced new layouts, digital tools and modern materials and finishes into flexible fixtures meant to help the brand transition between seasons.

JNJ-4496, formerly known as C-CAR039, is a dual-targeting CAR T designed to bind to both CD19 and CD20 antigens — two cell surface proteins commonly expressed on malignant B-cells. This design, including a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, is intended to enhance binding strength and persistence, also potentially addressing common mechanisms of resistance in relapsed or refractory disease.

In the Phase 1b dose confirmation study (NCT05421663) in patients with R/R LBCL, data at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) were reported in patients with a median follow-up of 4 months. Results informed a RP2D of JNJ-4496 at 75 million CAR+ T-cells. Among the 22 patients in the RP2D group where efficacy was assessed, those who received one prior line of therapy (n=10) had an objective response rate (ORR) of 100 percent and a complete response rate (CRR) of 80 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI), 69, 100). In the patients who had received two or more prior lines of therapy (n=12), the ORR was 92 percent and the CRR was 75 percent (95 percent CI, 62, 100).1

“There is a pressing need to continue advancing therapies for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Only about 40 percent of patients have long-term remissions with currently available single-antigen-targeting CD19 CAR T therapies,” said Krish Patel*, M.D., Director of Lymphoma Research, Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI), and principal study investigator. “The data presented today show encouraging clinical activity and promising safety, and represent a step forward in delivering a potential new treatment option to patients living with the most common type of aggressive lymphoma.”

Within the RP2D safety group (n=25), 52 percent of patients (n=13) received two or more prior lines of therapy, and 56 percent (n=14) received bridging therapy. In the RP2D cohort studied, no cases of Grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome were observed. Two patients had immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), one Grade 1 and one Grade 3. The Grade 3 event occurred in a patient with central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Overall, 84 percent of patients (n=21) had Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and 28 percent (n=7) reported serious TEAEs. The most common Grade 3/4 TEAE was neutropenia, a reduction in white blood cells (72 percent). One patient experienced a Grade 3 infection.1

“We’re really excited to share the first results for our dual-targeting anti-CD19/CD20 CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, underscoring our more than decade-long commitment to addressing unmet needs for patients with B-cell malignancies,” said Jeffrey Infante, M.D., Vice President of Early Clinical Development and Translational Research at Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. “As we continue to unlock the full potential of CAR T-cell therapies through novel next-generation approaches, these promising data reinforce earlier long-term findings and highlight the potential of JNJ-4496 to improve outcomes for patients.”

These data are advancing our pipeline of CAR T therapies for the treatment of B-cell malignancies and are an extension of our worldwide collaboration and licensing agreement initiated with AbelZeta Inc. (formerly Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc.) in 2023 to develop and commercialize next-generation CAR T-cell therapies (excluding Greater China). A Phase 1 study for C-CAR039 was conducted in China for the treatment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (predominantly LBCL).3 Johnson & Johnson is also evaluating the safety and efficacy of this asset (known as JNJ-4496 outside of Greater China) through a separate study involving a global patient population.4 In addition to the oral presentation of JNJ-4496 at EHA, the global clinical study data will be presented at the 2025 International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma from June 17—21.

About large B-cell lymphoma

Large B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a blood cancer that originates in the lymphatic system, arising from abnormal B cells, a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies to fight infections.2 The malignant cells grow rapidly in lymph nodes or other organs and can spread quickly throughout the body.2 These abnormal cells are larger than normal, healthy B-cells.2 Diffuse (D) LBCL is the most common and aggressive type where cells are spread out (diffuse) rather than grouped together when they are examined under a microscope.2 DLBCL accounts for approximately 40 percent of all NHL cases globally and is estimated to have 150,000 new cases diagnosed each year.5 While some patients respond to initial treatment, up to 40 percent can relapse or become refractory to therapy.6 LBCL and DLBCL patients often face limited treatment options and a poor prognosis, highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapies. Common symptoms include rapidly growing lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.2

In an increasingly digital world where e-commerce is booming and consumers expect faster, more reliable delivery services, logistics companies are under immense pressure to innovate. Two of the biggest names in the logistics industry in the United States, UPS (United Parcel Service) and USPS (United States Postal Service), are rising to the challenge in remarkable ways.

Both organizations have embraced advanced technology, automation, and sustainable practices to enhance efficiency and meet evolving demands. From AI-powered routing systems to digitized delivery experiences, UPS and USPS are no longer just mail and package carriers—they are now essential players in the world of smart logistics.

The Evolution of Logistics in the Tech Age

The logistics industry has come a long way from the days of paper tracking and manual sorting. With the rise of Industry 4.0, which emphasizes automation, data exchange, and smart systems, logistics companies are now integrating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), IoT (Internet of Things), and robotic automation into their daily operations.

UPSers and USPS Liteblue are at different ends of the innovation spectrum—UPS being a private company with vast resources and USPS being a public institution with a mandate to serve every American. Yet both are adapting impressively to the digital age.

UPS: Leveraging AI, Automation, and Advanced Logistics

UPS has been a pioneer in leveraging AI and data analytics to transform delivery operations. One of the most notable advancements is ORION (On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation), an AI-powered system that analyzes vast data points to determine the most efficient delivery routes.

Key Innovations at UPS:

ORION Technology: Saves an estimated 10 million gallons of fuel annually and reduces CO2 emissions by optimizing delivery routes.

Automated Sorting Facilities: High-tech hubs with robotic arms and scanners that can process thousands of packages per hour.

Drone Deliveries: Through UPS Flight Forward, UPS has received FAA approval to operate delivery drones in selected areas, primarily for medical and urgent deliveries.

Blockchain for Tracking: UPS has invested in blockchain systems to enhance supply chain transparency and improve tracking for high-value shipments.

Electric Vehicle (EV) Fleet: In an effort to cut carbon emissions, UPS is investing in thousands of electric delivery vehicles and sustainable practices.

These developments are not just about speed—they’re about precision, customer satisfaction, and environmental responsibility.

USPS: Reinventing Public Postal Services Through Tech

Often viewed as a more traditional organization, USPS has quietly been adopting significant technological upgrades in recent years. While their budget and operational model differ from private companies like UPS, the USPS still plays a critical role in delivering to every American address—something no private courier can match.

Notable USPS Innovations:

LiteBlue USPS Portal: An internal online platform that enables over 600,000 USPS employees to manage schedules, access benefits, and stay informed.

Informed Delivery: A popular USPS service that sends users digital previews of incoming mail and packages. It bridges the gap between physical and digital communication.

Package Tracking and Notifications: USPS has upgraded its tracking systems, allowing real-time updates for customers and businesses alike.

EV Transition Plan: USPS is set to deploy 66,000 electric delivery vehicles by 2028 as part of its green initiative.

Automated Package Sorting Centers: Upgraded infrastructure includes high-speed sorters and scanning systems to improve delivery times and reduce errors.

USPS’s strength lies in its infrastructure and nationwide reach. The organization has over 31,000 retail locations and covers every ZIP code in the U.S.—including remote and rural areas where private carriers may not operate.

The Perfect Storm: E-commerce, COVID-19, and Changing Expectations

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation across nearly every industry, and logistics was no exception. USPS and UPS were both tested during the pandemic, having to scale operations rapidly, manage workforce shortages, and deal with supply chain disruptions.

What emerged was a realization: Logistics is now a frontline industry, and technology is its backbone. UPS responded with enhanced tracking tools for businesses, while USPS doubled down on contactless delivery and route optimization.

UPS and USPS: Rivals or Collaborators?

While many see UPS and USPS as competitors, the reality is more complex. In fact, UPS often partners with USPS through services like UPS SurePost, where UPS handles the first leg of delivery and USPS completes the last mile, especially in remote or hard-to-reach areas.

This public-private collaboration showcases a future where logistics companies work together to maximize efficiency and customer reach. By combining the best of both worlds—UPS’s technology and USPS’s infrastructure—they can collectively raise the standard for delivery services in the U.S.

The Future: AI, Smart Cities, and Beyond

Looking ahead, the future of logistics will be defined by:

Smart Cities: Integrated systems where traffic lights, roads, and even sidewalks interact with delivery vehicles for maximum efficiency.

AI-Driven Predictive Logistics: Systems that forecast demand and weather patterns to optimize deliveries before problems arise.

Augmented Reality for Sorting and Inventory: UPS and USPS can both benefit from AR glasses that help workers scan, sort, and locate items faster.

Robotics in Warehouses: Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) will increasingly take over repetitive tasks in both private and public logistics hubs.

Customer Personalization: From customized delivery times to real-time tracking, customer experience will be key.

Both UPS and USPS are investing heavily in these technologies, ensuring they remain not just relevant, but revolutionary.

Conclusion: Logistics as the Pulse of the Digital Economy

UPS and USPS, though different in structure and approach, are both vital to the U.S. economy. Their willingness to embrace technology, rethink traditional models, and collaborate where needed makes them prime examples of 21st-century logistics evolution.",https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/young-delivery-woman-using-mobile-phone-while-going-through-dispatch-list-office-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 15:50:30.411305

The immediate market reaction has been swift: oil prices jumped over $5 per barrel, or seven per cent, to around $73 per barrel. For North American construction professionals, this development signals another round of inflationary pressures, especially for steel and aluminum.

Energy prices and metal costs: A direct link

Steel and aluminum production are highly energy-intensive. Any significant spike in energy costs, driven by oil price volatility, translates directly into higher input costs for these essential construction materials.

ConstructConnect Chief Economist Michael Guckes said, “Industry concerns about managing steel input costs to construction just became more complex with the latest clashes in the Middle East.”

Guckes added, “The data show a long-running, tight connection between oil prices and energy-intensive metal production costs. The jump in oil prices in response to the events in Iran on June 13 could quickly worsen an already difficult picture for metal prices.”

Tariffs compound the pressure

The latest round of 50 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, announced earlier this month, is already reverberating through the North American market. These tariffs are expected to raise costs across a wide range of products, from vehicles and appliances to building materials and construction projects.

What construction professionals can expect

Given the current situation, construction professionals should consider the following:

Prepare for higher structural steel and aluminum costs, driven by increased energy prices and an evolving tariff environment.

Expect a worsening potential for project delays or budget adjustments as suppliers adjust pricing to reflect rising input costs.

Anticipate increased volatility in the metals market, which could make procurement planning and risk management more challenging.

Investing.com -- Argus Research downgraded McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) Corp to Hold from Buy, citing weaker customer traffic amid resistance to years of menu price increases and signs of slower earnings growth.

Analyst cuts 2025 earnings estimate to $12.30 a share from $13.20, warning that McDonald’s core lower-income customer base is pushing back after a period of repeated price hikes.

The stock is trading at 24.6 times his revised 2025 forecast, a premium to peers Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), which trade at lower multiples.

While McDonald’s has outperformed broader restaurant peers so far this year, Argus sees limited near-term upside.

Same-store sales in the U.S. fell 3.6% in the first quarter, more than double the decline analysts had expected.

Global same-store sales also missed expectations, reflecting weaker demand in key markets such as the U.K.

Analyst noted that international sales were mixed, with strength in the Middle East and Japan partly offsetting softness elsewhere. Operating income declined to $2.65 billion from $2.74 billion a year earlier.

Despite the downgrade, Argus sees McDonald’s international reach, consistent dividend growth, and share buybacks as positives for long-term investors.

The firm now expects 2026 earnings of $13.30 a share, down from a prior estimate of $13.80, and cut its long-term growth forecast to 8% from 10%.

McDonald’s shares are up 4.3% so far this year.

• Anthem does not cover the same services or provide the same payment as when Medicare seniors are covered directly by Medicare.
• Anthem and other commercial insurers have made billions off the backs of seniors, health care providers and the federal government, and must come to the table and agree to pay for the care seniors need.
“These issues are deeply connected,” Dr. Jason Row, chief value transformation officer for Parkview Health, said.
What patients can do Parkview Health said for now, and until July 31, patients covered by Anthem should continue seeking care as usual at Parkview hospitals, facilities, and physician offices.","FORT WAYNE — As the July 31 deadline to finalize a new agreement with Anthem approaches, Parkview Health announced June 12 that it is urging Anthem to take ""meaningful action"" to resolve critical issues that it says are ""blocking progress."" In response, Anthem said Parkview Health's claims are ""inaccurate,"" that it is the most expensive health system in Indiana, and Parkview needs to reduce its prices.

Here are Parkview Health's claims in its own words in a news release that it said Anthem needs to resolve:

• Access to care for seniors with Medicare Advantage plans at fair reimbursement.

• Anthem does not cover the same services or provide the same payment as when Medicare seniors are covered directly by Medicare. These delays in care and denials of coverage, which traditional Medicare would have covered, harm patients and lead to unfunded care that employers in our community must subsidize.

• Anthem and other commercial insurers have made billions off the backs of seniors, health care providers and the federal government, and must come to the table and agree to pay for the care seniors need.

• Fair rates for services provided in non-hospital settings that are reimbursed typically at 60% of hospital-based care. Parkview is committed to expanding its network of low-cost ambulatory care sites but needs to be paid fairly when procedures are safely moved out of hospital settings.

• Anthem’s latest proposal continues contract language that permits delayed payments, retroactive denials, and excessive prior authorization requirements that prevent patients, particularly seniors, from getting the care their physicians order. In addition, Anthem proposes to reimburse Parkview for care provided to Medicare Advantage members at rates below Medicare. Anthem’s underfunding of government patients simply pads their profits by shifting costs to local employers and patients.

“These issues are deeply connected,” Dr. Jason Row, chief value transformation officer for Parkview Health, said. “Anthem is enforcing administrative policies that delay and deny care, especially for seniors. We cannot continue a partnership that jeopardizes access and quality, and shifts costs to local employers.”

Over the past five years, Parkview said it has taken aggressive steps to make care more affordable, absorbing over $1.1 billion in rate reductions from commercial insurers. ""In the current negotiation, Parkview has offered lower commercial hospital rates than it currently receives,"" it said in the written statement. ""This means Anthem would pay Parkview less for services in 2028 than it did in 2020. Despite this, Anthem has not addressed the fact that Medicare Advantage payments are significantly below industry standards, shifting costs to employers for government patients.""

“Unless Anthem returns to the table with fair, workable solutions on both patient access and rates, we will have to consider all options, including exiting their Medicare Advantage network,” Row added. “That is not something we want to do, but Anthem’s lack of urgency and unwillingness to negotiate in good faith gives us no other choice.”

Parkview said it ""remains fully committed to avoiding disruptions in patient care, if Anthem shares a reasonable proposal. However, Parkview has proactively prepared resources to support patients in transitioning their care should Anthem choose to exclude Parkview from its network. This includes working with other Medicare Advantage plans that patients may choose to switch to and offering a best-in-market commercial plan — Signature Care EPO Plus – at rates 25% below those offered in Anthem open network products.""

Asked to respond to Parkview's claims, Anthem spokesman Jeff Blunt said in an email, ""Parkview is making inaccurate statements in an attempt to distract our community from its long history of over-charging patients covered by employer sponsored health plans. Currently, Parkview stands as the most expensive health system in Indiana — costing Northeast Indiana patients and businesses $75 million every year in additional health care costs compared to other leading providers across the state. We’re asking them to reduce their hospital prices to match those of Indiana’s other top health systems. At the same time, we've offered Parkview significant payment increases for doctors and specialists to support continued investment in top-tier medical professionals for our community.

""As we have for months, Anthem remains committed to negotiating in good faith to reach a new agreement that keeps Parkview in our network at affordable prices for our members and employers.""

Anthem has the following website to provide updates on the negotiations: https://tinyurl.com/3x4y7wfx.

This is a repeat of tense negotiations that last took place in 2020 before both sides came to an agreement.

Anthem sought in 2020 to end its contract with Parkview over what it felt were Parkview’s “unsustainable prices that have the potential to put healthcare out of reach for the average person,” it said at the time. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the contract was extended twice before an agreement was reached.

Anthem had cited an independent study in 2019 by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research institute, that found that the costs Parkview charges private health plans, like Anthem, were nearly four times higher (395%) relative to the prices allowed by Medicare.

Parkview in 2019 responded to the RAND study results by saying that hospital pricing is more complicated than just a dollar amount on a bill, saying in a written statement, ""As we talk with employers across the region, they understand that quality and quantity of care must be considered as well.""

What patients can do

Parkview Health said for now, and until July 31, patients covered by Anthem should continue seeking care as usual at Parkview hospitals, facilities, and physician offices.

It said patients with Anthem may consider the following steps to ensure that Parkview remains in Anthem’s network:

These cities join the growing list of communities where the partnership is making produce more accessible — and helping families build healthy habits that last.
Instacart's partnership with PHA began with a shared belief: everyone deserves access to affordable, nutritious food.
""But we know that accessing fresh food isn’t always easy,"" said Dani Dudeck, chief corporate affairs officer at Instacart.","Instacart is expanding its work with Partnership for a Healthier America to bring the Good Food at Home program, powered by Instacart Health Fresh Funds, to nearly 1,000 additional families across the country.

Starting this month, Instacart expanded the Good Food at Home program with PHA and new local partners to Detroit; Sacramento, CA; and Washington, DC. These cities join the growing list of communities where the partnership is making produce more accessible — and helping families build healthy habits that last. This next iteration of the Good Food at Home program will extend from three months to eight months to better understand how sustained access can inform long-term healthy eating habits.

Instacart's partnership with PHA began with a shared belief: everyone deserves access to affordable, nutritious food. ""But we know that accessing fresh food isn’t always easy,"" said Dani Dudeck, chief corporate affairs officer at Instacart. ""For families living in food deserts and those without reliable transportation, getting fresh groceries can too often feel out of reach. When we began our partnership, we made a joint, nationwide commitment to connect under-resourced communities with 10 million servings of produce by the end of 2025.""

To address this problem, Instacart teamed up with PHA to launch Good Food at Home supported by Fresh Funds — grocery stipends that participating families can use on Instacart to buy fruits and vegetables with delivery straight to their door. Instacart reaches more than 98 percent of U.S. households — including 95 percent in food deserts — helping remove key barriers to access to nutritious food.

In Detroit, Washington, DC, and Sacramento, each participating household will receive $80 in monthly Instacart Health Fresh Funds along with an Instacart+ membership, enabling them to shop for fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables and canned vegetables from a wide array of local retailers available through the Instacart marketplace. And, for the first time, participants in these cities will receive their Fresh Funds for eight months instead of three allowing the companies to better understand how sustained access to healthy foods can shape long-term habits.

The latest iteration of the Good Food at Home program is designed to fill the critical summer and holiday hunger gaps, when school meal programs are often unavailable to the kids that depend on them. And while the structure is consistent across cities, each local program is tailored to meet the unique needs of the community through partnerships with trusted nonprofit organizations.",https://theproducenews.com/sites/default/files/2025-06/ih_0.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 16:15:41.857414
ID3,Albertsons,2025-06-13 17:12:11+00:00,San Luis Obispo Tribune,Southern California grocery workers could strike. Would it impact SLO County stores?,Kaytlyn Leslie,,,,,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/business/article308524375.html,"UFCW Local 770 represents more than 45,000 workers across the Southern California region, including over 20,000 grocery members in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties.
If a strike occurred in SLO County, it could affect up to eight stores — Albertsons, Vons and Ralphs locations — from Paso Robles to Nipomo.
If a deal is not met, a strike could include workers from the eight San Luis Obispo County grocery stores, according to union representative Heather Rutman.
Albertsons operates two of its namesake grocery stores in San Luis Obispo County, one at 189 Niblick Drive in Paso Robles and the other at 730 Quintana Road in Morro Bay.
The company also operates four local Vons stores: 3900 Broad St., San Luis Obispo; 7135 El Camino Real, Atascadero; 1758 W. Grand Ave., Grover Beach; and 520 W. Tefft St., Nipomo.","Thousands of grocery store workers across Southern California — including in San Luis Obispo County — could go on strike as their union pushes for a new contract amid concerns of a “severe staffing crisis.”

According to a news release from United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770, members began strike preparations Thursday at union headquarters in Los Angeles. UFCW Local 770 represents more than 45,000 workers across the Southern California region, including over 20,000 grocery members in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties.

According to the release, members authorized their bargaining team to call for an Unfair Labor Practice strike of Kroger and Albertsons, “which have prevented workers from securing a fair contract.”

The strike would include workers at the two major grocery chains’ subsidiaries, such as Ralphs, Vons and Pavilions, according to the release.

If a strike occurred in SLO County, it could affect up to eight stores — Albertsons, Vons and Ralphs locations — from Paso Robles to Nipomo.

“Kroger and Albertsons have pushed us to this point by trying to intimidate us into accepting less than the fair contract we deserve,” union bargaining team member Paszion Horner-Smith said in the release. “This fight for a fair contract isn’t just about us; it’s also about every customer affected by empty shelves, long lines and having to scan and bag their own groceries because these companies refuse to fairly negotiate around adequate staffing at the bargaining table.”

Why are SoCal grocery workers threatening strike?

According to the release, the union’s bargaining team has been negotiating with Kroger and Albertsons for a new contract for the past four months.

UFCW Local 770 said it hopes to obtain a contract that would address “several issues impacting store operations, working conditions and customer service, including the severe staffing crisis.”

“The companies have dismissed workers’ proposals, falsely calling their concerns ‘anecdotal’ rather than solving real problems,” the release said.

The local chapter of the union said the companies also broke labor laws “through unlawful surveillance, interrogations, threats and retaliation against union members.”

“This strike authorization vote sends a clear message: The companies must stop their illegal tactics,” the UFCW 770 bargaining team said in the release.

The local chapter’s efforts are part of a broader national push, with workers from two other UFCW chapters announcing similar plans to prepare for Kroger and Albertsons strikes in Washington and Colorado, according to the release.

“From the Rockies to the Cascades to the Hollywood Hills, nearly 65,000 grocery workers across the Western U.S. are united,” Seattle union member Shawn McGee said in the release. “We are fed up with being disrespected by the grocery companies, and our customers have our backs.”

According to the release, if workers from all three chapters strike at the same time, it could be “the largest grocery strike in modern history.”

When reached for comment Thursday, a Ralph’s spokesperson told The Tribune it remains engaged in bargaining with the union “because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption.”

“Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement and continued investment in industry-leading healthcare and a pension,” the spokesperson said. “These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer.”

The representative continued: “We remain committed to good faith bargaining that rewards our hardworking associates and keeps groceries affordable for our customers.”

A request for comment from Albertsons media representatives was not immediately returned Thursday evening.

What happens next in SLO County?

A strike is far from a sure thing.

After its members “overwhelmingly” voted Wednesday to authorize a strike, the Southern California UFCW chapter said it expects to hold practice strikes in both Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo counties next week.

Though the majority will happen in Los Angeles County, locally, a practice strike will be held June 20 at the Albertsons at 189 Niblick Drive in Paso Robles, according to the release. The event will last from 10 a.m. to noon.

Negotiations are expected to resume for a final time June 25-27.

If a deal is not met, a strike could include workers from the eight San Luis Obispo County grocery stores, according to union representative Heather Rutman.

Albertsons operates two of its namesake grocery stores in San Luis Obispo County, one at 189 Niblick Drive in Paso Robles and the other at 730 Quintana Road in Morro Bay. The company also operates four local Vons stores: 3900 Broad St., San Luis Obispo; 7135 El Camino Real, Atascadero; 1758 W. Grand Ave., Grover Beach; and 520 W. Tefft St., Nipomo.

Meanwhile, there are two Ralphs in the county, one at 201 Madonna Road in San Luis Obispo and the other at 1240 Los Osos Valley Road in Los Osos.

“He happened to mention that he and Ben Affleck were starting an advertising agency within Artists Equity.
“We were given the opportunity to brief the team and let them know the situation with Stella Artois in the US,” Bell said.
The first idea they brought to us became the Super Bowl spot.
And then, as an ancillary business to that – a very important one – we have the advertising agency.","“There are certainly some shifts in consumer preferences that are happening right now,” he said, acknowledging the rising interest in low and no-alcohol alternatives. “But beer as a category is very resilient globally and in the US. Stella has been a staple in the industry here for quite some time and we’re just very excited to continue to be a brand that elevates occasions and really plays a big part in culture.”

Bell, who celebrated his ninth anniversary with AB InBev this week, takes a broad view of the brand’s role in the market: “I focus on marketing, but I also lead all the commercial initiatives – working with our sales teams on everything from the liquid and the packaging all the way to the advertising you see in the Super Bowl. I like to think of it as more general management than just brand management.”

And that’s where a Hollywood-powered creative partnership comes in.

How Stella teamed up with Matt and Ben

Stella’s award-winning campaign was born out of a decade-long relationship with Hollywood royalty Matt Damon, who first partnered with the AB Inbev-owned brand through his charitable foundation Water.org. It was during a previous campaign in 2023, Bell recalls, that Damon mentioned something intriguing.

“Matt was generous enough to be part of a program we had called ‘Let’s Do Dinner’ back in 2023,” said Bell. “He happened to mention that he and Ben Affleck were starting an advertising agency within Artists Equity. They were working with Dunkin’ and said they were excited to maybe work with Stella because of Matt’s relationship.”

That conversation set in motion a rare creative scenario – an agency pitch that hit the mark from the very first slide. “We were given the opportunity to brief the team and let them know the situation with Stella Artois in the US,” Bell said. “They came with an amazing idea for a campaign. The first idea they brought to us became the Super Bowl spot. That just doesn’t happen.”

Inside Artists Equity: not your typical agency

Founded by Good Will Hunting writers and actors Damon and Affleck in 2023, Artists Equity is more than an ad agency. It operates as a fully vertically integrated film production studio with an advertising arm focused on helping brands create culturally resonant work.

“Yes, we’re not your typical agency,” explained its president of advertising, Josh Jefferis. “We’re a film production studio with a slate of scripted and unscripted films every year. And then, as an ancillary business to that – a very important one – we have the advertising agency. We have two clients right now: Stella and Dunkin’. We want to help iconic brands like those take really big swings in culture and partner with them to do so.”

The business model gives Artists Equity a cinematic edge. With A-list creative talent in the mix, both behind and in front of the camera, they bring a distinct entertainment-first lens to brand storytelling.

Making ‘David & Dave’: a Super Bowl winner

That cinematic sensibility was on full display in Stella Artois’s David & Dave Super Bowl spot, which paired Matt Damon with English soccer legend David Beckham in a playful, self-aware ad that leaned into their public personas and friendship. But it was what happened behind the scenes that left the deepest impression on Bell.

“I’ve been a fan of Ben and Matt for a very long time. David, I had met previously – he’d been working with Stella going back to 2024. But working with Ben, watching his creative process and watching him coach David, who hadn’t done much acting, to be a part of a Super Bowl commercial was just amazing to watch and be a part of,” Bell said.

“Matt Damon was also helping David. Watching his process with Ben – they’ve worked together for so long – it was just a really amazing experience and very enlightening for me and the Stella team.

Dunkin’ and Stella: two brands, one cultural mindset

On the surface, Stella and Dunkin’ could hardly be more different – one an upscale European lager, the other a blue-collar American coffee chain. But for Artists Equity, both brands share a crucial common thread.

“Actually, they’re quite similar,” said Jefferis. “They don’t kind of take themselves too seriously, they’re part of culture. I don’t think there’s necessarily a house style or tone. The ability to have the intelligent wit of a Stella or maybe the more pushing-the-edge irreverence of Dunkin’ is a nice range for the team to flex their writing and creative skills.”

That flexibility has already paid off in accolades. At The Drum Awards for Marketing Americas 2025 in New York, Stella and Artists Equity won the Advertising category for ‘David & Dave,’ while Dunkin’ took home the Food & Beverage award.

For Bell, that kind of recognition is about celebrating collaboration and creativity: “I take advantage of every opportunity to work with those guys. This is easily the most fun part of the job and getting to celebrate that and win some awards with the team is amazing.”

For Stella, culture is the strategy

As consumer tastes evolve and beer’s dominance is challenged by everything from hard seltzers to sober-curious movements, Bell is betting on Stella’s ability to stay culturally relevant through smart, entertainment-driven storytelling. “We have a very long history being part of entertainment and culture,” he said. “The ‘David and Dave’ campaign has really resonated with consumers and we’re looking forward to doing more of that. We’ll do our part to grow the category and get consumers more excited about beer.”

The company opened its first department store in Winnipeg, at the corner of Main Street and York Avenue, in 1881.
Also in 1926, HBC established a museum in Winnipeg, a showcase of its collection, other fur-trade materials and HBC lore gathered over the centuries.
For many years, Winnipeg remained something of a Canadian nerve centre for the London, England-based company.
The association has vocally supported the AMC and criticized HBC’s auction plan.","For a once-proud retail giant — built on a fur-trading empire so far-reaching it was known simply as The Company — it was an unceremonious end.

In March, after years of hemorrhaging at the bottom line, the Hudson’s Bay Company announced it would begin liquidating its stores across the country, with the doomsday clock striking zero on June 1.

Shoppers driven by nostalgia and bargains flocked to stores for all things striped red, green, yellow and blue, the now iconic colour pattern of the three-and-a-half-century-old institution.

Savvier hunters, however, are still waiting on the sidelines and eyeing bigger prizes — HBC’s private collection of 1,700 art pieces, 2,700 artifacts and even the company’s Royal Charter are all slated for auction to help pay off creditors.

The 355-year-old document not only birthed Canada’s oldest company, it effectively laid a foundation for colonial Canada itself — empowering HBC to operate like a sovereign government over Rupert’s Land, which encompassed about one-third of present-day Canada.

The six-pages of imperial parchment, signed by King Charles II of England in 1670 and which gave HBC exclusive trading rights throughout the vast Hudson Bay watershed, could make a visually elegant trophy in a private collector’s drawing room. And while no official valuation exists, clearly the collection’s crown jewel stands to fetch more than a few beaver pelts at auction.

Additional details on the HBC Corporate Collection are scarce.

However, browsing @hbcheritage, HBC’s official Instagram account for its heritage department, one gets a glimpse, finding images of Indigenous art labelled “HBC Corporate Collection.”

This includes a handful of Inuit sculptures by unknown artists from the turn of the 20th century.

According to The Canadian Press, an unnamed source familiar with the auction process says items proposed for auction include “paintings dating back to 1650, point blankets, paper documents and even collectible Barbie dolls.”

Neither HBC nor its auction house Heffel Gallery Ltd., responded to the Free Press questions about the contents of the corporate collection.

Nor have they identified publicly what’s intended for auction. Many First Nations leaders worry Indigenous artifacts could be among the sale lots — items they feel rightfully belong to Indigenous communities, not in private mansions.

Unsurprisingly, that backlash is growing.

Leslie Weir, the librarian and archivist of Library and Archives Canada, is one of many who feels the charter is too historically important to remain in private hands.

And with HBC’s deep historical roots in Manitoba — and much of its collection already housed at the Archives of Manitoba and the Manitoba Museum — several local organizations and public figures are opposing HBC’s auction and argue the collection should come back to the province.

“Why don’t they just make sure that these things that matter to the Canadian people, to Canadian history, to First Nations, Indigenous people … fall into the hands of the public?” Premier Wab Kinew said in late April.

The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) has intervened to halt the auction.

In court filings from April, Grand Chief Kyra Wilson said it’s highly likely some of the items slated for auction are “of profound cultural, spiritual, and historical significance to First Nations people.”

The AMC has demanded a First Nations-led review of the artifacts, meaningful consultation, and repatriation of items of sacred and cultural significance for Indigenous peoples.

They’ve made some progress. The Ontario Superior Court conditionally approved the auction but required HBC to first submit a catalogue to the AMC and the court for expert review through the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board.

Yet even if an item is declared “cultural property,” that only restricts export, not domestic sale, and highlights broader regulatory gaps in Canada’s heritage sector.

In better times, the HBC made significant cultural donations. This includes more than 20,000 artifacts to the Manitoba Museum in the 1990s and more than two million historical documents to the Archives of Manitoba in 1974, known as the Hudson’s Bay Company Archives (HBCA), one of the world’s most comprehensive archival repositories of its kind.

At the time, these donations were praised by many as enlightened acts of corporate social responsibility.

Today, the mood’s very different.

As well as leaving 8,000 laid-off employees without severance packages, HBC argues they have a financial responsibility to their creditors and stakeholders and can’t just give away such valuable assets.

As of early 2025, the company owed approximately $1.1 billion in debt, leading to its filing for creditor protection in March.

While discussions about Indigenous sovereignty intensify, the fate of HBC’s collections raises thorny questions about who owns and controls Canada’s colonial and Indigenous heritage alike.

Once stewards of colonial Canada, HBC has spent the last century stewarding that history.

Almost every major western Canadian city, and particularly Winnipeg, has its origins as an HBC trading post. But by the early 20th century, rugged pioneers trafficking in fur pelts from armed garrisons were becoming store clerks selling perfume and silk stockings in glossy Bay department stores.

HBC had sold Rupert’s Land to the new Dominion of Canada for £300,000 in 1870 without, of course, Indigenous consent.

The armed resistance it triggered — Métis leader Louis Riel’s ill-fated resistance against the Canadian government’s attempt to annex the Red River Settlement — was prime minister John A. Macdonald’s problem and HBC could turn itself to new ventures.

The company opened its first department store in Winnipeg, at the corner of Main Street and York Avenue, in 1881. Winnipeg’s middle-class could take in this emblematically Canadian experience with the security that followed Riel’s defeat and Manitoba’s entry into Confederation.

While HBC was helping to bring Canadians the luxuries of modern consumer life, it was also becoming more vocal about its historical role in modernizing the country.

In 1920, the year of the company’s 250th anniversary, HBC released The Romance of the Far Fur Country. One of Canada’s first documentary films, it’s a nostalgic picture of the fur-trade era whose Indigenous subjects were sometimes asked to strike a more “traditional” pose to suit the camera’s colonial lens. (Romance was considered lost until Winnipeg filmmaker Kevin Nikkel reconstructed the film with Peter Geller, using original raw footage unearthed at the British Film Institute.)

It was also the year HBC launched The Beaver magazine, renamed Canada’s History in 2010 and still active today.

Open an issue from 1920 and in between adventurous tales of traders, explorers and surveyors you’ll find articles about HBC’s purchase of “Eskimo relics and Indian curios.”

In 1926, the company opened its flagship downtown store at 450 Portage Ave., cementing its roots as a Winnipeg institution.

The classical revivalist structure, radiating British imperial identity, still stands — although it was assessed at $0 in 2019 and required millions of dollars in upgrades to be brought up to code. The building was gifted by HBC in 2022 to the Southern Chiefs Organization, which is transforming the space into a mixed-use development and hub for Indigenous culture and community services. The handover ceremony included a symbolic payment of beaver and elk pelts.

Also in 1926, HBC established a museum in Winnipeg, a showcase of its collection, other fur-trade materials and HBC lore gathered over the centuries.

Today we know that very little provenance — recorded history of an object’s origin and owners used to study its legal and ethical status — exists for artifacts acquired during this era.

Like early editions of The Beaver, the museum was not only an absorbing record of colonial history, but served as a PR tool, portraying the company as a heroic and civilizing force on the Canadian frontiers.

“These two positions always go together: the power to rule and control lands, peoples and waters (and) the power to document and control history,” says Adele Perry, University of Manitoba history professor and director of the Centre for Human Rights Research.

“And that’s one of the really powerful things about colonial archives and records, and that’s why the struggles with them exist.”

HBC’s interests in land management and rugged outposts did not end with the 1870 sale of Rupert’s Land.

It continued to operate numerous posts across Northern and Western Canada well into the 20th century. These posts could act a little like an informal government arm, distributing food and goods allowances to remote communities, as well as supplying residential schools.

Northern communities could also receive materials on HBC credit, to be repaid with furs or other items, a system managed at the discretion of local HBC officers that could lead to deep debt.

Until the mid-20th century, HBC retained fertile land (known as the “fertile belt”) and extensive mineral rights in Western Canada, which spawned ventures including oil and gas exploration.

This history can feel obscured by the company’s public image as a modern retail giant.

For many years, Winnipeg remained something of a Canadian nerve centre for the London, England-based company.

As the “Gateway to the West” at a time when the city still radiated economic promise, Winnipeg was well-positioned to help co-ordinate transportation and distribution across the Prairies and the North, and its downtown edifice was the company’s flagship Bay store for decades.

However, downtown Winnipeg’s slow stagnation after the Second World War didn’t bode well for 450 Portage Ave., and by the 1970s, HBC began to offload its guardianship of Canadian heritage to the Manitoba Museum and the Archives of Manitoba.

Established in 1974, the importance of the Hudson’s Bay Company Archives to generations of researchers is hard to overstate.

Driven by what historian Robert Coutts calls the company’s “fanatical penchant for record keeping,” the collection comprises some 2,000 metres of documents — London Committee minute books, servant records, daily journals of agents at Hudson Bay posts, ship logs and so on — alongside volumes of architectural drawings, photographs and maps, maps and more maps.

“To know that land, to map that land, is an element of control… That’s the history of colonialism, in a way, right there,” says Kathleen Epp, keeper of the Hudson’s Bay Company Archives.

Plumbing the collection’s depths, historians have grappled with colonialism’s complexities and tragedies; climatologists illuminated the historical patterns of climate change; storytellers drew inspiration for yarns of war, historical romance and shipwreck; Indigenous researchers studied family genealogies and found evidence for land claims, treaty rights cases and status claims.

Lined up neatly are all of HBC’s successive charters until 1970 — each a marker in the company’s 355-year history. But missing is the story’s first chapter: the original 1670 Royal Charter.

“We know exactly where it belongs in our system,” Epp told the Globe and Mail.

“We think of (the charter) as part of our records in a way already because … we’ve got the rest of the story and so we feel like it makes sense for the charter to be here and to be as publicly accessible as any of the other records.”

The year 1994 was another eventful one for the HBC’s collections. That’s when the company officially transferred the HBCA to the Archives of Manitoba, which had managed it for 20 years.

It’s also when The Beaver — whose triumphantly colonial tone had softened over the decades — became independent from HBC and when the company entrusted a vast but incomplete collection of its cultural objects to the Manitoba Museum.

The most famous is the 16-metre replica of the Nonsuch, the ketch that sailed into Hudson Bay in 1668-69, commissioned by HBC to celebrate its tercentenary in 1970. It was gifted to the museum in 1973.

But after visitors explore the ship’s intricate carvings, cramped living quarters and muzzle-loading smoothbore guns, hopefully they’ll wander over to the museum’s HBC Gallery.

There they’ll find brass tokens used as currency in the fur trade, a Plains hide dress and birch-bark canoe, and an array of other Indigenous and colonial objects related to navigation, exploration, retail and trade — just a segment of the museum’s massive HBC collection.

Amelia Fay, curator of anthropology and the HBC Museum Collection at the museum, worries that if what’s left of HBC’s collection ends up in private hands it could hinder the study of key parts of colonial and Canadian history.

“To me, breaking up a collection breaks up that story,” she says.

“And then, of course, there’s obvious ethical concerns. If there are Indigenous belongings — those going without consultation (is) perpetuating a colonial harm that museums are grappling with today. We’re trying to repair those harms by reconnecting communities to belongings and looking into repatriation and rematriation.”

In May, the museum formally apologized to First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities for holding ancestral remains and belongings in its collections without consent. It further committed to repatriating more than 40 ancestors through its “Homeward Journey” initiative.

As for its HBC collection, Fay explains that a key part of her job is doing detective work — piecing together patchy clues to trace the communities HBC employees visited in the 1920s while collecting for the company’s new museum.

Some pieces may have been purchased from their makers, but given the deep power imbalances, those deals can echo the dubious terms under which land was signed over to colonial powers.

Fay says when her team tracks down descendants of the original creators, some ask for the artifacts back right away. Others want the museum to keep and care for them, at least for the time being.

“I think it’s an important role museums can play: we can be this intermediary space where things can be safe, they can be publicly accessible,” she says.

“People can come and learn from them, and when the time is right, on the various levels that may be, then they can eventually find their way home.”

While HBC has been ordered to hand over its auction catalogue to the courts and to the AMC, whether it will willingly return items widely considered sacred or rightfully belonging to Indigenous communities or the public remains an open question.

Cultural property is often cited as one of the world’s largest unregulated markets, and Canada is no exception.

“We do not have any legislative or legal framework in Canada at the national level for anything related to repatriation… which is what makes it a bit difficult,” says Janis Kahentóktha Bomberry, executive director and chief executive officer for the Canadian Museum Association (CMA).

The association has vocally supported the AMC and criticized HBC’s auction plan.

“But there are standards where we’re asking for the full return of cultural belongings to occur with the involvement of appropriate Indigenous nations and as equal partners,” she says.

Bomberry is referring to the CMA’s 2022 report titled Moved to Action: Activating UNDRIP in Museums, whose guidelines surrounding repatriation reflect the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action.

But like the international rights frameworks they draw on, the CMA’s report is more of a moral manual than a rule book. This means the responsibility to research provenance, an expensive and chronically underfunded task, and pursue repatriation and rematriation falls primarily on collectors and museums.

It’s a bit like asking a company to bankroll an audit that could show it’s been profiting from looted goods, and hoping their conscience kicks them into action. Not every museum or collector is going to show the right stuff.

Still, Canadian law offers a window of hope to Indigenous and public stakeholders: depending on what the federal review decides, some of HBC’s corporate collection could be designated “cultural property” — blocking its export and keeping it in the country.

At that point, it’s feasible that philanthropists might step in, purchasing key works and donating them to back to the appropriate Indigenous parties or public museums and archives.

HBC seems to be promoting this apparent “win-win” outcome.

Adam Zalev, managing director of HBC’s financial adviser Reflect Advisors, notes in an affidavit filed in April that “government and quasi-governmental institutions, museums, universities, and high net worth individuals acting on their own accord or as potential benefactors to certain Canadian museums and institutions, have expressed interest in the art collection.”

Some still resent the possibility that priceless and sacred artifacts could be reduced to dollar values. The forthcoming sale leads to unflattering parallels between the company’s grand entrance more than 350 years ago and its hobbling exit today.

“This is a moment where the Hudson’s Bay Company is conducting itself differently than it did, say, 40 years ago, when they clearly engaged in good faith and created a lasting structure with both the Archives of Manitoba… and then the Manitoba Museum,” says Perry, the historian.

“Here we are reliving in a tiny way, the Royal Charter of 1670 and the transfer of Rupert’s Land of 1869-70 (where) the thoughts and experiences of peoples in these places are of the most minor consideration.”

Goggins, currently enjoying recent fame due to his inclusion on popular series including “White Lotus,” “Fallout,” and “The Righteous Gemstones,” is front-and-center in the midst of Walmart’s latest marketing blitz, according to Forbes.

In the ad kicking off the campaign (available on YouTube), Goggins can be seen partaking in a sauna, engaging in a hunt for a sasquatch, playing the keys in a rustic jazz and blues bar, and finally lining up with a group of country dancers.

The throughline uniting all of these various vignettes is a twist on The Who’s 1978 single “Who Are You,” with actors voicing over the “Who, who, who, who?” refrain with “Who knew? Who knew?” in reference to Walmart’s countless products on offer — syncing up with the official “Walmart. Who knew?” title attached to the campaign.

In comments shared with Forbes, Neil Saunders — GlobalData managing director and RetailWire BrainTrust member — endorsed the thrust of the humorous advertising move coming from the blue-and-yellow brand.

“Walmart’s new ad campaign is designed to make consumers rethink their perceptions of the brand. It hits all the right notes. It is funny and engaging, uses great actors and its message actually makes people pause and think,” Saunders said.

The ad was created by Publicis Groupe’s Leo Burnett NY, Fallon, Digitas, and Contender agencies. A Spanish-language version showcasing the talents of “Brooklyn 99” actress Stephanie Beatriz is also slated for release, with campaigns spanning social media, traditional television, and Reddit forums.

Walmart’s Brand Refresh Efforts Follow Gains in Higher-Income Consumers

And although Walmart has always been known as a low-cost leader, it has attracted a significant share of higher-income customers in recent days.

As Forbes senior contributor Pamela N. Danziger underlined, the confluence of efforts the retailer has made over the course of the past few months signals an intent to change its image, at least somewhat, from a staid discount retailer into a digitally driven and trending brand — counterbalanced with the knowledge that it also needs to retain broader appeal with its established middle-American foundation.

“The wider point is that the ad is not produced in isolation. It is part of an ongoing mission to broaden the appeal of Walmart and it highlights tangible changes the company has made on the ground. A low-price message is still at the heart of Walmart, but it is now so much more than this. When it comes to online shopping, Amazon is often the default.

More than 90% of voting United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 members at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions stores across San Diego County have authorized a strike if necessary, according to the union.

The vote, held June 8–11, comes amid ongoing contract negotiations between the union and grocery store parent companies Kroger and Albertsons.

The union, which represents more than 13,000 workers throughout San Diego and Imperial Counties, accuses the companies of unfair labor practices, including “surveillance, intimidation and retaliation,” during the months-long bargaining process.

“This strike authorization is not just a vote — it’s a mandate,” said Local 135 President Todd Walters. “We will not be pushed around or silenced. This vote shows that we are strong, united, and ready to do whatever it takes to win the fair contract you deserve.”

The bargaining committee has met with the companies 18 times since February, union officials said, but progress has stalled over issues such as staffing, wages and equity.

“I’ve been in every bargaining session,” said Cammy Fulton, a Ralphs worker and bargaining team member. “The companies aren’t taking us seriously. But this vote proves that we’re serious — and we’re not backing down.”

The final scheduled bargaining sessions are set for June 25–27.

Nike's been dealing with too much inventory, causing a squeeze on sales and margins last quarter.

What does this mean?

In a push to tidy up its overstocked inventory, Nike faced some financial bumps in Q4. Analysts at BofA Securities have cut their earnings forecast for fiscal 2026 from $2.00 to $1.80, driven by weaker demand in China and unfavorable exchange rates. Yet, there's a silver lining: fiscal 2027’s forecast is steady at $3.00 per share. Nike’s current focus is on normalizing inventory and gearing up for a sales bounce, emphasizing product innovations to catch consumer interest in upcoming seasons.

Why should I care?

For markets: Nike’s comeback strategy in play.

Despite a slight dip in fall 2025 wholesale orders, buzz is building around Nike’s spring 2026 innovations, especially in performance segments. Investors are keen on the brand's recovery potential in fiscal 2026, which could enhance stock performance. Management insights during earnings calls will be key to understanding sales trends and visibility.

The bigger picture: Setting sights on a sustainable future.

BofA Securities remains bullish on Nike with a price target of $80, even as the stock trades at $61.81.

The US sports giant has launched a collaboration with NorBlack brand NorWhite, in what not only represents its first creative partnership with an Indian brand, but also a strategic move to strengthen its presence in the market.

Inspired by the traditional bandhani technique , the collaboration marks Nike's return to a country where it has faced a complex trajectory. After multiple restructurings, store closures and business partner changes, the company is now looking to connect more directly with the local consumer and new generations.

The launch comes in a context of accelerated growth of the Indian fashion and retail market and has become a strategic priority for large international operators. Nike, which landed in the country through licensing and operated with multiple partners, went on to close 35% of its stores in 2016 after a drop in sales and accumulated losses.

Nike seeks to reconnect with India through a creative alliance with NorBlack NorWhite.

The collaboration with NorBlack NorWhite, a New Delhi-based brand founded in 2009 that has gained recognition for reinterpreting age-old textile techniques in a contemporary key, seeks to engage a new generation of female consumers who combine culture, design and active lifestyles. Both founders, Mriga Kapadiya and Amrit, grew up in Toronto but moved to Mumbai to reconnect with their roots and explore textile and traditional arts.

Launched on June 11, the capsule is available in selected stores and on its own website.

Her observation was reflected in the retailer’s first-quarter results, which showed sales at the Toronto-headquartered company rose 6.7 per cent to $40 million.

Article content

Much of the boost came from the company’s direct-to-consumer business, which includes its retail stores and e-commerce operations.

Article content

Sales from that division totalled $34.6 million for the period ended May 3, up from $31.4 million a year earlier. The segment also saw comparable sales growth of 14.1 per cent.

Article content

Roach attributed the increase to existing products resonating with customers who she said responded well to the company’s latest releases, too.

“We were also seeing strong adoption of updated cuts, which offer a modern take on comfort while staying true to the brand’s DNA,” she said.

“This momentum in our core collection and the success of our new programs gives us confidence as we continue to balance innovation with the consistency your customers expect from us.”

Meanwhile, partner and other sales, which include wholesale Roots branded products, licensing to select partners and certain custom products, fell to $5.4 million, compared with $6.1 million in the same quarter last year.

The loss amounted to 20 cents per share for the quarter compared with a loss of 22 cents per share in the same quarter last year.

The results fit Roots’ usual cadence, Roach said. Typically, the company generates 30 per cent of its sales in the first half of the year, when it tends to generate a loss. The back half usually brings profit.

This year Roots has been working to close “underperforming” stores and reallocate resources to “high potential” locations where the brand is resonating and there are opportunities for traffic growth.

Customer feedback and in-store analytics have also pushed the company to give some stores a makeover that has introduced new layouts, digital tools and modern materials and finishes into flexible fixtures meant to help the brand transition between seasons.

The medtech giant issued a recall notification to customers last month, and it has now been classified as a Class I recall by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

According to the FDA recall notice, there have been 63 medical device reports (MDRs) associated with the outlined issues, including two serious injuries and one death. There are 4,842 devices in commerce, according to the FDA’s recall database.

Medtronic advised discontinuing the clinical use of the affected device versions following an investigation into customer complaints relating to the devices shutting down during use and/or the devices’ shutdown alarms failing to sound effectively. The company said it had identified two separate capacitors on one of the ventilator’s controller printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) as the cause of the issues.

The agency noted that if a ventilator fails and does not provide adequate ventilation, the patient may not be able to breathe on their own, leading to low oxygen levels, high carbon dioxide levels, and potentially severe consequences like brain injury or death.

Also within the FDA’s recall notice, Medtronic added that the affected devices must be removed from circulation and that it will not be correcting the highlighted issues on affected ventilators or service parts and will no longer service the affected ventilators. The recall tag comes just over a year after Medtronic announced it would exit the ventilator market, citing unprofitability.

A recent study published in the BMJ found that almost a third of adverse events (AEs) were reported late – notably, outside of the mandated 30-day reporting window – to the FDA’s centralised Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between September 2019 and December 2022.

As part of its internal processes for notifying the public on high-risk medical device recalls, the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) initiated a pilot last year that focused on improving the timeliness of communications around corrective actions being taken by companies with devices believed to be high-risk recalls.

Johnson & Johnson said the first clinical data from its ongoing Phase 1b study of JNJ-4496, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, shows encouraging potential in treating large B-cell lymphoma, or LBCL.

The company said Friday the data show a 75% to 80% complete response rate among evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL who received the recommended Phase 2 dose.

The findings demonstrate the therapy's potential in treating such patients, including those with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which is the most common type of aggressive lymphoma, the company said.

The therapy also showed a promising safety profile, with no cases of Grade 3 or 4 cytokine-release syndrome observed in the cohort receiving the recommended Phase 2 dose, the company said.

Two patients had immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, including one Grade 3 event, which occurred in a patient with central nervous system lymphoma, the company said.

Overall, 84% of patients had Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events. The most common was neutropenia, a reduction in white blood cells, the company said.

The therapy is designed to bind to both CD19 and CD20 antigens, two cell surface proteins commonly expressed on malignant B-cells, in order to potentially address common resistance mechanisms in relapsed or refractory disease, the company said.

The vote empowers their bargaining team to strike over what they claim are illegal labor violations by Kroger and Albertsons.

These grocery workers are demanding fair wages, adequate staffing, and better working conditions amid growing tensions at the bargaining table.

Practice Strikes Set to Begin in Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo

Southern California grocery workers from UFCW Local 770 will lead a “week of action” from June 16–20. Practice picket lines, sign-making sessions, and leadership training are planned across Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo counties.

“This fight isn’t just about us,” said Paszion Horner-Smith, a Vons employee. “It’s about every shopper dealing with long lines, empty shelves, and understaffing caused by corporate greed.”

Union leaders emphasized that store workers are prepared to escalate their action unless Kroger and Albertsons bargain in good faith.

Southern California Grocery Workers Say Staffing, Pay Are Critical Issues

For four months, supermarket employees have pushed for a new contract that addresses chronic understaffing, low wages, and rising healthcare costs. UFCW alleges that Kroger and Albertsons have engaged in illegal retaliation and surveillance.

“These companies are using intimidation instead of negotiation,” said the UFCW 770 bargaining team. “Southern California grocery workers are united, and we won’t accept a bad deal.”

Kroger claims its offer includes “market-leading wage increases” and substantial benefits. Albertsons says it is committed to negotiating a fair agreement for both workers and customers.

Nationwide Solidarity Among Store Workers Builds Momentum

Southern California grocery workers are part of a broader movement across multiple states. More than 100,000 unionized Kroger and Albertsons workers in California, Colorado, and Washington have authorized strikes. If coordinated, it could trigger the most significant grocery labor action in U.S. history.

“We are united from Seattle to Los Angeles,” said Shawn McGee, a Fred Meyer worker. “Southern California grocery workers are not alone — we all face the same disrespect.”

Shoppers Feel the Impact

Customer frustration is growing as grocery stores remain understaffed. Consumer Reports found Kroger overcharged customers by an average of 18.4%. A UFCW survey showed that customers are increasingly blaming poor service on reduced staff.

Southern California grocery workers say they are stretched thin and underpaid while profits soar.

Contract Expiration Heightens Pressure on Grocery Workers

The contract for 65,000 workers expired on March 2, 2025. It is the largest union grocery contract in the nation. Employees across Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, Pavilions, Gelson’s, Stater Bros., and Super A are demanding living wages, affordable healthcare, pensions, and safe staffing levels.

It forms part of the reason Nike was able to establish itself as the world’s premier sportswear brand in a little under two decades.

Analysis from Euromonitor estimates that the value of the global sportswear market will grow at an annualised rate of 7 per cent from 2023 to reach $512bn (£391bn) by 2027.
Although young Scousers obviously remain devout, it’s generally held that bosses at Nike overestimated customer brand loyalty.","It’s been reported that a gaggle of teenagers in Liverpool recently queued overnight in the rain to get their hands on Air Max 95s, a new version of a Nike (US:NKE) trainer also commonly known as 110s. Apparently, the Air Max 95 (originally priced at £110) became something of a “must have” fashion item on Merseyside when it was first released in 1995 – and the affection endured even as shell suits went the way of spats and bell-bottoms.

You wouldn’t necessarily describe it as a tilt at haute couture, quite the opposite in fact. If consumers adopt mass-produced items such as the Air Max 95, it serves a collective impulse rather than individual expression. Marketers sometimes refer to this phenomenon as “tribal identification”. It forms part of the reason Nike was able to establish itself as the world’s premier sportswear brand in a little under two decades. The brand really has as much to do with pop culture as it does with athleticism.

But Nike’s pre-eminence in the marketplace is now under threat. The group’s share price started to head south in November 2021, and around two-thirds of its market value has been wiped out in the intervening period. Figures from GlobalData show that Nike’s share of the global sportswear market fell to 14.1 per cent in 2024, a 120 basis point contraction from the prior year, whereas its chief rival Adidas (DE:ADS) benefited from a 70 basis point increase to 8.9 per cent. These increments take on a little more significance when viewed in context. Analysis from Euromonitor estimates that the value of the global sportswear market will grow at an annualised rate of 7 per cent from 2023 to reach $512bn (£391bn) by 2027.

What went wrong from Nike’s perspective? Although young Scousers obviously remain devout, it’s generally held that bosses at Nike overestimated customer brand loyalty. This resulted in overly ambitious, if not ill-judged, direct-to-consumer (DTC) strategies. In a bid to enhance margins, it reduced its dependence on wholesale channels and cut long-standing ‘bricks-and-mortar’ retail relationships.

So, at a time when the view was taking shape that an ‘omnichannel’ offering amounted to best practice in modern retail, Nike was prioritising digital sales via Nike.com and its SNKRS app at the expense of the high street. But it turned out that many occasional punters were only too happy to opt for rival brands simply out of convenience – there was no compunction to keep faith with the company.

Under the stewardship of John Donahoe, who was replaced as chief executive by Elliott Hill last October, the group was criticised for failing to innovate, thereby relying too heavily on the reissue of retro models (like the Air Max 95). Because Nike had curtailed many of its long-standing commercial relationships, it also lost invaluable insights into its clientele’s preferences.

All this led to a situation where Nike seemed to be unable to determine what to produce, how much, and for whom. Throw in overly ambitious DTC sales forecasts, and the group was lumbered with persistent unwieldy inventories. Excess inventory duly gave way to heavy discounting and margin pressure – the exact opposite of what management was hoping to achieve.

Sentiment towards the stock has stabilised somewhat since Hill took the reins. Adidas’ own marked turnaround in its fortunes similarly occurred once it, too, changed its leadership team in response to faltering sales. The market also responded positively to recent news that Nike plans to resume direct sales to Amazon (US:AMZN) in the US, thus ending a six-year hiatus from the platform.

Hope springs eternal, but it’s unlikely that Wall Street’s faith will be restored in short order. Among other issues, analysts will have to take on board cautious earnings forecasts, the ongoing Trump tariffs spat, along with faltering North American sales momentum. The mood music remains resolutely downbeat.

All eyes will be on the group’s full-year figures, due to be published on 26 June. Expectations will be tempered by the fact that since 2019 half of the group’s earnings surprises have been to the downside, after years of consistent outperformance. Nike’s market position might have seemed unassailable at one point, but the sportswear industry, like most other forms of retail, has always been subject to brand churn, and there is no shortage of alternative products, such as New Balance, to take up the slack.",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3075191e-30c3-46dc-9d38-965c222a50a6.png?source=invchron,N,,2025-06-13 17:01:27.497217

In a report released Tuesday by the independent Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, officials noted that without revenue from corporate taxes, Ireland would face a “substantial debt” to the tune of €5 billion in 2025.
“Phenomenal levels of excess corporation tax are keeping Ireland in surplus,” the council said in the report.
Just three companies account for most of the excess corporation tax.” The report said that about 75% of Ireland’s corporate tax revenue depends on U.S. companies.

In a report released Tuesday by the independent Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, officials noted that without revenue from corporate taxes, Ireland would face a “substantial debt” to the tune of €5 billion in 2025.

“Phenomenal levels of excess corporation tax are keeping Ireland in surplus,” the council said in the report. “Without these revenues, there would be a substantial deficit, despite a strong economy. These receipts may well increase, but they remain high risk. Just three companies account for most of the excess corporation tax.”

The report said that about 75% of Ireland’s corporate tax revenue depends on U.S. companies. Both nations have hailed their tight business connections as mutually beneficial. A March report from the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, for instance, described Ireland as the “sixth largest investor in the U.S.” owing to the steady stream of business between the two countries.

Ireland is home to the European headquarters of many U.S. firms, including tech giants like Meta, Apple and Google. Ireland’s relatively lower corporate tax rate has also led some American companies to move their official legal headquarters there, such as medical device giant Medtronic and consulting firm Accenture.

Though many of the businesses with a presence in Ireland are exempt from the Trump administration’s tariff regime for now, that could change, the council’s report noted. Pharmaceutical products, for instance, have been exempted from U.S. tariffs, but the sector “remains under active review.”

Looking ahead, the sectors that have driven Ireland’s recent growth now face critical questions about whether to continue investing in the country. “Services sectors, such as the tech sector, may not be directly impacted by tariffs. However, if the trade dispute escalates and both sides respond with new tariffs, the services sector could also be directly impacted.”

Council researchers said nearly €40 billion worth of pharmaceutical goods were exported from Ireland to the U.S. in the first three months of 2025. That’s almost as much as all exports in 2024, according to the report.

For now, the report nonetheless projects higher-than-expected corporate tax revenue for Ireland. Though the Irish government has projected about €28 billion in corporate tax revenue, the council said those forecasts are “simply not credible” and pointed to a range of reasons why the figure might end up being much higher. The jump in pharmaceutical exports was one of them.

“Under current policies, we expect corporation tax revenues to continue rising, at least in the short term,” the council stated.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hI7aHQHOgOlC3fEdT7Q4k7o_bcAS6ft-rSP5mQuwIb0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTI2OTQ4ODczLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-13 13:34:33.505774

Union members of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) in Southern California and the Pacific Northwest have voted this week to authorize a worker strike against Kroger and Albertsons stores, Supermarket News reported.

This collective action involved approximately 60,000 workers across multiple regions and represents the largest coordinated strike authorization in UFCW history, as reported by Labor Notes.

The workers' demands include staffing increases and improvements to wages and benefits. Additionally, union members have raised concerns about unfair labor practices such as surveillance, intimidation, and retaliation during the bargaining process.

In Colorado, UFCW Local 7 members working at Safeway and Albertsons stores authorized an unfair labor practices strike last week. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice and canceled a current contract extension, effective at 11:59 p.m. on Saturday. Workers at Kroger-owned King Soopers and City Market stores in Colorado may also be preparing to strike, following a two-week strike earlier this year over similar issues.

In Indiana, Kroger workers rejected the company's latest contract proposal but have not yet authorized a strike. Nationwide, over 150,000 UFCW and Teamsters grocery workers are involved in negotiations for new agreements. Worker support for strikes remains high, with a reported 99% approval in the Denver metropolitan area, according to UFCW Local 7.

“Albertsons is proposing major cuts to workers’ healthcare benefits and threatening the financial security of pension beneficiaries, while refusing to address ongoing understaffing issues,” Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, stated.

In San Diego, more than 90% of UFCW Local 135 members voted to authorize a strike, with negotiations scheduled to continue later this month.

Both Kroger and Albertsons representatives have stated that they are committed to good-faith bargaining. A Kroger spokesperson emphasized the company's commitment to achieving favorable outcomes through negotiation, citing its recent offer of market-leading wages, healthcare, and pension benefits.

The immunotherapy may be given as a single agent in the neoadjuvant setting and continued after surgery as adjuvant treatment in combination with radiotherapy, with or without cisplatin, and then given again as a single agent.

The agency's decision is based on data from the Phase III KEYNOTE-689 trial, in which Merck is comparing the perioperative Keytruda regimen against no neoadjuvant treatment followed by adjuvant radiotherapy with or without cisplatin in about 700 patients with advanced HNSCC.

At a prespecified interim analysis, among patients with PD-L1 scores of 1 or more, those on the Keytruda regimen had a median event-free survival of 59.7 months compared to 29.6 months for patients in the control arm, representing a 30 percent reduction in the risk of recurrence, progression, or death. Overall survival results were immature at the time of the analysis.

""As the first perioperative anti-PD-1 treatment option for appropriate patients with resectable, locally advanced HNSCC, this new treatment regimen has the potential to shift the treatment paradigm for patients and their families affected by this disease,"" Marjorie Green, senior VP and head of oncology and global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories, said in a statement. ""Based on these trial results, Keytruda as part of this regimen shows potential to change longstanding standards of care for treating certain patients with locally advanced HNSCC.""

Paris-based Publicis, which owns agencies including Saatchi & Saatchi, last year overtook WPP as the world’s largest advertising company by revenues.","A French advertising giant has threatened to sue WPP after accusing the British company of spreading “falsehoods” about its business.

The Telegraph has learnt that Publicis Groupe wrote to Mark Read, the WPP chief executive, last week threatening legal action in an escalating row over advertising quality.

One source described the letter, which was also sent to Philip Jansen, the WPP chairman, and Brian Lesser, the WPP Media boss, as “aggressive”.

It was sent days before WPP lost its $1.7bn (£1.3bn) Mars contract to Publicis and before the London advertising giant announced Mr Read would step down as chief executive at the end of the year.

The row relates to a research report commissioned by WPP that accused Epsilon, a marketing technology company owned by Publicis, of selling low-quality advertising spots.

The report, which WPP distributed among clients, including Mars, found that more than a quarter of 500,000 sample impressions came from so-called “made for advertising sites”, which are built primarily to drive advertising clicks.

The research, first reported by Ad Age, prompted a furious response from Publicis, which branded the results “fake”.

The company said: “We don’t normally respond to [WPP’s] desperate moves, as it doesn’t help our industry ... But in the face of such obvious falsehoods, we can’t stay silent.

“WPP continues to claim innovation, this time by inventing their own ‘audits’ of their competitors. They’re doing it in a domain where they’ve recently excelled – throwing mud at their peers rather than focusing on their clients and their people.”

WPP said: “WPP Media is committed to quality and accuracy in everything we do. Our analysis was used to brief client leaders in response to client questions.

“We used a robust methodology grounded in established industry principles and designed to provide an objective assessment of inventory quality. We stand by the integrity of our methods and the findings presented.”

WPP and Publicis both declined to comment on the letter.

The row underscores the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two groups as the advertising industry grapples with an uncertain future in an era dominated by technology giants such as Meta and Google, as well as the rise of artificial intelligence.

Tom Denford, the chief executive of ID Comms, said the row was “indicative of the state of the industry and the pressure on these organisations”.

Paris-based Publicis, which owns agencies including Saatchi & Saatchi, last year overtook WPP as the world’s largest advertising company by revenues. Two other major advertising groups – Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group – have agreed to merge in a $30bn deal that will create a major new player in the market.

WPP on Monday confirmed that Mr Read will step down at the end of the year after more than three decades in the business.

The announcement came amid growing scrutiny over client losses, though sources close to Mr Read said he wanted to announce his departure ahead of Cannes Lions, the annual industry conference that begins next week.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/06/13/TELEMMGLPICT000427969943_17498270237510_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNuDlng7k5JgKe0LZng254HJewDry_ynYiY7645sYfm4.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-06-13 12:41:28.844582

An overheating battery can lead to “melting of plastic components, smoke, and fire hazards,” Anker wrote in an accompanying announcement. The company added that it was conducting this recall ""out of an abundance of caution to ensure the safety of our customers.""

According to the CPSC, China-based Anker has received 19 reports of fires and explosions involving these now-recalled portable chargers. That includes two minor burn injuries and 11 reports of property damage amounting to over $60,700.

The recalled “PowerCore 10000” power banks have a model number of A1263. They were sold online at Anker's website — as well as Amazon, eBay and Newegg — between June 2016 and December 2022 for about $27 across the U.S., per the recall notice.

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.
“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter reads.","Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday that she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers’ personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.

Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.

As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.

“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy—your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, reads.

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.

The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one of the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen, purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

“These powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,” a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.

CVS says on its website that it “negotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.”

The company’s text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.

“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter reads. “They would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care—the consequences would be dire.”

State Rep. Dixon McMakin says some of the messages from CVS were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers “may shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.”

“No we’re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said.",https://s25562.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/BRBR_Favicon.png.webp,N,,2025-06-13 12:38:57.131564

While Nike has yet to confirm an official release date, industry sources suggest the debut may occur sometime between June and August. The retail price is expected to be approximately $210.

This model marks a step in Nike’s exploration of additive manufacturing (AM), enabled through a collaboration with Zellerfeld, a German startup known for its work in fully 3D printed footwear.

Building Buzz Online

The “Oatmeal” colorway—a neutral blend of soft beige tones—has already attracted attention on social platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X. In April, content creator Janelle C. Shuttlesworth described the shoes as “light as air” in a video preview. Sneaker-focused accounts such as JustFreshKicks and TikTok user @shoehefner5 have also offered early walkthroughs. Among fans, the nickname “Foamy Oat” has started to catch on.

Before generating buzz online, the sneaker made a public appearance at ComplexCon Las Vegas in November 2024. There, its laceless, sculptural silhouette and smooth, seamless texture stood out—merging futuristic design with signature Air Max elements, such as the visible heel air unit.

Reimagining the Air Max Legacy

Drawing inspiration from the original Air Max 1 (1987), the Air Max 1000 retains the iconic air cushion in the heel while reinventing the rest of the structure using 3D printing. The shoe’s upper and outsole are formed as a single, continuous piece, produced from ZellerFoam, a proprietary flexible material developed by Zellerfeld.

Zellerfeld’s fused filament fabrication (FFF) process enables varied material densities throughout the shoe—resulting in a firm, supportive sole paired with a lightweight, breathable upper. The laceless, slip-on design prioritizes ease of wear while reinforcing a sleek, minimalist aesthetic.

Nike’s Chief Innovation Officer, John Hoke, emphasized the broader impact of the design, noting that the Air Max 1000 “opens up new creative possibilities” and achieves levels of precision and contouring not possible with traditional footwear manufacturing. He also pointed to the sustainability benefits of AM, which produces minimal waste by fabricating only the necessary components.

Expansion of 3D Printed Footwear Technology

The Air Max 1000 joins a growing lineup of 3D printed footwear innovations from major brands. Gucci, the Italian luxury brand known for blending traditional craftsmanship with modern techniques, unveiled several Cub3d sneakers as part of its Spring Summer 2025 (SS25) collection. The brand developed Demetra, a material made from at least 70% plant-based ingredients, including viscose, wood pulp, and bio-based polyurethane. The bi-material sole combines an EVA-filled interior for cushioning and a TPU exterior, featuring an Interlocking G pattern that creates a 3D effect.

Elsewhere, Syntilay, a footwear company combining artificial intelligence with 3D printing, launched a range of custom-fit slides. These slides are designed using AI-generated 3D models, starting with sketch-based concepts that are refined through AI platforms and then transformed into digital 3D designs. The company offers sizing adjustments based on smartphone foot scans, which are integrated into the manufacturing process.

Negotiations between the union and Safeway's parent company, Albertsons, have stalled.

Safeway workers are seeking better wages, secure health insurance and improved scheduling.

Safeway workers in Colorado, including more than 200 in Pueblo and Pueblo West, could strike as soon as Sunday, June 15, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers 7 union.

The union’s bargaining committee gave the required 72-hour notice to Safeway and its corporate owners, Albertsons, that the termination of the current extension agreement will allow a strike to proceed.

Pueblo-area Safeway workers voted May 31 to join the strike effort if labor negotiations, which have been ongoing since October, fail.

Safeway and Albertsons workers in Metro Denver, Boulder, Broomfield, Castle Rock, Conifer, Estes Park, Evergreen, Fountain, Grand Junction, Idaho Springs, Parker, Salida, Steamboat Springs, and Vail voted along with Pueblo workers to authorize an unfair labor practice strike by a 99% margin, according to a press release from the union.

Safeway workers are fighting for better wages and improved workplace scheduling as well as health insurance coverage.

“Unfortunately, that message was not taken seriously and today’s negotiating session did not generate a breakthrough,” according to the press release issued June 12.

“We took this decision very seriously and concluded that after so many months of bargaining, Safeway/Albertsons was giving us no choice but to further escalate our contract campaign,” said Ivan Lopez, a Safeway distribution center worker in Denver.

“We’d been clear since last fall that we needed them to address staffing, poverty-level wages, and ensure that workers health and pension benefits remain fully funded.”

The union has not yet announced a strike, but strikes could begin as early as midnight Sunday morning.

Pueblo’s King Soopers employees participated in an 11-day strike that ended Feb. 18 after representatives with the company and the union agreed to return to the bargaining table. The two sides have yet to reach an agreement.","https://www.chieftain.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/10/NTPC/74358229007-safeway.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y123&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-13 12:36:50.640994

SOURCE Johnson & Johnson","Phase 1b study suggests a promising safety profile and highlights the potential of a novel dual-targeting CD19/CD20 CAR T in patients with relapsed or refractory disease

75-80% complete response rate among evaluable patients at the recommended Phase 2 dose

MILAN, June 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) announced today the first clinical data from an ongoing Phase 1b study for JNJ-90014496 (JNJ-4496), an investigational dual-targeting anti-CD19/CD20 bispecific autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, being studied in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (R/R LBCL) who have not been previously treated with CAR T-cell therapy.1 Findings demonstrate the potential of JNJ-4496 in the treatment of patients with R/R LBCL, including R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) – the most common type of aggressive lymphoma, a blood cancer that originates in the lymphatic system.1,2 These data were presented as an oral presentation at the 2025 European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress (Abstract #S239).1

JNJ-4496, formerly known as C-CAR039, is a dual-targeting CAR T designed to bind to both CD19 and CD20 antigens — two cell surface proteins commonly expressed on malignant B-cells. This design, including a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, is intended to enhance binding strength and persistence, also potentially addressing common mechanisms of resistance in relapsed or refractory disease.

In the Phase 1b dose confirmation study (NCT05421663) in patients with R/R LBCL, data at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) were reported in patients with a median follow-up of 4 months. Results informed a RP2D of JNJ-4496 at 75 million CAR+ T-cells. Among the 22 patients in the RP2D group where efficacy was assessed, those who received one prior line of therapy (n=10) had an objective response rate (ORR) of 100 percent and a complete response rate (CRR) of 80 percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI), 69, 100). In the patients who had received two or more prior lines of therapy (n=12), the ORR was 92 percent and the CRR was 75 percent (95 percent CI, 62, 100).1

""There is a pressing need to continue advancing therapies for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Only about 40 percent of patients have long-term remissions with currently available single-antigen-targeting CD19 CAR T therapies,"" said Krish Patel*, M.D., Director of Lymphoma Research, Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI), and principal study investigator. ""The data presented today show encouraging clinical activity and promising safety, and represent a step forward in delivering a potential new treatment option to patients living with the most common type of aggressive lymphoma.""

Within the RP2D safety group (n=25), 52 percent of patients (n=13) received two or more prior lines of therapy, and 56 percent (n=14) received bridging therapy. In the RP2D cohort studied, no cases of Grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome were observed. Two patients had immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), one Grade 1 and one Grade 3. The Grade 3 event occurred in a patient with central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Overall, 84 percent of patients (n=21) had Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and 28 percent (n=7) reported serious TEAEs. The most common Grade 3/4 TEAE was neutropenia, a reduction in white blood cells (72 percent). One patient experienced a Grade 3 infection.1

""We're really excited to share the first results for our dual-targeting anti-CD19/CD20 CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, underscoring our more than decade-long commitment to addressing unmet needs for patients with B-cell malignancies,"" said Jeffrey Infante, M.D., Vice President of Early Clinical Development and Translational Research at Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine. ""As we continue to unlock the full potential of CAR T-cell therapies through novel next-generation approaches, these promising data reinforce earlier long-term findings and highlight the potential of JNJ-4496 to improve outcomes for patients.""

These data are advancing our pipeline of CAR T therapies for the treatment of B-cell malignancies and are an extension of our worldwide collaboration and licensing agreement initiated with AbelZeta Inc. (formerly Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc.) in 2023 to develop and commercialize next-generation CAR T-cell therapies (excluding Greater China). A Phase 1 study for C-CAR039 was conducted in China for the treatment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (predominantly LBCL).3 Johnson & Johnson is also evaluating the safety and efficacy of this asset (known as JNJ-4496 outside of Greater China) through a separate study involving a global patient population.4 In addition to the oral presentation of JNJ-4496 at EHA, the global clinical study data will be presented at the 2025 International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma from June 17—21.

About large B-cell lymphoma

Large B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a blood cancer that originates in the lymphatic system, arising from abnormal B cells, a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies to fight infections.2 The malignant cells grow rapidly in lymph nodes or other organs and can spread quickly throughout the body.2 These abnormal cells are larger than normal, healthy B-cells.2 Diffuse (D) LBCL is the most common and aggressive type where cells are spread out (diffuse) rather than grouped together when they are examined under a microscope.2 DLBCL accounts for approximately 40 percent of all NHL cases globally and is estimated to have 150,000 new cases diagnosed each year.5 While some patients respond to initial treatment, up to 40 percent can relapse or become refractory to therapy.6 LBCL and DLBCL patients often face limited treatment options and a poor prognosis, highlighting the urgent need for innovative therapies. Common symptoms include rapidly growing lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.2

Testing on a Single-Engine Cessna

The company carried out the demonstrations on a single-engine Cessna. Boeing stated that the aircraft received digital commands from engineers located in a nearby trailer. Pilots remained on the flight deck but acted primarily as passengers.

Evaluating Two Technologies

Boeing tested two technologies from its product development unit: Digital Taxis and Auto Taxis. The tests included digitally created airport activity.

The company explained that Digital Taxi collected data from ground vehicles, airspace controls, and airplanes to deliver instructions through graphics and text. This method would offer an alternative to verbal directions from air traffic control.

Auto Taxi used information from various systems to steer the aircraft. However, Boeing noted that pilots monitored the surrounding area and the aircraft’s performance.

After receiving instructions from the trailer, the pilots and engineers onboard either manually carried out the commands or activated Auto Taxi to complete the maneuver.

Possibly Including a Commercial Jetliner

Boeing said its autonomy systems team would analyze the test data to determine if the technologies worked properly. The company added that it might expand testing to include a commercial jetliner.

No worker wants to give up a paycheck in order to get the raise and benefits they feel they deserve. In many cases, even when management and labor negotiate a favorable deal, the money lost during a strike remains lost forever.

Workers, however, have very little leverage with management when it comes to negotiating fair wages. In many cases, bosses consider workers replaceable and don't take worker demands seriously.

In many part of American history, workers could not strike without fear of being replaced. Now, with retail jobs plentiful enough that both Walmart and Target pay their workers over $15 per hour, labor has more leverage.

Replacing tens of thousands of people in this market won't be easy, so a strike could cripple the business and do long-term damage. Hopefully, reality forces both sides to come to the table before a work stoppage takes place.

Nearly 45,000 Albertsons, Pavilions, Vons, and Kroger (Ralphs) workers have voted overwhelmingly in favor of a strike.

They have not walked off the job yet, but the threat to their employers has become very real.

Supermarket workers want better treatment

UFCW Local 324 represents the impacted workers, and the union has a simple description of its goals.

""The mission of UFCW Local 324 is to improve the lives of working families and to bring economic justice to the workplace. The UFCW is one union with one voice. We are committed to changing the places where we work and the communities where we live so that all workers have the opportunity to reach the American Dream,"" it shared on its website.

The union traces its history back to 1936.

""The United Food and Commercial Workers union stands as the by-product of mergers between many other trades and professions whose members saw value in uniting in solidarity against an increasingly powerful array of corporate retailers,"" it added.

More closings:

Popular local Dairy Queen rival suddenly closing, no bankruptcy

Another big Mexican chain closing down restaurant, no bankruptcy

UPS suddenly closing more stores amid chaotic new change, layoffs

Popular fast-food burger chain closes all restaurants in key area

Now, the union is ready to mobilize its workers to strike. It shared an update on its website.

""These past two weeks, nearly 45,000 grocery workers across Southern California came together and overwhelmingly voted YES to authorize an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) Strike against Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions for breaking the law by surveilling, interrogating, threatening, and retaliating against union members,"" it shared. ""This vote is a powerful message to Kroger and Albertsons: We are fed up with their union-busting tactics and unlawful behavior that disrespects workers, silences our voices, and stalls progress at the bargaining table.""

Here's what Albertsons, Pavilions, Vons, and Kroger workers want

While those are serious charges, the core of the dispute between the workers and management is wages and working conditions.

“For four months, we’ve negotiated with Kroger and Albertsons, offering solutions to the staff shortage crisis that hurts store operations, working conditions, and customer service. The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were ‘anecdotal’, downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily,"" the union shared in an update to members.

UFCW Local 324 believes it has acted in good faith and that management has not.

“We’re at the breaking point. We are disrespected, overworked, and undervalued by Kroger and Albertsons. We’re tired of asking these corporations to invest in their workers and customers, only to see no results. We’re tired of asking the companies to respect our labor rights and seeing our co-workers intimidated,"" it added.

Kroger, which owns Ralphs, shared a statement with KTLA.

“Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading healthcare and a pension…These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer,” a portion of the statement reads.

The union has not set a strike date.

The SHP provides benefits for over 750,000 state employees, retirees, and their dependents.
“State employees and retirees cannot afford to pay more,” said “We commend Treasurer Brad Briner and State Health Plan Executive Administrator Thomas Friedman for taking on this fight to bring true transparency to what we’re paying.
That said, the Plan remains hopeful that Caremark will comply with the contract without the Plan having to resort to litigation.
She said that under the contract, Caremark is required to perform its duties, even during the dispute.","Stalled contract negotiations between CVS Caremark and North Carolina State Treasurer Brad Briner’s office, along with the State Health Plan (SHP), could result in a possible court battle, higher premiums for state employees, or even insolvency for the Plan.

The treasurer said in a recent press release that CVS Caremark, the Plan’s pharmacy benefit manager (which manages the prescription drug benefits for the SHP), since January 2017, has refused to honor its current contract with the SHP after months of negotiations and many attempts to rectify contractual obligations.

They include Caremark’s failure to provide rebates, post-sale discounts negotiated with drug manufacturers, to the Plan in the amount of tens of millions of dollars since 2023, and the company’s repeated demands would rewrite the agreed upon contract with the Plan to increase its profits at the direct expense of teachers, state employees, retirees, and taxpayers.

The SHP provides benefits for over 750,000 state employees, retirees, and their dependents.

According to Loretta Boniti, Director of Strategic Communications and Media Relations for the State Treasurer’s office, Caremark has told the Plan that the company’s corporate profits on the contract are no longer as high as Caremark wants.

Regardless, the Plan’s contract requires that Caremark pay certain guaranteed minimum payments to the Plan, regardless of actual collections from drug manufacturers. The contract also requires Caremark to pass on 100% of all rebates and calculate these rebates correctly, which is important to ensure financial stability for the Plan and reduce costs for members.

She told Carolina Journal in an emailed statement that Caremark owes at least $10.1 million for 2023 rebates and $21.8 million for 2024 rebates.

premiums may rise if CVS Caremark doesn’t take corrective action

If Caremark does not pay these amounts, Boniti said the Plan may need to require every active member to pay additional annual premiums of $100 starting in 2026. In addition, if Caremark is allowed to continue to calculate the rebates incorrectly under the contract, it could separately increase annual premiums for the rest of the life of the contract by more than $500 per member.

“Many of Caremark’s unilateral actions and demands have centered around surreptitiously and more directly boosting Caremark’s profits at the expense of the Plan by attempting to reduce Caremark’s binding guarantees to the Plan, by trying to calculate rebates in ways disadvantageous to the Plan, and by attempting to change its contractual commitments when they become less profitable for Caremark,” she told CJ. “So far in the negotiations process, each of Caremark’s demands has not aligned with the Plan’s needs for a clear, stable, and fiscally responsible solution to Caremark’s breach. Thus, the Plan must maintain its rights under the current contract and demand Caremark comply.”

The SHP Board of Trustees voted to make benefit changes to the SHP for its 750,000 members for the 2026 benefit year at their meeting in May. The next board meeting on Aug. 15 will determine the premiums for 2026.

Briner and SHP administrators said the changes were necessary to address the Plan’s projected deficit — $507 million in 2026 and between $800 million and $900 million in 2027.

“We have been working hard to address the $500 million deficit the State Health Plan is facing since my first day in office,” he said in Thursday’s press release. “Part of that work includes partnering with organizations who are committed to working alongside us. We cannot proceed with vendors who will force the Plan to raise premiums on our state employees by not honoring their contractual obligations.”

“Prescription drug costs are already sky high,” said State Employees Association of North Carolina Executive Director Ardis Watkins in the release. “State employees and retirees cannot afford to pay more,” said “We commend Treasurer Brad Briner and State Health Plan Executive Administrator Thomas Friedman for taking on this fight to bring true transparency to what we’re paying. We stand behind their efforts to hold CVS Caremark to their word.”

CVS Caremark said it’s committed to delivering on it’s contract with the SHP

CVS Caremark spokesperson Shelly Bendit told CJ in an emailed statement that while they recognize the SHP is facing a significant budget shortfall and welcome the opportunity to work together to create additional savings in their pharmacy spend, the company is committed to delivering on its contractual promises to the SHP

“CVS Caremark’s record is clear: we lower the cost of prescription drugs for North Carolina’s teachers and public employees,” she said. “According to the NCSHP, their pharmacy spend thus far in 2025 is $158 million less than initially budgeted, and they have chosen to use those savings to help keep member premiums low. In fact, just last month, the State Health Plan chose to extend its contract with CVS Caremark through 2027 based on our successful partnership, which began in 2017.”

Bendit also said that Caremark has always, and continues to, pass through to the State Health Plan 100% of rebates it receives on drugs used by its members.

She further stated that, for the past 18 months, CVS Caremark has worked in good faith to resolve the contractual dispute with the SHP.

“In early 2024, they changed their plan design and chose to exclude coverage for Humira and anti-obesity coverage for GLP-1 drugs for its beneficiaries,” Bendit added. “We do not dispute their right to change their formulary. But, the State Health Plan is demanding that it continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates tied to drugs they chose to exclude when they changed their plan design.”

She said in a show of good faith and partnership throughout this dispute, CVS Caremark has continued to pay the SHP, but “continuing to pay this windfall is unsustainable.”

Bendit said, “We continue to offer tens of millions of dollars of real additional value through other programs consistent with our goal to lower prescription costs for the Teachers and State Employees of North Carolina.”

legal action may be taken if Cvs caremark doesn’t comply with contract

Boniti told CJ that if Caremark fails to comply with clear, stable, and fiscally responsible solutions to the company’s breach, the Plan is ready to move forward to protect its members through legal action.

That said, the Plan remains hopeful that Caremark will comply with the contract without the Plan having to resort to litigation.

She said that under the contract, Caremark is required to perform its duties, even during the dispute. Additionally, Caremark would be liable to the Plan for any harm Caremark’s failure causes to Plan members.

SHP members will still have pharmacy benefits regardless of outcome

Boniti stressed that if Caremark fails to honor its commitments, the Plan is preparing alternative arrangements to make up for Caremark’s default.

“In short, regardless of the outcome of this dispute, members will continue to have pharmacy benefits,” she said.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SHP--e1749637918585-768x444.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:39:05.527360

Zone marked the first time Dyson’s chief engineer (and son of James) Jake Dyson had been project lead for a product since he folded Jake Dyson Products into the Dyson portfolio.
Indeed, “black sheep” seems a reasonable enough way to describe the Zone’s position in the Dyson product family.
In an exclusive interview, WIRED sat down with Jake Dyson, who was disarmingly open about the fate of the Zone.
“[With the Zone] we thought we could bring something better to the table than what’s currently out there,"" says Jake Dyson.","“No, this is not an elaborate April fool”. This is how WIRED first reported on the Dyson Zone at the end of March 2022. The Zone was a wild reimagining of an established product type—a big, bulky pair of headphones with an integrated air-purification mechanism that presented rather unfortunately like a high-tech gimp mask. A solution to a problem no consumer seemed willing to acknowledge existed in the first place.

Worse was to follow. December 2022: “Dyson’s hellish-looking air-purifying headset will cost $950.” And in May 2023, our review made liberal use of words like “embarrassing”, “troubling” and “derision,” and suggested the reviewer felt like “a Fisher Price Batman villain” while wearing them. “You can finally buy this bizarre, head-mounted contraption—but for pity’s sake, don’t”.

Zone marked the first time Dyson’s chief engineer (and son of James) Jake Dyson had been project lead for a product since he folded Jake Dyson Products into the Dyson portfolio. At the time, he was bullish about the Zone’s chances: “After six years in development, we’re excited to deliver pure air and pure audio, anywhere.” Since then, Dyson has gone eerily quiet on promoting the Zone, and now your chances of acquiring a pair are close to nil.

In the United States, everyone from SportPursuit to Best Buy is out of stock, and retailers show no sign of doing anything about the situation. At the time of writing, Walmart's website reckons there is one pair left throughout the entirety of the retail giant. In the UK, meanwhile, retailer John Lewis is unequivocal: “We will not receive more stock of this item”.

In fact, it seems the only place where you can still buy the Dyson Zone is at Dyson.com—and even here, the product is far from front and center. Should you find yourself able to navigate to the relevant page, you’ll have to scroll down a long way to get to an image of the headphones with their air-purification muzzle attached. Indeed, “black sheep” seems a reasonable enough way to describe the Zone’s position in the Dyson product family.

In an exclusive interview, WIRED sat down with Jake Dyson, who was disarmingly open about the fate of the Zone. So it seemed only right to discuss the Zone's fallout, look at Dyson's altogether more successful (and de facto replacement model) OnTrac headphones, and, considering that Jake’s first swing for the company has turned out to be such a high-profile miss, find out Dyson’s future plans in the audio world.

“[With the Zone] we thought we could bring something better to the table than what’s currently out there,"" says Jake Dyson. ""You get pure delivery of undisturbed air, and join that with headphones because you have to wear it on your head. So combine the two, you make it a more attractive proposition … there’s added value. It brings a bit of fun and spirit to the product. And, of course, the visor is detachable—it can be something you wear in your hour of need, and then take it off and you’ve got an audio headset.”

But it is this leap with the air-purifying Zone that many could not quite fathom: “You’ve got to wear it, so let’s make it headphones.” What made Dyson go there in particular? And, moreover, when it became clear this would be such a hard ask, many brands would rethink things—yet Dyson plowed on anyway.

“I’ll be completely honest, quite often we work in an obsessive nature,"" says Jake. ""We want this product. We want to make this thing. Sometimes before actually evaluating what the market response might be. And the market didn’t exist. So you’ve got to take those risks.”

Those risks are thrown into stark relief when you consider the market response to Zone. A product that is only two years old, yet you seemingly can’t buy it anywhere now apart from on Dyson’s site. Has Dyson quietly killed the Zone?

“First thing: Zone was completely ahead of its time,"" says Jake. ""It’s solving a problem that is quite niche—the amount of people that are neurotic about air pollution, that want to solve that problem, and are willing to spend an amount of money; coupled with the fact that it’s headphones, means your market is small. We have sold thousands. And we still have the tooling—but we’ve stopped manufacturing it. We haven’t thrown the tools away. It’s something we believe will come around in the future. It’s a brilliant product.”

It’s worth noting at this point that, outside of Dyson, the Zone isn’t universally regarded as being a brilliant product. According to one major retailer in the US, “most people read it as a gimmick or another Google Glass–type product. For price, aesthetic, and performance, the space already has highly compelling offers from brands established as experts. Why would Dyson want to do ‘that’ when what it is good at is ‘this’”?

Alan Sircom, editor of globally respected Hi-Fi+ magazine, goes even further. “The Zone is too odd, in my opinion. Anything that reminds people of wearing masks during Covid is dead in the water. I’d forgotten about it—that’s how little market penetration Dyson has [with the Zone].”

Dyson, of course, is a privately owned company and consequently not obliged to release any information regarding the success (or otherwise) of the Zone. But Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint, doubts anyone can be happy with its performance.

“Zone was the result of six years of modeling and testing, of making maybe dozens of tooling models. Even if you just assume a team of 10 people, working on this project for six years, you’re talking about a lot of expense,” Lam says. “Sound tuning is expensive, prototype testing is very expensive. It’s hard to calculate exactly, but I’m sure it will have cost tens of millions of dollars. And the result is a product with no revenue, no profit margin, and no visibility. I haven’t seen a single pair being worn in Hong Kong.”

And Hong Kong is not the only Asian territory where the anecdotal evidence for Zone is uninspiring, despite the fact that Dyson is a revered brand name in Asia, with huge presence. No major retailer can help you. At the Gain City Megastore, which at 11 stories is Singapore’s largest consumer electronics retail store, they’re not in stock. At e-Earphone, Japan’s largest headphone retailer, they’re not available either.

Yodobashi is the world’s largest chain of electronics stores, but when WIRED visited the Kyoto branch recently the Dyson Zone was conspicuous only by its absence—and this is an electronics store with a “wireless headphones” department that has a footprint comfortably larger than that of the average Japanese apartment.

Dyson launched its OnTrac regular over-ear noise-canceling headphones with no wider innovative/unnecessary/bizarre (reader's choice) functionality in July 2024, just over a year after the Zone. And as a way of entering the market with a product that doesn’t actively scare people, and of competing with established brands on a like-for-like basis, it looks like a sensible move.

Certainly, our review of the OnTrac discusses the excellent noise-canceling, the nicely balanced sound, and the interesting industrial design. We gave them an 8 out of 10, along with a coveted “WIRED Recommends” badge—a far cry from the Zone’s rating, and quite the turnaround. Jake is justifiably proud of them. Also, the move from Zone to OnTrac shows a definite path despite the poor fortunes of Dyson's first swing at audio.

“We’ve learned a lot of lessons. It would be stupid not to take things further in audio,"" says Jake. ""Looking at other headphones out there, they all just look the same: black plastic, not very nice forms. Aesthetically, there’s something deeply missing in terms of headphones. We thought we could achieve the best noise-canceling out there, and also bring something more interesting in terms of design. Engineer a beautiful product, bring customization, and more of a fashion element.”

As OnTrac has clearly sold significantly more than Zone, does Dyson consider Zone to be a product that didn’t work, and OnTrac one that did? “[We've sold] ten-fold [more]—and we launched OnTrac last July, although you could say September was when it came to life. It normally takes about six months before people realize there’s something there. OnTrac worked. [As for the Zone] we never deem anything to be a failure, because we always learn something.”

To affirm this point, Jake Dyson says that OnTrac is not merely the same headphones as Zone but with the fan system removed. “We’ve taken the advancement of the noise-canceling and enhanced it even further,” he says. “We’ve increased the software capability, so the range of sound, from the treble to the bass, is expanded.”

If WIRED knows anything about the market for premium wireless over-ear headphones, though, it’s that the space is crammed with products from profoundly well-regarded brands—brands that have won their credibility through decades of experience in many areas of the audio market. Dyson, which is starting from a base of just about zero (if you accept that the relative success of OnTrac balances out the catastrophe of Zone), will need to establish a reputation for audio excellence pretty fast if it’s going to compete.

The impressive and numerous customization options for OnTrac are a start (and more are on the way), but in the area of the market in which Dyson seems determined to compete, thoughtful industrial design is a minimum. Reputations are won and lost in every department: sound quality, obviously, and the standard of active noise-cancellation, ergonomics, extended functionality, and headline technologies are all important, too. It is a sad fact that many brands with greater audio chops than Dyson have floundered.

That’s not to say Dyson can’t make it happen, though. The company will have taken a lot of learning away from its (ultimately fruitless) N526 electric car project—and let’s not overlook the fact that Dyson is a brand that usually gets where it intends to go. The company’s hits hugely outweigh its misses—and there seems no reason to assume the combination of engineering expertise and sheer persistence that has made James Dyson a billionaire is about to desert the brand any time soon.

And perhaps most importantly of all, the whole Zone experience has led Jake Dyson to an extremely important realization—at least when it comes to headphones: “One of the things we’ve learned is obviously people really do bloody care about what it looks like when it’s on your head.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/684ac0a982cd001d6f91e6ff/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Dyson%20Zone%20test%20rig.jpg",N,,2025-06-13 12:38:34.940690

After removing all 17 sitting members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices two days ago, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has revealed eight people he has selected to join the ACIP, per an NPR report.

On Wednesday, Kennedy listed the names and short bios of the new advisers who will join the ACIP, at its upcoming meeting in late June.

The new members are Dr. Joseph R. Hibbeln, Martin Kulldorff, Retsef Levi, Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Cody Meissner, Dr. Michael A. Ross, Dr. James Pagano and Vicky Pebsworth, the report said.

Following the selection of the new members of the ACIP, Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association issued the following statement: “The AMA is deeply concerned to learn that new members have already been selected for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) without transparency and proper vetting to ensure they have the expertise necessary to make vaccine recommendations to protect the health of Americans. We urge the Administration to reconsider the removal of the 17 ACIP members who have deep expertise in vaccines so physicians can continue to have confidence in ACIP’s recommendations, which have for decades helped them make recommendations to patients about vaccination. We will closely monitor the developments of ACIP and encourage the Administration to recommit to maintaining vaccine access for all Americans.”

Who: A New York consumer filed a class action lawsuit against Philips North America LLC and Philips Holding USA Inc.

Why: The plaintiff claims Philips falsely advertises its Avent Ultra Air and Ultra Soft pacifiers as orthodontic.

Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in New York federal court.

A new class action lawsuit claims Philips falsely advertises its Avent Ultra Air and Ultra Soft pacifiers as ‘orthodontic’.

Plaintiff Kaitlin Deforest’s class action lawsuit alleges Philips falsely claims the pacifiers promote healthy oral development or improve oral outcomes for children.

“The reasonable consumer understands ‘orthodontic’ to mean that the pacifiers promote oral development,” the Philips class action states.

Deforest wants to represent a New York class and a multi-state consumer protection class of anyone who purchased a Philips Avent Ultra Air or Ultra Soft pacifier within the applicable limitation period.

Pacifiers can cause harm to children, plaintiff says

Deforest argues that no pacifier is capable of promoting oral development and that prolonged pacifier use can cause significant harm to children by interfering with the proper development of teeth and orofacial structures.

“Children who use pacifiers to continue non-nutritive sucking habits have an increased risk of dental malocclusions — deviations from the ideal occlusion (the relation between the upper jaw and teeth and lower jaw and teeth) — of primary teeth,” the Philips class action explains.

Deforest argues Philips falsely advertises its Avent Ultra Air and Ultra Soft pacifiers as orthodontic to induce consumers to pay a premium price for them.

“Defendants’ Orthodontic Pacifiers cannot, and do not, support healthy oral and orofacial development of children,” the Philips class action states.

Deforest claims Philips is guilty of unjust enrichment, negligent misrepresentation, fraud and breach of express and implied warranty and of violating New York’s Deceptive Practices Act and state consumer protection statutes. She demands a jury trial and requests declaratory and injunctive relief and an award of actual and statutory damages for herself and all class members.

Meanwhile, a California federal judge has partially dismissed a separate class action lawsuit against Philips which accuses the company of labeling its Avent baby bottles and sippy cups as “BPA free” without disclosing the potential risk of microplastics leaching.

The plaintiff is represented by James C. Shah, Laurie Rubinow and Anna K. D’Agostino of Miller Shah LLP, Melissa S. Weiner and Ryan T. Gott of Pearson Warshaw LLP and Edwin J. Kilpela Jr. and James M. Lamarca of Wade Kilpela Slade LLP.

The plan applies to the more than 11,000 company-owned stores in North America, rather than the roughly 18,000 combined company-owned and licensed stores, Starbucks said.
Niccol said early tests of the model have sped up service times and grown sales, without providing specifics.
The Green Apron model includes in-store technology to more efficiently sequence orders, as well as a dedicated barista for drive-through orders.
“We have to be critical of where we’re spending if it’s not driving toward the Back to Starbucks strategy and growth programs.”","Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol told Reuters on Tuesday that he would accelerate the rollout of the coffeehouse chain's new staffing and service model, aiming for all North American stores by summer's end, rather than the initial plan for just a third of US stores by fiscal year-end.

The plan applies to the more than 11,000 company-owned stores in North America, rather than the roughly 18,000 combined company-owned and licensed stores, Starbucks said.

Niccol says the model is a foundational element of his turnaround strategy for the company, as he bets on an improved in-store customer experience to reclaim the sales growth that has eluded Starbucks in recent quarters.

Niccol said early tests of the model have sped up service times and grown sales, without providing specifics. “We’ve learned, and now we know what we need to do, so let’s scale it,” he told Reuters at the company's three-day leadership summit in Las Vegas on Tuesday.

The Green Apron model includes in-store technology to more efficiently sequence orders, as well as a dedicated barista for drive-through orders. Starbucks rolled out the service changes to 700 stores initially. During the company's April 29 quarterly earnings call, Niccol said it would be introduced in a third of US stores by fiscal year-end.

Niccol took over as Starbucks CEO in September with a plan to return the chain to its coffeehouse roots, focusing on the in-store experience and away from a reliance on mobile and to-go orders, in what the company calls ""Back to Starbucks.” The goal is to get baristas to get customers their orders in four minutes or less.

He did not share any financial figures about the cost of the Green Apron model's deployment, but said the company would host an investor day in 2026. The Las Vegas summit, the company's first since 2019, is hosting more than 14,000 managers and other company leaders.

Analysts and investors have wondered how long Niccol will need to turn the company around. Shares have gained 11% over the last five years, compared with an 88% rise in the broad-market S&P 500. TD Cowen recently downgraded its rating of Starbucks to ""hold"" from ""buy"", saying in part that it believed Niccol's turnaround would take longer than expected to deliver results.

Niccol said the transition will take time. Starbucks has not issued annual guidance, and Niccol told investors in an earnings call earlier this year that earnings-per-share “shouldn’t be used as a measure of our success” at this stage, instead pointing to in-store metrics like average wait times for orders. He said the transition's effect on earnings would be temporary.

On Tuesday, he emphasised his goal isn't to achieve short-term performance solely through cost reduction. As Starbucks increases investments in its labor and elsewhere, Niccol said he would be ""ruthless"" in cutting expenses not related to the company's turnaround. “We have to be critical of where we’re spending if it’s not driving toward the Back to Starbucks strategy and growth programs.”",https://img.resized.co/hospitalityireland/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE4XFxcLzA1XFxcLzA4MTA1MDQ1XFxcLzM2OTM5Njg0X20uanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5ob3NwaXRhbGl0eWlyZWxhbmQuY29tXFxcL2lcXFwvbm9pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj0xXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjI1NGZmNjRlOWRmZWIyM2IxZWYzNDdhNTc0YWRjMTZjMWQyNDYzMmMifQ==/starbucks-accelerates-new-staffing-model.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 15:50:21.337069

At the 2025 Starbucks Leadership Experience in Las Vegas, Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol joined founder Howard Schultz to reflect on the company’s legacy and future, per a company blog post. Niccol and Schultz highlighted the company’s “Back to Starbucks” strategy, focusing on delivering exceptional coffee, crafted by skilled baristas in inviting coffeehouses.

“When I heard you speak for the first time about Back to Starbucks, I did a cartwheel in my living room!” said Schultz to Niccol. “It’s short, it’s to the point, and it’s exactly the tip of the spear of who we should be, and who we are. And we are, above all else, a coffee company.”

“The craft of coffee has to be front and center. We must differentiate ourselves through coffee,” Schultz continued.

He concluded, “With coffee as the foundation, there are so many things we can do that create opportunities for the company, but the foundation must be coffee. Our core purpose and reason for being is to exceed the expectations of one customer and one partner at a time.”

Balancing the Needs of Starbucks Partners and Customers in Every Decision

Additionally, Schultz and Niccol emphasized Starbucks’ lasting role as a “third place,” a welcoming community space. Schultz responded, “The third place is not something we need to reinvent, it’s who we are. We are a company that is steeped in humanity, in human connection, because of all of you and the people you represent,” he added.

“Take it personal. Understand your responsibility to every customer and partner. That’s how we win,” Schultz concluded on how Starbucks can continue to change and grow in an uncertain marketplace.

The company founder reiterated his “two chairs” metaphor, emphasizing the importance of considering both partners and customers in every decision. He explained, “If a decision doesn’t exceed expectations for both, we simply don’t move forward. It’s our responsibility to honor them equally.”

He concluded his message with the following statement meant to inspire employees, shareholders, and the company’s workforce. “Our success is not an entitlement — it must be earned. I’ve never been more optimistic about Starbucks’ future. Take it back. Be true to the coffee. Be true to your partners.

The transactions took place over three consecutive days:

10 June: 419 966 shares sold for R23.17 million

11 June: 111 664 shares sold for R6.15 million

12 June: 168 370 shares sold for R9.12 million

The company stated that the share sales formed part of a portfolio rebalancing strategy, with Bagattini engaging in on-market sales.

Bagattini, who took the helm at Woolworths in February 2020 after serving as President of the Americas at Levi Strauss & Co., has become a prominent figure in the ongoing national debate about executive pay and income inequality in South Africa.

Executive pay under scrutiny

The CEO’s latest share sale comes as Woolworths continues to face growing criticism over its remuneration policies, especially at a time when many South Africans are grappling with rising living costs and stagnant wages.

According to shareholder advocacy group Just Share, Bagattini received R122 million in total compensation in 2023, making his pay 1 308 times higher than Woolworths’ lowest-paid employee, who earns R93 600 annually.

In 2024, Bagattini’s remuneration was cut to R65.3 million, a 47.7% decline, largely due to challenges facing the company’s apparel operations in South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia.

However, this figure still sparked backlash at the group’s 2024 Annual General Meeting, where over a third of shareholders voted against the group’s remuneration policy.

This was the second consecutive year that Woolworths failed to meet the 75% approval threshold required to pass its pay policy unopposed.

While the vote was non-binding, it signaled deep concern among investors about excessive executive compensation, particularly in a company battling retail headwinds.

Public reaction

“It is crucial to recognise the contribution of the extreme vertical wage gaps which characterise these companies to the country’s overall high levels of inequality,” said Kwanele Ngogela, senior inequality analyst at Just Share.

Although the CEO’s share sale represents only a portion of his total wealth, the amount exceeds what many Woolworths employees may earn in a lifetime, adding fuel to an already heated national conversation.

During day two of GroceryTech, Kroger VP of Associate and Operations Product Experience Mindy Rector discussed how technology can help engage and retain employees, explaining that the retailer ensures that its associates have tools that are intuitive and easy to use so they can do their jobs more efficiently.

“I think about when you purchase a new phone, and you get that phone home and open the box, there aren't instructions in the box, typically,” Rector explained. “And so how do we put the right tools in the hands of our associates that are just that easy, that are intuitive to use, easy to understand, require a little to no training? That really is a big portion of our goal on providing them with tools.”

Finally, Glenn Figenholtz and Chad Petersen from Lowes Foods delved into ways the grocer’s shoppers are the proverbial hub and tech tools are the spokes. “We try to bring digital to life in a way that best supplements and amplifies what we do,” Petersen said.

Using technology to convey value has proven pivotal for Lowes Foods over the past few years. “We bring it to life through ‘brown bag’ offers that are delivering the right price. We also have our little ‘Easter eggs’ that we tie in. If you pick up one of our private label products, for example, the UPC code on the back is actually shaped like a barn, which ties back to the outside of the store that you see,” Figenholtz said.

2. UNFI Delivers Solid Q3 Amid Cyberattack

News of a June 5 cyberattack at UNFI rocked the grocery retail world this week, with the wholesaler revealing that it was forced to take some systems offline, which affected customer orders. While UNFI has not yet revealed whether the attackers stole any data from the company's network, it did issue the following statement:

“We have identified unauthorized activity in our systems and have proactively taken some systems offline while we investigate. As soon as we discovered the activity, an investigation was initiated with the help of leading forensics experts, and we have notified law enforcement. We are assessing the unauthorized activity and working to restore our systems to safely bring them back online. As we work through this issue, our customers, suppliers, and associates are our highest priority. We are working closely with them to minimize disruption as much as possible.”

Meanwhile, UNFI shared solid Q3 results this week, with net sales increasing 7.5% to $8.1 billion in Q3 compared with the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a 4% bump in wholesale unit volumes, including the benefit of new business with existing and new customers, as well as inflation. This performance was led by natural product growth.

Gross profit was $1.1 billion, a $62 million increase, or 6.1%. The gross profit rate in the Q3 was 13.4% of net sales compared with last year’s 13.6% of net sales. The decrease was primarily driven by lower product margin rates and business mix, partly offset through supplier programs and lower shrink.

3. Suit Filed Against Grocery Outlet for Deceptive Pricing

A class action lawsuit was filed on June 2 against Grocery Outlet alleging deceptive sales strategy. OCJ Law P.C., along with co-counsel, filed the lawsuit on behalf of Oregonians, claiming that Grocery Outlet marketed and sold products, including near-to-term items, to the state’s consumers through a ""coordinated scheme of fake savings and made-up reference prices"" — vaguely attributed to ""Elsewhere"" — violating Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.

The complaint provides photo evidence from recent transactions that demonstrate Grocery Outlet's practice of displaying fabricated price comparisons that don't clearly identify the competitor whose price is supposedly being referenced. In some instances, the prices either don't correspond with other products sold regionally or are intentionally inflated to give the illusion of better in-store deals.

This lawsuit alleges that shoppers of the “bargain market” ended up paying roughly the same amount — or even slightly more — than if they had shopped at another store.

The grocer did not respond to PG’s request for comment.

4. Kroger, Albertsons Strike Actions Considered in 2 States

News came in this week that local unions representing 45,000 grocery store workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions locations across Southern California have voted overwhelmingly to authorize their bargaining team to call for an unfair labor practice strike in response to alleged labor violations during contract negotiations. The Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. are the parent companies of Ralphs, Vons, and Pavilions grocery stores.

“Our message is clear: We are fed up with these corporations’ union-busting tactics designed to intimidate us and prevent us from getting the fair contract that we’ve earned and deserve,” noted the bargaining committee for UFCW Locals 324 and 770 in a statement. “For four months, we’ve negotiated with Kroger and Albertsons, offering solutions to the staff shortage crisis that hurts store operations, working conditions and customer service. The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were ‘anecdotal,’ downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily.”

The ULP strike authorization votes took place in the first two weeks of June. Negotiations are slated to resume on June 25, 26 and 27.

In Indiana, 8,000 Kroger retail workers are threatening to strike against the grocer. A contract was rejected in late May, which included wage increases that the workers deemed too low, with thousands seeing a $0.25 raise in the first year, and between $0.50 and $0.75 over the entire four-year contract. The group also shared that the tentative agreement failed to address understaffing issues.

5. Costco Expands Shopping Hours for Executive Members

Costco is introducing a new benefit for its executive members, allowing them to shop an hour earlier than standard members, according to an email to employees confirmed by USA TODAY. Upper-level members will be able to shop at 9 a.m. starting June 30.

""Our Executive Members are our most loyal members, and we want to reward them for their commitment to Costco,"" the email said. Costco also revealed that executive members will receive a monthly $10 credit for orders of $150 placed through the company's ""Same-Day"" service or Instacart.

These perks for its upper-level shoppers are part of Costco’s aim to increase the overall value of its membership, including extending gas station opening hours and lowering prices on some key items such as eggs, butter and olive oil.",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2025-06/friday_5_june_13_teaser.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:36:59.711855

Speaking in a video available to staff online, Fries said the agency would launch an immediate cost-savings plan to cut around two million euros by the end of 2025.

“But it’s really 2026 we need to prepare for, and here the bar will be much higher. We estimate that we will need to find between 10 and 12 million euros in savings,” he added.

“Of course, this is bad news, but AFP is resilient,” he continued.

AFP, one of the world’s biggest news agencies, which employs 2,600 staff worldwide, has been affected by several factors that have weighed on its financial performance.

Fears about a global recession had led many clients to enter “wait-and-see mode” and either delay investment decisions or reduce their budgets, Fries said.

Funding cuts from the US government under President Donald Trump have also hit AFP clients, meaning “some have been forced to abruptly cancel their subscriptions”, he added.

Social network giant Facebook has also terminated its fact-checking programme in the United States, for which AFP was an important paid partner.

“Thirdly, we have overestimated our ability to get Big Tech to recognise and pay for our intellectual property,” Fries said.

“We have to face up to the fact that the changing political situation in the US means that tech companies are not feeling any pressure to respect copyright,” he added.

The media industry as a whole is also contending with further declines in advertising revenues and the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

AFP’s boss did not specify whether the group would resort to job cuts to achieve its savings target, but he said “we have to question everything without taboos”.

In 2024, AFP posted a net profit of 200,000 euros on revenues of 326.4 million euros.

After seven years of growth, AFP’s revenues are set to fall in 2024 to around eight million euros less than forecast in the budget, Fries said.

Alongside its commercial income, the agency also receives funding from the French state, which amounted to 118.9 million euros in 2024.

Now, a new battle is brewing among major fast food chains, and this time the spotlight is on chicken wraps.

McDonald’s brings back the beloved Snack Wrap

McDonald’s is jumping back into the wrap game, announcing the return of its discontinued Chicken Snack Wrap after a five-year hiatus. The decision follows years of customer complaints and even a Change.org petition demanding its return.

Starting July 10, McDonald’s will roll out its new “Shack Wraps”, which feature an all-white meat chicken strip available in spicy or ranch flavors.

Why chicken wraps are booming again

Chicken remains one of the hottest fast food items nationwide — just look at the drive-thru lines at Chick-fil-A. Portable and easy to eat, chicken wraps have surged in popularity, with options now available at Wendy’s, Burger King, and more.

“I like the grilled chicken wrap and grilled nuggets,” one customer said.

Not to be outdone, Popeyes is launching its own chicken wrap this month and took to social media to throw shade, boasting that its wrap would be available before McDonald’s.

What’s the catch? Price.

From the “Doesn’t That Stink” file: the days of the 99-cent Snack Wrap are long gone.

While McDonald’s hasn’t revealed the price of its new Shack Wraps, Popeyes’ version costs $3.99, and Wendy’s wrap sells for over $5. So don’t expect a throwback price when the wraps arrive next month.

Still, for loyal fans who’ve been craving the Snack Wrap since the pre-pandemic days, many say it’ll be worth it at any price.

Lee Annecchino, global industry lead, aerospace and defence, at Capgemini, said: “Digital continuity is a critical imperative for aerospace and defence organizations to thrive in today’s challenging and uncertain geopolitical environment.
“Ultimately, it enables operational excellence, reduces product development cycle times and fosters a collaborative culture, setting A&D players up for long-term success.
Around a third (34%) of respondents said their organisations have already reduced costs, with 13% cost reduction on average attributed to digital continuity.
In addition 30% of organisations have already shortened time to market and 18% have accelerated product development cycle times.","The aerospace industry is projected to boost investment in programmes to advance digital continuity, according to a new report from The Capgemini Research Institute.

The findings of an extensive industry survey of 179 organisations in 16 countries have been released ahead of next week’s Paris Air Show in the The strategic edge: How digital continuity drives business outcomes in aerospace and defence report.

Capgemini’s research found that 77% of aerospace and defence leaders believe improving digital continuity will accelerate production ramp-up by driving shorter time to market, with a 13% reduction on average

In addition more than 8 out of 10 (86%) defence organisations surveyed for the report recognised the need to integrate AI and gen AI into their engineering and product development processes.

In 2024, aerospace and defence organisations on average allocated 2.1% of their annual revenue to digital continuity initiatives, to ramp up production, accelerate development cycles, reduce operational costs, and stay agile amid global pressures.

This is expected to increase to 3.4% by 2028, in the context of rising costs, supply chain instability, and geopolitical movement.

Lee Annecchino, global industry lead, aerospace and defence, at Capgemini, said: “Digital continuity is a critical imperative for aerospace and defence organizations to thrive in today’s challenging and uncertain geopolitical environment.

“If it is embraced as a way of working, it will help organisations increase productivity and free up key resources from the waste created by disconnected systems and data.

“Ultimately, it enables operational excellence, reduces product development cycle times and fosters a collaborative culture, setting A&D players up for long-term success. Business leaders clearly recognize this and as a result have been ramping up their investments in these initiatives.

“In order to leverage the full potential, A&D organisations must focus on building interoperability across systems, enabling robust data management and adopting a comprehensive change management strategy.”

Capgemini said the seamless integration of data and information across all stages of the product lifecycle, linked to the external partner ecosystem is emerging as a critical enabler of business transformation in the sector.

It added digital continuity helps organisations “to ramp up quickly, driving many business benefits”.

Around a third (34%) of respondents said their organisations have already reduced costs, with 13% cost reduction on average attributed to digital continuity.

In addition 30% of organisations have already shortened time to market and 18% have accelerated product development cycle times.

The report concludes: “In order to thrive, aerospace and defence organisations must continually evolve in terms of skills, processes, technologies, security methods, and compliance policies.”",https://www.aviationbusinessnews.com/resources/uploads/2025/06/Capgemini-Report-.webp,N,,2025-06-13 10:24:53.788419

As evidenced rather dramatically by the National Grid substation fires that shutdown Heathrow Airport back in March, the UK power grid needs major work, as is the case in just about every Western nation.

Hyperion Robotics will design and build the foundations in Finland before shipping them to the University of Sheffield for testing, with the company already having delivered the first batch to the academic institution.

Subsequently, National Grid will conduct further tests on the foundations at the company’s Deeside Centre for Innovation, in North Wales. According to National Grid, the research hub is the first such facility in Europe “where assets associated with electricity networks can be tested off-grid, 24 hours, seven days a week”.

Hyperion Robotics claims that, over the course of a decade, the substation foundations could save over 700 tons of concrete and reduce carbon emissions by over 300 tons, while still costing slightly less than conventional construction methods. Funding for the project was provided by the Network Innovation Allowance (NIA), managed by the UK Government’s Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem).

In a press release about the partnership between Hyperion Robotics and National Grid to 3D print low-carbon concrete substations for the UK power grid, Fernando De los Rios, the CEO and founder of Hyperion Robotics, said, “Collaborating with National Grid, one of the world’s largest utility companies, marks a pivotal moment for Hyperion Robotics as we advance our mission to help the industry build smarter and greener. This partnership accelerates our efforts to decarbonize the construction sector through cutting-edge engineering and low carbon 3D-printed concrete structures. Through this collaboration, National Grid is setting an inspiring global benchmark for innovation and sustainability in the energy sector.”

Dr. Muhammad Shaban, National Grid Electricity Transmission’s Lead Innovation Engineer, said, “Our collaboration with Hyperion Robotics is a real step forward in achieving more innovative construction practices which align with our bold and ambitious commitments on sustainability. This trial of low-carbon 3D printed alternatives to concrete for substation foundations is the first of its kind in the UK, and has the potential to transform construction activities across the industry.”

This is one of the most logical uses of AC I’ve encountered, and there could hardly be a better choice for the foundations’ deployment than the UK. As evidenced rather dramatically by the National Grid substation fires that shutdown Heathrow Airport back in March, the UK power grid needs major work, as is the case in just about every Western nation.

The UK government is very aware of that state-of-affairs: around the same time as the Heathrow shutdown, Ofgem fast-tracked over $5 billion in funding to help update the UK power grid in alignment with the UK’s decarbonization goals. Thus, the timing would suggest that, if the initial project that National Grid and Hyperion Robotics are collaborating on proves successful, there will be strong momentum behind attempts to scale the project in the near future.

For Hyperion Robotics, success with the project could potentially give the company both the incentive and the means to expand its operations into the UK. If that turns out to be the case, a scaled-up version of the project based on more localized construction capacity could lead to even greater rates of carbon emission reductions.

Consumers still want their seats inside Starbucks. | Photo courtesy of Starbucks.

A few weeks ago, we were in New York City. We had about an hour to kill and needed to spend time on our laptop before an appointment. And so, like many people, we looked for a Starbucks.

We could not find a seat. We visited one location. All the seats were taken. We used our app to find another location. No seats there. It was only when we got to a location inside an office building lobby that we were able to sit down, but that 30-minute game of Find a Seat in a Starbucks wasn’t all that pleasant.

We were therefore not surprised to hear from the company that it pulled out some 30,000 seats from its stores, largely since the pandemic. Nor were we surprised that it is now putting those seats back, because there is demand for them, enough that the chain can quantify just how much a single seat makes.

It’s the latest lesson from Starbucks. The chain went too far in its bid to cater to the takeout customer, and in the process abandoned what made the brand Starbucks.

The coffee shop giant is hardly alone in this.

Restaurant chains spent much of their time after the pandemic adjusting to what they saw as a new normal. As consumers shifted so much of their visits to takeout and delivery, companies stopped focusing on in-store customers and instead worked to push takeout, delivery and drive-thrus.

There’s certainly plenty of evidence to suggest that this was the right move. After all, consumers are taking their food to-go in nearly three-quarters of visits, according to the National Restaurant Association. That’s up from two-thrids before the pandemic.

The post-pandemic world has also brought us a new generation of chains—mostly beverage-focused brands—that don’t have seats at all.

Given the expense of opening a restaurant, and the need for brands to generate a return on their new locations, it made sense to shrink boxes and devote energy toward where consumers were visiting the most. Why install a nice seat when customers won’t use it?

In Starbucks’ case, focusing more on that takeout customer was a financially rewarding decision.

The brand’s drive-thrus generated long lines. It boasted one of the best mobile ordering apps in the business. Most of its sales came from members of the chain’s loyalty program. There is only so much business a coffee shop chain can get from customers who spend an hour checking email on their way to a meeting.

But consumers still need the service restaurants provide. They yearn for connection, a phrase we heard probably thousands of times during the Starbucks Leadership Experience event this week.

Consumers may not always use the in-store services, but they want them to be there. Or, in the terms of Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, “when they pick up their mobile order, they’re going to pick it up in the world’s best coffeehouse.”

McDonald’s and its franchisees before the pandemic remodeled much of the chain’s interiors, even though we knew at the time that the brand catered mostly to drive-thru customers. That remodel has remained a competitive advantage for the chain. Consumers want to visit restaurants they feel good about.

In focusing so much on takeout, restaurant chains have forgotten what they were created to be in the first place. They became food factories, intent on getting people their food and moving them on.

But we’ve seen time and again lately, in the success of brands like Chili’s and Texas Roadhouse, that customers will pay for good experiences. And even these drive-thru-only concepts like Dutch Bros are built on the service they’re providing.

A restaurant visit isn’t just about getting a meal or a beverage. It’s about giving yourself that one special moment during the day, even if that moment is brief. Brands shouldn’t forget that, because consumers haven’t.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-06/background/Starbucks%20inside%20shop.jpg?VersionId=GR42HsRcZ06p5do2qVnMdjB5utxOkeFz,N,,2025-06-13 13:36:03.997059

The province’s Ministry of Labour found that Jones and her two businesses charged the workers between US$7,900 and US$12,000 to secure work permits and jobs at a Canadian Tire location in Toronto, The Globe and Mail reported.

None of the workers were aware at the time that charging recruitment fees is unlawful. Between 2023 and 2024, eight workers filed complaints with the ministry over how they were hired to work at the Canadian Tire store.

Previously, a Canadian Tire store in Toronto started being investigated by both provincial and federal authorities following allegations of mistreatment and financial exploitation of employees hired under Ottawa’s Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program.

Earlier this year, Canadian Tire announced it will be closing some stores under its Atmosphere brand as part of a four-year restructuring strategy.

Entities ‘functioned as one comprehensive and unified business’

The Ontario Ministry of Labour fined Jones $2,000 and ordered two companies she owns—Allison Jones Consulting Services Inc. and AJ Immigration Group Inc.—to reimburse the foreign workers up to a total of $150,000, according to the report.

Jones has 30 days to appeal the decision, which was issued on May 15.

The recruiter has maintained that the decision was made “in error” and that she operated lawfully because her businesses were separate entities, with fees charged by the immigration consultancy, AJ Immigration Group.

However, the ministry found that Allison Jones Consulting and AJ Immigration Group were associated, as they were commonly owned and managed by Jones, and shared employees who worked out of the same office in St. Albert, Alta.

“Although the information provided by the employer alludes to the fact that two businesses operated under different entities, it does not change the fact that both functioned as one comprehensive and unified business, and must be treated as one,” the decision stated, according to The Globe and Mail.

The decision also noted that Jones tried to skirt the law by “having fees fall under AJ Immigration Group Inc.” after each stage of the recruitment process.

‘A small business cost’

Despite the decision against the recruiter, labour lawyers and immigration experts are criticising how the law does little to prevent exploitation of foreign workers.

“Ultimately, $250 is a small business cost for an unscrupulous recruiter or employer, or a licence fee for breaking the law,” said John No, staff lawyer and interim director of the Parkdale Legal Clinic, in The Globe and Mail’s report.

It’s also problematic that the law requires foreign workers to file complaints against bad employers or recruiters if they become victimised, said Chris Ramsaroop, assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto and an organiser with Justice for Migrant Workers, in the same report.

“This case against Allison Jones began because the workers filed complaints with the ministry. What the ministry should do now is attempt to get compensation for all foreign workers who ever paid fees to this recruiter – but that’s unfortunately not how the system works.”

Recently, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested two individuals for illegally recruiting foreign workers and a third for human trafficking.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0363_638854132507471429.png,N,,2025-06-13 09:18:11.426605

Current armed conflicts serve as a stark reminder of the critical importance of maintaining substantial stockpiles of weapons, personnel, and ammunition. This presents a major challenge for European defense manufacturers, who have traditionally focused on producing complex, high-tech weapon systems in small quantities.

How can the industry make the leap to mass industrialization?

What short-term solutions can be implemented to scale up production of existing equipment?

And how can the product lifecycle be reimagined to better integrate manufacturing and ramp-up considerations?

Accelerating Production: A Long-Term Endeavor

Industrial ramp-up is not a new challenge for defense stakeholders, particularly in the aerospace and space sectors. For years, production management has been a central concern. However, recent conflicts—most notably the war in Ukraine—have reignited the urgency, highlighting the reality of high-intensity warfare and the critical need for mass production.

This demand now confronts European manufacturers historically focused on high-end, small-series technological equipment, primarily for export. The production apparatus must now adapt to a new strategic landscape, while contending with significant constraints: production lines designed for precision rather than volume, and legacy designs from the 1980s and 1990s that are often incompatible with modern digital tools and manufacturing methods.

Meeting this imperative requires a profound transformation of industrial models—from design processes to manufacturing capabilities.

“The defense sector must transition from a kind of small-batch high-tech craftsmanship to full-scale industrialization. If I were to use an analogy, I would say it’s like moving from luxury watchmaking to premium mass market”, Andreas Conradi, Head of Defense Europe.

Many manufacturers operating in both civilian and military markets have historically concentrated their efforts on the civilian segments, driven by strong growth dynamics in sectors such as naval, aerospace, and space. This focus has led to a pronounced separation between civilian and military activities—reinforced by defense secrecy requirements and cultural factors—limiting the transfer of experience and industrial synergies between the two domains.

In this context, meeting the current surge in demand requires reactivating production lines and increasing throughput—a lengthy and difficult process that cannot easily be accelerated. Timelines are further strained by the loss of critical skills (due to retirements, outsourcing, and post-COVID effects) in a sector with high technical demands, where the time required to build expertise is significant. Recruitment challenges are also exacerbated by mandatory security clearance procedures—which can take up to a year—and by the sector’s limited appeal to certain talent profiles.

Finally, the ecosystem remains highly fragmented, with a dense network of SMEs with limited investment capacity. This hampers the ramp-up of the supply chain, especially since digital continuity between stakeholders remains weak, making it difficult for major contractors to monitor progress effectively.

Finally, the ecosystem remains highly fragmented, with a dense network of SMEs According to Matthieu Ritter, Head of Aerospace & Defense France, “We are seeing a consolidation movement in the sector, which should accelerate around major manufacturers and the arrival of dedicated investment funds. But all of this takes time.”

Between Lean and Digital Pragmatism

According to Andreas Conradi, “Production ramp-up is probably the most complex issue for the defense sector, because you have to change everything: how you define needs, manage spare parts, design systems, produce them, organize the supply chain, and so on.”

To tackle this major challenge, three levers can be activated in the short and medium term:

Capacity Increase and Productivity Gains

This involves boosting capacity and improving productivity per assembly line through the reintroduction of lean practices. Many ramp-up projects have already been launched, such as adding extra teams to enable 24/7 operations. However, Elodie Régis notes: “This lever has already been activated in most organizations, with limited results due to recruitment difficulties and because the entire production ecosystem must be mobilized—logistics, quality assurance, maintenance, methods teams, etc.”

Expanding Existing Lines

This consists in duplicating certain stations identified as bottlenecks. “However, this already involves higher level of work on buildings and infrastructure, and presents complexity in execution while maintaining ongoing production”, adds Elodie Régis.

Optimizing Overall Production Organization

Complementary to the first two levers, this includes shortening the critical path with suppliers, consolidating the supply chain, and integrating elements of digital transformation when they can quickly deliver productivity gains without compromising capacity. For example, we are seeing the implementation of “single source of truth” architectures, consolidating all ramp-up stakeholders into a single, secure, and shared data lake. This approach optimizes the use of available data, facilitates planning and tracking of parts, tools, skills, and operations, identifies breakpoints and risk areas in the supply chain, enables “supplier recovery” initiatives, and secures valuable productivity gains.

“Ultimately, building new factories or production lines is such a long-term endeavor that it cannot be the sole answer to the defense sector’s immediate ramp-up needs”, concludes Elodie Régis.

Learning from Today to Better Prepare for Tomorrow

Defense industrial programs must meet exceptionally high technological, technical, and security requirements, which have not always accounted for industrial constraints. One of the key challenges for future programs will be to reconcile and more closely align the worlds of engineering and manufacturing in order to simplify and standardize designs. This includes, for example, integrating best practices from the civilian sector, using model-based systems engineering (MBSE), leveraging simulation and collaborative tools, and harnessing recent digital innovations—such as generative artificial intelligence and cloud computing—with digital continuity at the core of the process.

The defense sector must also anticipate and incorporate new constraints into its roadmap to successfully scale up production, including:

The growing role of low-cost or “disposable” systems (e.g., drones), which challenge traditional mindsets,

Circular economy principles, to address future tensions over strategic resources (steel, titanium, aluminum, etc.) between civilian and military sectors,

The rationalization of long and vulnerable supply chains, with significant sovereignty implications.

The name honors the company's roots, reflecting its original name prior to its acquisition by Medtronic in 2001, and a deep 40-year history of being at the forefront of transforming diabetes care around the world.

""Our journey began in 1983, when visionary entrepreneur Alfred E. Mann founded MiniMed and revolutionized diabetes care with many first-of-its-kind innovations that pushed the boundaries of care and helped simplify life with diabetes for countless people around the world,"" said Que Dallara, current EVP and President of Medtronic Diabetes and Chief Executive Officer designate of MiniMed. ""We're thrilled to honor this rich 40-year legacy with a name that carries deep meaning and trust. As we step forward into this new and exciting chapter, we'll focus relentlessly on fulfilling our Mission to make diabetes more predictable so everyone can embrace life to the fullest.""

Managing diabetes can feel draining and exhausting due to the constant mental and physical demands to keep glucose levels in a healthy range. Every meal and activity requires careful calculation — counting carbs, adjusting insulin, and monitoring levels to prevent dangerous low and high blood sugars that can result in both short- and long-term complications. The company's Mission is inspired by the desire to introduce more stability and predictability with technology that helps push diabetes management into the background.

That includes Key Payton, who has been with the company for over a decade and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1960. ""When I was just three years old, doctors told my parents I likely wouldn't live past 10. But here I am, 65 years later, defying the odds and living my best life. I've experienced firsthand how the company has transformed diabetes care and personally helped me beat those early odds in astounding ways,"" said Payton. ""I'm forever grateful for the hope and support they've given me every day for nearly three decades. Today, I'm a proud user of the MiniMed™ 780G system,** and my Time in Range§ has never been better. I'm finally sleeping through the night and worrying less about my diabetes — it's freeing.""

Based in Northridge, California, the Diabetes business is a passionate team of more than 8,000 employees dedicated to pushing the boundaries of innovation, developing breakthrough technologies that reduce burden, enhance quality of life, improve health outcomes, and redefine standards of care.

Medtronic is targeting completion of the planned separation within 18 months of the initial announcement, subject to customary conditions and legal requirements including consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies.

(CSE: NERD | OTCQB: NOSUF), a 30-year-old Canadian firm that has quietly built a nationwide army of “nerds” to protect more than 12,000 small and mid size enterprises—and marquee clients such as Canadian Tire, Home Hardware and Tim Horton’s—from the dark web’s relentless data hunters.

Founded in 1995, the London, Ontario–based company touts sovereign data custody as its north star, offering tailored cybersecurity packages that Regan describes as “nerd care,” delivered through a proprietary ERP platform that routes 30–50 fresh service requests a day to its technicians. “Everyone is a target,” he tells InvestorNews host Tracy Hughes, rebutting the notion that smaller players can hide in the crowd. While the residential and SME segments remain the core, Nerds is scaling up: its new NOS Technical Services division already places IT contractors in seven U.S. states and for multinational pharma firms. In the fiscal year ended May 31, unaudited revenue rose “about 15-plus percent” year over year, setting the stage, Regan says, for the first profit month since the 2018 IPO “by the end of this calendar year.”

The company’s latest quarterly filing underscores that trajectory, reporting six-month revenue of C$5.5 million—up 5 percent—with fresh initiatives such as Nerds On Line (unlimited remote IT support) and a Canada-U.S. marketing push aimed at turning what Regan calls “an incredibly attractive share price” into broader investor recognition. “Nobody calls because they’ve got smoke,” he quips. “People call because there’s a fire,” and Nerds’ mission is to “stop them cold in their tracks.”

The need for (dual) speed We hear stories of leaders pushing an “all or nothing” version of AI transformation: Use AI to cut functional headcount or die.
Just as you wouldn't expect to transform your company culture overnight by edict, it's unreasonable to expect something different from your AI transformation.
With every AI acceleration win, we uncover more places to improve hand-offs, activation speed, and business decision-making.","Ask technologists and enterprise leaders what they hope AI will deliver, and most will land on some iteration of the ""T"" word: transformation. No surprise, AI and its “cooler than you” cousin, generative AI (GenAI), have been hyped nonstop for the past 24 months.

But therein lies the problem.

Many organizations are rushing to implement AI without a grasp on the return on investment (ROI), leading to high spend and low impact. Without anchoring AI to clear friction points and acceleration opportunities, companies invite fatigue, anxiety and competitive risk. Two-thirds of C-suite execs say GenAI has created tension and division within their organizations; nearly half say it’s “tearing their company apart.” Most (71%) report adoption challenges; more than a third call it a massive disappointment.

While AI's potential is irrefutable, companies need to reject the narrative of AI as a standalone strategy or transformational savior. Its true power is as a catalyst to amplify what already works and surface what could. Here are three principles to make that happen.

1. Start with friction, not function

Many enterprises struggle with where to start when integrating AI. My advice: Start where the pain is greatest. Identify the processes that create the most friction and work backward from there. AI is a tool, not a solution. By mapping real pain points to AI use cases, you can hone investments to the ripest fruit rather than simply where it hangs at the lowest.

For example, one of our top sources of customer pain was troubleshooting undeliverable messages, which forced users to sift through error code documentation. To solve this, an AI assistant was introduced to detect anomalies, explain causes in natural language, and guide customers toward resolution. We achieved a 97% real-time resolution rate through a blend of conversational AI and live support.

Most companies have long-standing friction points that support teams routinely explain. Or that you’ve developed organizational calluses over; problems considered “just the cost of doing business.” GenAI allows leaders to revisit these areas and reimagine what’s possible.

2. The need for (dual) speed

We hear stories of leaders pushing an “all or nothing” version of AI transformation: Use AI to cut functional headcount or die. Rather than leading with a “stick” through wholesale transformation mandates or threats to budgets, we must recognize AI implementation as a fundamental culture change. Just as you wouldn't expect to transform your company culture overnight by edict, it's unreasonable to expect something different from your AI transformation.

Some leaders have a tendency to move faster than the innovation ability or comfort level of their people. Most functional leads aren’t obstinate in their slow adoption of AI tools, their long-held beliefs to run a process or to assess risks. We hired these leaders for their decades of experience in “what good looks like” and deep expertise in incremental improvements; then we expect them to suddenly define a futuristic vision that challenges their own beliefs. As executive leaders, we must give grace, space and plenty of “carrots” -- incentives, training, and support resources -- to help them reimagine complex workflows with AI.

And, we must recognize that AI has the ability to make progress in ways that may not immediately create cost efficiencies, such as for operational improvements that require data cleansing, deep analytics, forecasting, dynamic pricing, and signal sensing. These aren’t the sexy parts of AI, but they’re the types of issues that require superhuman intelligence and complex problem-solving that AI was made for.

3. A flywheel of acceleration

The other transformation that AI should support is creating faster and broader “test and learn” cycles. AI implementation is not a linear process with start here and end there. Organizations that want to leverage AI as a competitive advantage should establish use cases where AI can break down company silos and act as a catalyst to identify the next opportunity. That identifies the next as a flywheel of acceleration. This flywheel builds on accumulated learnings, making small successes into larger wins while avoiding costly AI disasters from rushed implementation.

For example, at Twilio we are building a customer intelligence platform that analyzes thousands of conversations to identify patterns and drive insights. If we see multiple customers mention a competitor's pricing, it could signal a take-out campaign. What once took weeks to recognize and escalate can now be done in near real-time and used for highly coordinated activations across marketing, product, sales, and other teams.

With every AI acceleration win, we uncover more places to improve hand-offs, activation speed, and business decision-making. That flywheel of innovation is how true AI transformation begins to drive impactful business outcomes.

Ideas to Fuel Your AI Strategy

Organizations can accelerate their AI implementations through these simple shifts in approach:

The most impactful AI implementations don’t rush transformation; they strategically accelerate core capabilities and unlock new ones to drive measurable change.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt69509c9116440be8/bltb903aa33db8b2181/684734c2fd3e28c1f4ea1369/Innovation-peshkova-adobe1.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-13 09:18:27.899546

“Now, it’s coming out and sharing and celebrating that with the team and the industry.” Whalar is the creator agency within the broader Whalar Group holding company.

Previously, Cronk and Harman served as presidents of North America and EMEA, respectively. While the CEO positions are not regional, Cronk and Harman will continue to focus on their respective markets. Cronk and Harman joined Whalar in 2018.

“We’ve been performing at this level and collaborating in this way as co-leaders of Whalar agency for a long time,” Cronk told ADWEEK. “Now, it’s coming out and sharing and celebrating that with the team and the industry.”

Whalar is the creator agency within the broader Whalar Group holding company. Until now, Whalar Group cofounders Neil Waller and James Street have been CEOs of the agency, and the two will continue to lead Whalar Group. Cronk and Harman will report to Waller.

Harman said she will continue to help educate brands on how to work with creators. “What we see in Europe is that there’s often a lot of scrutiny around the work that we do,” said Harman. “It’s a case of really educating, helping clients really get comfortable with this space.”

In the US, Cronk said that more brands are making long-term investments into creators. “It used to be like a one-year ambassador program, but the brands that are succeeding are thinking longer and deeper than that, and bringing creators in almost as if they were full-time employees,” she said. “That’s where we see huge success.”

Creators are becoming bigger brands

The Whalar Group owns a variety of companies in the creator economy space including Lighthouse, a campus for creators; Sixteenth, a global talent agency; and Moby Ventures, a creator-centric ventures studio.

The Whalar Group recently secured new funding from tech entrepreneur Marc Benioff, Shopify, and Hollywood producer Neal H. Moritz, valuing the company at a $400 million, according to Bloomberg. The Whalar Group has also acquired three companies: Business of Creativity, Sixteenth, and C Talent.

Promoting Cronk and Harman to lead the agency will help the growth continue, Cronk said.

“It allows Neil and James to focus on other businesses and the ambitions they have,” said Cronk. “There will be more acquisitions, growth, and innovation. Emma and I will focus purely on innovating for Whalar.”

The war for influencer marketing expertise is growing. Publicis Groupe recently acquired Captiv8 and also owns Influential. Stagwell has also acquired influencer marketing shops in the past year.

Whalar is aiming to differentiate itself by solely focusing on creators—specifically how creative is used in influencer marketing.

“It’s almost impossible to be culturally relevant without embracing creators,” said Cronk. “We’re a modern creative agency. We tell stories that are really compelling. They captivate and convert communities.”",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jo-cronk-emma-harman-ceo-2025.jpg?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-06-13 11:29:44.357216

By offering these exclusive benefits, Costco is improving their members' shopping experience and responding to the growing demand for convenience.
Executive members not only get discounts, but also enjoy a more comfortable and personalized shopping experience.","Starting June 30, 2025, Costco will offer new exclusive benefits for their executive members. These changes will improve the shopping experience for customers who choose this membership option. With these new advantages, Costco aims to remain an attractive option for frequent shoppers.

Costco offers several benefits

One of the main benefits is early access to the stores. Executive members will be able to enter one hour before standard members. This will allow them to start shopping at 9 am, before the store fills up with customers. This advantage is useful for taking advantage of the best deals and fresh products and gives them time to avoid crowds during the busiest hours of the day.

Another attractive benefit is the $10 monthly credit that executive members will receive for purchases through Instacart. This credit is valid for same-day delivery orders with a minimum value of $150. Home delivery has become increasingly popular, and Costco aims to make this service easier for their members. This monthly credit will offer additional savings to those who prefer not to go to the store.

This benefit is in addition to the 2% annual reward on purchases that executive members already receive. With this reward, members receive an annual check that represents 2% of the total of their purchases. This is one of the most valued features of the executive membership. Although the membership costs $130 per year, double the standard membership of $65, the additional benefits make it attractive for many frequent shoppers.

Costco focuses on their regular customers

The new benefits are designed to attract frequent shoppers to choose the executive membership. In addition to early access and the Instacart credit, members enjoy additional discounts and a more personalized experience. Costco keeps looking for ways to reward their most loyal customers, these new benefits reinforce that focus.

These changes also respond to new shopping trends. With the growth of e-commerce and home delivery services, Costco aims to adapt to current consumer preferences. By offering these exclusive benefits, Costco is improving their members' shopping experience and responding to the growing demand for convenience.

For those who make large and frequent purchases, the executive membership remains an excellent option. Early access and additional benefits like the Instacart credit justify the annual membership cost. Executive members not only get discounts, but also enjoy a more comfortable and personalized shopping experience.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-de-tienda-costco-estados-unidos-con-mujer-muy-feliz_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-06-13 12:39:51.911481

“When I joined (Instacart) in 2021, I had the luxury of being on the board for six months,” Simo said.
Read more: OpenAI Picks Instacart Chief Fidji Simo to Oversee Operations Entering the Big Leagues Simo’s new role at OpenAI positions her at the center of one of the most consequential companies in AI.
At Instacart, Simo launched a framework that included AI training for employees and designated internal “advocates” to help teams adopt new tools.
As OpenAI prepares for its next wave of growth, Simo’s appointment signals a shift toward developing AI products for the mass market at scale.","Speaking at the VivaTech 2025 conference in Paris — her first public interview since being named OpenAI’s CEO of applications in May — Simo said the opportunity for growth is “100x — and that’s just the beginning.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in a post on X announcing her hiring, called Simo an “exceptional” candidate to help OpenAI “scale the next 10x or 100x.”

During a fireside chat on Thursday (June 12), Simo laid out a bold vision for how AI could become an “ambient layer” in everyday life, reshaping how billions of people work, learn, shop and manage their health.

Simo, who will officially join OpenAI in August, will report directly to Altman and lead the charge to translate the company’s cutting-edge research into mass-market applications.

“My team is really in charge of taking the incredible research breakthroughs that the company generates and really making sure that we distribute them to society in the best possible way, so that people see the benefits of AI,” said Simo, whom the interviewer called the most powerful French woman in tech. “That gets reflected into an empowerment in their lives.”

Simo said AI is going to empower everyone to “reclaim some of our time through productivity. It’s going to make us express our creative potential even more through all the creative tools. It’s going to allow us to get access to knowledge and wisdom that in the past was limited to the most fortunate among us. It’s going to allow us to gain power in many different ways.”

Simo joins OpenAI at a pivotal time. Its recent acquisition of io, the AI devices startup of former Apple designer Jony Ive — along with OpenAI’s foundation models, plus Simo leading applications — will create a multi-layered company with a diverse product line.

Simo brings to OpenAI a track record of consumer tech transformation. At Instacart, she said she took the pandemic-era food delivery company and rebuilt it into a data-rich platform powering the digital transformation of grocery shopping.

“When I joined (Instacart) in 2021, I had the luxury of being on the board for six months,” Simo said. “It was right after the peak of the pandemic, and a lot of people were wondering if grocery delivery was going to be just a fad or something really enduring.”

Instead, Simo saw a longer-term opportunity: help brick-and-mortar grocers digitize every aspect of their operations, from supply chain to advertising.

Under her leadership, Instacart launched a retail media network and AI-enhanced shopping tools, including the “Caper Cart” — a smart shopping cart that uses computer vision and AI to identify items as consumers add them while suggesting other products and offering them personalized promotions in real time.

Asked why fully automated stores like Amazon’s Go have not gained traction, Simo said that customers “do not want a store that’s completely devoid of people.” Instead, these technologies can help augment human labor. “It’s really the magic combo, and we see that as augmentation and not replacement.”

Internally, Simo spearheaded a company-wide AI adoption initiative at Instacart, pushing every team to identify repetitive tasks and explore AI solutions. The results: 87% of code written by engineers is now AI-assisted, marketing teams use AI to turn existing food images into videos and reused in new campaigns, the PR team used AI journalist personas to practice press interviews, and the legal team uses AI to parse through documents like contracts.

“The entire company is AI-enabled,” Simo said.

Entering the Big Leagues

Simo’s new role at OpenAI positions her at the center of one of the most consequential companies in AI. While ChatGPT made AI into a household word, the future of OpenAI goes well beyond the chatbot and large language models, according to Simo.

“You can start thinking of AI as an ambient layer,” Simo said. “Not just enabled through GPT, but potentially through devices.”

OpenAI already touches hundreds of millions of users, but Simo believes there is growth potential in enabling “a team of agents at their service” — helping individuals in everything from education to healthcare and daily activities.

However, agentic AI, while full of promise, isn’t quite ready for prime time. A June 2025 PYMNTS Intelligence report said that “with adoption of generative artificial intelligence nearly universal across large companies, excitement is building around agentic AI, which goes one step further to make its own decisions and act fully autonomously.”

“Yet current GenAI implementations consistently require human oversight, raising questions over how agentic AI, a next-generation software that operates entirely free of humans, can reach its full potential,” the report added.

The report, “AI at the Crossroads: Agentic Ambitions Meet Operational Realities,” said at this stage, chief operating officers are still not ready for autonomous AI agents that can reliably perform high-risk tasks without human supervision.

Asked why so many enterprise AI efforts fail, Simo pointed to a common pitfall: implementing AI for its own sake. Companies need to start with problems they want to solve; every company has tasks that are tedious or repetitive that AI can tackle, she said.

At Instacart, Simo launched a framework that included AI training for employees and designated internal “advocates” to help teams adopt new tools. She said this approach could inform how OpenAI scales its own applications — embedding AI into real workflows and building the infrastructure for broad societal adoption.

Simo also brings a personal motivation to her work in AI. Diagnosed with a “pretty nasty” neuroimmune condition in 2020, she founded a research institute to collect health data in hopes of accelerating medical discoveries using AI. She sees AI’s near-term potential in democratizing access to health knowledge — helping the 90% of people who say they struggle to understand medical information.

As OpenAI prepares for its next wave of growth, Simo’s appointment signals a shift toward developing AI products for the mass market at scale.

“ChatGPT reaches hundreds of millions of people, but really, AI should change lives for everyone,” Simo said. “We need to be reaching billions. And then once you reach billions, you also need to make sure that each person can find value in multiple use cases.”

By Casey Hall and Nicoco Chan

SHANGHAI, June 13 (Reuters) – “Blind box” toymaker Pop Mart, which has seen frenzied sales worldwide for products related to its ugly-cute Labubu character, opened its first jewellery store in Shanghai on Friday.

The jewellery concept store, called Popop, sells accessories adorned with Pop Mart’s top-selling characters, including Labubu, Molly and Skullpanda.

While Chinese consumption remains subdued in the face of a prolonged property downturn and sluggish economy, Pop Mart’s affordable and adorable toys have remained in high demand both at home and abroad, driving its share price up more than 200% so far this year.

Investor Zhang Zhanming, 34, who owns Pop Mart stocks worth 100 million yuan ($13.92 million), flew from his base in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing for the opening to check out the new store type and decide whether to increase his shareholding in the company.

“I believe that the pricing and target audience for this brand are particularly well-suited, and I am confident that Pop Mart could potentially become China’s version of Disney,” Zhang said, predicting that the company’s market cap could double from its current $45.65 billion valuation.

Along with some Disney characters and others related to anime, comics and popular video games, Pop Mart’s characters are seen as fulfilling what has been called “emotional consumption”, which sees young consumers spend on affordable luxuries that bring joy into their lives.

Fang Ke, 35, who has a birthday coming up this month decided to treat herself to a 699 yuan Labubu bracelet at the opening.

“I’ve loved Pop Mart for a long time; it’s good-looking, brightly coloured, and also has a visual impact,” she said. “My daughter likes it too.”

At Popop, prices start at around 350 yuan for charms or a simple silver ring, and go as high as 2699 yuan for necklaces adorned with metallic models of the characters. Most pieces are priced at under 1,000 yuan.

ID37,Starbucks,2025-06-13 10:45:38+00:00,The Daily Star,"Once a status symbol, Starbucks cuts prices on its tea-based drinks to woo Chinese consumers",ANN/The Straits Times,,,,,https://www.thedailystar.net/news/asia/news/once-status-symbol-starbucks-cuts-prices-its-tea-based-drinks-woo-chinese-consumers-3915991,"Starbucks promoted its new drink prices on its official social media channels in China, branding it as a ""summer special price"".
Prices of its coffee drinks remain unchanged, ranging from 30 yuan for an Americano to 41 yuan for a cheese latte.
In recent years, Starbucks has been losing market share to major Chinese coffee chains such as Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee, which offer cheaper drinks for customers to grab on the go.
A user on the Chinese social media platform Weibo wrote: ""If it didn't reduce prices, soon it won't be able to sell a single cup of drink.""
Around 2021, nimbler Chinese competitors like Luckin adopted aggressive price cuts and started launching new flavours, giving Starbucks a run for its money.","""If I'm not at Starbucks, I'd be on the way to Starbucks.""

This was a common saying among netizens in China more than a decade ago, when patronising the American coffee chain was associated with being trendy and cosmopolitan.

But how times have changed for Starbucks, which has lost its social cachet as well as its status as the largest coffee chain in China to Chinese rival Luckin.

Now, in a rare move, the US coffee giant – which has long defended its premium positioning in China – has cut prices for its tea-based beverages this summer.

About a dozen of Starbucks' non-coffee drinks, which include Frappuccinos, iced shaken teas and tea lattes, now cost as little as 23 yuan ($3.21) each after an average 5 yuan discount, in a promotion effective from June 10 at its stores across China.

Starbucks promoted its new drink prices on its official social media channels in China, branding it as a ""summer special price"". Prices of its coffee drinks remain unchanged, ranging from 30 yuan for an Americano to 41 yuan for a cheese latte.

In recent years, Starbucks has been losing market share to major Chinese coffee chains such as Luckin Coffee and Cotti Coffee, which offer cheaper drinks for customers to grab on the go.

Its promotion comes as the Chinese tighten their belts amid a weakened economy, protracted property slump and difficult job market.

While Starbucks had previously said it would not engage in price wars, it has introduced smaller drink sizes and coupons to appeal to a wider consumer base in its second-biggest market after the US.

The prices of its drinks are now closer to those from upscale Chinese tea chains and Luckin, with the latter offering aggressive discounts all year round.

Checks by The Straits Times showed that the price of iced tea on Luckin's app was 26 yuan, but consumers have to pay only 14 yuan after discounts.

Starbucks China chief growth officer Tony Yang said on the company's official account on Chinese social media WeChat that its improved ""non-coffee"" products will, along with its core coffee offerings, ""better meet the diversified needs of customers"".

The promotion is aimed at the afternoon segment, with the company marketing it as ""coffee in the morning, non-coffee in the afternoon"", he added.

While Starbucks' official promotional materials steered clear of calling it a price cut, the price change was picked up by netizens and Chinese media outlets, some of whom called it an overdue move by the normally ""aloof"" company.

A user on the Chinese social media platform Weibo wrote: ""If it didn't reduce prices, soon it won't be able to sell a single cup of drink.""

Starbucks, which entered the Chinese market in 1999 and once had a store inside the Forbidden City in Beijing, has struggled to reinvent itself after its business, which largely relied on dine-in experiences, was severely disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Around 2021, nimbler Chinese competitors like Luckin adopted aggressive price cuts and started launching new flavours, giving Starbucks a run for its money.

Luckin also capitalised on the pick-up and delivery model by downsizing its stores into small ones with no seating, drastically saving on rent, labour and maintenance costs.

By 2023, Luckin overtook Starbucks as the largest coffee chain in China, in terms of sales and number of stores.

As at March 2025, Luckin has more than 24,000 outlets and reported a net revenue of $1.2 billion, while Starbucks has around 7,750 stores and generated about US$740 million in net revenue.

Starbucks is not the only foreign coffee brand facing pressures in China. British coffee chain Costa, which entered China in 2006 and once competed closely with Starbucks, has been quietly closing down stores across China and has only around 500 stores.

Foreign brands like Starbucks have lost their lustre among Chinese consumers, amid rising scepticism towards Western consumerism and a greater emphasis on cultural pride.

Starbucks is now distancing itself from Luckin and focusing instead on lower-tier cities and counties, where the brand still retains a more premium status and competition is less stiff.

The US giant has also been looking to revive its business in China by selling stakes in it. In May, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources, that it has started the process by contacting several potential investors.

Allison Malmsten, a public research director at research firm Daxue Consulting, noted that lowering prices is always a risk, as it is harder to keep customers if prices rise again. ""But given the circumstances, it seems like a measured risk from Starbucks,"" she told ST.

Olivia Plotnick, who runs social media marketing agency Wai Social in Shanghai, said while Starbucks was a pioneer in China's coffee industry, chances for it to come up tops again are slim as it is in a tough spot.

Its current strategy to capture market share in lower-tier cities is a race against local brands, which will be able to move faster and cut prices, she noted.

She told ST, ""Eventually, (Starbucks) will face the same problems that it does in places like Shanghai with high competition. So in order to survive, it will have to consider how to position itself.""",https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/06/13/straight.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 13:36:08.231888

With a trade war underway, Americans worried about costs have flocked to the used clothing market.
Kristen Hester, who manages Out Of The Closet, a thrift store with 24 locations, says customers now expect thrift stores to offer more.","St. Petersburg, Florida — Brooklyn Karasack loves to thrift and sew. She thrifts in her hometown of St. Petersburg, Florida, and then uses her grandmother's sewing machine to whip up her fantastical creations.

""This is probably $3 or something like that,"" Karasack told CBS News, referring to an old pillowcase she turned into a tote bag as an example of her work.

Her creativity has paid off. The 28-year-old, who works as an auditor during the day, has more than 800,000 online followers, who watch her take her thrift store finds on her social accounts and turn the old items into new ideas.

Karasack said she got into thrifting and sewing after deciding to stop buying fast fashion. Fast fashion, a term for low-priced, trendy clothes made by companies like H&M, Forever 21 and others, has become a big contributor to textile waste, producing 92 million tons a year, according to Global Fashion Agenda's Pulse of the Fashion Industry report. A piece of clothing is worn only seven to ten times, on average, before being thrown out, according to Uniform Market.

She said that after she started thrifting, she hasn't ""bought anything fast fashion."" Karasack isn't alone in turning toward thrifting.

With a trade war underway, Americans worried about costs have flocked to the used clothing market. Thrifting is an easy way to avoid tariffs, with prices generally 50% to 75% off of retail. The secondhand market is expected to more than double by 2028, growing 6.4 times faster than the broader retail sector, according to a 2024 resale report from Thredup, an online thrift store.

Small businesses are also jumping on the trend — Sew Pinellas offers beginner sewing classes for DIYers of all ages. They've been full since they began last year.

Sewing jumps in popularity during economic slowdowns, data from Statista shows that 26% of 18- to 29-year-olds engage in some form of sewing activity.

Kristen Hester, who manages Out Of The Closet, a thrift store with 24 locations, says customers now expect thrift stores to offer more. Customers used to think of thrifting happening in a charity shop where everything is thrown around and they had to dig through dirty bins.

Hester grew up thrifting with her mom and likens it to a treasure hunt, but notes back then it wasn't as popular as it is today.

""Thrift stores had stuff that the regular retail stores just didn't have,"" Hester said. ""...You think of a small little charity shop, where maybe everything is thrown around; you have to dig through dirty bins.""

The 38-year-old says that her store is ""more of a curated, boutique experience.""

Out of The Closet, like many secondhand shops, is mission-driven. When you shop or donate at Out of the Closet, 96 cents of every dollar made goes to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation's HIV prevention and treatment services, the shop said.

She adds, ""It really has created this really cool kind of niche community where everybody is just so accepting. Everybody's in the same mindset. Everyone is happy to be there.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/12/a1c2f8e2-961f-4959-89af-40f5ad6b4844/thumbnail/1200x630/11a26fc352cb78504bd32cf9fc94b982/1749769108273.png?v=d2f497bd9339ad99d2e0559414346698,N,,2025-06-13 11:28:47.269699

Chipotle debuted a new limited-time Chipotle Honey Chicken at restaurants in North America and Europe beginning in March.

The chain said it makes the protein option with ""fresh chicken hot off the grill, seasoned with savory Mexican spices, in a marinade of seared, smoked chipotle peppers and a touch of pure honey.""

In late April, Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright told analysts and investors during the company’s first-quarter earnings call that the Chipotle Honey Chicken has ""had a higher mix than any other limited-time offer, even surpassing its two-market pilot test."" He also said it was ""driving incremental transactions"" and guest feedback ""has been overwhelmingly positive.""

The Chipotle Honey Chicken previously underwent ""stage-gate testing"" in Nashville, Tennessee, and Sacramento, California, last year, per a press release.

Sonic

Sweet Topped Lemonades debuted at Sonic Drive-In locations across the U.S. in early June.

The new drinks, released in time for summer, come in three different flavors: Classic Lemonade, Strawberry Lemonade and Blueberry Lavender Lemonade.

They ""combine tart, all-natural lemonade with velvety smooth cold foam on top,"" Sonic said.

In late May, the company also brought back Watermelon and Lemonberry Slushes, which it described in a press release as ""frequently requested on social media fan-favorite"" flavors.

They were previously available at Sonic in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Burger King

A limited-time menu that draws inspiration from the soon-to-be-released ""How to Train Your Dragon"" live-action movie arrived at Burger King in late May.

Its launch, part of a collaboration with Universal Pictures, came a couple of weeks ahead of the film’s theatrical debut, which is slated for Friday.

The items in the ""How to Train Your Dragon""-inspired limited-time menu include a Dragon Flame-Grilled Whopper, Fiery Dragon Mozzarella Fries, Viking’s Chocolate Sundae and Soaring Strawberry Lemonade, according to the chain.

BURGER KING HAS LIMITED-TIME ‘HOW TO TRAIN YOU DRAGON’-THEMED MENU ITEMS AHEAD OF MOVIE RELEASE

Popeyes

Hot new menu items at Popeyes include its chicken wraps, fried pickles and pickle-glazer chicken sandwich, according to the chain.

Popeyes Chicken Wraps, a competitor to the McDonald's returning snack wrap, came out in early June and will be available for a limited time while supplies last, Popeyes said in a press release.

They feature a chicken tender, lettuce, shredded cheese, pickles and one of three spreads. The options for the spreads are Classic, Spicy or Honey Mustard.

The fried pickles and Popeyes pickle glaze chicken sandwich debuted at the beginning of April.

They are part of a limited-time pickle-themed menu that the chain rolled out nationwide at that time.",https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/06/0/0/mcdonalds-burger-king-signs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-06-13 08:20:34.613302

Blades said uncertainty, higher input costs and higher interest rates continue to hamper tractor sales.
Total farm tractor sales through May hit 80,332, down 12.8% from the first five months of 2024.
Self-propelled combine sales — measured as a separate category by AEM — were down 43% to 1,253 year-to-date.
In 2024, tractor sales fell 13.2% compared to the previous year, while combine sales dropped 24.3%.","New farm tractor and combine sales continue to lag in 2025 after a slowdown that started the previous year, according to the latest report from the Association of Equipment Manufacturers.

Soft sales led savvy dealerships to focus on service and aftermarket upgrades such as precision agriculture technology, said Curt Blades, AEM vice president.

SS Equipment New Holland, headquartered in Pasco, Wash., focused on deals with winter overhaul programs, said Jay Herbers, corporate sales manager. The economy has been tight, limiting sales of tractors, combines, swathers and bailers, he said.

“The biggest thing in this economy is selling your business as a whole,” Herbers said.Salesmen need to promote the dealership’s parts and service out in the field.

Chad Hochstetler, general manager for Rickreall Farm Supply, a Kubota dealership in Rickreall, Ore., said farmers and ranchers were making investments in their existing equipment.

“People are trying to be resourceful,” he said.

In some cases, that means seeking versatility and using tractors as “Swiss Army knives.”

“How can we make our tractors do more things? That’s some of what is occurring in the market right now,” Hochstetler said.

Hochstetler was hopeful sales would improve in the third and fourth quarter of 2025 as agricultural uncertainty regarding trade and other matters is resolved.

Herbers said there was optimism.

“When you’re able to get a quote to a guy, it’s trending upwards,” he said.

Farmland Tractor in Tangent, Ore., sells tractor parts and when the economy is tough, parts sales increase, said Ty Raschein, whose family owns and operates the business.

“Nobody is buying new, they’re fixing old, so that’s better for us,” he said.

Raschein said margins are tight across the country, including in Linn County, Ore., where grass seed isn’t moving.

Blades said uncertainty, higher input costs and higher interest rates continue to hamper tractor sales.

Preliminary data also indicates that the fleet age for tractors and combines is relatively young, with many farmers, ranchers and rural residents making larger purchases within the past eight years.

During the pandemic, for example, dealerships experienced record high sales of tractors less than 40 hp as people were stuck at home.

Combine sales are sharply down, but were strong just a few years ago thanks to advancements with precision agriculture.

AEM data showed sales of tractors from 40 hp to 100 hp suffered the smallest percentage drop year-to-date in 2025.

Herbers said mid-range tractors sales for machines from 75 hp to 100 hp were decent, in part because ranchers use those machines and beef is a hot segment.

Hochstetler said the sweet spot for sales at Rickreall Farm Supply was from 40 hp to 80 hp.

“It isn’t bad. It’s down slightly,” he said.

Total farm tractor sales through May hit 80,332, down 12.8% from the first five months of 2024.

Self-propelled combine sales — measured as a separate category by AEM — were down 43% to 1,253 year-to-date.

In April 2025, HM Land Registry reported the processing of 1.81 million applications – down from March’s 1.97 million and a month-on-month decline.

Yet, over the past 18 months, HM Land Registry’s well documented backlogs have introduced unwelcome uncertainty to even the most carefully structured transactions.

In April 2025, HM Land Registry reported the processing of 1.81 million applications – down from March’s 1.97 million and a month-on-month decline. While volumes remain substantial, the challenge lies not in throughput alone, but in the persistent delays impacting complex applications. This includes new title registrations, lease variations and transfers of part – staples which are often seen in major site transactions. Delays create uncertainty as to entries burdening and benefiting parcels and priorities can inevitably end up in the wrong order. Creating further delays and issues with the registration gap – please see our earlier article Top 10 Tips: The Registration Gap issued on 06 October 2022 for tips and tricks to deal with this.

In this context, the Land Registry’s recent push to digitise and modernise its platform is a welcome, if overdue, development. From Autumn 2025, we can expect to see HMLR roll out enhanced automated checks to assist with identifying common administrative errors prior to submission. Their aim - to reduce requisitions and the need for corrective follow-up. These changes are estimated to save applicants over 300,000 hours annually. Alongside this, firms will be given access to data dashboards tracking avoidable submission errors. This will aim to share data on typical errors within law firms to increase the speed of the service they can provide. Alongside this, the Land Registry will be offering free training and support to firms aimed at improving accuracy and overall processing times.

These improvements sit within a broader government mandate to modernise the Registry’s operations and improve transparency – an agenda that includes greater public access to ownership data and digitalisation of title information. For our development clients, this could see significant improvements in pre-acquisition diligence and reduce reliance on time-intensive manual searches. Whilst HMRL has said that the release of requisition data has been “supported by trade bodies and industry and aligns with the government’s priorities for HM Land Registry”, this of course raises the question as to whether in practice these changes will speed up the registration of transactions. On the whole, it seems that these are welcomed improvements which are thought to make the entire process more efficient, cost effective and in turn, cut down the currently lengthy process.

That said, these are foundational changes, not quick fixes. HMLR was initially targeting a 12-month maximum age for any open application by March 2025. This has of course been exceeded and the Land Registry are currently reporting that almost all applications are completion within 15 months, with the minority taking a few weeks longer. As such lawyers and clients alike must continue to factor registration delays into deal structuring – particularly where title registrations are tied to funding drawdowns, phased site delivery, or contractual longstops. It is as important as ever to consider strategies to mitigate the impact of current delays including; obtaining indemnity insurance to protect against risks associated with unregistered interest or potential title defects, careful planning as to the sequence of property transactions including coordinating completion dates of related transactions to ensure that potential Land Registry delays do not impact subsequent deals and the active management of requisitions and queries raised by the Land Registry. Prompt responses to requests for additional information or documentation from the Land Registry can significantly assist with preventing further delays down the line.",https://www.charlesrussellspeechlys.com/contentassets/3112ec991d72441b8e23e709c62f3a5d/2025-06-13-09-12-47-983-684beb8f9c2246d842ff12d1/,N,,2025-06-13 11:28:51.599753

However, Abbott and Medtronic are best positioned among top competitors, with majority of their 510(k)-approved neurology devices manufactured exclusively in the US, respectively, according to the MedSource Database of GlobalData.

GlobalData’s report, “Impact of US Tariffs on the Medical Devices Industry: Strategic Intelligence,” reveals that 96 per cent and 57.1 per cent of Abbott and Medtronic’s 510(k)-approved neurology devices manufactured exclusively in the US.

The Market Analyzer on GlobalData’s Medical Intelligence Center reveals that the global neurology device market reached $13.9 billion in 2024, with the US accounting for a dominant $8 billion.

GlobalData estimates that over half of the neurology devices market value is concentrated among five major manufacturers, each with major US operations and a global sales presence. While some companies are shielded from tariffs due to robust domestic manufacturing operations, others may need to reassess their pricing, sourcing, and logistics strategies to stay competitive.

Neurology devices range from emergency-use tools like neurovascular coils and catheters to discretionary products such as neurostimulators for chronic health conditions. While demand for life-saving neurological care remains steady, tariffs are driving up production costs and adding strain to global supply chains. At the same time, hospitals under financial pressure may delay upgrades to diagnostic systems like EEGs or reduce purchases of non-urgent outpatient therapies. As a result, manufacturers face the greatest risk not from declining procedure volumes but from increased exposure to manufacturing disruptions, especially for products reliant on imports or complex logistics.

Ashley Clarke, Senior Medical Device Analyst, GlobalData, comments, “Even with tighter budgets, hospitals cannot delay urgent neurological procedures like stroke interventions or shunt placements. The real pressure is upstream, with tariffs squeezing margins and compelling companies to rethink where and how their devices are manufactured.”

Abbott and Medtronic continue to expand their domestic capabilities, strengthening their ability to weather tariff impacts and scale efficiently within the world’s most lucrative neurology market. In contrast, Boston Scientific and Stryker face higher exposure, producing just 17.4 per cent and 25.5 per cent of their neurology devices exclusively in the US.

Clarke adds: “As tariffs increase cross-border costs and global supply chains become more unpredictable, these companies may need to revise pricing models or restructure logistics to remain cost-effective.”

In this shifting landscape, companies that align research, production, and pricing strategies with the realities of US manufacturing and reimbursement policy are best positioned to protect market share and take the lead in an increasingly complex US neurocare market.

Clarke concludes, “Companies with a strong US manufacturing base will be less exposed to price volatility, more consistent on delivery, and in a stronger position when negotiating with hospitals or group purchasing organisations. That is a big advantage in a high-cost, high-stakes field like neurology.”",https://cdn.expresshealthcare.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12180817/Neurology-Devices_2024_GlobalData.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:25:45.630594

As the Industrial Revolution and the decline of the fur trade reshaped the market, Hudson’s Bay’s trading posts gradually evolved into retail stores. From the 1880s onward, the company built a nationwide department store network. Over the decades, it acquired several Canadian chains, including Simpsons, Woodward’s and Zellers, while its signature multi-colored stripes became an enduring emblem.

The company briefly ventured into Europe, acquiring Germany’s Galeria Kaufhof in 2015 and taking over the Netherlands’ V&D retail network in 2017. However, facing financial losses, Hudson’s Bay divested its European operations by 2019.

Ninety-six stores affected

In Canada, Hudson’s Bay’s decline began over the past decade. The company operated 80 Hudson’s Bay stores positioned in the upscale segment, along with three Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks OFF 5TH outlets. Business further deteriorated after the pandemic, with the company citing the fast-changing retail landscape and elevated U.S. tariffs as key challenges.

Owned since 2008 by U.S.-based NRDC Equity Partners, the company sought creditor protection in April 2025 under Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), citing difficulties meeting its financial obligations. Headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, the company failed to secure funding for a potential restructuring and ultimately moved toward full liquidation.

In recent weeks, stores sold off remaining inventory ahead of a June 1 closing date. The closures led to 8,300 job losses across retail locations, with nearly 1,000 additional layoffs expected in offices and logistics centers by mid-June. Local media reported widespread emotion among longtime employees— some with three decades of service— and among customers who associate Hudson’s Bay with family memories.

However, the brand name, emblems and logos will live on. In mid-May, Canadian retail group Canadian Tire acquired the rights for 30 million Canadian dollars (19 million euros).

A “strategic and patriotic” choice

""It is difficult to witness the final days of another iconic Canadian retailer. While the circumstances are unfortunate, we are proud to step in for customers. This decision is both strategic and patriotic,"" said Canadian Tire president Greg Hicks. The company plans to integrate Hudson’s Bay’s signature stripes into its private label products and has reportedly submitted bids for several store leases.","https://media.fashionnetwork.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=cover,width=600,height=600,format=auto/m/7639/09c6/f00e/36e3/e71a/993d/2c0a/f76a/eff8/a291/a291.jpg",N,,2025-06-13 11:28:55.783418

Neither Google nor HP have revealed the price of a separate Google Beam license to gain access to Zoom or Google Meet.","Contents

HP is the first company to launch a hardware product based on Google's 3D video call technology, Google Beam. The technology is designed to ensure that users perceive a “lifelike image” of the person in front of them. However, at 25,000 US dollars, HP's solution is not cheap.

Anzeige

Light field screen, many cameras, and AI

The HP Dimension has a 65-inch light field display with 8K resolution and six high-speed cameras that are embedded in the frame of the housing to create an almost spatial video image of the user. A “state-of-the-art volumetric AI video model” is used for this effect, which converts “2D video streams into realistic 3D”, explains Google.

To create a 3D effect of the other person, an optical layer is attached above the panel, which apparently consists of microlenses. These can influence the direction of the light rays emitted by the panel to create a spatial view of the person. Spatial audio and adaptive backlighting are intended to create a stronger immersion effect.

In development for years

The technology was first presented by Google at I/O 2021 as Project Starline. The prototype shown at the time, which consisted of a 65-inch 8K panel, speakers, microphones, lighting, a computer and several camera sets, was the size of a separate dining area in a restaurant. Since then, the company has been able to reduce the technology so that it is not larger than a flat-screen TV.

In the course of I/O 2025, Google renamed the 3D video conferencing solution Google Beam and brought HP on board as its first hardware partner. Google had previously conducted test runs with the conferencing solution within its own company and with an early access program. Salesforce, T-Mobile and Wework, among others, took part in the program to gather practical data on how the solution can help colleagues working remotely to stay connected.

Anzeige

According to Google's initial findings from 2023, the interaction between people during video calls via the 3D video conferencing solution should be more interactive. In terms of non-verbal behaviors, participants were more animated and used significantly more hand gestures, head nods and eyebrow movements.

Participants also reported a significantly better ability to perceive and communicate non-verbal behaviors than in conventional video conferencing. According to Google, the conversational dynamics were also higher than in conventional calls.

However, the 3D conferencing solution has one major limitation: only one person per screen can take part in the video calls, as face and eye tracking, among other things, does not work with multiple people.

25,000 dollars just for the hardware

HP's Dimension is intended for use in companies, costs 25,000 dollars and will be launched in the USA, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, and Japan this year, according to the manufacturer. Companies such as Salesforce, Deloitte and NEC have already agreed to bring Google Beam into their offices.

Incidentally, the purchase price of the 3D video conferencing system only includes the hardware. Google charges an additional amount for the software license required for video calls. Neither Google nor HP have revealed the price of a separate Google Beam license to gain access to Zoom or Google Meet.",https://heise.cloudimg.io/bound/1200x1200/q85.png-lossy-85.webp-lossy-85.foil1/_www-heise-de_/imgs/18/4/8/7/5/2/4/1/google-beam-hp-dimension-2119c7cad86e8049.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:20:17.215088

That was enough to beat out nationwide competitors with far larger footprints and knock McDonald’s fries down to second-to-last place.

The rankings, compiled by restaurant furnishing company Seating Masters, evaluated 25 locations per brand and found that In-N-Out’s daily fresh-cut fries stood out for their quality and consistency.

Shake Shack came in second with a 3.7 rating, followed by Freddy’s Frozen Custard & Steakburgers at 3.59.

Southern regional chain Bojangles placed fourth for its seasoned fries, while Chick-fil-A’s waffle fries secured fifth — praised for their crispiness and sauce-friendly design.

McDonald’s and Burger King didn’t just miss the top spots — they nearly hit rock bottom. Burger King managed a 1.92 average across 623 reviews, barely edging out McDonald’s 1.91 score from more than 1,300 reviews.

The lowest-rated fries in the country belonged to KFC, which landed dead last with a 1.77 average across 175 reviews from 50 locations.

Here are the top 10 rankings, based on the data compiled from Seating Masters:

• In-N-Out Burger – 3.86

• Shake Shack – 3.7

• Freddy’s Frozen Custard & Steakburgers – 3.59

• Bojangles – 3.51

• Hardee’s – 2.86

• Checkers/Rally’s – 2.84

In the Philips Best organisation, the sleep apnoea affair could never have arisen.” “Philips made little mention of this, but the instructions for use of the apnoea devices said: “clean with washing-up liquid”.","In the late 1990s, Philips confronted a greater challenge than ever before: the company had to reinvent itself. In the second part of a trilogy, Studio040 examines the bureaucracy within Philips and the part it played in the emergence of the disastrous sleep apnoea affair. ‘It had long been known at the top of the company that those devices were inadequate,’ he says.

According to interviews conducted by Studio040 with those well-versed in the company, Philips is less and less the firm that enabled Eindhoven to grow into the technological hotspot it is today. The Eindhoven-based company now mainly makes headlines with new announcements of reorganisations and problems with the FDA—the US Food and Drug Administration—over products that do not function as they should.

Layoffs

In February this year, Philips announced that it was cutting 90 jobs in the Netherlands, including positions in Best and Eindhoven. This news followed an announcement made six months earlier that 400 jobs would be eliminated in the Frisian town of Drachten.

Earlier, in early 2023, the company had revealed plans to cut 6,000 jobs globally—of which 1,100 were in the Netherlands. This came just a few months after October 2022, when Philips announced 800 job cuts in the Netherlands as part of a global reduction of 4,000 positions.

Over two years, Philips reduced its workforce in the Netherlands by 20 per cent, while worldwide job losses amounted to around 13 per cent. To put this in perspective: during the large-scale reorganisation known as Operation Centurion in the 1990s, about 16.5 per cent of jobs were lost, with 45,000 out of more than 300,000 employees being given notice.

Spaghetti

The gigantic bureaucracy that had to be done away with in the 1990s is still there at the company. “Boonstra said Philips was spaghetti and he wanted to turn it into asparagus. To transform the company from a big tangle of strands into a manageable number of streamlined divisions. It never succeeded, that much is clear, but it is much less spaghetti,” says Jan Post, who was a top executive at Philips for many years.

That picture is also confirmed by former employee Rens van Leeuwen, who worked at the company for 44 years and served on the works council for six years. “What keeps coming back is a far too thick management layer at the top. At Philips, there are 10 to 15 management layers between the shop floor and the top. If you want to manage 100,000 people and you have a maximum of 10 per manager then five management layers are enough.”

Brilliant Minds

‘If you want to report a problem to management, you’re told it’s someone else’s responsibility and passed from one manager to another,’ says Van Leeuwen. ‘Responsibilities are spread across far too many managers, so it’s unclear to them whether they have the authority to make a particular decision.’

‘As a result, a lot of good ideas from the shop floor end up being discarded. Philips is still able to attract brilliant people, but you have to give them meaningful work—and at the moment, that happens all too rarely. The real expertise is on the shop floor; as a manager, your job is to guide the output. If you never set foot in a lab, you’ll never truly understand electrical engineering.’

“A number of products and functions are placed outside the Netherlands. This has been the case for some time, Poland, Batam in Indonesia, China, India and if things don’t go well there, then people no longer know how the lines of communication are within the company and how to make contacts internationally. Then you have the distance barrier, language barrier, culture barrier, and the knowledge barrier,” Van Leeuwen continues.

‘But remarkably, this also plays out in the Netherlands,’ says Patrick Meerts of the FNV. “In Drachten the other day, they told me that so do not know what the organisation is like either. If your supervisor is in China or Indonesia, it’s all quite complicated. But an executive or a human resources department around the corner is past glory.”

Sleep apnoea

One of the problems that broke the company recently, the widely publicised sleep apnoea affair, is also related to this. The problems with sleep apnoea devices continued to simmer on within the company for a long time before effective action was taken.

‘The sleep apnoea problem was known much earlier,’ says Arjan Huizinga, who has been doing collective bargaining with Philips on behalf of the CNV union for more than a decade.

“If you let it fester too long, after a while you get a big pus. In my experience, they have hoped to keep it under wraps. This is not good for customer confidence. The claims world is not so big in the Netherlands but it is in the United States, where all kinds of lawyers pop up wanting money. Then the problem becomes very big and it takes years to recover from that. They should have responded to it proactively”,

Best

‘Within the development department in Best, the sleep apnoea affair was met with astonishment,’ Van Leeuwen indicates. “In Best, an incredible amount of money and time is spent on patient safety. Much of the development capacity is spent on meeting FDA requirements and the even more stringent MDR/IVDR, the European counterpart of the FDA.”

“There is a huge and influential Quality&Regulation department within Philips Best that is purely concerned with checking that all new developments, improvements and modifications are sufficiently tested according to FDA and MDR/IVDR regulations. Every developer is aware of this. In the Philips Best organisation, the sleep apnoea affair could never have arisen.”

“Philips made little mention of this, but the instructions for use of the apnoea devices said: “clean with washing-up liquid”. But Americans like to clean with ozone, which is very aggressive. Moreover, I personally think the FDA is also to blame. It could also have discovered this at the US facility where apnoea devices are developed. That’s what the whole FDA was set up for, to be able to trust that products coming onto the market can be used safely.”

Wrong acquisition

Jan Post thinks the affair is due to a wrong acquisition. “Philips bought the apnea device company in 2005 and there was a decent gross margin on this product. That’s why it was attractive to buy such a company, it was a gold mine.”

But the Philips management never managed to cash in on that goldmine, a problem that had broken the company before, Post outlines. “We don’t have great experiences with such acquisitions. We once bought Magnavox, an American television brand to gain a foothold in the United States. Americans are not the best manufacturers, there is a lot of brains and research, but production is not as good. That was also a problem then and again now.”

Post does not think the affair arose because of the company’s internal bureaucracy. “I think it was just a misguided acquisition. But it is not representative of the problems at today’s Philips. Illustrative, though? I find that hard to say. You buy a product, you misjudge the production quality, those things happen.”

Outsourcing

Another problem is that Philips outsources developments to suppliers, says Van Leeuwen. “For the development of the MRI scanner, at a certain point we had to have a special chip. Once, the company could make that itself but now we have to build knowledge together with a supplier so that not all knowledge is under Philips management anymore, NXP in this case.”

“There are very reliable and competent suppliers to Philips. Usually they are happy with development orders from Philips and usually they handle them well so that a win-win situation arises. But there always remains a risk, the same goes for the supplier by the way.”

‘High-level outsourcing is what they call it,’ says FNV’s Patrick Meers. “High-quality technology you can get another company to develop. Procurement Department will then calculate whether it is cheaper to have something developed yourself or by another company – so it is only about money. But that way, the knowledge you pay for is built up outside your own company. If that company, quits or goes bankrupt, you lose your knowledge. And those companies that are brought in often make a profit, while Philips sits bleeding.”

Commentators are divided on how much Europe’s banks will ultimately profit from the current defense boom.","Europe’s drive to rearm in the face of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been met with a shift in perception among European banks toward doing business with weapons manufacturers.

For decades, banks viewed relationships with the defense sector as “dirty money” that could damage their reputations. But that perception has changed dramatically since Feb. 24, 2022, in parallel with the European Union and its member states increasing their defense spending.

Bloomberg reported Thursday that the perceived threat from Russia, combined with US reluctance to engage fully with Europe, has prompted governments to reverse a decades-long effort to benefit from the “peace dividend” following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

With hundreds of billions of euros in the pipeline, some of Europe’s largest financial institutions are now actively preparing to support the continent’s defense sector. These include France’s BNP Paribas and Société Générale, Germany’s Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, the Netherlands’ ING Groep NV, and the European Investment Bank (EIB).

According to the report, banks are hiring staff and setting up teams that will specialize in working with defense-related government departments and companies. Bloomberg says the EIB alone is currently working on 20 separate defense-related projects. Banks are expected not only to profit from the boom in defense contracts but also to gain a reputational boost for supporting European security.

The report cites Fabrizio Campelli, head of global wealth management at Deutsche Bank, as saying the bank is “honored” to work on a €1 billion ($1.2 billion) EIB defense-related project. “We stand ready to reinforce the resilience of Europe’s security and defense,” he said.

ING’s CEO Steven van Rijswijk added, “We dusted off our policy, but we also dusted off our own mindset. From ‘No, unless...’ it has become ‘Yes, unless...,’” describing the bank’s new welcoming attitude toward credit applications from the defense industry. He said the rapid change in approach followed clear signals “from the top.”

Other banks are following suit. BNP Paribas, for example, is said to be doubling or tripling its defense-sector business, and is reportedly streamlining its internal approval process for military transactions.

According to Bloomberg, the European Commission and European governments are taking a proactive role in bringing together the defense industry and financial sector. The European Banking Federation (EBF), a lobbying group representing major European banks, has created a task force to smooth cooperation.

Meanwhile, the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, is expected to propose new measures to address obstacles the defense industry faces—particularly in financing.

Commentators are divided on how much Europe’s banks will ultimately profit from the current defense boom. So far, relatively few contracts have been signed. But bankers are preparing for a wave of business expected in the coming months.

Bloomberg notes that large defense companies rarely need loans, since government orders typically include upfront payments. But smaller firms – especially those producing drones and new military technology – will likely require significant financial support. Arnaud Journois, an analyst at the Morningstar DBRS credit agency, said Ukraine’s drone war is largely sustained by small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups that need a financial leg up.

The future looks bright for Europe’s banks. Diego de Ojeda, head of the European Commission’s Unit for Defense and Preparedness, ended the Bloomberg piece by saying, “Defense is going to be a very good business – there is a massive flow of money coming.”",https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/06/12/4f58396552b8c7af65e89366b59f5b1c.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg,N,,2025-06-13 03:10:27.764160

Candidate supply expands at sharpest rate since end of 2020

Demand for staff falls at softest rate in eight months

Pay growth strengthens but remains below historical trend

Data collected 12-23 May

Summary

The latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global, pointed to a further reduction in UK recruitment activity in May. Permanent placements fell at a slightly sharper rate, but the decline in temp billings was the slowest in six months. Concurrently, overall demand for staff fell at a notably softer rate.

The availability of candidates meanwhile rose at the quickest pace for nearly four-and-a-half years amid reports of redundancies and fewer job opportunities. At the same time, rates of starting pay increased further in May, though growth of both starting salaries and temp wages remained weaker than on average.

The report is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Hiring activity falls again, particularly for permanent staff

Recruitment activity across the UK continued to slow in May, with survey members reporting that weaker confidence around the outlook and concerns over costs had dampened staff hiring. While permanent staff appointments fell at a slightly quicker and sharp rate, the downturn in temp billings slowed since April to the softest in six months.

50.0 = no-change

Sharpest rise in candidate supply for nearly four-and-a-half years

Candidate availability continued to rise in May, with the rate of growth the steepest since December 2020. Recruiters signalled quicker increases in the supply of both permanent and temporary staff, with the former recording the sharper rate of expansion. There were frequent reports that redundancies and fewer job opportunities had pushed up candidate numbers in the latest survey period.

Vacancies decline at softest rate in eight months

The downturn in demand for staff eased notably in the latest survey period, with total vacancies declining at the weakest rate since last September. Softer reductions were signalled for both permanent and temporary vacancies, though in each case the rate of contraction was solid.

Stronger increases in starting pay

Salaries awarded to new permanent joiners increased further in May, with recruiters often noting that competition for suitably-skilled candidates had driven the latest upturn. The rate of salary inflation was the quickest seen since last August. At the same time, temp wage growth improved to a one-year high. That said, rates of inflation remained below their respective long-run averages.

Regional and Sector Variations

The sharpest reduction in permanent placements was seen in the South of England. The Midlands meanwhile bucked the wider UK trend and recorded the first increase in placements for a year (albeit marginal).

Three of the four monitored English regions registered a decline in temp billings, led by the South of England. In contrast, the Midlands recorded the first expansion in four months.

Seven of the ten monitored job categories registered lower demand for permanent staff in May. Hotel & Catering saw the sharpest reduction in vacancies, followed by the Nursing/Medical/Care and Retail sectors. The strongest uptick in demand was seen in the Engineering category.

Engineering was the only monitored job sector to record an improvement in demand for temporary workers during May. Retail meanwhile saw the steepest drop in vacancies, with sharp contractions also noted across the Executive/Professional and Nursing/Medical/ Care sectors.

Comments

Commenting on the latest survey results, Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said:

“May’s data shows very little change. Employers are still holding back on hiring, which meant last month the number of jobseekers increased at the steepest rate since 2020.

“The first half of this year has been full of uncertainty for businesses who are still trying to navigate cost pressures, technology advancements and global risks. Business leaders will want to see how the new trading agreements with the US and EU, Government spending plans and the Modern Industrial Strategy will drive forward our economic growth. To boost the jobs market employers need to feel confident about the outlook and understand how AI will impact their business.”

Commenting, Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said:

“More encouraging signs in temp billings, vacancies, and stabilising private sector demand offer a measure of optimism as we head into the second half of the year. There are early signs of promise, particularly in the Midlands, which saw its first increase in permanent placements in a year and a rise in billings after four months. Meanwhile, the downturn in temporary billings has eased further in London and the North of England.

“The big test now is whether the Spending Review convinces more employers to dance at the party by turning intent on hiring and investing into action. The Spending Review delivered a big hit in terms of eye-catching spending on technology and energy, but the lack of announcements on workforce matters is badly out of step with its desire to build a deep pool of talent.

“With the Industrial Strategy imminent, businesses are looking for more than talk of renewal, they want a clear plan for an economic revival. One that acknowledges the central role of good workforce policy – beyond just employment rights. That means putting workforce matters at the heart of the agenda, not treating it as a compliance issue.”

Methodology

The KPMG and REC, UK Report on Jobs is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Survey responses are collected in the second half of each month and indicate the direction of change compared to the previous month. A diffusion index is calculated for each survey variable. The index is the sum of the percentage of ‘higher’ responses and half the percentage of ‘unchanged’ responses. The indices vary between 0 and 100, with a reading above 50 indicating an overall increase compared to the previous month, and below 50 an overall decrease. The indices are then seasonally adjusted.

Underlying survey data are not revised after publication, but seasonal adjustment factors may be revised from time to time as appropriate which will affect the seasonally adjusted data series.

Steel giant, ArcelorMattal Liberia, promises to increase annual County Social Development Fund to $4 million for Liberia.

By Kruah Thompson

Monrovia, Liberia; June 13, 2025 – Acting CEO and chief of operations at ArcelorMattal Liberia, Anthony P. Kocken, has promised to increase the Annual County Social Development Fund to $4 million after conclusion of the third Amendment to its Mineral Development Agreement (MDA) with the Government of Liberia.

The Third Amendment to the Mineral Development Agreement (MDA) between ArcelorMittal and the Government of Liberia is a proposed revision of the existing agreement that governs operations of the company in Liberia, particularly mining of iron ore.

ArcelorMittal, one of the world’s largest steel and mining companies, has been operating in Liberia since the original MDA was signed in 2005, and amended in 2006.

The company mines iron ore primarily from Mount Tokadeh in Nimba County and exports through Buchanan Port Grand Bassa County.

However, as a major economic contributor here, employing thousands and contributing to the national budget, the company came into agreement with the Liberian Government under the third Amendment to Extend ArcelorMittal’s operations for an additional 25 years.

During this period, the company is expected to increase investment to over $1 billion, including expansion of mining operations, construction of a new processing plant in Yekepa, improvements to rail and port infrastructure, increment of production to 15 million tonnes per year, with potential to reach 30 million tonnes, and establish provisions for third-party access to the rail and port infrastructure, which is a key issue for regional integration and access by other mining companies like HPX (High Power Exploration), while addressing community development, local content, and increasing revenue sharing.

Base on this agreement, the House of Representatives passed the amendment in 2022, but the Liberian Senate withheld approval, citing concerns over lack of transparency, insufficient benefits to Liberia and local communities, issues around exclusive control of infrastructure (rail and port) by ArcelorMittal, a need for open access for other companies like HPX and Guinea’s iron ore projects.

As of mid-2024, negotiations and consultations continue, with civil society, government, and international stakeholders involved.

Speaking at MICAT regular press briefing here Thursday, June 12, 2024, Acting CEO Kocken noted that the Annual County Social Development Fund will increase to $4 million, when the Third Amendment is concluded.

On March 25, 2025, Liberia endorsed the User-Operator framework proposed in the Third Amendment to the MDA signed with the government.

He revealed that just one week ago, they stood shoulder to shoulder with the Government and people of Liberia to commission the country’s first-ever iron ore concentrator, a historic milestone that marks not just evolution of their operations, but the beginning of a new era for Liberia

He said they are not only to share what they have accomplished together, but to ignite national excitement about what lies ahead.

“This Phase II expansion is not merely a company investment; it is a national breakthrough. It is a bold affirmation that Liberia can move beyond exporting raw materials to producing high-grade, value-added iron”, Mr. Kocken said.

He recalled that in March Liberia endorsed the User-Operator framework proposed in the Third Amendment to share rail facility with other users.

AML CEO said its rail model, which is widely used for bulk commodity transport in Australia, Brazil, and Canada, has also been successfully implemented in neighboring Guinea.

AML has consented to the Rail System Operating Principles (RSOP) suggested by the Liberian government that ensures transparent and non-discriminatory rail operations.

“Today, we gather not only to share what we have accomplished together but to ignite national excitement about what lies ahead.

The Phase II expansion is not merely a company investment; it is a national breakthrough. It is a bold affirmation that Liberia can move beyond exporting raw materials to producing high-grade, value-added iron concentrate right here on Liberian soil. It is a signal to the world that Liberia is open for transformative business and serious about sustainable development.”

He added that this is the power of partnership, a partnership that over two decades has grown stronger through mutual trust, shared sacrifice, and the unwavering belief that Liberia’s future can, and will, be built by Liberians.

“We are talking about thousands of jobs created. Billions invested. Hundreds of Liberian businesses were empowered. Entire communities lifted. And an increase in national revenue from $35 million to over $125 million annually to support schools. clinics, roads, and opportunity”, CEO Kocken disclosed.",https://thenewdawnliberia.com/jepujef/2025/06/Acting-CEO-and-chief-of-operation-at-ArcelorMattal-Liberia-Anthony-P.-Kocken.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 03:09:55.574940

By Elizabeth Ireland, Times of San Diego

June 12, 2025 (San Diego County) -- More than 90 percent of voting United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 members at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions stores across San Diego County have authorized a strike if necessary, according to the union.

The vote, held June 8–11, comes amid ongoing contract negotiations between the union and grocery store parent companies Kroger and Albertsons.

The union, which represents more than 13,000 workers throughout San Diego and Imperial Counties, accuses the companies of unfair labor practices, including “surveillance, intimidation and retaliation,” during the months-long bargaining process.

“This strike authorization is not just a vote — it’s a mandate,” said Local 135 President Todd Walters. “We will not be pushed around or silenced. This vote shows that we are strong, united, and ready to do whatever it takes to win the fair contract you deserve.”

The bargaining committee has met with the companies 18 times since February, union officials said, but progress has stalled over issues such as staffing, wages and equity.

“I’ve been in every bargaining session,” said Cammy Fulton, a Ralphs worker and bargaining team member. “The companies aren’t taking us seriously. But this vote proves that we’re serious — and we’re not backing down.”

The final scheduled bargaining sessions are set for June 25–27.

More than 100,000 union grocery workers nationwide authorized a strike against Kroger and Albertsons last week. If called, it could become the largest grocery strike in modern history, disrupting operations during the industry’s peak summer season, according to Los Cerritos Community News.

In the first quarter of the financial year, H&M posted a moderate increase in sales of 3.10% to SEK 55,333 million (EUR 5,108 million).","H&M is intensifying its strategy to raise its positioning. The Swedish group, the world's number two fashion retailer, has made the leap, for the first time, to the French department store Galeries Lafayette Paris Haussmann. Through a shop-in-shop format dedicated to its H&M Adorables children's line, the fashion company and the iconic department store located just a few steps from the Opéra Garnier are creating synergies along the lines of the previous collaboration with Selfridges in London.

Surrounded by children's fashion brands such as Sergent Major or Mayoral and childcare references such as Moulin Roti or Stokke, H&M has set up its first space in the department store in the capital's 9th arrondissement. Located on the fifth floor of the Boulevard Haussmann department store, the 63-square-meter outlet is dedicated entirely to its high-end children's fashion line, Adorables, launched globally in October 2024.

This strategic opening also marks the line's second physical foray into France following its debut at H&M's flagship store on boulevard Haussmann. The proposal follows in the wake of the ephemeral corner that the Swedish giant launched several months ago at Selfridges in London, where the brand presented this line for the first time in a premium retail environment outside its own stores. For the moment, in Spain, the accessible premium line is only available through the brand's online store.

""The setting of Galeries Lafayette in Paris Haussmann is perfect to present this line to new customers,"" said Isabella Innergård, CEO of H&M Kids, underlining the importance of the city as a major fashion capital. ""We wanted to approach our customers and other different consumers with an unexpected and novel proposal, it is possible that for some it will be the first time they shop at H&M,"" she told Modaes about the potential access to new targets thanks to the newly opened Parisian location.

H&M surrounds itself with children's brands such as Mayoral and Sergent Major in its new corner.

Divided into two areas, one dedicated to babies and the other to children's clothing up to ten years old, the space offers a careful selection of eighty items with prices between 12.99 and 49.99 euros. ""We pay great attention to the fabrics, betting on materials, cashmere, silk and wool,"" said Innergård about the ambition to evolve the children's offer towards the high-end through design and a qualitative proposal.

""Sustainability is closely linked to the fabrics, but also to the lifespan and durability of the garments,"" continued the category's top manager on the ""strategic shift"" of the children's offering. In fact, H&M even aspires to link itself with the vintage universe. ""They are beautiful, well-cared-for garments that are appreciated, which gives them the value of wanting to keep them or inherit them; they are timeless designs destined to be passed on from one child to another,"" admitted Sofia Löfstedt, creative director of the children's line, underlining the pragmatic conception of garments such as bodysuits, which include buttoning extensions to last longer, accompanying the child's growth.

The corner, designed by H&M's in-house retail team, combines stone, wood and textiles to recreate a sophisticated and warm atmosphere, in line with the Swedish group's new visual language in its latest store renovations towards a high-end concept, such as in Westfield London, Stockholm or Seoul.

The company is immersed in a strategy to raise its brand positioning.

With this move, H&M is reinforcing its positioning in the premium segment, in a context of transformation of the group, which is committed to raising the level of its spaces, improving the design of its collections and expanding its presence in emblematic locations. The partnership with Galeries Lafayette, a benchmark in French retail, is part of this strategy to attract a more demanding customer without losing sight of its accessible identity, and comes against the backdrop of the Senate's approval of the anti-fast fashion law, which directly targets the practices of China Shein.

In recent times, H&M has concentrated its efforts on simplifying and elevating its global offering. ""We have optimized our assortment to strengthen the overall customer offering and fashion credentials with clearer, stronger andmore recognizablecollections and capsule collections,"" the company told Modaes during a recent visit to its Stockholm headquarters.

The main axes of change relate to product improvement, the overhaul of its store network and the transformation of the brand, combined with a simplification of its chains and the reorganization of its teams. The change, which began in the women's category, is taking shape this year in the men's and children's collections.

Present in France with a network of 168 stores, H&M boasts ambitious plans for the market, although the group does not detail sales by market or category. ""We want to target a more demanding clientele, both local and international, very attentive to fashion and product quality,"" said Manuel Da Cruz, Ile-de-France area manager for the Swedish group.

H&M's change began with its women's line and continues with its men's and children's lines.

The initiative is also part of an extensive store renovation plan in the Paris region, which includes key locations such as Forum des Halles. This store, the group's most profitable in the market, is in the process of remodeling and adapting its offer and will reopen its doors after the summer. In addition, the space upgrade plan will be completed by the end of the year, after having renovated the Beaugrenelle and Levallois spaces.

The Swedish company's latest ace up its sleeve is a strategic opening in Le Marais, one of Paris' trendiest neighborhoods, where it will open a permanent store in September with a focus on men's and women's fashion, as well as brand experience. The project follows an artistic pop-up store launched last year as a test, and confirms the group's desire to strengthen its presence in premium locations. The exact address of the store has not yet been confirmed.

In the first quarter of the financial year, H&M posted a moderate increase in sales of 3.10% to SEK 55,333 million (EUR 5,108 million). The company also posted a 53% drop in net profit to 53.5 million euros, affected by the unstable geopolitical context, increased investment and the impact of exchange rates.

Last week, the Persson family raised its control in the Swedish company's capital. The members of the founding saga of the fashion group took 70% of the company's capital and 85% of the voting rights, in a progressive takeover that could lead H&M to a future away from the stock market.",https://www.modaes.com/global/thumb/eyJ0IjoiZCIsInciOjEyMDAsImgiOjY3NSwibSI6MSwidiI6ImRldjE3NDk3OTg2MDAifQ/files/2025/redaccion-empresas/hm/hm-corner-1200.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 03:10:02.293825

Last month, Ralph Lauren announced during a call with analysts that it planned to raise its prices in the coming months into next year.

While the move is in line with moves from other similar clothing brands responding to the tariffs that were recently imposed by the Donald Trump administration, it does not sound like that is the sole reason for Ralph Lauren's price increases.

As it turns out, the company was already planning to increase its prices even before the tariffs were announced as it moves forward with what appears to be a new brand identity.

During a recent call with analysts, Ralph Lauren Chief Financial Officer Justin Picicci explained that the brand was shifting its focus toward younger and more high-end customers who are less sensitive to price increases.

“We’ve been on this multi-year journey to shift our customer base towards less price-sensitive consumers, especially in the full-price channel,” Picicci said on a call with analysts according to the Wall Street Journal.

While this might not be good news for some consumers, it sounds like the brand has already had success with the strategy, reporting larger profits and a jump in revenue for the first three months of the year as a result of those higher prices and lower cotton costs.

With this success, Ralph Lauren is already planning to increase prices even more in the upcoming fall as well as next year's spring.

Needless to say, it's pretty clear that Ralph Lauren has no interest in courting price-conscious customers.

The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

Medtronic in May issued the recall notification related to specific Newport HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators and certain related Newport service parts.
The impacted Newport HT70 family of ventilators is intended to provide continuous or intermittent positive pressure mechanical ventilatory support.
Medtronic said it is not correcting these issues on affected ventilators or service parts and will no longer service affected ventilators.
Medtronic in February 2024 had announced its decision to exit its ventilator product lines, including the Newport ventilators.","(RTTNews) - Medical devices maker Medtronic plc has urged customers to discontinue clinical use of the recently recalled certain Newport branded ventilators and certain related service parts after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration upgraded it to a Class I recall.

According to the FDA, a Class I recall is the most serious type of recall, a situation where the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.

Medtronic in May issued the recall notification related to specific Newport HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators and certain related Newport service parts.

The impacted Newport HT70 family of ventilators is intended to provide continuous or intermittent positive pressure mechanical ventilatory support. HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators are intended for use by home users, as well as for infant and pediatric patients who may be at higher risks of injury or death due to unanticipated ventilator failures.

The recall was initiated after customer complaints, and the related probe identified two separate capacitors on one of the ventilator's controller Printed Circuit Board Assembly or PCBA. This, in case of failure, may result in the ventilator shutting down during use, or the shutdown alert alarm failing to sound effectively.

If a ventilator fails and does not provide adequate ventilation, the patient may not be able to breathe on their own, leading to low oxygen levels, high carbon dioxide levels, and potentially severe consequences like brain injury or death.

There have been 63 medical device reports or MDRs associated with this issue, including two serious injuries and one death, the firm noted. The company added that no instances of both capacitors failing on the same PCBA board have occurred, nor are they anticipated to occur.

Medtronic said it is not correcting these issues on affected ventilators or service parts and will no longer service affected ventilators. Instead, the customers are asked to remove the affected devices from use and replace with an alternate means of ventilation.

The firm will continue working directly with the FDA and other regulatory bodies around the world on the recall.

Medtronic in February 2024 had announced its decision to exit its ventilator product lines, including the Newport ventilators. As they wind down the business over the coming years, the company said it will continue to serve the existing ventilator contracts.",https://images.finanzen.net/mediacenter/unsortiert/facebookicon.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 05:11:36.685917

To provide real-time transparency and showcase the campaign's monumental growth, a ""Lion Tracker"" at Influential Beach will monitor the lion's escalating audience throughout the festival.

Publicis Groupe is launching a groundbreaking global campaign designed to be a live, undeniable demonstration of the power of creators, technology, and AI in achieving unprecedented reach and impact.

Launching on June 16th, the audacious campaign aims to prove that clients can achieve Super Bowl-level reach (over 127 million impressions) for a mere fraction of the cost, seamlessly integrated into their existing media mix. This will be made possible through Publicis' formidable influencer ecosystem, powered by Influential and Captiv8, which boasts a network of over 19 million creators and is further amplified by Epsilon’s robust data capabilities.

The ""unknown lion"" will be introduced through a joint Instagram post from top wildlife influencers @shandorlarenty (9.3M TikTok, 596K Instagram) and @Pubity (40M Instagram, 17M TikTok). From this initial spark, the activation will rapidly expand across Influential and Captiv8’s vast network, covering a staggering 90% of influencers with more than 1 million followers and 95% with over 5,000.

To provide real-time transparency and showcase the campaign's monumental growth, a ""Lion Tracker"" at Influential Beach will monitor the lion's escalating audience throughout the festival. By the close of Cannes Lions, this ""unknown lion"" is projected to have achieved ""big game"" reach, a powerful testament to Publicis' unique influencer platform.

Driving the point home with a playful yet pointed message, the program is backed by a digital OOH (Out-of-Home) campaign. These ads will humorously compare the cost of achieving Super Bowl-worthy influencer reach to common Cannes expenses – from a handful of business class tickets to a fraction of a beach party budget, or even a sliver of the awards entries some agencies submit.

Arthur Sadoun, CEO of Publicis Groupe, emphasized the strategic vision behind the initiative: “With every acquisition — from Captiv8 to Influential — and every innovation, like CoreAI, we’re building a future-ready platform to help clients navigate an increasingly complex and challenging marketing landscape. At Cannes this year, we’re focused on turning AI hype into business upside — with practical, Monday-ready solutions our clients can put to work immediately.”

Publicis Groupe's ""unknown lion"" campaign is set to be a highlight of Cannes Lions 2025, not just for its creative ingenuity but for its clear, demonstrable proof of how cutting-edge technology and a vast creator network can deliver unparalleled results for clients in today's dynamic marketing environment.",https://erp.adgully.com/artical_image/4512df292ce590768153217b3c208a3f.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 02:11:31.944433

CVS, which owns one of the nation's largest PBMs, Caremark, says the bill could force it to pull out of Louisiana entirely.
'If you choose to be a PBM, you can still be a PBM,' explained State Rep. Dustin Miller, who sponsored the bill.
The text blast from CVS — which has revamped management after a sales slump — didn't go over well with many legislators.
If they leave, they leave of their own volition because they don't truly care,' another person wrote.","Louisiana residents were left confused — and a little panicked — after CVS sent out ominous texts claiming the pharmacy giant may shut down every store in the state.

The messages, sent directly to customers' phones this morning, warned that 'your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist could lose their job' — sparking a wave of concern and confusion.

The alert was linked to House Bill 358, a new piece of legislation targeting Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) — the behind-the-scenes middlemen that help set drug prices and reimbursement rates.

CVS, which owns one of the nation's largest PBMs, Caremark, says the bill could force it to pull out of Louisiana entirely.

'If you choose to be a PBM, you can still be a PBM,' explained State Rep. Dustin Miller, who sponsored the bill. 'But you cannot be a PBM and a pharmacy.'

Lawmakers argue the measure is designed to stop big chains from steering customers toward their own stores — a move they say hurts independent pharmacies and inflates prices.

The text blast from CVS — which has revamped management after a sales slump — didn't go over well with many legislators.

'Scare tactics,' said Rep. Dixon McMakin, who slammed the company's messaging as misleading.

Others, like Rep. Edmond Jordan, tried to calm nerves: 'Independent pharmacies aren't going to close tomorrow. In fact, they're doing better than they have in years.'

'If CVS decides to leave, hopefully, we have people there to make up that difference.'

PBMs are used by pharmacies, insurance companies, and drug manufacturers when setting drug prices.

'They set the rates and the reimbursement for the pharmacies; we are just telling them if that is your core responsibility, you can keep that as your core responsibility,' Miller said.

'We don't want you to also go open a pharmacy and steer people to you and compete against other pharmacies.'

The text message fiasco comes after Arkansas signed Act 624 into a law banning PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies starting next year.

Reddit users were more blunt.

'CVS has one of the biggest PBM's and they don't want to give up all the price fixing they do. Let them leave. They will come crawling back,' a customer claimed on a post.

'Just got it myself as well at the email. Do not respond. If they leave, they leave of their own volition because they don't truly care,' another person wrote.

The bill, which has passed both the House and Senate, now awaits the signature of Governor Jeff Landry, who is expected to sign it into law. That is expected to be a formality.

The text message fiasco comes after Arkansas signed Act 624 into a law banning PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies starting next year.

CVS has been having financial problems over the last few years.

The chain announced back in 2023 that it would close 900 stores by the end of 2024.

The pharmacy chain revealed the closures were part of a 'retail footprint strategy' created in order to continue meeting customer needs.

CVS is planning to shutter 270 stores this year, but will continue operating over 9,000 locations nationwide.

It experienced a 7% increase in first quarter revenue compared to 2024 and has not filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

However, fellow pharmaceutical chain Rite Aid has been struggling to stay afloat after filing for bankruptcy in 2023.

It's set to close 111 stores across the US this year, and is in the process of selling its pharmacy assets following its second bankruptcy filing.

DailyMail.com has reached out to CVS for comment about the text messages.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/12/22/99320897-0-image-m-29_1749762280919.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 02:10:38.684543

The affected batteries can be identified by the Anker logo engraved on the side with the model number A1263 printed on the bottom edge.
However, Anker is only recalling units sold in the US with qualifying serial numbers.
After confirming that your power bank is one of the recalled units, Anker says it should be taken to a facility that can safely dispose of lithium-ion batteries due to the risk of fire.
If you’ve been regularly using devices featuring lithium-ion batteries for a while, you’ll want to be mindful of issues like overheating or visible swelling and dispose of them properly if you think there’s a potential problem.","Anker has issued a recall for its PowerCore 10000 power bank (model A1263) due to a “potential issue with the lithium-ion battery” that could pose a fire safety risk. The company has received 19 reports of fires and explosions that have caused minor burn injuries and resulted in property damage totaling over $60,700, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC).

The recall covers about 1,158,000 units that were sold online through Amazon, Newegg, and eBay between June 2016 and December 2022. The affected batteries can be identified by the Anker logo engraved on the side with the model number A1263 printed on the bottom edge. However, Anker is only recalling units sold in the US with qualifying serial numbers. To check if yours is included, you’ll need to visit Anker’s website.

Anker is offering affected consumers their choice of either a $30 gift card (the recalled battery cost around $27) that can be used on Anker.com, or a free 10,000mAh Anker power bank as a replacement (model A1388) featuring upgrades including a charge level display and a USB-C charging cable lanyard.

To receive the gift card or the replacement, Anker requires a “photo of the power bank with the submission date and the word ‘recall’ or ‘recalled’ written clearly in permanent marker,” to be submitted, and a “photo showing the model number and serial number (SN) printed on the bottom of the device.” The company is also requesting a purchase receipt, but it’s not mandatory to participate in the recall.

After confirming that your power bank is one of the recalled units, Anker says it should be taken to a facility that can safely dispose of lithium-ion batteries due to the risk of fire. Those facilities can be found through the Environmental Protection Agency’s website or other organizations in the US that specialize in processing e-waste. Do not throw them in the trash, recycling bins, or used battery boxes provided at various retail locations.

The recall is also a reminder that power banks and backup batteries can potentially develop severe issues over time, as these particular units are almost a decade old. If you’ve been regularly using devices featuring lithium-ion batteries for a while, you’ll want to be mindful of issues like overheating or visible swelling and dispose of them properly if you think there’s a potential problem. And while the technology is currently more expensive than lithium-ion batteries, you can also consider upgrading to solid-state batteries which are more powerful, safer, and longer lasting than what we commonly use now to power our devices.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/anker_powercore1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-06-13 01:08:58.938303

The recruitment blitz— adding as many as 85,000 workers across its 17,000 US locations — is a bold move aimed at slashing long wait times.

Customers have grown weary of waiting 20 minutes for a drink, with many walking away from the chain entirely.

Soaring prices and what critics call a 'soulless' in-store experience have only added to the exodus — helping drive a sharp drop in sales.

New CEO Brian Niccol, speaking to 14,000 store managers at a Las Vegas event on Wednesday, called it 'the biggest human capital investment in connection in the history of Starbucks.'

He said the goal isn't just to speed up service, but to ease pressure on overworked employees and bring back the warmth and personal touch that once made Starbucks a beloved 'third place' between home and work.

'Your rosters are going to expand with this,' Niccol told managers, who can begin hiring from August.

Five years ago, Starbucks stores averaged 23 employees. Cost-cutting has since trimmed that number down to 18 to 19 — four to five fewer workers per location.

Restoring pre-Covid staffing levels would mean hiring between 68,000 and 85,000 people across all US stores.

Even focusing solely on the 11,000 company-owned locations, the increase would still be a massive 44,000 to 55,000 hires.

Jodi Love, a portfolio manager at T Rowe Price, a Starbucks shareholder, estimated the labor investments would add more than $1bn in additional spending to fiscal 2026.

But the move is expected to resonate with baristas on the frontlines, many of whom have long complained of chronic understaffing that fuels delays and drains morale.

The new hires are also expected to support Starbucks' efforts to bring back a more personal touch — including a new policy asking baristas to handwrite notes on customers’ cups.

Explaining the U-turn, Niccol told the Financial Times: 'We over-rotated on the idea of equipment and that replacing the humanity of service,' Niccol told the Financial Times.

'And I think service is our point of difference. Despite everybody saying they're more connected than ever, everything I read is people feel more lonely than ever.

'I think part of the problem is there aren't enough third places anymore.'

Niccol was hired last year in an effort to turn around the struggling chain.

Former CEO Howard Shultz agreed with Niccol telling Wednesday's company event 'we're not a company based on technology.

'That enables us, we're a company based on people.'

The former Chipotle boss has embarked on a series of plans to return Starbucks to its original 'third place between home and work' concept.

Coffee drinkers have turned away from the chain in recent years, put off by high beverage prices, long wait times and impersonal experiences.

Niccol has set about axing complicated drinks from Starbucks menus, asking staff to put messages on customer's coffee cups and scaling back promotions.

Critics of the message say it’s more than a warning; it’s a political campaign that may have crossed a legal line.
“So, they’re kind of like a Visa Card for prescriptions.” But Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill says CVS went too far by using private customer data for lobbying.
“CVS has cornered the market and used that market to run a lot of independent pharmacists out of business,” she said.
“The loss of independent pharmacies has been much more damaging to us than losing a large chain pharmacy like CVS,” Murrill said.","LOUISIANA (KLFY) — This week, CVS customers across Louisiana were met with an alarming text message:

“Last-minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy—your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job. Contact your elected officials to protect your access.”

The text, which quickly triggered confusion and concern, refers to House Bill 358—a late-session proposal that would ban pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like CVS Caremark from owning or controlling pharmacies in the state.

Critics of the message say it’s more than a warning; it’s a political campaign that may have crossed a legal line.

“People give their information to health care providers to provide patient information for the betterment of their health,” said former state senator and pharmacist Fred Mills. “I don’t know if they give this information for political purposes.”

PBMs act as a middleman between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. Supporters of the bill argue that this dual role (particularly when companies like CVS own both the PBM and the pharmacy) creates a conflict of interest and limits consumer choice.

“If you work for a company that decides you’ll pay $5 or $10 for your prescriptions, the PBM implements that plan,” Mills said. “So, they’re kind of like a Visa Card for prescriptions.”

But Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill says CVS went too far by using private customer data for lobbying.

“They were sending out information using people’s personal cell phone numbers to lobby against legislation that they didn’t like,” Murrill said. “That is not the purpose for which they obtained our personal information.”

In response, Murrill says her office has issued a cease-and-desist letter and opened an investigation into whether CVS violated the state’s Unfair Trade Practices Act.

“CVS has cornered the market and used that market to run a lot of independent pharmacists out of business,” she said. “It’s also running up our costs of medication.”

In a public statement, CVS claimed the legislation would force the company to close 119 pharmacies in Louisiana, impacting one million patients and nearly 2,700 employees. But Murrill and other state officials argue the company’s messaging is misleading.

“The loss of independent pharmacies has been much more damaging to us than losing a large chain pharmacy like CVS,” Murrill said. “It is so damaging to our rural communities. And they have been decidedly persistent in putting them out of business.”

The bill did not pass despite pressure from Governor Landry. If Governor Landry does call a special session, it would most likely happen in August.

""We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers and allows our company to remain competitive.""

A Ralphs spokesperson sent the following statement in response to the strike authorization:

""We remain actively engaged in bargaining with the union because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption. Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading health care and a pension. These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer.

""We remain committed to good faith bargaining that rewards our hardworking associates and keeps groceries affordable for our customers.""

Negotiations are scheduled to resume on June 25, according to the union. The workers' contracts expired March 2.

The union said it is seeking ""living wages, affordable healthcare benefits, a reliable pension (and) more staffing and better working conditions for a better customer experience.""

Fed FOMC, BoE, BoJ meetings and mainland China data in focus

Central bank meetings will be in abundance in the coming week, including in the US, UK and Japan, while inflation figures in the UK and Japan will be scrutinized alongside activity data from both the US and mainland China.

The Fed policymakers gather for the June FOMC meeting. Despite additional political pressure by President Donald Trump to lower rates and a lower-than-anticipated CPI report, US central bankers are widely expected to keep Fed fund rates unchanged in the near-term. Inflation remains above target at 2.4% and uncertainty about the potential impact of tariffs on prices remains a major concern at the Fed, all while the labour market continues to show encouraging resilience. The next move by the Fed nonetheless likely remains a cut, with money managers widely expecting up to 50 basis points of cuts in the second half of 2025, according to the latest June S&P Global Investment Manager Index (IMI). While the IMI survey has also indicated that the political environment remains the biggest drag on equities in the near-term, fiscal and monetary policy are acting as additional drags. As such, the Fed's stance will be closely watched for insights into the interest rate outlook and what may be a trigger for rate cuts.

A clearer bias towards the lowering of interest rates is meanwhile observed for the UK. Subdued growth conditions and softening inflationary pressures, according to May's UK PMI data, point to further rate cuts by the Bank of England, though it may not be until August when we see them move again, after having just lowered the Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% in May. The August cut is also likely to be followed by a further cut in November.

Meanwhile in APAC, the Bank of Japan faces greater challenges in their rate hike resolve amid signs of deteriorating economic trends. A near-stalling of growth has been signalled in May as US trade policy uncertainty dampened global trade. The impact was not limited to Japan, however, as APAC economies broadly experienced a slowdown in growth as export orders fell at an increased rate, according to PMI indications. To gain further insights into the impact of trade disruptions, mainland China's industrial production and retail sales figures will be in focus, while Japan also refreshes trade and inflation numbers for May.

PMI-based central bank indicators point to a further rate cuts in the UK while the bias is becoming less clear in the US, albeit temporarily as an inventory build-up buoy growth.

What to watch in the coming week

Americas: Fed meeting, US retail sales, industrial production, building permits and housing starts data; BCB meeting; Canada retail sales

June's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting unfolds midweek with the consensus pointing to no change in Fed rates at the mid-year meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the market has priced in the next rate cut only towards the end of the year. Concerns over intensifying tariff-related inflationary pressures, coupled with a resilient labour market, as shown by the latest May S&P Global US PMI data and confirmed by the official labour market update, mean a rate cut only looks likely later in the year.

On the data front, US retail sales and industrial production figures will be key indicators to monitor, in addition to housing market updates. A solid rise in services activity contrasted with falling manufacturing production in May, according to PMI indications, and points to the likelihood of positive retail sales performance.

Central bankers similarly gather in Brazil to update monetary policy settings, with another hike not ruled out at present amid elevated inflation. That said, subdued growth conditions in May, according to the S&P Global Brazil PMI, add to the uncertainty for the interest rate outlook.

EMEA: BoE meeting, UK inflation, retail sales; Germany ZEW index; Eurozone trade data

Central bank meetings unfold in the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden in the week ahead. While the Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold according to consensus, the bias remains towards lowering rates on the back of subdued growth conditions and softening inflationary pressures, as seen via May's UK PMI update. Official UK inflation numbers will be due on Wednesday for an assessment of the latest CPI trend.

APAC: BoJ meeting, Japan inflation and trade data; mainland China activity data; Australia employment data; New Zealand GDP; BI, BSP, CBC meetings

A major central bank meeting also takes place in Japan, albeit with the Bank of Japan expected to hold its policy stance until later in the year. Key economic release includes Japan's inflation and trade, while a slew of activity figures will also be out from mainland China. Amid more subdued manufacturing sector conditions signalled by the Caixin PMI data, the industrial production numbers will be watched, while accelerating services activity growth hint at improvements for retail sales.

Australia meanwhile updates employment numbers and New Zealand releases first quarter GDP. Central bank meetings also take place in Indonesia, Philippines and Taiwan.

ID22,J&J,2025-06-13 02:54:09+00:00,Healthcare Brew,Johns Hopkins researchers warn drug tariffs could worsen shortages - Healthcare Brew,Caroline Catherman,,,,,https://www.healthcare-brew.com/stories/2025/06/12/johns-hopkins-researchers-drug-tariffs-worsen-shortages,"For generic drugs, tariffs could increase supply shortages.
For branded drugs—which make up 20% of prescriptions but 80% of prescription drug spending—tariffs could increase prices.
“For these products, the biggest problem is not cost, but it’s actually supply shortages,” she said.
About 62% of drug shortages from 2013–2017 were related to quality issues, the agency said in a 2019 report.
Branded drug manufacturers have moved from the US to places like Switzerland, Ireland, and Germany over the last couple decades because those countries offer better tax policies, he said.","With tariffs on the way “very shortly” for imported drugs, pharma giants like Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson are investing billions into expanding US manufacturing.

On the surface, it seems like tariffs are accomplishing the promised goal of bringing manufacturing back to the US. In an April 2 briefing, the White House vowed this increase would strengthen supply chains, lower costs, and reduce dependence on “foreign adversaries.”

But Baltimore, Maryland-based Johns Hopkins researchers said in a June 11 media briefing they don’t think tariffs will bring much benefit. For generic drugs, tariffs could increase supply shortages. For branded drugs—which make up 20% of prescriptions but 80% of prescription drug spending—tariffs could increase prices.

The deets. Only about 12% of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) volume is made in the US, excluding IV fluids, according to an April report by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), an independent nonprofit that sets global drug quality and safety standards.

“It would take years” to build up enough US manufacturing capacity to end reliance on other countries for certain branded drugs, Jeromie Ballreich, an associate research professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said during the briefing.

Plus, because domestic manufacturers import active pharmaceutical ingredients and key starting materials to make their drugs, manufacturing drugs here doesn’t necessarily dodge potential tariffs, Mariana Socal, an associate professor in the same department, said.

“We would expect pharma to pass the cost on to the insurers, and we would expect insurers to pass the cost on to the individual patients,” Ballreich said.

Already, the US pays more for branded drugs—sometimes 2x–4x more—than other countries, according to 2021 data from the Government Accountability Office.

Generic problems. Generic drugs are a different story.

The US pays about the same or less than other countries for these drugs, Socal said.

“For these products, the biggest problem is not cost, but it’s actually supply shortages,” she said.

If it becomes more expensive to import generics, she added, manufacturers might be tempted to “cut corners” on safety, since these drugs already have such low profit margins.

The FDA, which regularly inspects manufacturing facilities, could end up pausing imports from certain plants in response, exacerbating shortages. About 62% of drug shortages from 2013–2017 were related to quality issues, the agency said in a 2019 report.

How to fix things. On the other hand, the researchers said there are legitimate concerns about relying on other countries for drugs and a need for supply chain reform.

“Having access to prescription drugs is a national security matter,” Socal said. “I think that’s part of the rationale for bringing manufacturing back to US soil.”

But to do so requires more than tariffs: It demands a well-trained workforce alongside policies that make it attractive to set up shop in the country, Ballreich said.

Branded drug manufacturers have moved from the US to places like Switzerland, Ireland, and Germany over the last couple decades because those countries offer better tax policies, he said. (The European Union manufactures 43% of API for US brand-name prescriptions, USP found.)

To bring the manufacturers back, the US needs to offer tax policies that can compete.

He pointed to the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which used tax credits and grants to tempt more companies to move semiconductor manufacturing back to the country.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/878a62c685f591d3315ab7fde50ad6ee3d1379d9-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-06-13 03:10:06.903442

Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.","BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.

Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.

As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.

“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy — your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.

The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

“These powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,” a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.

CVS says on its website that it “negotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.”

The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.

“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter read. “They would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care – the consequences would be dire.”

Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers “may shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.”

“No we’re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said.

Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.

“It's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,” he said. “They’ve now taken that to send me political texts.”

CVS sent messages to “large numbers"" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.

Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information “for their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,” Murrill told reporters. “That’s not why anybody gave them their phone number.”

Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.

The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee — a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.

“We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,” Thibault said in an email. “Our communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.”

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.

The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.

Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.

“CVS … you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,” Landry said.

The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.

Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.

“Yes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,"" Landry said a statement. ""It’s that important.”

Niccol has sought to return Starbucks to its former glory and he’s made several changes in this effort.

The coffee chain's new strategy follows its struggles with continuous sales declines and slower store traffic over the last few quarters.

To return business to growth, Starbucks developed the ""Back to Starbucks"" turnaround plan, which included optimizing operations, prioritizing coffee quality, and simplifying its menu.

In the last several months, Starbucks (SBUX) reintroduced condiment bars and ceramic mugs for in-house sipping, brought back handwritten notes on to-go cups and bags to foster better customer connections, and returned the free in-café refills to make its coffee shops feel more like homes.

To increase efficiency, the coffee giant also refreshed its menu with a simpler version, discontinuing 13 items and eliminating extra charges for milk alternatives.

Starbucks makes major changes in its business with a turnaround plan

Starbucks has even gone beyond tweaking the store experience and menu. The chain will close underperforming shops to invest in building new locations and revamping old ones, encouraging customers to stay longer.

And just last month, Starbucks implemented a new dress code for its baristas across all North American stores to enhance its iconic green apron, marking its first update in nearly a decade.

Now, the coffee giant is making another change regarding its baristas, and this one requires a significant investment.

Starbucks increases investment in its workforce

Starbucks is expanding its workforce by adding at least one full-time assistant store manager to most company-operated stores nationwide beginning this fall.

This move aims to streamline the operation of its stores and improve the overall customer experience by providing staff with the support and help they need, ensuring a consistent leadership presence during operating hours.

Although anyone may apply for the full-time assistant store manager role, Starbucks wants to encourage its employees to put their best foot forward by supporting career growth and hiring 90% of the new leadership roles internally.

Currently, approximately 20% of Starbucks stores have an assistant store manager, with most being short-term.

The hiring process will be multiphased, with the first phase happening this September across six Starbucks districts. This initial step will help the company test the initiative and eventually have a full-time assistant store manager in most of its company-operated coffee shops by 2026.

Canada will be the next region to follow this process, beginning in summer 2026.

But booming demand for help in processing foreign goods has made these services more expensive, adding another cost to the tariff burden, industry players told Reuters.

AI Brief

Customs brokers are raising fees and boosting staff due to complex new US tariffs and increased paperwork.

Major firms like FedEx, DHL, Nike, and Amazon are expanding trade compliance teams to navigate changing trade rules.

Unpredictable tariff hikes are causing confusion, import delays, and heavier reliance on brokers across the US trade ecosystem.

Customs brokerages, until recently an anonymous branch of the import ecosystem, handle the paperwork needed to process shipments and calculate tariff bills. Mom-and-pop brokers interviewed by Reuters say they are raising fees, while major logistics firms like Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx and Germany-based DHL are also adding staff to their customs compliance teams.

Market research firms ballpark customs brokering as a roughly $5 billion industry in the United States. Hiring a broker is optional, but the increasing complexities of U.S. tariffs and customs regulations are leading more importers to shell out the cash.

Independent brokers like Laredo, Texas-based JD Gonzalez are fielding dozens of questions daily from concerned clients struggling to understand what they may owe to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and whether to go ahead with shipments or hold off.

Brokers are also spending more time and labor on customs forms than ever, and have in some cases implemented new IT systems.

“With all the new information we have to process, some of the automation we've used has been thrown out, so there’s more work to do,” said JD Gonzalez, who is also president of custom brokerage trade group NCBFAA.

The trend is part of a broader wave of corporate efforts to bolster trade compliance operations. Major companies, from Nike to Amazon to Lowe’s, had published job postings as of Wednesday for trade and customs professionals.

Nike was seeking a “lead” for trade and customs, who would “play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our trade compliance framework,” according to the post on Nike’s careers website. Amazon, meanwhile, had at least 10 U.S. customs brokerage jobs listed on its careers website. Lowe's had three.

Nike, Amazon and Lowe’s did not respond to requests for comment.

HIGHER FEES

Independent brokers often base their fees on the number of codes they must enter to classify the contents of a given shipment. Known as harmonized tariff schedule codes, these line items help border officials distinguish car parts from children's toys, and determine proper tariff rates.

Prior to Trump's frenetic tariff policies, fees ranged from around $4 to $7 per code. But Gonzalez said the extra costs brokers have incurred as they ramp up systems to handle the tariff changes have led some to increase fees by $1 to $5 per code.

Gonzalez said he has raised fees “nominally,” while Steve Bozicevic, CEO of A&A Customs Brokers headquartered in Seattle and Vancouver, said his company added $3 per product type being imported into the U.S. because of merchandise facing ""tariff stacking,"" a phrase used when an item faces multiple tariffs.

""We raised the rates for the U.S. because of the new and added complexity,"" Bozicevic said. The company has not raised rates for imports into Canada because there's ""no new complexity,"" he said.

United Parcel Service UPS.N raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin. The move was part of general rate increases and unrelated to changes in tariffs, a UPS spokesperson told Reuters. FedEx's logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by 4% in January, according to a company spokesperson.

These bigger logistics companies, which include brokerage services in their broader shipping offerings, are also beefing up staff. DHL has upped headcount on its U.S. customs entry team by 30% since February, according to a spokesperson for the company’s DHL Express shipping unit.

FedEx had more than 40 open job postings on its customs and trade teams as of Tuesday, mainly based in the U.S., according to its LinkedIn jobs page. UPS had 10 similar U.S. positions open, according to its jobs website.

FedEx is ""adjusting our network to meet demand"" in an evolving tariff landscape, which ""includes hiring additional customs brokerage roles,"" the spokesperson said. UPS declined to comment on the job postings.

Historically, tariff changes have been less frequent, say brokers, trade lawyers and other trade professionals, and they have come with weeks of lead time, allowing brokers to prepare for the change and provide logistical feedback to CBP.

Compare that to last week's doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%, which Trump announced abruptly, forcing the U.S. customs department to quickly publish official guidance just hours ahead of a midnight change.

""Many brokers clear shipments ahead of time, so then you have to come back and retroactively redo it and fix it,"" said Miami-based customs broker Ralph De La Rosa, whose company, Imperial Freight Brokers, was founded by his father 54 years ago.

Even brokers who have not raised fees said their services have become inherently more expensive as the number of HTS codes has spiked.

Importers slowed shipments into the United States after Trump’s massive tariff announcement on April 2, after having frontloaded purchases earlier in the year to get ahead of an expected rise in duties.

Imports of consumer goods, which include cell phones and other household items, decreased $68.9 billion to $277.9 billion in April from a month before, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Trump announced additional tariffs on steel and aluminum in June and in May threatened to impose 50% tariffs on the European Union.

Adding to the uncertainty, a federal appellate court on Tuesday ruled that sweeping tariffs may remain in effect while appeals proceed, after a trade court ruled that the U.S. president overstepped his executive powers and blocked the duties. The appellate scheduled arguments for July 31.",https://img.astroawani.com/2025-06/61749635232_YantianportinShen.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:06:41.959146

CHICAGO, June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- LanzaJet, Inc., a leading next-gen fuels technology company and producer of sustainable fuels, today announced a new agreement with Microsoft to adopt Microsoft Azure as the company's preferred cloud platform. The agreement marks an expansion of LanzaJet's partnership with Microsoft and underscores the central role innovation plays in scaling next-generation fuels for aviation.

LanzaJet will leverage Azure to support their global growth by enhancing the company's operational systems, financial platforms, and data-driven decision-making capabilities, including those related to plant performance and supply chain optimization.

""For early-stage technology companies like LanzaJet, partners matter, and Microsoft has been with us from the start,"" said Anne Sidio, Chief Transformation Officer at LanzaJet. ""This agreement builds on a multi-level relationship with Microsoft, from early investment in our company to renewable fuel offtake agreements and now digital infrastructure, reflecting the kind of collaboration needed to accelerate innovation, scale operations, and build a secure and resilient global platform.""

Microsoft has been a cornerstone partner in LanzaJet's journey, providing both capital and commercial alignment. The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund was among the first institutions to invest in LanzaJet, offering one of the company's earliest low-interest loans to help finance the construction of LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels, the world's first commercial ethanol-to-SAF facility in Soperton, Georgia. Microsoft deepened that commitment in 2024 with a direct investment in LanzaJet to support continued global deployment of its technology.

In addition to financial backing, Microsoft is also an offtaker of LanzaJet's fuels, leveraging renewable diesel as well as SAF Certificates (SAFc) from future LanzaJet projects to advance its own emissions reduction goals and fulfill its industry-leading sustainability commitments, including becoming carbon negative by 2030. With today's announcement, Microsoft becomes a core technology partner supporting LanzaJet's internal systems as the company scales its global operations.

""Microsoft's continued support of LanzaJet reinforces the critical role enterprise-grade technology can play in climate innovation,"" said Alistair Speirs, Senior Director of Azure Global Infrastructure at Microsoft. ""We are glad to be partnering with a leader in the sustainable fuels industry and be a part of LanzaJet's continued mission to decarbonize aviation.""

As LanzaJet expands its project portfolio across the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Latin America, building their global platform on Azure will enable secure, scalable connectivity across regions, while supporting robust data management in areas ranging from feedstock traceability to emissions accounting.

This announcement follows a series of milestones for LanzaJet, including recent recognition from TIME100, S&P Global, and Reuters for the company's innovation, impact, and leadership in the global clean energy transition.

One store has a lot of polite employees who are always smiling, always kind, and very helpful. The other, you guessed it, is quite the opposite. When cashiers scan the items at the register in the second store, instead of gently placing them down, they almost break them.

While that is rude, I can’t blame everything on the workers, because the second store is hugely understaffed, and the management just won’t allow for more employees. Logically, they have a much smaller profit margin than the first store mentioned.

This story repeats itself all over the world, and sometimes the problem escalates. In the U.S. this year, there have been several huge boycotts at various retailers and grocery stores.

Recently, the retail giant Walmart experienced a nationwide customer boycott, organized by The People's Union USA, over the retailer’s alleged contribution to economic corruption. Then customers boycotted Target and Dollar General over DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) rollbacks.

Now, another supermarket chain is about to join this alarming trend.

Safeway and Albertsons workers reject the latest offer, intend to strike

The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 rejected the latest offer from Safety and Albertsons (ACI) and delivered 72-hour notice that its employees plan to terminate their current contract extension and go on strike.

“We took this decision very seriously and concluded that after so many months of bargaining, Safeway/Albertsons was giving us no choice but to further escalate our contract campaign,” stated Ivan Lopez, a Safeway distribution center worker in Denver.

Over the last few weeks, Safeway/Albertsons grocery store workers in Colorado pushed for an unfair labor practice strike to address the company’s perceived failure to negotiate fairly with employees and resolve understaffing at the state’s major grocers.

UFCW Local 7 President Kim Cordova said that Safeway/Albertsons have been working with KingSoopers and City Market, asking their employees to take less in health care and retirement benefits, and even cutting benefits for retirees.

The Union also highlighted that the two largest traditional grocery chains in the U.S., Kroger and Albertsons, have seen record profits over the last few years and have given billions of dollars to Wall Street investors.

What workers want is for these chains to invest more of those funds in the store, to lower prices for consumers and improve working conditions for employees.

One of the biggest strikes in Colorado’s history may start June 15

After nine months of negotiations, the bargaining fell through on June 11, and workers delivered a 72-hour notice requirement. That means the extension agreement can be terminated on Saturday at 7:42 p.m.

The countdown has begun, the Union said, adding that while the strike was not officially announced, it could begin as early as midnight on June 15.

In late May and early June, Safeway/Albertsons workers in Metro Denver, Boulder, Broomfield, Castle Rock, Conifer, Estes Park, Evergreen, Fountain, Grand Junction, Idaho Springs, Parker, Pueblo, Salida, Steamboat Springs, and Vail all voted to support an unfair labor practices strike by 99%.

Back in February, UFCW Local 7 members at Kroger-owned King Soopers struck for 10 days, hoping that Safeway/Albertsons would learn from it and reach a deal with its workers.

If the strike happens, around 7,000 workers might be involved, making it one of the biggest labor actions in The Centennial State’s history and the second-biggest this year, writes the Denver Post.

What’s more, there are about 150,000 UFCW and Teamster workers in Colorado, Washington, and California negotiating new contracts, suggesting that the strike in Colorado could lead to major labor action at retail giants.

Although the US and China reached a 90-day truce in their ongoing tariff war in May, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US are still subject to tariffs of as much as 3,521 per cent, with Washington citing unfair trade practices such as subsidies and dumping for the high levies.

The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals representing store workers announced on Monday that members have voted overwhelmingly in favor, giving their leaders authority to call a strike.

A walkout would cause a major disruption for two of the nation’s largest grocery chains during the busiest season of the year. Kroger and Albertsons are the parent companies of Ralphs, Vons and Pavilions grocery stores.

The last major Southern California grocery strike in 2003 and 2004 roiled the region’s supermarkets, paving the way for new chains. Another strike was averted during a standoff in 2022.

The vote comes fourth months after contract negotiations between the union and the grocery chain companies began. The workers’ contracts expired March 2.

In the statement, the bargaining committee of UFCW Locals 324 and 770 said: “Our message is clear: we are fed up with these corporations’ union-busting tactics designed to intimidate us and prevent us from getting the fair contract that we’ve earned and deserve.”

In an email statement, Courtney Carranza, director of communications and public affairs for Southern California Division at Albertsons, said: “We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers, and allows our company to remain competitive.”

A representative of Kroger did not respond to a request for comment.

The strike authorization vote was held in the first two weeks of June, the union said. It did not disclose the results.

Negotiations are scheduled to resume on June 25.

Among the chief sticking points in the talks is staffing levels, with the union contending that a staffing shortage has hurt service and working conditions.

“The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were ‘anecdotal’, downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily,” the union said in its statement. “At the same time, the companies have broken labor laws by engaging in unlawful surveillance, interrogation of members at actions, threats, and retaliation for union activity. This is unacceptable.”

Act 624 is scheduled to take effect January 1, 2026.","FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (KNWA/KFTA) — CVS Health is ramping up its campaign against a new Arkansas law that targets pharmacy benefit managers, publicly clashing with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders just hours after she defended the legislation in a guest essay for The New York Times.

Act 624, signed by Sanders in April, bars companies from running both a pharmacy and a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), a model used by CVS. PBMs manage prescription drug benefits for insurers, negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and reimburse pharmacies.

In her guest essay on June 10, Sanders wrote that PBMs “forcibly steer patients away from independent operators” and inflate drug prices. She also wrote that Act 624 lets PBMs keep operating in Arkansas, but, she said, “they just can’t continue to mistreat patients and box out other pharmacies.”

Sanders claimed the three largest pharmacy benefit managers handle 80% of U.S. prescriptions and earn 70% of specialty drug revenue through their affiliated pharmacies.

“Now, CVS is threatening to close down every pharmacy it operates in our state — preferring to take its ball and go home rather than divest from its pharmacy benefit management business and actually serve the patients it claims to care about,” Sanders wrote.

CVS issued a statement later that day disputing Sanders’ characterization of the law, claiming that the new law is about “choosing winners and losers and rewarding special interests.”

“Out-of-state competitors are disadvantaged,” a CVS spokesperson said. “In-state competitors, including Walmart, would handsomely benefit from the closures of pharmacies owned by us and others. The losers are the people of Arkansas who will pay more.”

CVS says the law could force it to close 23 pharmacies in Arkansas, affecting 340,000 patients, and block its specialty pharmacy from treating 10,000 high-risk patients with cancer, HIV and rare diseases.

The company is also challenging Act 624 in federal court, arguing it violates the U.S. Constitution.

“PBMs are the last line of defense between drugmakers that want to charge a lot of money, and the American businesses, unions, health plans, and government agencies that want to provide good benefits to people,” CVS said in its response on June 10.

CVS argues the law is unconstitutional because it unfairly targets out-of-state businesses, treats similar companies differently, and conflicts with federal laws like ERISA and Medicare rules. The company also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

“One state representative who co-sponsored this law owns 13 pharmacies by himself,” the company said, linking to state Rep. Brandon Achor’s campaign website.

Act 624, introduced as House Bill 1150, was backed by the Arkansas Pharmacists Association and Attorney General Tim Griffin, and passed easily.

The Taylorsville, Ind., facility in northern Bartholomew County will be adjacent to a previously announced $175 million King’s Hawaiian bakery operation. Both companies are subsidiaries of Irresistible Foods Group (IFG).

“When we purchased the Bartholomew County site, we did so with thoughts about building it out in phases,” says Joe Leonardo, vice president of strategic operations for Irresistible Foods Group and chief operating officer for King’s Hawaiian. “Today’s announcement for Grillo’s Pickles confirms our strategy.”

Grillo’s Pickles is investing $54 million to construct and outfit a 155,000-sq.-ft. food manufacturing facility and will employ up to 150 people. It is adjacent to the previously announced 300,000-sq.-ft. bakery facility for King’s Hawaiian.

“Our pickles use a century-old family recipe and contain no artificial preservatives,” says Adam Kaufman, president and CEO of Boston-based Grillo’s Pickles. “Grillo’s Pickles are packed, shipped and sold refrigerated. For our new production site, it was important to us to find a central U.S. location with a skilled workforce and supportive business environment, and we are very excited to be in Bartholomew County, Ind.”

Local government leaders expressed support for IFG’s two projects. In November 2023, Bartholomew County officials pledged up to $3,746,000 from a combination of County Rainy Day Fund and County Economic Development Income Tax (CEDIT) funds to pay for off-site water, sewer and road improvement upgrades to serve the project site and surrounding area. Last June, county officials unanimously approved the company’s request for an additional 10-year property tax phase-in on the Grillo’s Pickles building and equipment, producing savings of approximately $1.2 million.

“Bartholomew County, Ind., is committed to growing and diversifying our local economy, and we are exceptionally pleased to support and welcome Grillo’s to our community as an important part of our local strategy to attract food manufacturing,” says County Commissioner Tony London.

According to Kristen Goecker, interim president of Greater Columbus Economic Development Corporation, regional leaders have also approved inclusion of up to $1 million from Indiana’s READI 2.0 funds awarded to the South Central Indiana Talent Region. The funds will support intersection improvements at US-31 and Bear Lane, along with the extension of County Road 700N on the southern edge of the project site, in support of the Taylorsville Industrial Park.

“As a company, Grillo’s Pickles is known for their refreshingly unique pickle products, along with their fun and very distinctive marketing efforts,” Goecker says. “As such, Grillo’s is going to fit in perfectly well in a community that is known for being different by design, with a manufacturing workforce that is second to none.”

Bartholomew County Council president Leah Beyer also voiced her support of the project.

“This project represents economic development teamwork at its finest,” Beyer says. “County Planning & Zoning, County Council, the Board of Commissioners, City of Columbus officials, local utilities and our READI Regional Group have all pulled in the same direction to support the investments pledged by IFG, King’s Hawaiian and Grillo’s Pickles.”

In addition to local incentives, based on the company’s investment and job creation plans, the Indiana Economic Development Corporation committed an investment in Grillo’s Pickles of up to $1.4 million in the form of incentive-based tax credits.

(AP) — Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers’ personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.

Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.

As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.

“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy — your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.

Bill would have banned ownership of both drug stores and pharmacy benefit managers

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.

The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

“These powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,” a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.

CVS says on its website that it “negotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.”

CVS texts included a draft letter opposing the bill

The company’s text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.

“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter read. “They would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care – the consequences would be dire.”

Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers “may shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.”

“No we’re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said.

A GOP lawmaker received one of the texts

Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.

“It’s in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,” he said. “They’ve now taken that to send me political texts.”

CVS sent messages to “large numbers” of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company’s pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.

Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information “for their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,” Murrill told reporters. “That’s not why anybody gave them their phone number.”

Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.

The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee — a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.

“We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,” Thibault said in an email. “Our communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.”

Landry says he may call special session

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state’s legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.

The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.

Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS’s lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn’t be able to access their medications.

“CVS … you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,” Landry said.

The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.

Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.

“Yes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,” Landry said a statement. “It’s that important.”

United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 7 represents 7,000 Safeway/ Albertsons employees across Colorado. The union and the company have spent the past few months working to reach an agreement on wages, staffing levels and benefits.

In a release, the union said a negotiating session Wednesday ""did not generate a breakthrough,"" so leaders decided to give the company a 72-hour strike notice. UFCW Local 7 members who have already voted to strike could begin as early as Sunday.

Union leaders said they did make a final offer to the company to avoid a strike. That officer will expire at 5 p.m. on Friday.

UFCW Local 7 terminates contract extension with Safeway, gives strike notice

Sydney Isenberg

Denver7 reached out to UFCW Local 7 president Kim Cordova multiple times Thursday for a comment and interview, but did not hear back as of the publication of this article. A different representative with the union told Denver7 that out of the 81 union Safeway stores in Colorado, approximately 45 could strike.

For shoppers like LaVette Noel, the potential for a strike at her local Safeway is a massive blow.

""My feelings are hurt because I like Safeways,"" Noel said. ""You know, King Soopers, Safeway, I choose Safeways right now in my life.""

Noel told Denver7 she visits the Safeway location in Denver's Five Points neighborhood multiple times a week. She said news of the impending strike gives her major pause over continuing to shop there.

""I want them to get whatever they're asking for or want because they work hard for their money, and I think they deserve whatever they're asking for,"" Noel said of Safeway employees.

Chris Sharits is also a loyal Safeway shopper. He often picks up DoorDash grocery store orders from the Five Points location.

""I get a lot of these, so, you know, almost 3,000 shopping orders of my 13,700 some lifetime deliveries, which I started during the shutdown,"" Sharits said. ""If this store is on strike, I won't pass the strike. I won't go over the strikers.""

A spokesperson for Safeway/ Albertsons declined an interview but did offer a statement, which states, ""We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers, and allows our company to remain competitive.""

While shoppers understand what's happening, they told Denver7 they are not happy with what's possibly to come.

""That's just the way I'll handle it is I just won't take the orders,"" Sharits said.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6d2f736/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+76/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59%2F40%2Fdd046043496e8996da6a5dd0570a%2Fimg-3350.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 23:04:41.824035

And I’m leaving inspired, energized and ready to lead forward.
That moment wasn’t just about recognition—it was about showing what’s possible when we stay close to the work and lead with intention.
LE25 reminded me that leadership isn’t about having all the answers.
I’m not just leading a team — I’m building a community where everyone feels empowered to deliver their best.","After 17 years with Starbucks, I’ve seen a lot — store closures, transformations and everything in between. But LE25 was something special. It wasn’t just a celebration of where we’ve been; it was a launchpad for where we’re going. And I’m leaving inspired, energized and ready to lead forward.

What stood out most to me over these two days was the clarity of purpose. There’s no secret formula to success here — it’s about living our values, showing up for each other and creating a space where both partners and customers feel seen. That’s what I’m bringing back to my store in Illinois.

One of the most powerful moments for me was hearing Mellody Hobson speak. Her story — her presence — was deeply moving. As a woman and a person of color, her journey from not having a seat at the table to becoming a leader who’s always had partners at heart reminded me that anything is possible. She’s been with us through so much, and her commitment to this company is inspiring.

And then there was Howard. Seeing him on stage alongside Brian Niccol, both aligned in their message, was incredibly grounding. It reminded me that we don’t need to reinvent who we are — we just need to lead with connection and care. That alignment gave me confidence that we’re on the right path.

Being on stage as part of the Starting Five was surreal. I never imagined I’d be in that position, representing the work we’ve done and the direction we’re heading. It was an honor to stand beside other store managers and leaders like our coo Mike Grams, who truly listens and cares about what’s happening in our stores. That moment wasn’t just about recognition—it was about showing what’s possible when we stay close to the work and lead with intention.

I’ve already started doing the work with my team — owning our business, setting clear expectations and building a culture of accountability. But now, I’m thinking about how to elevate that. I plan to connect with every partner one-on-one and share what I experienced. I want them to know how important they are to our success and how much I need them with me on this journey. We all have to be all in.

Green Apron Service helped us see what’s possible when we focus on excellence at every point of connection. With the right labor and the right mindset, we created a better partner experience, which led to a better customer experience. It wasn’t about doing more — it was about doing what matters, with intention. LE25 reminded me that leadership isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about being present, staying curious and creating space for others to grow. That’s what I’m taking back to my store. I’m not just leading a team — I’m building a community where everyone feels empowered to deliver their best.

We’re moving forward with purpose. And I’m ready.",https://about.starbucks.com/uploads/2025/06/Image-2.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 01:08:45.067161
ID13,CVS Health,2025-06-12 23:49:20+00:00,WTOP News,Louisiana AG investigating CVS for sending mass text messages lobbying against legislation - WTOP,The Associated Press,,,,,https://wtop.com/national/2025/06/louisiana-ag-investigating-cvs-for-sending-mass-text-messages-lobbying-against-legislation/,"(AP) — Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers’ personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.
As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.
“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy — your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.
“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter read.
He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers “may shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.” “No we’re not, you liars.","BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers’ personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.

Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.

As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.

“Last minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy — your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,” one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.

Bill would have banned ownership of both drug stores and pharmacy benefit managers

The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.

The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country’s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.

“These powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,” a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.

CVS says on its website that it “negotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.”

CVS texts included a draft letter opposing the bill

The company’s text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.

“The proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients’ ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,” the letter read. “They would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care – the consequences would be dire.”

Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers “may shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.”

“No we’re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said.

A GOP lawmaker received one of the texts

Republican Rep. Bryan Fontenot held up his phone, showing that he, too, had received a text message from CVS.

“It’s in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,” he said. “They’ve now taken that to send me political texts.”

CVS sent messages to “large numbers” of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company’s pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.

Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information “for their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,” Murrill told reporters. “That’s not why anybody gave them their phone number.”

Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.

The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee — a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.

“We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,” Thibault said in an email. “Our communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.”

Landry says he may call special session

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state’s legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.

The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.

Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS’s lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn’t be able to access their medications.

“CVS … you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,” Landry said.

The bill ultimately died with the Senate opting not to take it up in the final hour of the 2025 session.

Landry said he plans to call a special session in hopes of passing similar legislation.

“Yes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens,” Landry said a statement. “It’s that important.”

They did the most brand PR work for us within the U.S. and wider North America.
We will work with The Weber Shandwick Collective collaboratively.
Any comment on how this will affect Mars’ agency relationships?
Why did you pick The Weber Shandwick Collective?","In January 2026, Mars will launch a new agency model globally across its Snacking and Petcare businesses.

Interpublic Group’s The Weber Shandwick Collective will handle earned media; and Publicis Groupe will have oversight of media production, connected commerce, paid influencer and paid social work. Creative will continue to be handled by Omnicom’s BBDO and DDB.

PRWeek’s Diana Bradley sat down with Andy Pharoah, VP of corporate affairs and sustainability at Mars, to find out more about why the company reworked its agency roster.

What inspired Mars to make this change now?

This isn't just about an agency win or loss. This is about a completely different approach to building brands in which ‘earned first’ takes a massive role.

This is a very strategic shift. The reality is, 50% of reach to consumers is not ad-funded. If you look at Gen Z, 73% of its purchases are influenced by friends, communities and influencers. This is a complete pivot in terms of how we think about marketing, and, for the first time, adapting an earned-first approach. We have never had an agency doing what we are looking for [The Weber Shandwick Collective] to do in support of our brands, covering all of our consumer brands globally. This is about remaining relevant, putting the fans, communities and pet owners in the driver’s seat, and it is linking right through the chain to digital commerce. This is about a new growth equation and how we are thinking about building the business. Earned is playing a key role at the table.

This has been a long process. I have to pay great tribute to our lead CMO, Gülen Bengi, who came to a point of view midway through last year that the marketing world had changed so much that to build a relevant reach and truly connect and engage with our consumers, we need to do things very differently.

Talk me through how the new agency structure will change PR strategy for Mars Snacking and Petcare?

It means for our big consumer brands and for those two businesses, there will be a very integrated approach to how we hog the conversation, reach consumers and how we have two-way conversations with consumers. It’s really about how you ensure there is a cultural fluency It’s taking the idea of the press office or newsroom mindset into how we build our brands in a super-integrated way.

Mars confirmed Edelman will no longer handle brand PR. Are you ending relationships with any other PR firms?

All brand PR, as of January, will move under this arena. There will be a host of local relationships in support of brands that will no longer continue. We have never before had one agency that covered brand PR for a Mars business unit globally or one agency that would cover PR for one brand globally. So this is moving away from having a large number of tactical relationships into something that is much more strategic with an earned-first mindset at the outset.

Will there be any changes to Mars’ in-house comms team?

We will have to evolve to make sure we are making this work in the best possible way. [With] the amount of digital fluency and data fluency we want to build into our approaches, it will inevitably be that we build skills and capabilities in our agency partners and within Mars. Just as we think about the transformation we are expecting from our partners, we need to be on that transformation journey ourselves. We have a very comprehensive capability-development program internally, so we are looking to integrate this into it and ensure also that in each of the key businesses, it has the right senior stewardship and leadership. It means I am going to spend more of my time thinking about these topics than I would have previously. Similarly, our VPs of corporate affairs in the specific businesses at a global level and regionally will spend more time thinking about these topics.

Aside from The Weber Shandwick Collective, what other PR firms within IPG will Mars work with?

It was a comprehensive process. Weber Shandwick has been a long-term partner. They did the most brand PR work for us within the U.S. and wider North America. We are trying to do this globally with a single agency partner. We will work with The Weber Shandwick Collective collaboratively. It is always the case that not one single agency has the best capabilities in every market at all times, so we are working with all our partners to ensure we make full use of the broader capabilities within those agency groups.

We are starting with The Weber Shandwick Collective, and that is who works with us and who pitched, but as this develops and as we find what is the best in every market in support of our core brands, we are open to a broader approach across IPG. It’s foolish to rule out any approach to realize the dream we are after.

Omnicom is in the process of acquiring Interpublic Group. Any comment on how this will affect Mars’ agency relationships?

I can't comment on the merger. Omnicom is our retained creative agency. If the acquisition goes ahead, IPG will become part of Omnicom. If you look at our partners, any PR agency worth their salt has a record of successfully working with other agencies in the marketing mix that can sometimes be part of the same holding company or other holding companies. So we don't think it will meaningfully change things. No one has a monopoly on creativity. Creativity cannot be coded. In this earned-first world, it’s the idea that connects and has virality, so that is how we are expecting all our agency partners to work.

Why did you pick The Weber Shandwick Collective?

They are a strong partner for us. They have done some great work. They stood out for their ability to match the scale of our ambition. They also have a mindset that aligns with our brand-building philosophy: global in vision, local in voice and culturally fluent by design. And they have been a partner for over 20 years.

With focus on rising sports media and marketing efforts, NHL team sponsorship revenue climbed 9% year-over-year to $1.5 billion for the 2024-25 season, according to SponsorUnited.

The average sponsorship deal is now at $529,000. Overall sponsorship revenue for the league is up 20% since the 2022-23 TV season.

It notes 500 new brands have made deals with the league year-over-year -- with finance (up 8%), business services (18%), and automotive brands (8%) accounting for one-third of the new sponsorship money.

Leading individual NHL high profile star players -- Connor McDavid (of the Edmonton Oilers) and Matthew Tkachuk (of the Florida Panthers) the faces of each participating Stanley Cup team – lead the league with eight brand deals each.

Focusing on growing uniform ‘patch” brand signage, SponsorUnited says the average NHL jersey patch deals range from $3.4 million to $4.2 million, which is nearly a third less than the average across the other leagues, which is approximately $6 million.

Biggest sponsorship spenders for the NHL: Crypto.com, AB InBev; Toyota Motor; Scotiabank; and Roger Communications.

The average sponsorship deal volume per team is now 92 -- up 7% from 89 in the previous season. The top five teams in terms of deals are the Nashville Predators, with 141; the Washington Capitals, with 139; the Vegas Golden Knights, with 136, and the Edmonton Oilers, with 119.

This report offers analysis of brand sponsorships, endorsements, and social engagement across the NHL and its athletes for the 2024-25season, encompassing more than 1,900 brands, 3,000 deals, and 46,500 social posts.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mediapost.com/publications/images/mp-logo-fb.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:13:46.657186

This relaunch coincides with Delta’s 100th anniversary and positions the airline to better serve Korean passengers while expanding its reach across the U.S. via its Salt Lake City hub.

Delta Restarts Salt Lake City to Seoul Flight

The newly launched Salt Lake City–Seoul route reflects Delta’s broader strategic efforts to reinforce its trans-Pacific network.

Operated in partnership with Korean Air (KE), this new service gives Korean travelers access to 35 U.S. cities through SLC, with efficient international-to-domestic connections averaging just 55 minutes, comparable to transfer times at Incheon.

Jeff Moomaw, Delta’s Vice President of Asia Pacific, highlighted the significance of the launch at a press event in Seoul. “This year marks Delta’s 100th anniversary. Introducing a new route to Korea during this milestone makes the occasion even more special,” he said.

Delta and Korean Air have operated a joint venture since 2018, and this collaboration now connects Seoul to 14 destinations across the United States. As a result, Delta has become the largest long-haul foreign carrier at Incheon International Airport (ICN).

Delta emphasized its commitment to deepening ties with Korean Air, describing the alliance as the leading trans-Pacific joint venture. Joint efforts include co-developed digital platforms and streamlined booking systems, allowing passengers to use either airline’s mobile app for reservations and check-in across both networks.

Moomaw explained, “Together, we’ve made joint investments in digital solutions and customer experience improvements to deliver top-tier service.” The integrated experience aims to provide travelers with a seamless journey, from booking to arrival.

Addressing Market Dynamics

Regarding recent investor activity involving Hanjin KAL—the parent of Korean Air—Delta downplayed speculation about management instability.

Hoban Construction recently acquired an 18.46% stake in Hanjin KAL, prompting speculation of a control dispute. However, Delta views the investment as non-disruptive.

“I have good trust in Walter Cho (Korean Air Chairman),” Moomaw stated. “We view Hoban’s stake increase as a simple investment.” In response to the move, Hanjin transferred treasury shares to its employee welfare fund, increasing Cho’s stake to 20.79% and maintaining a lead over Hoban.

Delta itself holds a 14.9% stake in Hanjin KAL, underscoring its vested interest in the long-term stability of Korean Air.

Delta also reaffirmed its strong support for the proposed merger between Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, viewing it as an opportunity to align flights with market demand and improve service quality.

“We are very excited about the acquisition,” Moomaw said. “Our priority remains aligning the right flights with the right markets to provide the best possible service to our passengers.”

New Summer 2025 Routes to Europe

Delta Air Lines launched its most extensive transatlantic summer schedule to date, introducing new direct flights from major U.S. hubs including New York (JFK), Atlanta (ATL), Boston (BOS), Minneapolis–St. Paul (MSP) and Detroit (DTW).

With expanded service to Europe, Delta becomes the largest U.S. carrier to destinations such as Italy, France, Greece, and Denmark, and the only U.S. airline flying nonstop to Prague (PRG) this season.

Delta Air Lines (DL) is not only adding capacity but also infusing its network expansion with vibrant, culture-rich celebrations.

The airline has ramped up operations to key European cities, reinforcing its leadership in transatlantic travel and spotlighting Italy as a central focus. Service to Italy has increased by over 10% year-over-year, solidifying Delta as the top U.S. carrier in the Italian market.

Each new route launch was marked by festive events at departure gates, highlighting the cultural identity of the destination.

Boston (BOS) to Barcelona (BCN): Logan Airport’s Terminal E hosted flamenco dancers and Spanish guitarists, bringing the vibrant streets of Barcelona to life. Travelers were welcomed with mocktails and a Spanish-themed send-off.

Boston (BOS) to Milan (MXP): The Milan-bound flight was celebrated with live opera performances and elegant Italian refreshments, offering a taste of Italy’s fashion capital before departure.

New York (JFK) to Catania (CTA): Delta’s first-ever direct route to Catania, Sicily, took off with a celebration featuring Sicilian desserts, a cannoli-inspired cake, and live regional music, channeling the spirit of Mount Etna and the Mediterranean coast.

Minneapolis–St. Paul (MSP) to Copenhagen (CPH): A ribbon-cutting ceremony with Delta executives and local officials marked this inaugural flight, accompanied by Scandinavian music and speeches recognizing the growing U.S.-Nordic connection.

Additional Routes Across Europe

Delta’s summer schedule includes several other key route launches that expand access across Europe:

Detroit (DTW) to Dublin, Ireland (DUB) – Connecting the Midwest to Ireland with direct service.

Atlanta (ATL) to Naples, Italy (NAP) – Enhancing access to Italy’s southern coast.

Minneapolis–St. Paul (MSP) to Rome, Italy (FCO) – Adding another gateway to the Italian capital.

Atlanta (ATL) to Brussels, Belgium (BRU) – Service launched June 10, linking Georgia with Belgium’s capital.

Delta’s move solidifies its role as a major player in U.S.-Europe air travel for summer 2025. With culturally rich celebrations and robust route offerings, the airline gives passengers enhanced opportunities to experience Europe directly from the U.S.

Delta’s Strategic Focus on European Growth

This network growth is part of Delta’s long-term strategy to capture demand for transatlantic travel, especially during peak summer months.

By leveraging its U.S. hubs and aligning route launches with local festivities, Delta strengthens its brand presence and customer loyalty across major European markets.

Italy, in particular, continues to be a priority, with Delta leading as the primary U.S. airline flying to multiple Italian cities. Enhanced connectivity, experiential send-offs, and diversified European access position Delta to compete aggressively with other global carriers on transatlantic routes.

“We believe a great partner experience fuels the customer experience,” said Grams.
LE25 will also spotlight the first-ever Starbucks Global Barista Championship— a celebration of Starbucks baristas who embody the company’s commitment to community, connection and craft.","LAS VEGAS, USA – This week, Starbucks is hosting over 14,000 coffeehouse leaders from across North America at Leadership Experience 2025 (LE25) in Las Vegas—its largest leadership gathering ever and the first under chairman and ceo Brian Niccol and coo Mike Grams.

“Getting ‘Back to Starbucks’ means refocusing on what has always set us apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas,” said Niccol. “We are bringing together our coffeehouse leaders from across North America to celebrate, empower and equip them to accelerate our transformation. The coffeehouse experience defines the Starbucks brand, and these leaders and their teams bring that experience to life for millions of customers every day.”

Starbucks: A new era of leadership and customer experience

LE25 is an important milestone for Starbucks. Over three days, coffeehouse leaders will engage in immersive workshops, connect over new ways of working, hear directly from company leaders, and experience the first-ever Starbucks Global Barista Championship, celebrating craft, connection, excellence at its best.

The event will accelerate Starbucks turnaround—centered on exceptional service, simplified routines, and deeper customer connections. Leaders will explore new innovations, clearer customer service standards, and a renewed focus on hospitality, including a goal of four-minute wait times – without compromising the warmth and connection that define the Starbucks Experience.

“This isn’t just a reset—it’s a recommitment to who we are when we are at our best,” said Grams. “LE25 is our moment to recommit to a culture of hospitality and excellence. We’re making progress, have real momentum with our ‘Back to Starbucks’ plan and are on the right track to turn the business around.”

Since launching its Back to Starbucks strategy nine months ago, customers are already feeling the difference, with welcoming spaces, more confident baristas, faster service, and the return of small but meaningful touches like ceramic mugs, handwritten notes on cups, a more consistent dress code, and a much-loved customer favorite: the condiment bar.

“Our turnaround is rooted in listening—to partners and customers—and taking action on what we hear,” added Grams. “We’re listening and testing in the coffeehouse, and then applying our learnings to scale quickly and enhance the customer and partner experience.”

Leading with partners, Winning with customers

Starbucks continues to lead the industry in partner (employee) care, offering industry-leading pay and benefits that average more than $30 per hour for baristas. Benefits for eligible partners include 100% tuition coverage for a first-time bachelor’s degree from Arizona State University, up to 18 weeks of paid parental leave, equity in the form of stock, and more. As part of its focus on making Starbucks the best job in retail, the company now also has a goal to hire 90% of retail leaders from within, fostering a culture of growth and opportunity.

Since launching Back to Starbucks, Starbucks has seen strong early results: shift completion rates are at record highs, turnover is at a record low—less than half the industry average—and partner engagement scores continue to rise. In a recent internal survey, 84% of U.S. store partners—over 160,000 baristas and coffeehouse leaders—shared their feedback, marking the highest participation rate to date. The results show a strong upward trend in partner engagement, with strong and growing majorities of both coffeehouse leaders and baristas recommending Starbucks as a great place to work.

“We believe a great partner experience fuels the customer experience,” said Grams. “We always have more work to do, but our partners are rallying behind Back to Starbucks and telling us they like what they see. When our partners feel supported, our customers notice the difference too.”

Coffee and craft take center stage

LE25 kicks off today with Starbucks largest-ever coffee tasting, featuring a first taste of the new Starbucks 1971 Roast™, available in the U.S. and Canada this Winter. The company is also celebrating the impact of its investment in the Global Farmer Fund, supporting long-term sustainability across Origin communities.

LE25 will also spotlight the first-ever Starbucks Global Barista Championship— a celebration of Starbucks baristas who embody the company’s commitment to community, connection and craft. Over the three-day competition, 12 baristas from around the world will showcase their coffee passion and expertise through a variety of skills and knowledge-based competitions.

“We’re returning to what made us iconic: handcrafted coffee, human connection, and a relentless focus on excellence,” said Niccol. “We’re reigniting the soul of Starbucks, together.”

Giving back in Las Vegas

This week, Starbucks is demonstrating how major events can be designed with sustainability and community in mind. LE25 is powered by 100% renewable electricity sourced within 500 miles of Las Vegas. Starbucks will donate any surplus food to its FoodShare partner Three Square Food Bank, divert food waste and coffee grounds from the event to local farms, and plant 10 trees per attendee to support reforestation efforts in South American coffee-growing communities.

The Starbucks Foundation will invite attendees to vote for five local Las Vegas organizations to receive grants, with an estimated $100,000 to be donated to causes like hunger relief, homelessness, youth empowerment and more. The Starbucks Foundation is also donating a $10,000 Neighborhood Grant to each Barista Championship contestant’s chosen nonprofit.",https://www.comunicaffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Logo-Starbucks-e1656573908529.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 01:08:50.694800

With this success, Ralph Lauren is already planning to increase prices even more in the upcoming fall as well as next year's spring.
Needless to say, it's pretty clear that Ralph Lauren has no interest in courting price-conscious customers.
Instead, it seems to be moving even more into a high-end market as it looks to become an even more exclusive brand.","Ralph Lauren has long been one of the biggest and most influential names in men's fashion, and it sounds like they are looking to lean on that notoriety as they look to raise prices and continue to court less price-sensitive customers.

Last month, Ralph Lauren announced during a call with analysts that it planned to raise its prices in the coming months into next year.

While the move is in line with moves from other similar clothing brands responding to the tariffs that were recently imposed by the Donald Trump administration, it does not sound like that is the sole reason for Ralph Lauren's price increases.

As it turns out, the company was already planning to increase its prices even before the tariffs were announced as it moves forward with what appears to be a new brand identity.

During a recent call with analysts, Ralph Lauren Chief Financial Officer Justin Picicci explained that the brand was shifting its focus toward younger and more high-end customers who are less sensitive to price increases.

“We’ve been on this multi-year journey to shift our customer base towards less price-sensitive consumers, especially in the full-price channel,” Picicci said on a call with analysts according to the Wall Street Journal.

While this might not be good news for some consumers, it sounds like the brand has already had success with the strategy, reporting larger profits and a jump in revenue for the first three months of the year as a result of those higher prices and lower cotton costs.

With this success, Ralph Lauren is already planning to increase prices even more in the upcoming fall as well as next year's spring.

Needless to say, it's pretty clear that Ralph Lauren has no interest in courting price-conscious customers.

According to the UFCW Local 324 and 770 Bargaining Committee, negotiations have been going on for months without successful progress.
Zinder said negotiations have become increasingly strained and difficult, and she said the vote is meant to protest against unfair labor practices.
Albertsons’ Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the Southern California division, Courtney Carranza, provided a statement to Voice of OC regarding the contract negotiations.
If the companies are not willing to make progress towards reaching an agreement with the union’s demands, the employees are prepared to strike, she said.","Yesterday, 45,000 Southern California grocery workers voted to authorize a strike against Albertsons, Vons and Ralphs after months of what union officials say are unfair labor practices during contract negotiations.

President of UFCW Local 324 Andrea Zinder said both companies — Albertsons, which owns and operates Albertsons, Vons and Pavilions, and Kroger, which owns and operates Ralphs — have used intimidation tactics, surveillance methods and threats to managers to interfere with negotiations.

According to the UFCW Local 324 and 770 Bargaining Committee, negotiations have been going on for months without successful progress.

“For four months, we’ve negotiated with Kroger and Albertsons, offering solutions to the staff shortage crisis that hurts store operations, working conditions, and customer service,” reads a Wednesday statement from union representatives. “The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were ‘anecdotal’, downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily.”

The strike authorization vote means grocery workers are prepared to walk out if deemed necessary as they negotiate for increased wages, healthcare benefits and increased staffing.

Zinder said negotiations have become increasingly strained and difficult, and she said the vote is meant to protest against unfair labor practices.

“Negotiations are at a difficult point right now,” Zinder said in a phone interview on June 12.

Albertsons’ Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the Southern California division, Courtney Carranza, provided a statement to Voice of OC regarding the contract negotiations.

“We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers, and allows our company to remain competitive,” she wrote in a Thursday email.

A Ralphs spokesperson also responded to the claims.

“We remain actively engaged in bargaining with the Union because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption,” the spokesperson wrote in a Thursday email.

“Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading healthcare and a pension. These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer. We remain committed to good faith bargaining that rewards our hardworking associates and keeps groceries affordable for our customers.”

Zinder said employee wages have fallen behind the cost of living, even after a recent significant pay increase that was a result of 2022 contract negotiations.

“We want fair wages,” she said in a phone interview. “Our members are feeling the same effects of inflation as everyone in the community, but it is really hitting our members hard.”

She said staffing is another issue that grocery store employees want to see addressed in these contract negotiations.

“Stores are very understaffed,” Zinder said.

According to Zinder, when stores are understaffed, they increasingly rely on self-checkout, shelves may go unstocked and delis sometimes close early.

“This not only affects the customers, but it also affects the employees in the store,” Zinder said. “They are doing twice as much work, and the customers are often unhappy and lashing out at employees because they are so frustrated.”

Zinder also emphasized that understaffed stores result in safety issues and work environment issues.

There are three more dates of negotiations at the end of June, with the first one scheduled for June 25, according to Zinder.

The local grocery union president said she hopes these two companies come back to the table and give employees on the bargaining committee an opportunity to tell their stories and listen to the concerns and needs of employees regarding staffing and wage increases.

“We are hoping they will come back to the bargaining table, realizing they are making a lot of money,” she said. “Both of these companies are making a lot of money, giving millions out on Wall Street to shareholders.”

Zinder added that it was time these large corporations invested back into their stores.

“They need to invest in the stores,” she said. “Investing in the store not only means putting in more money to remodel, but it also means paying employees what they deserve and having enough employees.”

Zinder said a rally will take place on June 20 in Long Beach to raise awareness and give a platform to workers’ demands.

If the companies are not willing to make progress towards reaching an agreement with the union’s demands, the employees are prepared to strike, she said.

“If we are not able to make progress, we may need to go on strike over these unfair labor practices that companies have committed,” Zinder said.

Zinder said that only select stores would face strikes, but that all employees are getting ready if it becomes necessary.

“We are hoping that companies will understand that we are serious and they need to do the right thing or they will face strikes outside their stores.”",https://voiceofoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_4113.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:15:17.098991

“My direct focus is on clinician engagement, particularly physicians and nurses, and their well-being,” Dr. Goodrich said.
The company is focused on reducing clinician turnover and allowing them to practice at the top of their license.
“Clinicians sometimes feel like they’re not being seen or heard,” Dr. Goodrich said.
Humana recently piloted ambient AI technology to reduce documentation burden, which records a physician-patient visit and generates a note.","Humana is taking proactive steps to address burnout and improve engagement for its thousands of employed or affiliated clinicians by focusing on well-being, reducing turnover, and tackling frustrations related to technology and administrative processes, according to the company’s Chief Medical Officer, Kate Goodrich, MD.

Dr. Goodrich discussed the company’s recent ambient AI pilot on the Becker’s Healthcare podcast, an episode that will air later this month.

“My direct focus is on clinician engagement, particularly physicians and nurses, and their well-being,” Dr. Goodrich said. “I’m also increasingly focused on improving our working relationship with clinicians that we contract with. We want to find ways to address friction points and administrative frustrations between providers and payers. There’s a lot of potential there, and a strong desire to improve that area.”

Five notes:

1. Humana has around 1,200 physicians across its insurance and care delivery divisions, as well as about 7,000 nurses. The company is focused on reducing clinician turnover and allowing them to practice at the top of their license.

2. One area the company is targeting regarding clinician burnout is frustration around daily technology use, including the use of EHRs.

“Clinicians sometimes feel like they’re not being seen or heard,” Dr. Goodrich said. “They believe they could contribute more, but they aren’t always invited to the right conversations. Additionally, they want opportunities for growth and development.”

3. Humana recently piloted ambient AI technology to reduce documentation burden, which records a physician-patient visit and generates a note.

4. Surveyed clinicians say the ambient tool is reducing documentation time and cognitive load, or the mental fatigue caused by managing too much complexity during patient visits.

5. Humana is also developing AI tools that could summarize a patient’s medical history and interactions, such as hospital visits or prescriptions. This would save time spent searching through multiple portals and improve accuracy by providing a concise summary before the clinician meets the patient.",https://www.beckerspayer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/payer-og-image.png,N,,2025-06-12 22:25:52.502498

Sunna will lead corporate, regulatory, civil society and category communications across PMI’s U.S. operations and serve as a member of the U.S. senior management team, according to a statement from the company.

Sunna has worked at PMI since 2018. She joined the company as director of corporate comms and executive brands and was promoted to her most recent role as VP of corporate communications in 2022, according to her LinkedIn profile.

In that role, she helped to shape and execute global communications strategies that strengthened the company’s reputation and stakeholder engagement, according to a PMI statement.

According to ABC 25 Columbia, over 50 percent of Costco members have already downloaded the Scan & Pay app during its current testing phase.
One of the big box store’s biggest competitors, the Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, has offered a similar feature known as Scan & Go for a while.

But each consumer’s impulse to heap their cart with deals can lead to lines with long waits at the register. The membership-focused franchise aims to address the issue with its newest feature, Scan & Pay.

As its name suggests, the technology—a collaboration with Instacart—allows shoppers to scan the items they want, add them to their digital shopping carts, and pay for everything via the company app. Customers must then scan a QR code at a kiosk before exiting the store.

During the company’s fiscal third-quarter earnings call, CEO Ron Vachris described some early Scan & Pay test results as “very positive” for members and “successful” at speeding up lines. According to ABC 25 Columbia, over 50 percent of Costco members have already downloaded the Scan & Pay app during its current testing phase.

Costco isn’t the only chain that’s using technology to expedite its checkout process. One of the big box store’s biggest competitors, the Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, has offered a similar feature known as Scan & Go for a while. As Fortune reports, Sam’s Club developed the tech in 2013, but customers could initially only pay for their items via self-checkout registers. The retailer eventually allowed shoppers to checkout and pay through its designated app. Now, Sam’s Club wants to get rid of self-checkout lines all together in favor of Scan & Go—it even replaced manual receipt checks with AI and “computer vision tech” in January 2024.

This isn’t Instacart’s first foray into the world of high-tech grocery shopping, either.

""We've got to get the seats back,"" he said in an interview at the company's Leadership Experience event in Las Vegas.

Why it matters: ""We had this strategy that I think was just a misfire of a purpose-driven store. It's like, well, the purpose is community connection,"" Niccol said. ""I think that's what got us off our game.""

""We've got to get the seats back,"" he said in an interview at the company's Leadership Experience event in Las Vegas.

The big picture: Under Niccol — who joined from Chipotle in September — Starbucks has been making a series of changes to reverse a decline in foot traffic and sales as part of what it calls the ""Back to Starbucks"" plan.

After years of prioritizing digital orders and drive-thrus, Starbucks is looking to create community spaces with more seating, bringing back ceramic mugs and adding new menu items, Niccol said.

He tells Axios that the company has been making progress, but it might take time before the results show up in earnings.

""I hope sooner rather than later,"" he said.

Zoom in: Niccol called Starbucks' iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte a ""fastball"" and said the company has to create new ""fastballs for the business.""

Some of the products being tested like a ""chocolate protein cold foam,"" banana bread lattes and food that's baked in stores, he said.

""It's significantly better and it also just looks delicious,"" he said of two croissants and a double chocolate cookie being tested. We got to innovate on those things.""

What's next: Starbucks is rolling out a ""Green Apron Service Model"" to stores by the end of the summer, Niccol said, which it hopes will speed up the time it takes to make drinks. The company's goal: a 4-minute wait time for drinks.

The company announced this week it will add full-time assistant managers across the U.S. to help busy stores run more smoothly.

""We're going to have innovation to our app, our rewards program, and that will happen over the next six to nine months,"" Niccol told Axios.

The intrigue: Niccol's turnaround plan has the support of former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who said Wednesday that he ""did a cartwheel in my living room"" the first time he heard about the strategy.

""It was so brilliant. It's short, to the point and it's exactly to the tip of the spear who we should be and who we are,"" Schultz said from the stage. ""And we are, above all else, a coffee company.""

Reporting directly to CEO Sam Altman, the move to the ChatGPT-maker represents the latest chapter in a career that has taken Simo from a fishing family in France's Mediterranean port of Sete to the heights of Silicon Valley.

As the current CEO of grocery delivery platform Instacart, she cuts a unique profile: a French woman in the male-dominated American tech landscape—who resists advice to blend in.

""I can put all my energy trying to be someone else or I can be myself and pour all of that energy into what I can create,"" she told CNBC in February.

This philosophy will likely be on display when she appears Thursday at the VivaTech conference in Paris.

Raised in Sete, Simo attended the elite HEC business school before joining eBay in 2006, first in France then in California.

""People expect a very business-like story for why I decided to come to the US. It wasn't. The American Dream was on TV every night and that was an incredibly appealing thing,"" she said.

'Never Intimidated'

In 2011, Simo joined Facebook, now Meta. She was given responsibility for video and monetization in 2014, a role she considers the defining moment of her career.

Simo championed the company's pivot to video, which became central to Meta's strategy despite initial internal skepticism.

""She never let herself be intimidated,"" recalled David Marcus, who worked at Meta alongside Simo and now serves as CEO of online payment company Lightspark.

""She had an ability to challenge Mark (Zuckerberg) and push him, when others would have hesitated.""

Joining Instacart in 2021, Simo inherited a company that had been bleeding money for a decade.

Under her leadership, the grocery delivery platform achieved profitability in 2022 through aggressive diversification: data monetization, expanded retail partnerships and a robust advertising business.

Now Simo faces her biggest test yet. As OpenAI's number two, she'll free up CEO Altman to focus on research and infrastructure while she tackles the company's operational challenges.

Despite being one of history's most highly funded startups and ChatGPT's phenomenal success, OpenAI is burning cash at an alarming rate.

The company has also weathered significant leadership turnover, including Altman's own brief ouster and reinstatement in 2023, raising questions about management stability.

But French investor Julien Codorniou, who worked alongside Simo at Facebook, said she will more than rise to the occasion.

""Fidji's arrival is a declaration of ambition by OpenAI,"" he said.

Kroger and Albertsons are the parent companies of Ralphs, Vons, and Pavilions grocery stores.

The UFCW Locals 324 and 770 Bargaining Committee said the following:

“The results are in, and we have overwhelmingly voted to authorize an Unfair Labor Practice strike at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions throughout Southern California. Our message is clear: we are fed up with these corporations’ union-busting tactics designed to intimidate us and prevent us from getting the fair contract that we’ve earned and deserve.

“For four months, we’ve negotiated with Kroger and Albertsons, offering solutions to the staff shortage crisis that hurts store operations, working conditions, and customer service. The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were ‘anecdotal’, downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily.

“At the same time, the companies have broken labor laws by engaging in unlawful surveillance, interrogation of members at actions, threats, and retaliation for union activity. This is unacceptable.

“We’re at the breaking point. We are disrespected, overworked, and undervalued by Kroger and Albertsons. We’re tired of asking these corporations to invest in their workers and customers, only to see no results. We’re tired of asking the companies to respect our labor rights and seeing our co-workers intimidated.

“This strike authorization vote means that we expect the companies to return to the bargaining table, negotiate a deal that works for everyone, and desist from their unlawful tactics, before we walk out and hit the picket lines.”

Grocery shoppers are also feeling frustrated by major grocery chains like Kroger and Albertsons, and recent reports show why. Consumer Reports caught Kroger overcharging customers by 18.4%, while the Economic Roundtable’s “Bullies at the Table” study shows 92% of workers have witnessed this practice. A customer survey conducted by UFCW Locals 770 and 324, along with LAANE, reveals most shoppers report severe understaffing at Kroger and Albertsons stores, resulting in empty shelves, unbearable checkout lines, and shifted burden to shoppers.

Forty-five thousand UFCW members across Southern California who work at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions took unfair labor practice strike authorization votes the first two weeks of June. Negotiations are scheduled to continue on June 25, 26 and 27.

Tens of thousands of additional union grocery workers across the country who are employed by Kroger and Albertsons –the parent companies of Ralphs, Vons, and Pavilions– also voted to authorize a strike last week, bringing over 100,000 grocery workers to the brink of a strike at the same time. Should the workers call a strike, it could create the largest grocery strike in modern history, and a major labor disruption for two of the nation’s largest grocery chains this summer, their busiest season of the year.

Grocery Workers Rising are employed at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, Pavilions, Stater Bros., Gelson’s and Super A stores. Their contracts expired on March 2, 2025.

These 65,000 grocery workers make up the largest union grocery contracts in the nation, are rising up and fighting for:

Living wages

Affordable healthcare benefits

A reliable pension

More staffing and better working conditions for a better customer experience

For decades, betting against McDonald’s has proven to be a losing strategy. The company has weathered every headwind imaginable: Calls for healthier eating, tougher labour laws, the rise and fall of plant-based meat, and complex procurement challenges. Through it all, McDonald’s has remained remarkably resilient.

But today, the fast-food giant may be facing its most formidable threat yet — and it has nothing to do with burgers or fries. It’s Ozempic.

CHARLEBOIS: Ozempic could do what health advocates couldn’t -- shrink McDonald’s Back to video

Article content

This week, McDonald’s shares dipped following an analyst downgrade, triggered by concerns over the growing use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic. Analysts estimate the company could lose up to 28 million customer visits in the U.S. alone. While the market reaction has been modest so far, the long-term implications are serious. By 2030, up to 30 million Americans — nearly 1 in 10 — may be using GLP-1 medications. In Canada, that number could reach between 1.5 and 3 million, equivalent to the entire population of the Island of Montreal.

These medications suppress appetite and, by extension, shift consumption patterns. Early data suggests that consumers on GLP-1s are eating less frequently and with greater intentionality. This poses a direct threat to brands built on impulse consumption — particularly those targeting value-conscious or lower-income demographics, a category into which McDonald’s firmly falls.

The food industry has faced disruption before. The rise of online grocery and food delivery services in the early 2000s challenged the sector’s reliance on impulse-based purchasing. Digital platforms forced companies to reimagine how they connect with consumers in a non-physical environment. The growing adoption of GLP-1s presents a similar disruption — but this time, the driver is physiological, not technological, and largely outside the industry’s control.

The downgrade of McDonald’s stock should not be dismissed lightly. In Canada, the company operates more than 1,400 restaurants, employs approximately 90,000 people, and commands 18% to 20% of the quick-service market. It serves more than 2.5 million Canadians every day. McDonald’s is also the largest single buyer of Canadian beef and eggs in the foodservice industry — making it a crucial link in the domestic agri-food value chain.

Other signals point to broader structural shifts. WeightWatchers has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Major snacking companies are also feeling the pressure. Year-over-year, PepsiCo’s stock is down nearly 21%, Nestlé is down 10%, and Mars has seen a 5% decline. Nestlé has even introduced a line of “Ozempic-friendly” products to cater to a new consumer reality: Smaller appetites, higher sensitivity to side effects, and less frequent indulgence.

As was the case with the rise of plant-based diets, the food industry is once again being forced to adapt. The difference this time is that GLP-1 usage isn’t a lifestyle choice — it’s a medical intervention. Quick-service chains now recognize that if one member of a group can’t find a suitable menu option, the entire group may choose to dine elsewhere.

This is, quite simply, a turning point. It marks the first time in modern history that a pharmaceutical innovation is reshaping the global food landscape at scale. McDonald’s has proven its adaptability in the past and may do so again. But make no mistake: The GLP-1 revolution has the full attention of many executives in the food industry — and with good reason.

North American factories remain underutilized, with persistent weakness in Mexico and Canada

Europe inches toward industrial recovery, while U.K. downturn deepens

CLARK, N.J., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index — a leading indicator tracking demand conditions, shortages, transportation costs, inventories, and backlogs based on a monthly survey of 27,000 businesses — fell to -0.46 in May, from -0.39 in April, signaling increasing spare capacity across the world's supply chains as a result of tariffs and tit-for-tat trade war.

Global supply chain activity was driven lower by a deterioration across Asia, which reported the greatest degree of spare capacity in almost a year and a half. The quantity of raw materials and components purchased by Asian factories weakened for the second consecutive month in May, signaling stronger retrenchment. Notably, China was central to this regionwide decline during May.

North America's supply chains remain underutilized due to considerable weakness in Mexico and Canada. In the U.S., manufacturers continue to be underutilized, but they increased purchases of raw materials and commodities, bolstering inventories to protect against future higher prices or supply disruptions.

The European industrial sector edged closer to recovery, with activity at the region's suppliers broadly level with April, which was the strongest for 10 months. Manufacturers on the continent have been buoyed by recently announced fiscal stimulus measures, particularly in Germany. The U.K.'s supply chains remain severely underutilized, with the country's manufacturers retrenching aggressively again in May.

""U.S.-China trade talks come at a critical moment — Chinese factory demand has dropped sharply, and U.S. manufacturing is weighed down by excess capacity,"" said John Piatek, VP consulting, GEP. ""This isn't just macro noise. Tariffs are already reshaping procurement strategies as companies front-load inventories, diversify suppliers, and brace for a longer game of economic decoupling.""

Interpreting the data:Index > 0, supply chain capacity is being stretched. The further above 0, the more stretched supply chains are.Index < 0, supply chain capacity is being underutilized. The further below 0, the more underutilized supply chains are.

Interpreting the data:Index > 0, supply chain capacity is being stretched. The further above 0, the more stretched supply chains are.Index < 0, supply chain capacity is being underutilized. The further below 0, the more underutilized supply chains are.

MAY 2025 REGIONAL KEY FINDINGS

ASIA: Index fell to -0.40, from -0.32, signaling that the region's supply chains were the most underutilized since December 2023. Chinese factories pulled back their purchasing in May.

NORTH AMERICA: Index rose to -0.24, from -0.34, reflecting some pickup in purchasing volumes in the U.S., driving supply chain activity higher. Weak conditions in Mexico and Canada continue to weigh on manufacturing in the region.

EUROPE: Index little changed since April (-0.29), down fractionally to -0.30. Albeit still indicating underutilized supplier capacity, the index is much higher than on average over the past two years as Europe's industrial recovery progresses.

U.K.: Index rose to -0.97, from -1.12, but still at a level indicative of considerable slack across supply chains, showing marked weakness across the U.K. manufacturing industry.

MAY 2025 KEY FINDINGS

DEMAND: Global demand for raw materials, commodities and components remained subdued, with no improvement seen since April and therefore meaning it remains at its weakest in the year-to-date. Procurement activity in Asia was down at its sharpest in nearly a year and a half, driven by retrenchment among Chinese factories.

INVENTORIES: Global safety stockpiling reports remain historically low, primarily due to inventory strategies in Europe, with manufacturers across the continent continuing to favor lean warehouses. This contrasts with the trend in North America, with safety stockpiling above its long-term average for a second successive month.

MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Our global item shortages indicator, which tracks the availability of critical commodities, common inputs and components, remains below its long-term average, signaling robust global material supply levels. This metric implies that vendors have stock to meet orders from their customers.

LABOR SHORTAGES: Reports of backlogged work rising due to staff shortages ticked up slightly at the global level in May but overall, they remain close to historically typical levels, indicating that suppliers' workforce capacity remains sufficient to cope with current demand.

TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs were broadly in line with their long-term average in May.

About the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility IndexThe GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is produced by S&P Global and GEP. It is derived from S&P Global's PMI® surveys, sent to companies in over 40 countries, totaling around 27,000 companies. The headline figure is a weighted sum of six sub-indices derived from PMI data, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price & Supply Indicators compiled by S&P Global.

A value above 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being stretched and supply chain volatility is increasing. The further above 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being stretched.

A value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility. The further below 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being underutilized.

A Supply Chain Volatility Index is also published at a regional level for Europe, Asia, North America and the U.K. For more information about the methodology, click here.

It seeks to meet the demands of B2B and hybrid ecommerce buyers who increasingly expect consumer-grade delivery speed and flexibility.
Essendant and Roadie partnership The partnership allows Essendant to integrate Roadie directly into its existing fulfillment network, which includes 30 distribution centers across the U.S.

It covers technology and business trends in the growing B2B ecommerce industry.","Essendant has partnered with Roadie to boost its local delivery capabilities and support the rapid growth of its ecommerce operations.

Essendant is a distributor of business supplies. The United Parcel Service (UPS) owns Roadie, a crowdsourced delivery platform. The agreement gives Essendant access to Roadie’s network of more than 200,000 independent drivers. That enables the distributor to offer same-day and next-day delivery in metropolitan markets and hard-to-reach locations without expanding its own fleet. The move is part of a broader push to modernize Essendant’s logistics infrastructure. It seeks to meet the demands of B2B and hybrid ecommerce buyers who increasingly expect consumer-grade delivery speed and flexibility.

Essendant and Roadie partnership

The partnership allows Essendant to integrate Roadie directly into its existing fulfillment network, which includes 30 distribution centers across the U.S. This integration will allow ecommerce orders to be routed dynamically based on proximity, carrier availability, and delivery times — key requirements in a B2B market that is rapidly adopting digital-first procurement practices.

“As ecommerce continues to reshape how businesses source and receive supplies, delivery speed has become a competitive differentiator,” said Tim Engstrom, senior vice president of supply chain at Essendant. “Our partnership with Roadie helps us close the last-mile gap without investing in dedicated assets, allowing us to move faster and smarter.”

Essendant’s logistics overhaul is part of a larger digital transformation strategy under new CEO Dave Rickard. He took the helm earlier this year following the departure of interim CEO David Boone. Rickard previously served as the company’s interim chief transformation officer. He brings experience from Uline, US Foods, and Boston Consulting Group.

Rickard now leads the company’s connected commerce initiative multi-pronged effort to:

Grow ecommerce sales

Integrate with online marketplaces

Offer seamless fulfillment options for both resellers and end-users.

Essendant says it currently partners with over 1,300 brands and 560 suppliers. It also says it supports ecommerce fulfillment to 98% of the U.S. population with next-day service.

The Roadie integration builds on this foundation by enabling Essendant to better serve B2B, B2C, and B2B2C channels through more responsive and scalable delivery solutions.

With more than $5 billion in annual net sales, Essendant is competing in a digital commerce environment where speed, transparency, and service reliability increasingly determine market share. The company says strategic partnerships like this one are key to meeting the expectations of modern ecommerce buyers while maintaining operational efficiency.

“Many cardiovascular device companies rely on manufacturing outside the U.S. to address demand, especially from the U.S.,” David Beauchamp, a medical analyst with GlobalData, said in a company statement.
Thus far, device companies have remained confident they can push forward in the face of tariffs.
For now, Beauchamp noted, these companies should prepare for “decreased revenues and growth” in the United States.
On June 10, the World Bank Group officially predicted that the U.S. economy will grow half as fast in 2025 as it did in 2024.","The Trump administration’s ongoing trade war with China could do significant long-term damage in the United States, creating new challenges for the country’s booming cardiovascular device market. That is all according to GlobalData, a leading data analytics firm.

“Many cardiovascular device companies rely on manufacturing outside the U.S. to address demand, especially from the U.S.,” David Beauchamp, a medical analyst with GlobalData, said in a company statement. “Tariffs are likely to cause increases in material cost and disrupt long-standing supply chains. Currently, the U.S. does not have the manufacturing capacity to adjust to possible losses that could result from the impacts of tariffs.”

Medical device manufacturers such as Medtronic, Edwards Lifesciences, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, Abbott and Boston Scientific have focused more and more on the cardiovascular market in recent years. The U.S. population is getting older—and in many cases, sicker—causing the demand for these devices to rise.

Thus far, device companies have remained confident they can push forward in the face of tariffs. Medtronic, for example, estimated that tariffs could cost the company up to $350 million, but its leaders do not seem too phased by the hurdle.

Only time will tell if that confidence persists. For now, Beauchamp noted, these companies should prepare for “decreased revenues and growth” in the United States.

“It remains unlikely that the U.S. can become completely self-sufficient in producing all the components required for advanced cardiovascular medical devices,” he said. “Without a more concrete and stable policy on these tariffs from the current American administration, it is likely that most manufacturers will be forced to continuously change their internal forecasts and production plans.”

Updates on trade disputes—and their impact on the global economy

There may be some good news on the horizon, according to new reports on the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China. One U.S. official told reporters that the latest talks between the two sides were a success. Chinese officials have said the same thing to the country’s own media.

On June 10, the World Bank Group officially predicted that the U.S. economy will grow half as fast in 2025 as it did in 2024. Trade disputes were specifically mentioned as a reason for that decrease in an official Global Economic Prospects report.

“Only six months ago, a ‘soft landing’ appeared to be in sight: the global economy was stabilizing after an extraordinary string of calamities both natural and man-made over the past few years,” according to the report’s foreword. “That moment has passed. The world economy today is once more running into turbulence. Without a swift course correction, the harm to living standards could be deep. International discord—about trade, in particular—has upended many of the policy certainties that helped shrink extreme poverty and expand prosperity after the end of World War II.”",https://cardiovascularbusiness.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/2024-08/istock-2060312303_1.jpg?h=140710cd&itok=iykcbjND,N,,2025-06-12 22:28:58.420686

The attack targeting M&S, which was first reported around Easter weekend, stopped it from processing online orders and also emptied some store shelves.
Companies' language around cyberattacks and security breaches also varies—and may depend on what they know when.","A string of recent cyberattacks and data breaches involving the systems of major retailers have started affecting shoppers.

United Natural Foods, a wholesale distributor that supplies Whole Foods and other grocers, said this week that a breach of its systems was disrupting its ability to fulfill orders—leaving many stores without certain items.

In the U.K., consumers could not order from the website of Marks & Spencer for more than six weeks—and found fewer in-store options after hackers targeted the British clothing, home goods and food retailer. A cyberattack on Co-op, a U.K. grocery chain, also led to empty shelves in some stores.

Cyberattacks have been on the rise across industries. But infiltrations of corporate technology carry their own set of implications when the target is a consumer-facing business.

Beyond potentially halting sales of physical goods, breaches can expose customers' personal data to future phishing or fraud attempts.

Here's what you need to know.

Cyberattacks are on the rise overall

Despite ongoing efforts from organizations to boost their cybersecurity defenses, experts note that cyberattacks continue to increase across the board.

In the past year, there's also been an ""uptick in the retail victims"" of such attacks, said Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, a U.S. nonprofit.

""Cyber criminals are moving a little quicker than we are in terms of securing our systems,"" he said.

Ransomware attacks—in which hackers demand a hefty payment to restore hacked systems—account for a growing share of cyber crimes, experts note. And of course, retail isn't the only affected sector. Tracking by NCC Group, a global cybersecurity and software escrow firm, showed that industrial businesses were most often targeted for ransomware attacks in April, followed by companies in the ""consumer discretionary"" sector.

Attackers know there's a particular impact when going after well-known brands and products that shoppers buy or need every day, experts note.

""Creating that chaos and that panic with consumers puts pressure on the retailer,"" Steinhauer said, especially if there's a ransom demand involved.

Ade Clewlow, an associate director and senior adviser at the NCC Group, points specifically to food supply chain disruptions. Following the cyberattacks targeting M&S and Co-op, for example, supermarkets in remote areas of the U.K., where inventory already was strained, saw product shortages.

""People were literally going without the basics,"" Clewlow said.

Personal data is also at risk

Along with impacting business operations, cyber breaches may compromise customer data. The information can range from names and email addresses, to more sensitive data like credit card numbers, depending on the scope of the breach. Consumers therefore need to stay alert, according to experts.

""If (consumers have) given their personal information to these retailers, then they just have to be on their guard. Not just immediately, but really going forward,"" Clewlow said, noting that recipients of the data may try to commit fraud ""downstream.""

Fraudsters might send look-alike emails asking a retailer's account holders to change their passwords or promising fake promotions to get customers to click on a sketchy link. A good rule of thumb is to pause before opening anything and to visit the company's recognized website or call an official customer service hotline to verify the email, experts say.

It's also best not to reuse the same passwords across multiple websites—because if one platform is breached, that login information could be used to get into other accounts, through a tactic known as ""credential stuffing."" Steinhauer adds that using multifactor authentication, when available, and freezing your credit are also useful for added lines of defense.

Which companies have reported recent cybersecurity incidents?

A range of consumer-facing companies have reported cybersecurity incidents recently—including breaches that have caused some businesses to halt operations.

United Natural Foods, a major distributor for Whole Foods and other grocers across North America, took some of its systems offline after discovering ""unauthorized activity"" on June 5.

In a securities filing, the company said the incident had impacted its ""ability to fulfill and distribute customer orders."" United Natural Foods said in a Wednesday update that it was ""working steadily"" to gradually restore the services.

Still, that's meant leaner supplies of certain items this week. A Whole Foods spokesperson told The Associated Press via email that it was working to restock shelves as soon as possible. The Amazon-owned grocer's partnership with United Natural Foods currently runs through May 2032.

Meanwhile, a security breach detected by Victoria's Secret last month led the popular lingerie seller to shut down its U.S. shopping site for nearly four days, as well as to halt some in-store services. Victoria's Secret later disclosed that its corporate systems also were affected, too, causing the company to delay the release of its first quarter earnings.

Several British retailers—M&S, Harrods and Co-op—have all pointed to impacts of recent cyberattacks. The attack targeting M&S, which was first reported around Easter weekend, stopped it from processing online orders and also emptied some store shelves.

The company estimated last month that the it would incur costs of 300 million pounds ($400 million) from the attack. But progress towards recovery was shared Tuesday, when M&S announced that some of its online order operations were back—with more set to be added in the coming weeks.

Other breaches exposed customer data, with brands like Adidas, The North Face and reportedly Cartier all disclosing that some contact information was compromised recently.

In a statement, The North Face said it discovered a ""small-scale credential stuffing attack"" on its website in April. The company reported that no credit card data was compromised and said the incident, which impacted 1,500 consumers, was ""quickly contained.""

Meanwhile, Adidas disclosed last month that an ""unauthorized external party"" obtained some data, which was mostly contact information, through a third-party customer service provider.

Whether or not the incidents are connected is unknown. Experts like Steinhauer note that hackers sometimes target a piece of software used by many different companies and organizations. But the range of tactics used could indicate the involvement of different groups.

Companies' language around cyberattacks and security breaches also varies—and may depend on what they know when. But many don't immediately or publicly specify whether ransomware was involved.

Still, Steinhauer says the likelihood of ransomware attacks is ""pretty high"" in today's cybersecurity landscape—and key indicators can include businesses taking their systems offline or delaying financial reporting.

Overall, experts say it's important to build up ""cyber hygiene"" defenses and preparations across organizations.

""Cyber is a business risk, and it needs to be treated that way,"" Clewlow said.

The new store replaces the former Barnes & Noble at the mall, which closed last year. It is on the first floor of Tysons Corner Center, across from H&M.

Barnes & Noble said the new store is slightly smaller than its previous Tysons store, but has nearly as many bookcases. It also includes a B&N Cafe.

Author David Baldacci will cut the grand opening ribbon at the store on Wednesday, and will be signing books, including his newest, Strangers in Time. Baldacci’s books have sold more than 150 million copies.

The new Tysons store extends Barnes & Noble’s significant comeback. After steadily closing stores for 15 consecutive years, it opened more new bookstores in 2024 than it did in an entire decade from 2009 to 2019. The chain is on track to open 60 new stores across the country this year.

Barnes & Noble has 20 stores in the D.C. region currently, one of its largest markets. Its high-profile Georgetown store opened last summer at 3040 M Street NW, the exact same building where it closed in 2011.

On June 11, Costco announced in a press release that Executive Members will receive a $10 monthly credit if they place their order online.

So, how does it work?

If you're a Costco Canada Executive Member, you'll receive a $10 credit each month when you place an online order on Sameday.costco.ca or through Instacart. The credit is then automatically applied when you place an order worth $150 or more.

""Costco Executive Members expect exceptional value — and now, they can get even more delivered to their door,"" said Daniel Danker, chief product officer at Instacart.

""Our new monthly credit makes it easier than ever for members across North America to get Costco's warehouse items with the convenience of fast and reliable delivery through Instacart.""

“The third place is not something we need to reinvent — it’s who we are,” Schultz said.
“People all over the world are longing for human connection… We are a company that is steeped in humanity.
That’s how we win.” Performance Through the Lens of Humanity Schultz passionately defended the idea that performance and humanity are not mutually exclusive.
And we are above all else, a coffee company.” “The craft of coffee has to be front and center…we must differentiate ourselves through coffee.","Greeted by a standing ovation and steady roar of applause at Starbucks Leadership Experience 2025 in Las Vegas, chairman and ceo Brian Niccol and founder Howard Schultz reflected on the company’s legacy, its future and the enduring importance of Starbucks as a “third place” — a community hub where human connection thrives.

Reclaiming the Third Place

Niccol opened the session by asking Schultz about the relevance of the third place in today’s world. Schultz responded by acknowledging global anxiety and uncertainty, noting that Starbucks role as a community anchor is more vital than ever.

“The third place is not something we need to reinvent — it’s who we are,” Schultz said. “People all over the world are longing for human connection… We are a company that is steeped in humanity. We are steeped in human connection, because of all of you and the people you represent.”

Schultz, who led Starbucks from a small Seattle roastery to a global brand with over 40,000 stores and nearly 500,000 partners, emphasized the need to reclaim Starbucks soul. “We’re not a company that needs AI to do what we do. It’s an enabler. What we need to do, is just be ourselves — be the people that we’ve been,” he said.

“Take it personal. Understand your responsibility to every customer and partner. That’s how we win.”

Performance Through the Lens of Humanity

Schultz passionately defended the idea that performance and humanity are not mutually exclusive. Reflecting on Starbucks growth from 11 stores in 1987 to 40,000 today, he said:

“We’ve always been a performance-driven company through the lens of humanity. That’s how we create opportunity.”

“This is a magical time [to be at Starbucks] … and I believe that when you go back to your store and extend everything you’ve learned to your partners … we’re going to come out of here like a tidal wave!”

The Two Chairs: Partners and Customers

One of the most memorable metaphors from the session was Schultz’s “two chairs” concept — a reminder that every decision should consider both the partner and the customer.

“If a decision doesn’t exceed expectations for both, we don’t do it. That’s our responsibility.”

Back to Starbucks: Coffee at the Core

Niccol and Schultz discussed the Back to Starbucks strategy, which centers on coffee excellence – the best coffee, served by the best baristas, in the best coffeehouses. Schultz emphasized that Starbucks must remain a coffee-first company.

“When I heard you speak for the first time about Back to Starbucks, I did a cartwheel in my living room!” said Schultz. “It’s short, it’s to the point, and it’s exactly the tip of the spear of who we should be, and who we are. And we are above all else, a coffee company.”

“The craft of coffee has to be front and center…we must differentiate ourselves through coffee. With coffee as the foundation, there are so many things we can do that create opportunities for the company, but the foundation must be coffee. Our core purpose and reason for being is to exceed the expectations of one customer and one partner at a time.”

The Mind of a Merchant

Schultz recounted his formative trip to Italy in 1983, where he was inspired by the artistry and attention to detail in Italian coffee bars. He urged leaders to embrace the “mind of a merchant” — focusing on quality, a welcoming environment and connection.

“People buy with their eyes. Create a multi-sensory experience; a sense of community that only we can create.”

Culture, Standards and Opportunity

Schultz closed with a call to action for each partner in the arena: be a culture carrier. He stressed that Starbucks success is not an entitlement — it must be earned every day through attention to detail and personal responsibility.

“The culture, the values, the guiding principles, the heritage is what built the brand. The responsibility of everyone in this room is to be a culture carrier. Respect the heritage and tradition, take care of your people, exceed the expectations of your customers and be steeped in coffee.”

“Everyone in this room has the power to make a difference. All you have to do is make a personal difference in the life of your partners, the life of your customers, and everything else is going to follow.”

A Tidal Wave of Optimism

Schultz ended with a message of hope and determination:

“Our success is not an entitlement – it must be earned,” said Schultz, adding, “I’ve never been more optimistic about Starbucks future. Take it back. Be true to the coffee. Be true to your partners. Let’s surprise the world again.”",https://about.starbucks.com/uploads/2025/06/Starbucks-LE-25-Howard-3-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 00:06:40.470928

The committee's report tracked the prices of the most popular Amazon listings for products from five of Babylist's categories of baby goods.
Of the five items studied, the Graco car seat saw the highest price increase.
Executives from Newell said during an April 30 earnings call that the company had raised prices on its baby gear by about 20%.","The cost of some baby gear has risen in recent weeks due to President Donald Trump's tariff policies, according to a new congressional report.

The cost of five common items bought for babies has increased 24%, or by $98 combined, between April 1 — the day before Trump's sweeping April 2 tariff announcement — and June 9, according to the analysis by the Joint Economic Committee's minority arm.

The analysis tracked the prices of five popular baby gear categories: car seats, bassinets, strollers, high chairs and baby monitors. It leaned on data from baby registry website Babylist.

""New parents already have their budgets stretched thin by all the products that they have to buy for their child – the last thing they need is a new tax on babies created by President Trump,"" said Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., ranking member of the committee, in a media release.

The findings come as companies grapple with Trump's ever-changing tariff policies. Some have said they will work to mitigate the impact of the levies and offset the costs to consumers, meanwhile, others, including Best Buy and Costco , have said they already raised some prices. Walmart and Target said they plan to hike prices on some items.

Baby gear sold in the U.S. is specifically at risk of tariff impact because 97% of strollers and 87% of car seats are manufactured in China, according to Babylist.

The committee's report tracked the prices of the most popular Amazon listings for products from five of Babylist's categories of baby goods. The Amazon bestsellers included items from brands Graco, AirClub, Summer by Ingenuity, Evenflo and HelloBaby. The report measured the price increases over time using the price-checking websites Keepa.com and Camelcamelcamel.com.

Of the five items studied, the Graco car seat saw the highest price increase. The Graco SnugRide Lite LX Infant Car Seat got 44.8% more expensive over the measured time period. Prices for the other products that were reviewed rose between 10% and 30%.

A spokesperson for Graco owner Newell Brands told CNBC in a statement that the report appears to have started collecting data on the Graco car seat during a period when retailers were running a promotion.

The spokesperson said the car seat was on sale on April 1, so the price was hiked by about $20, not by $43, as suggested in the report.

Executives from Newell said during an April 30 earnings call that the company had raised prices on its baby gear by about 20%. The company said at the time it was equipped to handle Trump's tariffs, excluding hypothetical further hikes on imports from China.

A broader Babylist analysis of 11 categories, including products like bouncers and diaper bags, found that costs increased by an average of $400 combined between March 10 and June 3. Those higher prices for new parent households in the U.S. amounts to $875.2 million in total additional costs, according to the analysis and based on data from the American Community Survey.

The study found particular risk for parents in California, with parents in that state collectively facing a potential $100.3 million in additional baby costs this year. That was followed by Texas at $85.3 million, Florida at $48.5 million and New York at $48.4 million, according to the report.

""Just in the last two months, the tariffs have made things even more difficult for new parents, forcing them to shoulder higher prices for car seats and other items that they absolutely need to keep their babies safe,"" Hassan said in a statement to CNBC. ""And the tariffs are already forcing some businesses to choose between laying off workers, raising prices for customers, or closing altogether.""

To that end, Amazon Pharmacy is scaling rapidly in logistical capabilities, integrating pharmacies directly into its vast logistical network to enable same-day medication delivery.
Amazon’s broader ambition remains clear: to fundamentally transform the consumer healthcare experience.
With significant logistical strengths, Amazon Pharmacy seeks to remove administrative burdens – automating data entry, streamlining billing processes, and reducing pharmacy deserts.
Who do you trust more to ship for consumers in healthcare – Amazon, CVS, or neither?","CVS’ $20B Consumer Pivot

CVS, the company with over $370B in revenue yet an $80B market cap, the company known as ‘3-letter’ to pharmacists, the company which operates a slowly dying retail footprint, the company which felt so threatened by Mark Cuban’s side hustle they felt the need to write out a full op-ed in Fortune, the company with 30%+ PBM market share, a segment of healthcare known for the most opaque economic practices known to mankind, and the company that has returned nothing to shareholders (outside of dividends) over the past 5 years…wants to make things easier for the healthcare consumer – and it is investing $20B over the next decade to do so.

Glaringly missing from its $20B consumer roadmap is the obvious need to make CVS Caremark, the largest PBM by market share, more transparent.

In general, non-competitive, consolidated markets lead to bad consumer experience. Vertical integration leads to patient steerage. While these dynamics CAN work to create a more cohesive, streamlined experience and perhaps more favorable situations for CVS-specific patients, in this walled garden ecosystem with basket-style pricing economics, CVS with its scale and business tactics tend toward anti-competitive practices. Plus they’re…pretty good at preserving margin and moving money away from rebates (hotly attacked in recent memory) to GPO management fees or specialty pharmacy fees (the largest growth vector nowadays) – from a great breakdown from Optum’s Advisory Board (and originally Nephron reporting):

“While contributions from commercial rebate retention decreased from 46% of estimated profit in 2012 to 13% in 2022 as a greater share of rebates were passed through to plan sponsors, the share of PBM profits derived from fees that are less likely to be shared with plan sponsors has grown from 5% in 2012 to 22% in 2023…

Putting it all together, we find that while increased pass through of rebates and price protection to plan sponsors have reduced these traditional sources of PBM profitability, novel PBM fees associated with contracting entities [GPOs] are more than offsetting this decline while expansion of specialty pharmacy is now the leading driver of PBM profit growth.” – Nephron Research, Trends in Profitability and Compensation of PBMs & PBM Contracting Entities

Alright. My quips are over – I promise. In an industry with scarcity and allocation of resources, someone has to be the bad guy to be a check on provider/pharma overutilization, and CVS just so happens to operate two extremely large ‘villain’ figures in healthcare – insurance and PBMs.

This rabbit hole aside, credit where credit is due for management around recognizing that CVS needs to reorient its consumer experience. Let’s dive into how they’re trying to achieve just that, since there are some interesting takeaways. While the original article is scant on details, a big part of CVS’ consumer-oriented strategy appears to be focused on interoperability: actually playing nice in the ecosystem.

Various administrations have attempted to encourage the industry to do this over the years, and a number of startups have attempted to develop platforms to host such an environment. But all have been unsuccessful for one key reason, said Tilak Mandadi, CVS Health’s chief experience and technology officer: Companies have been unwilling to shake things up.”

Wait…is that a CVS executive who just said that?

(alright, NOW I’m done)

CVS wants to embed its consumers into its ecosystem, and that means a more integrated, streamlined experience across the enterprise – pharmacists and Oak Street Health clinicians have complete longitudinal patient records; consumers know upfront prices; better notifications or communication; using AI as a call center extender; etc.

For AI, CVS laid out specific guardrails:

Never use AI for clinical diagnosis

Never use AI for prior auth / denials

Never use AI to prevent human touch

So, long story short, sounds like CVS will never use AI!

As far as CVS’ consumer-oriented strategy and vision is concerned, I’ll believe it when I see it. Actions speak louder than words, and I sure have seen a lot of words from CVS lately. This isn’t to rag on the initiative but more of a ‘raised eyebrows’ challenge at the company at the center of PBM disruption and opacity.

Inside Amazon Pharmacy’s Relentless focus on the Consumer

Here’s a company with a relentless focus on the consumer, and has held this core belief since its inception: Amazon.

Amazon, the company which has devoted every piece of capital in the name of its customers, the company which generates $630B+ in annual revenue and is worth over $2 trillion in market cap with a 65% return over the past 5 years (not market beating, to be fair), is slowly working its way deeper into the healthcare services industry.

Since acquiring PillPack in 2018 and launching Amazon Pharmacy in 2020, Amazon has emphasized affordability and transparency in pharmacy practices, initially targeting those paying cash, then moving into Medicare and directly competing with CVS’ retail pharmacy on both fronts. For Amazon, the end goal is always the consumer with an endless pursuit of making things easier for Amazon customers – even in healthcare, where incumbents don’t play nice.

Amazon bought PillPack to be a consumer healthcare platform play, and they’ve been building it that way ever since, launching transparent products like RxPass and overpaying for acquiring consumer-forward companies like One Medical:

“[Amazon’s Nader] Kabbani shared [TJ] Parker’s concern about the pharmacy industry and the dominant players’ inability or unwillingness to put the consumer first.”

So, Amazon Pharmacy is reshaping the healthcare landscape by leveraging its unique strengths in digital consumer experience, logistics, and technology-enabled simplification. I talked to Amazon Pharmacy’s John Love last week who was a wealth of information on what they’ve been up to, including PillPack’s move into Medicare and also around enabling caregivers to support loved ones by allowing them to manage medication.

Today Amazon is working receive access to PBM APIs so that members can access their benefits and know their price estimates. Notably, despite efforts to integrate directly with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to streamline copay estimates and claims, the largest three PBMs have yet to fully partner with Amazon, signaling ongoing resistance and complexities in data-sharing and transparency. Let’s just assume they’re worried about…API security.

Amazon has asked the PBMs for this access and all 3 of the big PBMs have “understood the request.”

Currently, Amazon Pharmacy serves approximately 1 in 4 customers through real-time benefit checks. Where they don’t have perfect information, the platform analyzes past claims data and other information to copays, leveraging machine learning to do so. Fascinatingly, simply by ESTIMATING copays for customers, Amazon learned they could improve medication adherence. Explain to me exactly why PBMs would be against that? (But really, if there’s a legitimate reason I’d love to know).

Amazon Pharmacy’s new offerings, PrimeRx, RxPass, and RxCoupon, illustrate Amazon’s consumer-centric approach across healthcare which has a simple goal: simplify, simplify, simplify. The team continues to recognize broken or failing aspects of the pharmacy value chain for the consumer. Quality of experience at the retail pharmacy is dismal. Mail order hasn’t evolved. So they set out a goal to get every U.S. citizen medication as quickly as possible, safely.

To that end, Amazon Pharmacy is scaling rapidly in logistical capabilities, integrating pharmacies directly into its vast logistical network to enable same-day medication delivery. By embedding pharmacies within distribution hubs, they’ve reduced delivery times from 2 days to 2-6 hours, launching services initially in urban hubs such as Seattle, New York, and Austin, with plans to build a new pharmacy operation every 18 days into major urban areas over the course of 2025.

I’m also pumped personally to hear the state of Texas approved drone delivery, which should only serve to increase medication access. But I’d love to eventually see these capabilities extend to rural areas.

In tandem with its logistical growth, Amazon continues to expand its pharmacy business through strategic partnerships, including a notable agreement with Eli Lilly as a dispensing partner and Blue Cross of California. Additionally, Amazon’s latest feature enhancements, like caregiver functionalities and Medicare-compatible payment options, directly respond to growing consumer demands for convenience, affordability, and transparency. When asking John how Amazon’s team prioritizes platform features, he noted they develop a composite score, involving the following questions and more:

What’s the total potential impact of this feature?

How can we improve medication adherence, access, and affordability? What are the edge cases?

How much time is the consumer saving?

Amazon’s broader ambition remains clear: to fundamentally transform the consumer healthcare experience. With significant logistical strengths, Amazon Pharmacy seeks to remove administrative burdens – automating data entry, streamlining billing processes, and reducing pharmacy deserts.

“We want the pharmacy to be as simple as shopping on Amazon is…make what should be simple…simple.”

In essence, Amazon Pharmacy’s expansion and innovative approach underline healthcare’s shift towards consumerism, and despite ongoing friction with major PBMs, the trajectory suggests continued disruption as Amazon leverages its considerable technological and logistical resources to reshape the patient pharmacy experience.

And it looks like incumbents are taking notice as consumers demand more from their healthcare services.

“[Customers] really want to trust and engage with companies that have earned the right to be in healthcare,” [now-former CEO Karen Lynch] said. “I think about Amazon as sort of a transactional company today.”

“We welcome competition.” – now-CEO David Joyner

This isn’t intended to be a CVS slam piece or an Amazon puff piece. It’s intended to be a …”who is making the consumer experience in healthcare better?” piece. And so far, it seems as if Amazon is doing a hell of a better job, but CVS has the immense incumbency and assets to deliver incredible impact.

Who do you trust more to ship for consumers in healthcare – Amazon, CVS, or neither?

This means that, if plans hold, we may soon be able to fly cross-country at Mach speeds.

1973 Overland Flight Ban

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) banned commercial supersonic flights over land in 1973 due to the disruptive sonic booms they created. The last time humans regularly flew supersonically was with the Concorde, which cleverly got around this restriction by flying at those speeds only over the ocean.

Ultimately, Concorde was retired in 2003 because of high operating costs, noise concerns, and limited routes. But now, this flight option is back on the table—and it makes sense given the leaps in technology and modern air travel demands.

New Executive Order on Flight Ban

According to the new orders, the FAA must scrap the 1973 rule prohibiting flights faster than Mach 1 over land, as long as the aircraft keeps noise below the sonic boom threshold.

Advances in engineering now allow for “boomless” supersonic flight—planes that fly fast but stay quiet. Thanks to these new orders, industry players like Boom Supersonic, which is developing the XB-1 demonstrator, expect rapid progress.

Supersonic Technology

Developers are designing planes with special shapes and technologies that minimize or redirect shockwaves so that the sonic boom either doesn’t happen at all or isn’t heard on the ground. The XB-1 prototype hit Mach 1.1 last January without a sonic boom reaching the ground, showing that quieter supersonic travel is achievable.

Removing speed restrictions will let companies like Boom Supersonic quickly move forward with development of commercial supersonic jets—like its upcoming Overture airliner, which is set to fly at Mach 1.7 and drastically cut travel times.

Drones and eVTOLs

While not supersonic, the orders also create a task force to better secure U.S. airspace from unsafe drone activity, particularly around big events like the Olympics or the World Cup.

Plans include enabling drone flights beyond visual line-of-sight and supporting electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), developed by companies such as Joby and Archer, aimed at future urban air mobility.

Implications

Supersonic jets could serve diplomatic or military purposes, and help make the U.S. a world leader in the sector. Improved drone regulations can also reduce reliance on foreign drone tech—especially from China—and strengthen national security.

Of course, challenges remain, including costs, fuel efficiency, and making sure that the noise standards are met, but these advances are a big step in the right direction for speedy air travel.

Both of those incidents involved older Boeing 737-800 aircrafts — and occurred while Air India was still under governmental control.
Over recent years, Air India redesigned its branding and ordered hundreds of new planes from both Boeing and Airbus.
""This is a difficult day for all of us at Air India,"" CEO Campbell Wilson said in recorded remarks.
A single passenger survived the crash, according to a senior Indian official and Air India.","The deadly crash of an Air India flight carrying more than 240 people on Thursday arrives after years of efforts to turn around the country's flag carrier — which had been plagued by tragedy and financial losses under prior state ownership.

In 2010, an Air India flight arriving from Dubai overshot the runway in the city of Mangalore and plunged over a cliff, killing 158 people out of the 166 on board. And in 2020, a flight for Air India Express, a subsidiary of Air India, skidded off a runway in Southern India during heavy rain and cracked in two — killing 18 people and injuring more than 120 others.

Both of those incidents involved older Boeing 737-800 aircrafts — and occurred while Air India was still under governmental control. Indian conglomerate Tata Sons took over Air India in 2022, returning the carrier to private ownership after it was run by the state for decades.

The 180 billion rupee (then worth $2.4 billion) deal was in some ways a homecoming for Air India, with roots that date back to the Tata family's founding of what was then-called Tata Airlines in 1932. It was also part of an wider effort to save the airline — which had become a money-losing, debt-saddled operation.

Jitendra Bhargava, former executive director of the airline and author of “The Descent of Air India,” said government ownership fostered an archaic work culture, outdated processes, and management by bureaucrats unfamiliar with the aviation industry.

“You are getting a recipe for disaster. And we went through it,"" Bhargava told The Associated Press. As a result, he said, the company hemorrhaged money — which had a “cascading effect” because it couldn’t invest in upgrades.

By the time of the Tata Sons takeover, Air India’s market share was around 12% and at risk of shrinking as competitors expanded. Bhargava and other aviation experts stress that shedding government control was necessary for Air India to compete with other private rivals — and the carrier has since worked to reinvent itself by modernizing both its operations and fleet.

Over recent years, Air India redesigned its branding and ordered hundreds of new planes from both Boeing and Airbus. Analysts don't expect Thursday's crash, which involved a 12-year-old Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to change such partnerships.

""Admittedly, Air India and the Tata organization have been very proud about the fact that they’ve made a major commitment to Boeing,"" said Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and leadership consultant.

While acknowledging that Boeing has been bruised in recent years, largely due to problems with its 737 Max, Mendiratta noted that there's still been a ""hunger"" from airlines around the world to add the company's new planes to their fleets after recent delivery delays. That includes demand for the 787 Dreamliner — which, she said, is ""one of the most important aircraft when it comes to sustainable aviation, emissions reduction, managing the costs of aviation.""

Boeing has been plagued by its own safety issues, including past deadly crashes. This, however, was the first crash of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, according to the Aviation Safety Network database. And the cause of Thursday's crash is still unclear.

An international investigation is underway, and Boeing has said it's “working to gather more information.” Air India said it's also working to get answers around what caused the crash — while promising to support those impacted by the tragedy.

""This is a difficult day for all of us at Air India,"" CEO Campbell Wilson said in recorded remarks. ""Our efforts now are focused entirely on the needs of our passengers, crew members, their families and loved ones.""

Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, added in a statement that ""no words can adequately express the grief we feel at this moment."" He said that the company would provide 10 million rupees (nearly $116,795) to the families of each person ""who has lost their life in this tragedy"" — and also cover medical expenses of anyone who was injured.

The Boeing 787 crashed into a medical college after takeoff in India's northwestern city of Ahmedabad. A single passenger survived the crash, according to a senior Indian official and Air India. But the airline said there were no other survivors — putting the latest death toll at 241.

Beyond the fatal accidents in 2010 and 2020, an Air India Boeing 747 flight also crashed into the Arabian Sea in 1978, killing all 213 aboard.

The carrier was under government control from 1953 through 2022.

Other fatal accidents involving India’s state-owned airlines include the more than 50 people who died in a crash in the eastern city of Patna in 2000. In 1993, a flight crashed in the western city Aurangabad, killing 55. In 1988, over 130 died when a plane crashed while landing in Ahmedabad and in 1991, a crash near northeastern city Imphal killed 69 people aboard.

Retailers: ‘We’re committed to good-faith bargaining’ Spokespeople for both Kroger and Albertsons said they remain committed to good faith bargaining in their contract negotiations.","Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers union in Southern California and the Pacific Northwest voted this week to authorize a strike against the local chains owned by Kroger and Albertsons in their markets.

They were among the 60,000 workers voting simultaneously to authorize strikes across multiple markets, making the votes the largest coordinated strike authorization in UFCW history, according to Labor Notes.

The retailers have been negotiating new contracts for several months with union locals representing tens of thousands of workers, who are seeking staffing increases and wage and benefit improvements. Workers are also alleging unfair labor practices during the negotiations, including surveillance, intimidation, and retaliation against union members.

Meanwhile, Safeway/Albertsons workers in Colorado who belong to UFCW Local 7 authorized an unfair labor practices strike last week, and on Wednesday the union issued a 72-hour strike notice and canceled the current contract extension, effective at 11:59 p.m. on Saturday. Workers at Kroger-owned King Soopers and City Market stores in Colorado could also go on strike, according to UFCW Local 7. Those workers previously staged a two-week strike in February, also alleging unfair labor practices.

Kroger workers in Indiana also rejected the company’s most recent contract offer last week but have not yet authorized a strike.

Widespread UFCW, Teamsters contract talks ongoing

More than 150,000 UFCW and Teamsters grocery store workers are currently negotiating for new collective bargaining agreements across the country. Strikes have received widespread worker support, including 99% in metro Denver, according to UFW Local 7.

“At the bargaining table, [Albertsons] is holding hands with King Soopers and City Market to propose major cuts to workers’ healthcare benefits, and to threaten the financial security of our pension beneficiaries on fixed incomes, while continuing to reject meaningful efforts to address chronic understaffing in stores,” said Kim Cordova , president of UFCW Local 7.

In Southern California, more than 90% of workers who are members of UFCW Local 135 in San Diego voted to authorize a strike, the union said. Bargaining is scheduled to continue there later this month.

Retailers: ‘We’re committed to good-faith bargaining’

Spokespeople for both Kroger and Albertsons said they remain committed to good faith bargaining in their contract negotiations.

“We remain actively engaged in bargaining with the union because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption,” a Kroger spokesperson told Supermarket News. “Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading healthcare and a pension.

The organizations distilled their calls for FARM Rio to either drop the multinational coffee giant or condition their partnership with Starbucks on the basis of major reforms to the company’s labor practices, in a letter to FARM Rio CEO Fabio Barreto dated June 4.

FARM Rio, which holds a certified “B” Corporation designation for certain ethical standards, carries a global reputation of being committed to bold environmental goals, advocates say. The Brazilian fashion brand inked a partnership with Starbucks to bring its unique take on prints and designs to Starbucks’ merchandise back in May.

“Starbucks faces serious allegations about child labor and other severe human rights violations in its coffee supply chains in China, Mexico, Guatemala, and numerous other countries,” advocates wrote in the letter. “Furthermore, Starbucks has refused to sign a fair contract with its unionized workers in the United States where thousands of baristas face retaliation for demanding basic rights such as fair wages, breaks and workplace safety.”

FARM Rio did not provide a response via its online contact form, and Prism could not locate other contact information for the company’s media representatives. A representative from Good Culture Inc., a public relations agency working for FARM Rio in the United Kingdom, said it does not handle the company’s U.S. partnerships, including with Starbucks.

Starbucks spokesperson Jay Go Guasch said in an email statement to Prism that the company believes advocates’ allegations are “without merit.”

“We plan to vigorously defend the Starbucks brand,” Go Guasch said.

In their letter, advocates highlighted a recent lawsuit filed by representatives of eight Brazilian workers who accused Brazilian farms of trafficking them and forcing them to harvest coffee sold to Starbucks through Cooxupé, a large-scale international cooperative considered by Starbucks as a Tier 1 supplier.

The company’s Tier 1 suppliers are entities that directly provide the coffee, tea, and cocoa used in Starbucks’ products.

The conditions alleged in the legal complaint depict an environment akin to slavery and reflect rampant use of child labor.

In the filing, workers and their representatives allege that hellish worker conditions in Starbucks’ supply chain extend beyond Brazil and are pervasive in the coffee operations in China, Colombia, Mexico, Indonesia, Uganda, and Guatemala that supply Starbucks.

Go Guasch told Prism that Starbucks does not purchase coffee from all farms within Cooxupé’s cooperative, which includes more than 19,000 coffee farm members.

The company instead vets suppliers using its Coffee and Farmer Equity (CAFE) Practices verification program, Go Guasch said. The program was developed with the oversight of third-party experts in 2004 and, according to Starbucks, has been continuously independently audited and iterated upon through the years. Go Guasch also called the standards the most stringent in the industry, a point some advocates have disagreed with.

“Starbucks is committed to ethical sourcing of coffee, including helping to protect the rights of people who work on the farms where we purchase coffee from,” Go Guasch added.

Etelle Higonnet, the founder of Coffee Watch, an organization aiming to reform working conditions in the coffee industry, and a signatory to the letter, told Prism that Starbucks should reform its CAFE program or adopt a more stringent and comprehensive set of standards.

“It is so far beneath the best in class,” Higgonet, who said he has researched best practices in the coffee industry, said of the CAFE program. “They do not pay a living income reference price for farmers, they do not guarantee a living wage for the farmworkers. They are not organic. They’re not even really close to organic.”

The CAFE program, Higonnet added, does not require Starbucks’ transparency with buyers. Products are not traceable back to their farm of origin, Higonnet, a veteran human rights advocate and attorney, said.

The Smithsonian Bird Friendly coffee certification standards, Higonnet said, should be the coffee company’s north star. According to the Smithsonian website, the organization’s standards ensure that every farm yields an organic, deforestation-free crop. Farms under these standards also prioritize forestry conservation using the best environmental practices.

“It is the only certification that guarantees every coffee and cocoa bean sold is grown in a way that protects wildlife habitat,” the website reads.

Higonnet said that Starbucks should at least make its supply chain traceable, instead of asking customers to take the company at its word.

“This is a widespread, systematic, documented pattern and practices of extreme human rights violations in their supply chain. You should not be sourcing from [those farms],” Higonnet said. “You’re just going to tell us that it’s OK, and we’re supposed to trust you? That is crazy.”

Higonnet said that Starbucks should be held accountable for alleged human rights violations in its supply chain.

“They should be shamed, and they should have to deal with their problems in a more meaningful way,” said Higonnet.

Coffee Watch filed a 307 petition in April with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, asking the agency to ban imports of Brazilian coffee linked to forced labor in the supply chains of companies like Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts, McDonald’s, and Nestle.

The letter from advocates also listed the litany of labor law violations American workers have filed against Starbucks since announcing their intentions to unionize the company’s stores in 2021.

The U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions found that as of August 2022, Starbucks faced the most unfair labor cases before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) of any private employer over the preceding year.

The number of cases was “30% more than its closest peer UPS, which has nearly twice the number of employees as Starbucks,” according to the U.S. Senate’s report. Media reports estimate that as of 2024, workers and unions have filed 700 unfair labor practice cases with the NLRB.

In the letter, advocates called for FARM Rio to drop the collaboration with Starbucks or make it conditional on the following demands:

Uphold the right of all workers to freely unionize.

Eradicate slavery and child labor from its supply chains.

Ensure living wages for farmworkers and living income prices for smallholder farmers.

Commit to full labor rights across its global operations.

Engage in transparent dialogue with labor, environmental, and human rights organizations.

Higonnet said Starbucks should not be allowed to “launder” its image and track record of alleged labor violations through the reputation of another, more respected brand.

“It’s an effort to just push the bad news down,” Higonnet said. “But we can’t let that happen, because all the ethical CEOs should be calling Starbucks to say, ‘Hey … get with the program, respect human rights.’”

By Amos Harris

Monrovia, Liberia – June 12, 2025 – Despite continuous proclamations of a multi-billion-dollar investment in Liberia, ArcelorMittal Liberia faces mounting criticism as its contractors reportedly endure squalid living conditions in host communities. These harsh realities starkly contrast with the company’s public relations narrative of progress and significant contributions to the nation’s development.

During a press briefing held today at the Ministry of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism (MICAT), ArcelorMittal’s top executives highlighted their purported $3.5 billion investment in Liberia since 2006, touting it as “one of the largest ArcelorMittal has ever made on the continent.” However, Chief Operating Officer Anthony P. Kocken and his colleagues offered no substantive explanation for the inhumane and degrading conditions faced by Liberian contractors. Many of these essential workers are reportedly housed in makeshift, dilapidated structures lacking basic amenities such as running water, electricity, and proper sanitation.

This disconnect between corporate rhetoric and on-the-ground reality has sparked outrage among local communities and rights advocates. While ArcelorMittal pledges to boost employment, improve infrastructure, and invest in health and education, residents of Nimba, Bong, and Grand Bassa Counties – where the company operates – continue to question the tangible impact of these claims. Many argue that the company’s activities have primarily served to extract Liberia’s resources rather than genuinely foster its development.

General Manager of Mines, Jallah Selena, asserted the company’s “good standing” with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other regulatory bodies. Yet, local environmental groups have repeatedly condemned ArcelorMittal’s mining operations for alleged damage to local ecosystems and pollution of nearby water sources. Selena’s claim that the company has no financial liabilities to students or the Liberian government also drew skepticism, with persistent allegations of mismanagement and uneven distribution of the Social Development Fund intended for impacted counties.

Rebecca Kwabo, Head of Human Resources, reiterated the company’s narrative of increasing local employment. However, this assertion rings hollow for numerous contractors who reportedly work under precarious and exploitative terms, characterized by little to no job security and limited opportunities for advancement.

Perhaps the most glaring issue remains the company’s apparent refusal to address the unacceptable living conditions of its workers. While executives boast of multi-million-dollar contributions and partnerships, the individuals generating the company’s wealth are forced to reside in what can only be described as “misfit structures” – a stark embarrassment for a company profiting immensely from Liberia’s rich mineral resources.

Marcus Wleh, Head of Sustainability and External Relations, claimed ongoing collaboration with community stakeholders to ensure the fair distribution of development funds. However, numerous community leaders have reported little evidence of such collaboration, demanding greater transparency and accountability.

Despite COO Kocken’s pledge to increase the company’s annual contribution to the national budget from $30 million to $100 million, critics argue that monetary promises on paper are meaningless unless they translate into tangible improvements for the Liberian people on the ground. As ArcelorMittal Liberia continues to cultivate its public image and celebrate its partnership with the Boakai administration, the voices of the contractors – those living in squalor while building the company’s fortune – remain largely unheard and unaddressed.

A growing chicken trend has emerged among fast-food chains, with major players like Chick-fil-A, Raising Cane's, McDonald's (MCD) , and Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King and Popeyes focusing on launching new chicken-based products to dominate the sector.

As a fast-food leader, Taco Bell decided to enter the chicken game. However, it isn't just hopping on a trend; it's creating a version with its own unmistakable flavor.

Taco Bell enters the chicken trend by launching Crispy Chicken Nuggets

Crispy Chicken Nuggets first debuted on Taco Bell's menu in December of last year, and while available, they made up nearly one in six orders. This menu item was so successful that almost 5 million customers tried it, which caused it to sell out nationwide in under a week.

The product's success might be due to its uniqueness, since Taco Bell tested over 50 recipes and flavor combinations to make the nuggets stand out from the rest.

Taco Bell's Crispy Chicken Nuggets are made with all-white meat chicken marinated in jalapeño buttermilk and coated in a crunchy tortilla-chip and breadcrumb blend.

Because of how much fans love the Crispy Chicken Nuggets, Taco Bell relaunched them for a limited time in April. The demand was so overwhelming that it decided to expand the product even further.

Yum! Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell is launching the new Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos, featuring the fan-favorite Crispy Chicken Nuggets in strip form.

The Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos are filled with Crispy Chicken Strips, purple cabbage, crisp lettuce, pico de gallo, and shredded cheddar cheese, all folded or wrapped inside a warm tortilla.

Everyone knows no Taco Bell meal is complete without a good dipping sauce, so in addition to the new items, the fast-food chain is also introducing two new sauces: Spicy Ranchero and Avocado Ranch.

“Crispy chicken is having a moment, but our fans made it a movement,” said Taco Bell’s Chief Marketing Officer Taylor Montgomery in a press release. “So, we decided to bring our sell-out Nuggets recipe to the formats that defined our brand because true innovation means elevating the icons, not replacing them.

To run a four-minute mile, Kipyegon will need to shave at least 7.64 seconds off her own world record (set in 2023).
“We know that shoe can go at least four minutes and seven seconds,” said Carrie Dimoff, who oversees innovations in footwear for Nike.
Kipyegon’s shoes don’t need to last an entire season, so long as they hold up three minutes and 59 seconds.
Like with the Vaporfly, Kirby, Gibson and Dimoff all believe that their findings will inform future design decisions not just by Nike but the industry at large.","As a problem to be solved, the four-minute mile is not a matter of will but science.

Make no mistake: when Roger Bannister became the first human in history to run 1609 meters in three minutes and 59 seconds, he possessed no shortage of talent nor grit.

But Bannister, a 25-year-old medical student at the time, famously focused on physiology, tailoring his training and performance around efficiency — decades before the Vaporfly made it the trendiest buzzword in running.

On June 26, some 70 years later, Faith Kipyegon will attempt to do the same when she races to become the first woman in history to break the four-minute barrier.

And, just like Bannister, she’s relying on science to take her there.

Only this time, Kipyegon can count on the backing of the world’s largest sportswear company, which will outfit the Kenyan in state-of-the-art footwear and apparel developed behind closed doors at its innovation lab in Beaverton, Oregon.

Seven seconds into the unknown

This isn’t the first time Nike has supported one of its athletes in pursuit of athletic history.

The company famously developed its Vaporfly super shoe for a high-profile time trial in 2017 called Breaking2, when three runners attempted to run a marathon in under two hours.

One of them, of course, was Eliud Kipchoge, who eventually accomplished the feat in a follow-up called the INEOS 1:59 Challenge, wearing Nike’s sequel to the Vaporfly.

To run a four-minute mile, Kipyegon will need to shave at least 7.64 seconds off her own world record (set in 2023). And while the marathon and mile are two different beasts, the difficulty of the task isn’t far from the one that faced Kipchoge in 2017, even if the scales seem far apart on paper.

“Maybe not everybody in the general public would understand just seven seconds or eight seconds, but it is huge when put on the edge of a four-minute effort,” Brett Kirby told Gear Patrol in an exclusive interview.

Kirby is the Senior Principal of Performance Exploration Research in the Nike Sport Research Lab and one of the key players in the team supporting Kipyegon in her attempt, which Nike is calling Breaking4. (He also worked on Breaking2 and featured prominently in the National Geographic documentary detailing the project.)

“If you look at what you’d need to get to four minutes, you fall roughly in the ballpark of around three percent,” Kirby added. If you remove Kipyegon from the equation, it climbs almost double; Sifan Hassan was the previous record holder, with a personal best of four minutes and 12.33 seconds.

According to Kirby, the thing that makes the mile so difficult to crack is its reliance on “multiple energy systems,” he said, noting the importance of both aerobic efficiency and and pure power.

“That’s what makes it super complicated and complex because it’s riding this bubble of saying, ‘I have to be good not only at speed but also endurance, and then I have this element of blending those two,'” Kirby added.

Nike’s most aerodynamic apparel solution, ever

To support Kipyegon, Kirby and the greater Nike innovation team will bring the full might of their sports science backgrounds, starting with a bespoke apparel solution that includes a one-piece suit, headband, 3D printed bra and arm sleeves.

The suit’s halo feature are small synthetic half-circles of varying heights, strategically placed around Kipyegon’s shoulders and hips. Nike calls them Aeronodes and the goal is to create “controlled turbulence,” said Lisa Gibson, who helped to oversee their development, in an interview.

“They’re placed specifically where we want the air to flow more smoothly and stay close to the body,” Gibson added. “What that does is it creates smaller eddies behind the body, which reduces drag.”

Eddies are effectively small, chaotic pockets of air that develop in the wake of a moving object, and they “can almost feel like you’re being pulled back,” Gibson said. “So the Aeronodes result in smaller eddies, which reduces drag and results in a smoother flow downstream.”

Other decisions were made to facilitate marginal gains, such as placing the seams of the suit on the back, as opposed to the sides. The effect wasn’t just speed but comfort, which ultimately became Nike’s North Star during the myriad prototyping phases.

“We wanted to make sure that this is incredibly comfortable for Faith because we didn’t want any distractions to take away from what she’s trying to do,” Gibson said. “The team had to go through a lot of iterations to make sure it was not only optimized for aerodynamics but also optimized for faith and her comfort.”

Finding Faith’s feet

The emphasis on comfort becomes especially critical on Faith’s feet, as her shoes will be the things making contact with the track at the Stade Charléty in Paris — the setting of her Breaking4 attempt.

And while they boast some state-of-the-art upgrades, they are heavily based off of Nike’s Victory middle-distance super spikes, which Kipyegon used to set the current world record in 2023.

“We know that shoe can go at least four minutes and seven seconds,” said Carrie Dimoff, who oversees innovations in footwear for Nike. “But the team obviously wanted to consider could we improve upon it.”

That meant re-evaluating every aspect and material of the shoe, looking for whatever gains were there to be found.

“We had a lot of ideas that hadn’t yet made it into commercial product,” Dimoff said, starting with one of Nike’s chief technological innovations: the Zoom Air unit.

During her attempt, Kipyegon will wear shoes that include a Air Zoom unit that’s 3mm taller than the one found in the existing Victory 2 model.

“The height of the Zoom Air unit is related to how much energy it can store in return. As Faith runs down the track, she loads that airbag with her own energy. These airbags are over ninety percent efficient, so with every step, she’s getting more of that back.”

It’s not the only attribute Dimoff and the crew rethought. They also redesigned the upper, swapping out Nike’s existing Atomknit for one made from even lighter-weight yarns, and increased the number of spikes from four to six.

Even the carbon outsole plate is new.

“The existing plate was designed for commercialization. It was designed to be worn for multiple races throughout the length of a season by athletes of all levels,” Dimoff said.

Kipyegon’s shoes don’t need to last an entire season, so long as they hold up three minutes and 59 seconds.

But that isn’t to say the innovations bred by Breaking4 won’t tickle into consumer products. Like with the Vaporfly, Kirby, Gibson and Dimoff all believe that their findings will inform future design decisions not just by Nike but the industry at large.",https://www.gearpatrol.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/nike-faith-kipyegon-gear-patrol-lead-jpg.webp,N,,2025-06-12 22:33:29.071519

Daily Hive has reached out to Costco to inquire if this early access benefit will also be available to Executive Members in Canada.","If you’re a Costco Canada shopper who’s been on the fence about signing up for a membership, a new perk might help you decide.

On June 11, Costco announced in a press release that Executive Members will receive a $10 monthly credit if they place their order online.

So, how does it work?

If you’re a Costco Canada Executive Member, you’ll receive a $10 credit each month when you place an online order on Sameday.costco.ca or through Instacart. The credit is then automatically applied when you place an order worth $150 or more.

“Costco Executive Members expect exceptional value — and now, they can get even more delivered to their door,” said Daniel Danker, chief product officer at Instacart. “Our new monthly credit makes it easier than ever for members across North America to get Costco’s warehouse items with the convenience of fast and reliable delivery through Instacart.”

The new benefit kicks in on June 30.

If you’re thinking of signing up for an Executive Membership, Costco Canada is currently offering a pretty sweet deal.

Sign up for the membership for $130 per year (plus applicable taxes) and get $80 off a $200 purchase on Costco.ca using the promo code COSTCO80. But just a note — this promo isn’t valid on purchases made on Sameday.costco.ca or Instacart.

The $10 credit isn’t the only perk that Costco shoppers in the U.S. will enjoy.

On June 9, Business Insider reported that, according to an email sent to employees, Costco announced that Executive Members will be able to shop in U.S. locations one hour earlier than Gold Star Members. The additional perk also starts on June 30.

""You go to China, all the consumer internet apps, it's not Google or YouTube or Facebook or Instagram, it's the Chinese versions of those.
The company has been the IOC's cloud technology provider for the past three Olympic cycles, including the 2024 Paris Olympics.
For the Paris Olympics alone, that meant managing around 11,000 hours of video.
""Last Olympics was the first time cloud technology had overtaken satellite broadcasting technology, and that technology is all supported by Alibaba,"" Tsai said.","Joe Tsai, co-founder and chairman of Alibaba Group, believes China's edge in artificial intelligence is rooted not only in technical capability but also in its fast-moving consumer internet sector and the intensity of its engineering culture.

Speaking at VivaTech 2025 in Paris on Wednesday during a wide-ranging conversation with Maurice Levy, emeritus chairman of Publicis Groupe, Tsai pointed to the local internet environment as a key driver.

""When you look at the Chinese market, starting with some of the early internet companies, China has always been very good at adopting and iterating new technology, especially in the consumer internet space,"" he said.

He noted that China's internet ecosystem, built around platforms like Taobao, WeChat, and Douyin, plays a central role in driving innovation. ""You go to China, all the consumer internet apps, it's not Google or YouTube or Facebook or Instagram, it's the Chinese versions of those. And in fact, they're actually better. They provide a better user experience,"" Tsai said.

According to Tsai, this ""application-rich ecosystem"" pushes companies to adapt quickly, making it an ideal environment for AI deployment. He also spoke about the internal culture at Chinese tech firms, especially among engineers, who often work with a sense of urgency and national competitiveness.

Earlier this year, Alibaba launched its Qwen series of large language models in response to the release of DeepSeek, a rival model. The timing, just before Chinese New Year, didn't stop the company's engineering teams. ""Our engineering leads decided, they said, 'Cancel your Chinese New Year holiday. Everybody. Stay in the company. Sleep in the office. We're going to accelerate our development,'"" Tsai said. ""So within a few weeks, we launched our version.""

Tsai added that Alibaba also open-sourced smaller-parameter versions of its models to contribute to the broader development community.

The conversation shifted to Alibaba's international AI applications, particularly its work with the International Olympic Committee, or IOC. The company has been the IOC's cloud technology provider for the past three Olympic cycles, including the 2024 Paris Olympics.

""One of the areas that we focus on is broadcasting,"" Tsai said, noting that the Olympics generate tens of thousands of hours of footage. ""So what the IOC have done is they centralize the filming of the Games, and they take all that footage, put it onto the cloud."" For the Paris Olympics alone, that meant managing around 11,000 hours of video.

""Last Olympics was the first time cloud technology had overtaken satellite broadcasting technology, and that technology is all supported by Alibaba,"" Tsai said.

Alibaba's AI also played a role in enhancing the viewer experience. ""We actually use our AI to make the game presentation more exciting,"" he said.

The system used AI to generate multi-angle views of action scenes with far fewer cameras than traditional methods. ""It's very compute-intensive, but this is very, very light, very efficient,"" Tsai said.",http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202506/13/684b20a7a310a04a967a27bc.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 22:36:03.325047

(Louisiana First) — Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday that her office will investigate CVS after the company reportedly sent text messages to state employees urging them to oppose a bill about pharmacy technician access to prescription records.

Murrill said CVS texted many state employees and their families on Wednesday. The message asked them to fight against a bill that impacts the company’s pharmacy benefits manager.

“My office will be investigating whether CVS Pharmacy improperly appropriated to its own use the personal information of OGB (Office of Group Benefits) members and will take legal action if it did,” she said.

HB358 allows licensed pharmacy technicians in this state to access their pharmacy’s software system or dispensing information system. They can do this to complete job tasks remotely.

The bill says that pharmacies can set up rules to keep confidential records safe. It also states that pharmacy technicians cannot copy, download, or remove any pharmacy software.

“This is not an appropriate use of personal information obtained through a state contract,” Murrill said.

In a new statement, Murill said she is sending a cease-and-desist letter and civil investigative demands.

With this message, Canadian department store chain Hudson’s Bay is closing its doors for good. The company has filed for bankruptcy and is liquidating its assets, resulting in the loss of more than 9,000 jobs. It marks the end of an era for a historic retail institution: Hudson’s Bay opened North America’s first department store and was one of the continent’s oldest continuously operating companies. Here is a look back at the rise and fall of this retail icon.

Hudson’s Bay’s origins trace back to 1670, when two French fur traders— known as coureurs des bois— founded the company with the backing of England’s King Charles II. Pierre- Radisson and Médard Chouart des Groseilliers established several trading posts to collect and ship animal pelts, mainly beaver. According to Quebec newspaper Le Devoir, these operations expanded with little ""consideration for Indigenous populations.""

The company’s influence, driven by its exploitation of local land and maritime resources, soon extended from Canada’s far north to as far south as San Francisco, playing a key role in shaping the economy of the so-called ""New World.""

As the Industrial Revolution and the decline of the fur trade reshaped the market, Hudson’s Bay’s trading posts gradually evolved into retail stores. From the 1880s onward, the company built a nationwide department store network. Over the decades, it acquired several Canadian chains, including Simpsons, Woodward’s and Zellers, while its signature multi-colored stripes became an enduring emblem.

The company briefly ventured into Europe, acquiring Germany’s Galeria Kaufhof in 2015 and taking over the Netherlands’ V&D retail network in 2017. However, facing financial losses, Hudson’s Bay divested its European operations by 2019.

Ninety-six stores affected

In Canada, Hudson’s Bay’s decline began over the past decade. The company operated 80 Hudson’s Bay stores positioned in the upscale segment, along with three Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks OFF 5TH outlets. Business further deteriorated after the pandemic, with the company citing the fast-changing retail landscape and elevated U.S. tariffs as key challenges.

Owned since 2008 by U.S.-based NRDC Equity Partners, the company sought creditor protection in April 2025 under Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), citing difficulties meeting its financial obligations. Headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, the company failed to secure funding for a potential restructuring and ultimately moved toward full liquidation.

In recent weeks, stores sold off remaining inventory ahead of a June 1 closing date. The closures led to 8,300 job losses across retail locations, with nearly 1,000 additional layoffs expected in offices and logistics centers by mid-June. Local media reported widespread emotion among longtime employees— some with three decades of service— and among customers who associate Hudson’s Bay with family memories.

However, the brand name, emblems and logos will live on. In mid-May, Canadian retail group Canadian Tire acquired the rights for 30 million Canadian dollars (19 million euros).

A “strategic and patriotic” choice

""It is difficult to witness the final days of another iconic Canadian retailer. While the circumstances are unfortunate, we are proud to step in for customers. This decision is both strategic and patriotic,"" said Canadian Tire president Greg Hicks. The company plans to integrate Hudson’s Bay’s signature stripes into its private label products and has reportedly submitted bids for several store leases.","https://media.fashionnetwork.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=cover,width=600,height=600,format=auto/m/7639/09c6/f00e/36e3/e71a/993d/2c0a/f76a/eff8/a291/a291.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 22:20:08.457569

The defendants in the Ohio case are Halo MD, a HaloMD executive and four Ohio-based medical services firms.

The Georgia defendants engaged in a ""coordinated fraudulent scheme to steal tens of millions of dollars from Anthem, employer sponsors, and other Blue Cross Blue Shield companies,"" according to a complaint that Georgia Blue filed in May in the U.S. District Court for the District of Georgia.

The defendants launched ""massive volumes of IDR disputes"" against Georgia Blue, and they demanded ""outrageous payment offers that far exceed what the provider defendants could have received from patients or health plans in a competitive market,"" Georgia Blue said.

In Ohio, ""Anthem and its employer plan sponsor customers have paid excessive amounts for medical services and incurred unnecessary administrative and arbitration fees,"" Anthem of Ohio said in its complaint. ""The financial harm caused by defendants' abusive practices is ongoing and threatens the affordability and sustainability of health benefits for Anthem's members.""

Georgia Blue and Anthem of Ohio are accusing the defendants named in their complaints of committing fraud, deception, violations of the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and violations of Employee Retirement Income Security Act provisions.

HaloMD rejected the Elevance subsidiaries' allegations.

""The Blue Cross Hydra is continuing its lawfare with another suit attacking the No Surprises Act and its patient protections and smearing the one company defending fair reimbursement for physicians,"" HaloMD said in its response. ""We'll be contesting these suits to the full extent of the law and continue fighting for doctors to be paid for the care they deliver.""

The No Surprises Act: The new Elevance subsidiary suits are related to the No Surprises Act, a federal law that was part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021.

Congress enacted the law in an effort to address longstanding concerns that many patients with health coverage who thought they were following the rules of their plans ended up facing large, unexpected out-of-pocket expenses.

The No Surprises Act includes provisions aimed at eliminating two types of surprise medical bills: bills for out-of-network emergency care and care patients who go to in-network hospitals get from out-of-network physicians.

Plans and providers are supposed to have the patients pay their share of the costs at in-network rates, then work with each other or use IDR services to resolve any remaining disagreements over the amounts the plans should pay.

The providers have accused health plans and plan administrators of working with claim administrators to hold down reimbursement rates for out-of-network care in ways that violate federal antitrust laws.

The defendants in those cases have argued that they have been using public information to fend off outrageously high bills for out-of-network care.

The new suits: Georgia Blue said 70% of the Georgia IDR dispute payment determinations involving the defendants in its case were for claims that were clearly ineligible for the No Surprises Act IDR process.

Georgia Blue reported that the defendants started 342 disputes on May 3, 2024, including 279 that were clearly not eligible for the IDR process.

But Georgia Blue lost 192 of the disputes, in part because of the defendants' use of false eligibility attestations, and it was ordered to make $390,704.69 in extra reimbursement payments and pay $118,754 in IDR process fees, the company said.

In Ohio, about 50% of the Ohio IDR dispute payment determinations were for claims that were ineligible for the IDR process, and those disputes led to $25 million in improper IDR awards, according to Anthem of Ohio.

Anthem of Ohio said the defendants in its case started a wave of 312 IDR disputes against it on Dec. 26, 2024, with 174 being ineligible for the IDR process.",https://k2-prod-alm.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/brightspot/3a/74/f8d8aa314b569679f86978987822/2024-elevance-istock-620x372.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 10:25:29.421558

If you’ve been on the internet in recent months, you’ve probably seen an increase in interest in protein-heavy food and drinks.

Now, Starbucks is testing a new way to instantly add a whopping 15 grams of protein to nearly any beverage.

The coffee giant is testing a protein cold foam at five locations in the US through its Starting Five program. It’s part of CEO Brian Niccol’s hopes to expand into the wellness category, the company announced during the Starbucks Leadership Experience in Las Vegas.

“This thing is going to be a rocket,” Niccol said on stage in Las Vegas. “It’s on trend. It’s delicious.”

Niccol explained to Axios that the new innovation is geared toward a number of consumer groups, such as 20-year-old males, 50-year-old females and people taking GLP-1s.

“I was watching people coming to our stores, they would get three shots of espresso over ice,” Niccol explained. “And in some cases, they pull their own protein powder out of their bag, or in other cases, they have a protein drink, like a Fair Life, and they’d pour that into their drink.”

“I’m like, well, wait a second, we can make this experience better for them,” he added.

There’s currently a huge push for protein with Gen Z, with different recipes and trends such as the “100 grams of protein daily” challenge going viral on TikTok.

And with the continuous rise of GLP-1 drugs, research has shown that a high-protein diet is vital to maintaining muscle with the appetite-suppressing injectable treatments.

“The good news is now I think we’re right on trend, and we can do it, I think, arguably better than anybody else,” Niccol said.

According to Fast Company, the protein cold foam will be identical to the cold foam Starbucks customers know and love — but it will be packed with somewhere between 15 and 18 grams of protein.

The world’s largest coffee chain reportedly initially imagined that the protein blend would simply mix into drinks, but it kept getting clumpy — something that protein powder consumers may know a thing or two about — and they wanted to solve that problem.

The development team found that blending the powder into foam got rid of the clumps, which led to the protein cold foam innovation.

Starbucks shared that their protein powder should be able to be added to any of its cold foam flavors, but the current testing version is a banana cold foam, FoodSided reported. They’re starting the testing with Starbucks’ Iced Caffe Latte.

While it’s being tested in just five locations at the moment, Niccol told Axios he thinks the nationwide release of the protein cold foam will be sooner rather than later.

“It’s not one of those things that’s years away. It’s months away,” he said.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/logo-american-coffee-company-starbucks-106259543.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-06-12 22:37:57.742355

Starbucks has confirmed to TODAY.com that it is testing a banana protein cold foam on an iced latte, joining the ever-expanding list of brands offering high-protein options. The brand revealed the innovation at the Starbucks Leadership Experience event in Las Vegas this week.

Starbucks is light on specifics about the new banana-flavored foam, but, according to Fast Company, it’s loaded with somewhere between 15 and 18 grams of protein and will also be available in other flavors like chocolate in the future.

The protein-packed cold foam is being tested in five Starbucks stores, but the brand declined to specify which locations or when it would begin appearing on menus.

This move is part of the brand’s back-to-Starbucks strategy, which involves reimagining and modernizing its food and beverages to build a buzzier menu.

Starbucks says it’s taking a “new, deliberate approach” to testing menu innovations through a program it calls Starting Five with select coffeehouses in the U.S. Confirmed tests include protein in coffee, freshly-baked croissants and a new item called the Strato Frappuccino, which offers a more layered drink experience.

Starbucks is following in the footsteps of other protein-maxxing companies who have been adding the macronutrient to ice cream, candy bars, lemonade, water and, most recently, Khloe Kardashian’s popcorn.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/Starbucks-Cold-Foams-te-250612-98ab96.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 22:38:03.090473

Company Announcement

Customers are being asked to remove the affected devices from use and replace with an alternate means of ventilation

June 11, 2025 — In May 2025, Medtronic issued a voluntary recall notification to global customers related to specific Newport™ HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators and certain related Newport™ service parts. The FDA recently designated this voluntary action by Medtronic as a Class I recall.

With this recall, Medtronic is advising discontinuation of clinical use of the affected devices. Investigation into customer complaints identified two separate capacitors on one of the ventilator’s controller Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA), that, in case of failure, may result in:

The ventilator shutting down during use, or

The shutdown alert alarm failing to sound effectively.

The following table identifies the item name, manufacture date and use by date:

No instances of both capacitors failing on the same PCBA board have occurred, nor are they anticipated to occur.

If a ventilator fails and does not provide adequate ventilation, the patient may not be able to breathe on their own, leading to low oxygen levels, high carbon dioxide levels, and potentially severe consequences like brain injury or death. There have been 63 medical device reports (MDRs) associated with this issue, including two serious injuries and one death. HT70 and HT70 Plus ventilators are intended for use by home users, as well as for infant and pediatric patients who may be at higher risks of injury or death due to unanticipated ventilator failures.

Customer recommendations

Customers should remove the affected devices from use and replace with an alternate means of ventilation. Medtronic is not correcting these issues on affected ventilators or service parts and will no longer service affected ventilators identified in this notification. Customers with questions should contact Medtronic Customer Service at 800-962-9888. Adverse events or product quality concerns with this product should be reported to the FDA and Medtronic:

Refer to the customer notification and the patient letter for additional information.

The Newport™ HT70 family of ventilators is intended to provide continuous or intermittent positive pressure mechanical ventilatory support for individuals who require mechanical ventilation through invasive or noninvasive interfaces. Specifically, the Newport™ HT70 family of ventilators is applicable for infant, pediatric, and adult patients greater than or equal to 5 kg (11 lbs) in hospital, sub-acute, emergency department, and home care environments as well as for transport and emergency response applications. The Newport™ HT70 operator’s manual can be found here.

Medtronic will continue working directly with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies around the world on this voluntary recall. In February 2024, Medtronic announced its decision to exit its ventilator product lines, including the Newport™ ventilators. The company continues to serve the needs of its customers and their patients worldwide, and honor existing ventilator contracts, as they wind down the business over the coming years.

Dominant market share

Despite a decline in overall market performance, the family-owned company has achieved notable growth, solidifying its significant market share of 43.3% as of the first quarter of 2025. This figure surpasses the combined market share of all its competitors, further cementing the company’s leadership in this space.

Jörg Pfirrmann, managing director of Rügenwalder Mühle, attributed the company’s success to its innovation-driven approach and strong brand leadership. “We are growing profitably and have gained new market shares through innovations and clear brand leadership – against the industry trend,” he stated.

Outperforming a downward market

While the plant-based sector as a whole experienced a six percent downturn in the first quarter of 2025, Rügenwalder Mühle expanded by almost four percent during the same period. In contrast, many private label brands and other competitors faced declines.

One of the key drivers of this growth is Rügenwalder Mühle’s focus on product innovation. The company has consistently launched new items, with six of its products ranking among the 13 most successful of 2024. Notably, its Vegan Hauchgenuss Classic – Chicken Style topped the list as the most successful product of the year.

“Nearly half of the most successful products in 2024 come from us. We occupy the top three spots. This shows that we are setting standards in the veggie market – not with a large quantity of products, but with quality, taste, and relevance for our consumers,” said Pfirrmann.

Despite fluctuating market conditions, the demand for plant-based alternatives continues to rise, reflecting broader societal shifts. Rügenwalder Mühle remains confident in the future growth of the sector. “We are convinced that a double-digit market share in Germany is realistic – especially since young, sustainability-minded consumers will become the family shoppers of tomorrow,” Pfirrmann remarked. He furthered that the key to maintaining long-term success is delivering products that meet both taste and sustainability expectations.

Leading plant-based innovation in Germany

The company’s leadership in innovation is also supported by external market research. According to NIQ, Rügenwalder Mühle is among the top three innovation drivers in the meat and dairy alternatives segment. Enrico Krien, Director of Customer Success DACH at Nielsen, noted, “Rügenwalder Mühle is one of the leading innovation drivers in the field of meat and dairy alternatives.”

Consumer perception aligns with these findings. Rügenwalder Mühle referenced a study conducted by Kantar, a market research institute, which revealed that Rügenwalder Mühle outperformed other brands across multiple categories, including perceived innovation, product uniqueness, and its reputation as a trendsetter.

Pfirrmann concluded, “Even in the eyes of consumers, we are the clear innovation leader. Our brand is perceived as a trendsetter, with a unique offering and strong emotional connection. This means we are not only in shopping baskets but also in the minds and hearts of people.”",https://assets.vegconom.de/media/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/12123137/Rugenwalder-Muhle-4.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:29:15.251079

The dispute led the chains to lose a combined $1.5 billion in sales, the Los Angeles Times reported.","Some 45,000 workers at Southern California's busiest grocery stores are ready to walk off the job, joining tens of thousands nationwide.

LOS ANGELES, CA — Some 45,000 workers at Southern California's busiest grocery stores are ready to walk off the job after the union representing Albertsons, Pavilions, Ralphs and Vons employees announced this week its members had authorized a strike.

""Our message is clear: we are fed up with these corporations’ union-busting tactics designed to intimidate us and prevent us from getting the fair contract that we’ve earned and deserve,"" reads a statement from the Bargaining Committee of Locals 324 and 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers. ""For four months, we've negotiated with Kroger and Albertsons, offering solutions to the staff shortage crisis that hurts store operations, working conditions, and customer service.

""The companies have dismissed our proposals and claimed that our concerns were 'anecdotal,' downplaying the real challenges we and our customers face daily.""

The unions cover workers at grocery stores owned by Kroger and Albertsons in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, San Diego, Ventura, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, a Local 770 representative told Patch.

The union said 90% of its membership voted to authorize the strike in an election that was scheduled amid stalled contract negotiations between the labor groups and the grocery giants, the Orange County register reported.

Members of Local 770 planned to gather in Los Angeles' Koreatown Thursday to make signs and hold picket captain meetings in advance of a possible strike. The union is part of a coalition of regional grocery store labor groups that make up Grocery Workers Rising.

Grocery Workers Rising is planning a week of ""practice strikes"" beginning Monday across LA County and will hold a rally in Long Beach on June 20.

It's unclear when customers could expect a strike to begin in Southern California; the authorization vote doesn't mean a work stoppage is guaranteed.

But it's a real possibility: The SoCal labor dispute is one of many unfolding concurrently across the country — tens of thousands of additional grocery store workers are ready to strike against Kroger and Albertsons after other recent authorization votes.

In Colorado, strikes could happen as soon as Sunday, according to reports from the state.

""We respect the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach an agreement that is fair to our employees, good for our customers and allows our company to remain competitive,"" Albertsons, which is also the parent company of Pavilions and Vons, said in a statement.

A Ralphs spokesperson said in a statement: ""We remain actively engaged in bargaining with the union because we believe the best outcomes are achieved at the table, not through disruption. Our current offer reflects that commitment, including market-leading wage increases for associates over the life of the agreement, and continued investment in industry-leading health care and a pension. These are benefits that many non-union competitors do not offer.

""We remain committed to good faith bargaining that rewards our hardworking associates and keeps groceries affordable for our customers.""

The same group of SoCal grocery workers went on strike or were locked out in 2003 as part of an action that lasted for over four months in what was the longest and largest supermarket strike in U.S. history. Consumers who crossed the picket lines found half-empty shelves as they did their Thanksgiving and Christmas shopping at Albertsons and Ralphs. The dispute led the chains to lose a combined $1.5 billion in sales, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Negotiations in SoCal are scheduled to resume on June 25, according to the union. The workers' contracts expired March 2.

The union said it is seeking ""living wages, affordable healthcare benefits, a reliable pension (and) more staffing and better working conditions for a better customer experience.""

A strike authorization vote does not necessarily mean there will be a strike.

Union members approved a three-year contract in 2022 after a threatened strike, including wage increases of $4.25 per hour for most workers while some classifications received higher pay raises.

""We expect to successfully mitigate this cost and return to our long-term target range of 5% to 7% next quarter.""","Dive Brief:

HP sped up plans to shift manufacturing of North America-bound PCs and printers outside of China to offset higher-than-expected tariffs, President and CEO Enrique Lores said in a May 28 earnings call.

The computer maker increased production in India, Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam and the U.S. and expects to bypass China for nearly all U.S. imports by the end of June, Lores said.

""In Q2, we acted quickly to address tariff-related headwinds, taking decisive steps like accelerating our manufacturing rebalancing, redesigning our logistics network, shifting sourcing and qualifying new product configurations,"" the CEO said.

Dive Insight:

In Q1 2025, Lores set September as the target date for having less than 10% of HP’s products sold in North America made in China. The Trump administration’s April tariffs triggered a significant acceleration of the plan.

“While we plan for a range of scenarios in the quarter and we worked aggressively to respond to changes in the regulatory trade environment, the tariff increases announced in April were higher than expected,” CFO Karen Parkhill said on the earnings call.

HP adjusted its logistics networks and supply chain during the quarter, per Lores. For example, the company avoided tariffs in Canada and Latin America by removing the U.S. as a distribution hub.

HP's strategy for offsetting tariffs also included raising prices on PCs and printers, which it saw other market participants and competitors doing as well, Lores said.

Tariffs implemented by the Trump administration during Q1 had a significant financial impact on HP, executives said during the earnings call. The levies led to reduced non-GAAP earnings and operating profit, as well as a dip in operating margin for PCs.

While Uganda currently lacks in-country glass recycling capacity, the 63 metric tons of glass collected during the initiative were transported to Tanzania.
Following the pilot’s success, NBL intends to scale up the glass collection initiative, expand to new regions, and roll out consumer awareness campaigns to promote recycling behaviour.
“Though Uganda doesn’t yet have domestic glass recycling, this pilot proves the potential.
Together with startups like Yo-Waste, we’re helping to build a more sustainable Uganda.","Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | To commemorate World Environment Day, Nile Breweries Limited (NBL) has announced the successful completion of a glass bottle recycling pilot, implemented in partnership with local tech startup Yo-Waste under the AB InBev 100+ Accelerator Program, it said in a statement shared on June 11.

The pilot, which ran from August 2024 to March 2025, focused on collecting, sorting, and preparing post-consumer glass waste for recycling. While Uganda currently lacks in-country glass recycling capacity, the 63 metric tons of glass collected during the initiative were transported to Tanzania. There, the glass was processed into cullet and reintegrated into AB InBev’s bottle manufacturing supply chain, creating a closed-loop system that reduces environmental impact.

“This initiative shows that circular solutions are still achievable even with limited infrastructure,” said Emmanuel Njuki, Legal & Corporate Affairs Lead at NBL. We exceeded our initial target of 50 metric tons, collecting 63 metric tons of glass through partnerships with 15 outlets across Kampala and surrounding areas, enabled by a tech- driven collection process using the Yo-Waste mobile app.”

“As the world transitions to more sustainable production models, NBL is proud to lead this shift in Uganda,” Njuki added. “This pilot proves that with local innovation and strong partnerships, we can build a circular packaging system that benefits businesses, communities, and the planet.”

Nile Breweries has long prioritized sustainable packaging. Over 90% of our products are sold in returnable packaging, significantly reducing single-use materials. Our breweries have implemented robust waste segregation systems at source.

Our breweries are on a path of increasing our already high recycling rate and eliminating onsite waste generation through reducing resource use, recycling and reusing materials where possible. So far, our average recycling rate for Jinja and Mbarara breweries stands at above 90%.

Following the pilot’s success, NBL intends to scale up the glass collection initiative, expand to new regions, and roll out consumer awareness campaigns to promote recycling behaviour. “Though Uganda doesn’t yet have domestic glass recycling, this pilot proves the potential. Together with startups like Yo-Waste, we’re helping to build a more sustainable Uganda. Every bottle returned is a step toward a greener future,” said Emmanuel.

This initiative proves the potential of sustainable packaging solutions and aligns with AB InBev’s global sustainability ambition to have 100% of its products in returnable packaging or packaging made from a majority of recycled content.",https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EmmanuelNjuki-and-Martin-Tumusiime.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:14:09.023334

A committee of House members and senators on Wednesday amended a bill that initially set rules for how pharmacists could work remotely.
After the change, the proposal said any company affiliated with a pharmacy benefits manager couldn’t hold a permit to operate a drug store in the state.
The company said it would have to close more than 100 stores, impacting 980,000 customers, if the bill passed.
House members voted 88-4 to approve the conference committee's compromise, but the Senate didn't hold a final vote — killing the matter for now.","BATON ROUGE — The debate over a bill pitting mom-and-pop drug stories against pharmacy benefit managers lasted until the final day of the 2025 legislative session, and drew the state’s attorney general into a battle with a major national chain.

A committee of House members and senators on Wednesday amended a bill that initially set rules for how pharmacists could work remotely. After the change, the proposal said any company affiliated with a pharmacy benefits manager couldn’t hold a permit to operate a drug store in the state.

""Your local pharmacist is the most accessible health professional to the community. Most of the time, you can get to your pharmacist before you can get to a doctor,"" said Kyle Talley, a former pharmacy technician at Floyd’s Family Pharmacy near Ponchatoula.

PBMs are middlemen among pharmaceutical companies, businesses, health insurance companies and workers. Critics say PBMs drive up the costs of medicine to ensure everyone affiliated with the plan makes money, but PBMs often say their scale allows them to negotiate lower prices, especially for commonly used drugs.

After the House and Senate conference committee amended the pharmacist bill Wednesday, CVS tapped its customer network via text and urged them to lobby against the proposal. The company said it would have to close more than 100 stores, impacting 980,000 customers, if the bill passed.

House members voted 88-4 to approve the conference committee's compromise, but the Senate didn't hold a final vote — killing the matter for now.

Attorney General Liz Murrill said CVS misused its customer list and said she was preparing a cease-and-desist order against it, despite concerns it would violate the company’s constitutional rights.

“CVS did not obtain people’s personal cell phone numbers for the purpose of using it to lobby against legislation,” Murrill said in a news conference. “If you’ve every given permission to them to use your phone number, you gave it to them for particular things, like getting a notice about a vaccine that might be available to you.

“Those are the kinds of reasons why they have your phone number, not so they can use it to lobby against legislation that hurts them,” she said.

The bill concerned last-minute language that Louisiana should deny a state permit to any pharmacy ""wholly or partially owned or controlled"" by a pharmacy benefit manager or one of its subsidiaries.

CVS said quick action was needed after the 11th-hour change to the bill.

""We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy and acted accordingly,"" spokeswoman Amy Thibault said. ""Our communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.""

Non-CVS customers received notices Wednesday, as well, asking them to contact lawmakers.

Many pharmacies, regardless of whether they are affiliated with a PBM, maintain contact information for their customers, often to send them reminders about when prescription refills are ready or vaccinations are due.

Randal Johnson of the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association said benefits managers have an outsized role in the drug industry.

“The PBM is truly supposed to be a claims processor in the middle,” he said.

Instead, Talley said, independent companies are forced to accept whatever deal they can make, “knowing that it’s going to have a negative impact on our bottom line.”

“The PMS are underpaying us so bad to where you’re in a financial position where you can’t even buy the inventory that you need,” Talley said.

Murrill said that, without the legislation, rural communities could lose their drug stores as large chains undercut them on prices.

“The independent pharmacists in our communities around the state play an enormously important role,” she said, warning of “pharmaceutical-pharmacy health care deserts.”",https://dcer237tfveol.cloudfront.net/v2/oIpIceOEO7BBHduvoxH5fQNcJuJjQo_lEAo81thqa_kvr8VGkf54lf_XijJSK39jnJNQQOqZSNgJp7KVNi7PpqgLx9_7DIhYp66QqX_JKjf83iuW7-jf_vTpl6iHxAqL0,N,,2025-06-12 22:23:40.877493

Magazine,Kit Eaton,,,,,https://www.inc.com/kit-eaton/why-starbucks-is-bucking-the-trend-and-hiring-more-managers/91201543,"The ASM role makes sense as the company addresses its in-store operations.
They’ll “help provide consistent leadership support throughout more of the store’s operating hours,” allowing store managers, who “typically oversee multimillion-dollar businesses and lead teams of around 18 partners,” to tackle more strategic tasks.
But from a managerial viewpoint, formalizing the assistant store manager role makes sense.
This frees up higher-ranking officers from having to worry about day-to-day matters so they’re free to strategize.
Starbucks is doing almost exactly the same thing, in hopes that by freeing up store managers’ time, they’ll be able to lead their stores better and come up with ways to improve profits.","In a blog post announcing the changes, Starbucks explained that only about 20 percent of its stores have an assistant manager right now, and that person’s role “tends to be short-term and varies by location.” That’s all going to change, with the ASM becoming a full-time role in most stores, with each manager reporting directly to the store manager (or “coffeehouse leader” in Starbucks-speak). The ASM role makes sense as the company addresses its in-store operations. They’ll “help provide consistent leadership support throughout more of the store’s operating hours,” allowing store managers, who “typically oversee multimillion-dollar businesses and lead teams of around 18 partners,” to tackle more strategic tasks. This includes “developing talent, creating the Starbucks Experience, and building community.” The idea is to enable store managers to do more than merely “react to the day-to-day.”

The company’s also spinning it as a good move for existing staff members, suggesting that for interested workers it could be a “meaningful first step into coffeehouse leadership.” It also aligns with the company’s goal of hiring 90 percent of its retail leadership roles from inside its own ranks. The blog also underlines how important Starbucks views its workers, pointing out it provides equity, 100 percent tuition coverage for a first bachelor’s degree, up to 18 weeks of paid parental leave, and more.

This pro-worker terminology stands in bold contrast to some of the company’s recent changes to its uniform policy, which riled up store baristas to the point some went on strike. A previous round of strikes affected over 300 stores nationwide on Christmas Eve last year, when members of a workers union took action over unresolved issues relating to wages, staffing, and schedules.

What’s more interesting about the new ASM changes are that they come as other big brands, like Amazon and Meta, are taking steps to cull middle-rank managers and workers in an effort to streamline business processes and improve profitability. But from a managerial viewpoint, formalizing the assistant store manager role makes sense.

Think of it as a parallel to the way an army works: Sergeants are the midlevel, noncommissioned officers who work directly with troops and military materiel and act efficiently to “get stuff done” in response to their commanders’ orders. This frees up higher-ranking officers from having to worry about day-to-day matters so they’re free to strategize. Starbucks is doing almost exactly the same thing, in hopes that by freeing up store managers’ time, they’ll be able to lead their stores better and come up with ways to improve profits.

Starbucks’s move also stands out in an AI-centric era. Other companies are attempting similar efficiency and productivity boosts by using AI to free up staff members’ time—Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been very clear this is his goal when he recently announced a plan to ditch some midlevel coders at his company.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/06/starbucks-asst-managers-inc-GettyImages-1806571763.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 22:38:45.083684

Lawmakers on Thursday expressed consternation at the idea that CVS had used customer information to send out lobbying texts.","Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill says she is investigating CVS after the company sent mass text messages to customers urging them to tell their legislators to oppose a bill on pharmacy benefits managers.

House Bill 358, which stirred ferocious debate in the waning hours of the legislative session but did not pass, would have barred companies from owning both pharmacy benefits managers and drug stores. Supporters said that would have stopped big companies from squeezing independent pharmacies out of the market and keeping too much of the savings they get on prescription drugs.

PBMs are meant to act as middlemen between pharmacies, health care plans and drug manufacturers to negotiate lower drug costs.

CVS, which owns both the drug store chain and a PBM, Caremark, said the bill would have forced them to close 119 pharmacies in Louisiana. The company launched a lobbying blitz on Wednesday that included a mass text message campaign telling customers the bill could force their drugstore to close and asking them to contact their legislator.

The text messages infuriated many lawmakers, who accused the company of scare tactics.

In a note distributed to legislators on the floor Thursday, Murrill pointed out that CVS manages the drug plans for state employees through the Office of Group Benefits.

“My office will be investigating whether CVS improperly appropriated to its own use the personal information of OGB members and will take legal action if it did,” the note said. “This is not an appropriate use of personal information obtained through a state contract.”

In a press conference Thursday afternoon, though, Murrill said she was her investigation was ""broader than just the OGB contract."" She said she would examine whether CVS engaged in ""unfair and deceptive trade practices by improperly using people's personal information in a way that they did not permit.""

Murrill announced on X that she was sending CVS a cease-and-desist letter and civil investigative demands.

Gov. Jeff Landry also spoke out against CVS’ lobbying action in a post on X,

“Abusing patients’ sensitive information to push a political message is completely unethical and manipulative and we will not stand for it,” the post said.

Amy Thibault, a CVS spokesperson, issued a statement saying the company's communications with its customers, patients and community members were ""consistent with the law.""

""This bill came together yesterday with no public hearing,"" Thibault said. ""We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly.""

Thibault referred to the fact that the PBM legislation came through an amendment to a bill that originally set rules for remote work for pharmacy technicians.

That amendment was proposed while the bill was in a conference committee, a closed-door process where a group of House and Senate members meet to hash out agreements on bills when one chamber has rejected the other's amendments.

Lawmakers on Thursday expressed consternation at the idea that CVS had used customer information to send out lobbying texts. State Rep. Beryl Amedée, R-Gray, saying she found it “disturbing.”

“I’m going to assume that somewhere in the tremendous amount of fine print that comes when you sign up for anything these days, that they have covered their potential liability here, but I still think that’s outside the boundaries of what customers expected when they gave their phone numbers to get prescription updates,” she said. “I’m very disappointed in CVS because the messaging that they did send out was untrue and I consider it propaganda.”

Lawmakers shared screenshots of texts that CVS sent to constituents.

One said HB358 would “prohibit CVS Specialty from serving you and thousands of other patients who receive specialty prescription drugs.”

“You will lose access to your pharmacy team, pharmacy supportive services, and you will need to be serviced by an alternate specialty pharmacy provider,” it said.

The text included a link for customers to send messages to their elected officials.

“I’ve been getting comments from my constituents and friends, and they’re terrified, and it ain’t right,” said state Rep. Michael Bayham, R-Chalmette.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/93/19377d49-496b-586a-93bc-311730a4c8ce/66fc586d218bd.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-12 22:23:49.643470

The next-generation Redefine Burger and Redefine Beef Mince are set to hit retail shelves across the Netherlands, Germany, and France. These products feature significant improvements, including a reduction in saturated fats by up to 90% and a protein content ranging from 11 to 16 grams per 100 grams.

Delivering a “meatier” experience

The newly released products were developed in collaboration with chefs, meat experts, and consumers to ensure both flavor and texture meet consumer expectations for a more authentic meat experience. Extensive sensory testing, which involved both vegan and non-vegan participants, informed the final formulations of the burgers and mince. The company claims that the products now deliver a “meatier” experience compared to previous versions.

Eshchar Ben-Shitrit, CEO and co-founder of Redefine Meat, noted that taste remains a key factor for consumers, particularly those who are flexitarian or regular meat eaters. “Our unique taste-first approach is at the heart of all product development. While many other plant-based products continue to fall short in this area, our next-generation products build upon our premium-quality legacy to deliver an even meatier taste,” he stated.

In addition to improved taste and texture, the nutritional composition of the new products has been optimized to meet the highest Nutri-Score rating (A). Key updates include a significant reduction in methylcellulose content, which has been lowered to less than 2%, as well as an overall increase in protein content.

Tech capabilities allow for rapid prototyping

The company’s technological capabilities, including its patented additive manufacturing processes and the use of AI and machine learning to optimize meat-like qualities, allow for faster prototyping and iteration. This provides Redefine Meat with an edge over traditional plant-based meat production processes, enabling quicker responses to consumer preferences.

Redefine Meat’s new products will be available in major retailers, including Jumbo, Picnic, Plus, and Vomar in the Netherlands; Tegut in Germany; and Monoprix in France.

Ben-Shitrit also addressed consumer concerns about nutrition in plant-based foods, stating, “We recognize that nutrition is playing an increasingly important role in consumer buying habits. Our next-generation products deliver high levels of protein, vitamins, and fiber, without cholesterol, offering a better alternative to many other processed foods.”",https://assets.vegconom.de/media/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/12114044/RT_BBQ-season_Burger-760x507-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:29:20.175801

Dive Brief:

Nescafé sourced 32% of its coffee from farmers that implemented regenerative agriculture practices last year, surpassing a 2025 goal of sourcing 20% of coffee from such methods, parent company Nestlé announced Wednesday.

The instant coffee brand — the largest from the Swiss food and beverage giant — launched a program in 2022 to help farmers transition to sustainable practices that improve productivity, cut spending and reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to coffee production. Farmers that adopted this “Nescafé Plan 2030” achieved an emissions reduction between 20% to 40% per kilogram of unroasted coffee beans last year, per the company.

Nescafé counts the progress towards its goal of lowering its overall carbon footprint and sourcing half of its coffee from farmers that incorporate regenerative agriculture practices.

Dive Insight:

Nescafé said its program encourages farmers to adopt regenerative agriculture practices. These include optimizing fertilization, which improves quality and soil health, in addition to reduced carbon dioxide; planting cover crops, that help in improving biodiversity, soil health and reducing dependency on agrochemicals; and land restoration, which helps them plant native trees to capture carbon dioxide in and near the coffee farms and improves biodiversity and water management.

The program focuses on improving the livelihoods of the sourcing farmers and the communities they live in and includes social initiatives like human rights and child protection. The coffee brand said the latter services include monitoring and bettering children and workers’ rights across Nescafé’s supply chains.

Coffee is one of the world’s most traded agricultural commodities, but a recent analysis by the Carbon Disclosure Project found that the amount of land suitable for coffee cultivation and production could reduce by 48% to 97% by 2050 in key regions due to climate change. The study said most of coffee’s carbon footprint — 75% to 91% — is generated before the coffee beans even leave the farm. Key factors contributing to the generated emissions come from land use, deforestation, fertilizer and processing methods. Hence, incorporating regenerative agriculture practices is more important than ever.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/DJBrA3usWXy6MnCrv0dYg77wVAsQebjOpLRz4Cjmb-g/g:nowe:651:414/c:4984:2816/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05NTU2NDc5OTQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-12 22:23:55.356486

Mattel, the toy giant behind Barbie and Hot Wheels, has struck a deal with OpenAI to help design and develop toys using the startup’s technology, signaling a new era of AI-assisted play tied to its billion-dollar brands.

The first product born out of this partnership—powered by OpenAI’s flagship product ChatGPT and its other generative AI tools—is expected to debut later this year, though details remain under wraps.

“With OpenAI, Mattel has access to an advanced set of AI capabilities alongside new tools to enable productivity, creativity, and company-wide transformation at scale,” Brad Lightcap, chief operating officer at OpenAI, said in a statement.

The discussion between the two companies began last year. The deal does not entail licensing Mattel’s intellectual property to OpenAI, retaining full creative control over its products.

“Our work with OpenAI will enable us to leverage new technologies to solidify our leadership in innovation and reimagine new forms of play,” Josh Silverman, chief franchise officer of Mattel, said in a statement.

That has included more than ten notable title changes, retirements and additions to Nike’s leadership ranks over the past few months.
The leadership team has grown to 14 executives, the majority of which are either new to their title or top-line leadership role at Nike.
But even with those departures, the team Hill is building remains largely Nike-centric.
Nike has new marketing and communications leads, and three different C-level roles that arguably all handle innovation: a chief innovation officer, a chief growth initiatives officer and a chief innovation, design and product officer.","Eight months into his tenure as Nike’s CEO, Elliott Hill's leadership team is now set, according to a company spokesperson. That has included more than ten notable title changes, retirements and additions to Nike’s leadership ranks over the past few months.

Matt Powell, an adviser with BCE Consulting, said via email that the chief executive has been “thoughtfully building his team to execute the turnaround,” which is centered on rebuilding relationships with wholesale partners and rightsizing key footwear franchises like Air Force 1 and Dunk. Sales in the retailer's most recent quarter tumbled 9%, just the latest in a string of declines at the activewear giant.

“Mr. Hill will be tasked with executing these changes and winning back market share lost to competitors that filled shelves left by Nike’s vacancy,” S&P Global Ratings’ analyst Amanda O’Neill said in emailed comments in September. “Specifically, Nike has lost its footing in the specialty running category, specifically losing market share to newer entrants Hoka and OnRunning, and legacy competitors Adidas and New Balance have retained their positions in the lifestyle category.”

Hill, who retired from Nike in 2020 after a lengthy 32-year tenure with the activewear giant, isn’t shying away from change during his second Nike stint, especially when it comes to the executive leadership team.

In early October, just before Hill took over, Nike featured 12 executives on its leadership page, including then-CEO John Donahoe and Hill, alongside Chairman Emeritus Phil Knight and Executive Chairman Mark Parker. Now, eight months later, just three executives remain in their same role, excluding Knight, Parker and Hill. The leadership team has grown to 14 executives, the majority of which are either new to their title or top-line leadership role at Nike. The page as it stands is reflective of Hill’s direct leadership team, though other notable appointments have also been made across the organization, a spokesperson said.

In all the hubbub, four executives with 26-plus years of experience have announced their retirements since Hill joined, including marketing lead John Slusher, Chief Human Resources Officer Monique Matheson, Chief Innovation Officer John Hoke and President of Consumer, Product and Brand Heidi O’Neill. But even with those departures, the team Hill is building remains largely Nike-centric.

Everyone on Nike’s leadership page currently is a Nike veteran; in fact, the only notable appointment Hill has made externally is for the brand’s new chief communications officer. Michael Gonda arrives in early July from McDonald’s and his only other experience at a major brand is at yogurt maker Chobani.

Other than Gonda, much of the team Hill has assembled has decades of experience at Nike — something analysts flagged as a bonus when Hill was named to the top spot last fall.

“While fundamentals will be very challenged in the near-term, we believe that it takes a back seat to the narrative, which is that of a veteran athlete coming out of retirement to pull his once-proud team out of the dumps,” Needham analyst Tom Nikic wrote in December, after Hill’s first earnings call as CEO.

Additionally, Hill’s adjustments so far highlight a few structural changes in the way Nike is doing business. For example, the chief executive elevated Chief Supply Chain Officer Venkatesh Alagirisamy to the senior leadership team in October and in May separated O’Neill’s responsibilities for consumer, product and brand into three distinct roles that will all report to Hill individually.

Nike has new marketing and communications leads, and three different C-level roles that arguably all handle innovation: a chief innovation officer, a chief growth initiatives officer and a chief innovation, design and product officer.

These notably reflect some of Nike’s top turnaround priorities: product innovation and brand storytelling.

Likewise, Nike is tackling its DTC-wholesale mix with new leadership. Hill in March said he worked with Craig Williams, who leads Nike’s geographies and marketplace, to institute new leaders for Nike Direct and Nike Wholesale. Shannon Glass was named vice president of Nike Direct in January, per her LinkedIn, while Erica Bullard serves as her counterpart on wholesale.

Hill described them both as “long-term industry veterans and Nike veterans” and said he’s tasked them with working closely together after Nike’s previous DTC-wholesale missteps led to some of the challenges it’s currently facing.

“In fact, we even put them sitting … up on our floor together. They have offices right outside of one another,” Hill said on the earnings call in March. “I told them those two have got to walk together everywhere they go and make certain that we stay aligned. And I think they're doing a tremendous job of really making certain that we have an integrated approach to the overall marketplace.”

Saying is one thing, but doing is another — and the Nike turnaround will likely take time, GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments in September.

“Nike has a long road to travel in order to compete more successfully against younger, nimbler brands. And its reinvention coincides with a period of soft sneaker demand,” Saunders said. “Hill likely has the skill and vision to turn the business around, but this will not happen overnight. A change of jockey does not automatically put the Nike horse out in front.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/e1d7ROyXWAnk2Fd3n4_DMWbGvahQEYHR7an1z0NFbJU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8yNDA5MTdfRWxsaW90dEhpbGxfT3JpZ2luYWwuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-12 22:33:33.145769

So, what is Green Dot Assist?
Green Dot Assist even troubleshoots hardware issues.
Packaged in an iPad app (apparently, Microsoft couldn’t convince the coffee chain to use Surface devices), Green Dot Assist combines training, support, and efficiency tools, all powered by Azure’s generative AI capabilities.
Given Starbucks’ longstanding emphasis on employee training, an AI-powered employee training guide and assistant makes sense.","While most companies across the food value chain are embracing AI in some form, one major player that’s been notably quiet is Starbucks.

From mobile ordering to Web3 experiments, and computer vision-powered bioauthentication to automated drink-making, the Seattle-based coffee giant has never shied away from tooting its own hard about tech-forward initiatives. But when it came to generative AI, the most hyped tech trend of the past few years, Starbucks had kept relatively quiet, leaving many to wonder what it was working on and when it might reveal its plans.

That wait is over. This week, at a 14,000-employee conference in Las Vegas, the company unveiled Green Dot Assist, a generative AI-powered assistant designed to help baristas and store managers streamline their operations.

So, what is Green Dot Assist? In short, it’s a Microsoft Azure-powered virtual assistant currently being piloted in 35 Starbucks locations. The app assists with a range of tasks, from training new employees on how to prepare specific beverages to supporting shift managers with dynamic scheduling in response to real-time changes, such as last-minute call-outs.

Green Dot Assist even troubleshoots hardware issues. In a demo video shared by Starbucks, a barista named Dave uses the assistant to diagnose an espresso machine that’s pulling inconsistent shots. The AI provides 3D visual guides and prompts Dave to submit a service ticket—an experience that blends visual diagnostics with conversational support.

Packaged in an iPad app (apparently, Microsoft couldn’t convince the coffee chain to use Surface devices), Green Dot Assist combines training, support, and efficiency tools, all powered by Azure’s generative AI capabilities.

Given Starbucks’ longstanding emphasis on employee training, an AI-powered employee training guide and assistant makes sense. But my guess is this is just the beginning. In the longer term, I expect Starbucks to leverage AI to further enhance operational efficiency, particularly given the significant shift in order mix towards mobile ordering, which has led to increased wait times and customer frustration. This next wave will likely include more advanced automation, as we’ve already started to see with the chain’s push to roll out its Clover Vertica machine nationwide this year and – possible – a new point of sale system announced this week at the company’s employee conference.",https://i0.wp.com/thespoon.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-12-at-9.09.09-AM.png?fit=1200%2C704&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-12 22:39:22.905375

The letter advised customers of a potential power supply failure in a specific set of Hugo consoles. Medtronic received 25 complaints related to the loss of power due to failures of the surgeon console main power supply. The main power supply provides power to the entire console except for the 3D monitor, which has its own power supply.

Power supply failure could lead to the permanent loss of ability to teleoperate the system from the surgeon console before or during the procedure. During this failure, the tower and arm cart assembly remain operable. This enables the manual manipulation of arms and/or the removal of instruments and the endoscope, if needed.

Of the 25 complaints investigated, Medtronic reports zero instances of serious patient harm. Six complaints reported non-serious injury. Five of those related to conversions to laparoscopy and one required conversion to another robotic system. Of these cases, two reported an extended procedural time greater than 30 minutes. The remaining 19 complaints reported no injury.

Medtronic says the potential for harm includes treatment delay, bleeding, tissue damage and/or tissue trauma. Its notice has no impact on patients who have already undergone a procedure using the Hugo system.

According to Medtronic, continued use of Hugo is considered appropriate based on an internal review. Company representatives intend to inspect impacted systems and service devices within the coming months.

More about the Medtronic Hugo surgical robot

Hugo is a modular, multi-quadrant platform designed for various surgical procedures. It features wristed instruments, 3D visualization and surgical video capture options in Touch Surgery Enterprise. Hugo combines with Touch Surgery Enterprise to offer a smart, digitally enabled surgical experience.

Medtronic first unveiled Hugo in September 2019 as a potential competitor to long-time industry leader Intuitive Surgical.

Hugo received CE mark approval for urologic and gynecologic procedures in October 2021 and a launch began with the first procedure in Europe in February 2022. However, the system remains investigational in the U.S., but perhaps not for long — the company submitted Hugo to the FDA this year.

Additionally, Medtronic hopes to add more clinical studies earlier this year. It seeks to expand Hugo’s indications to hernia and gynecology. The company completed enrollment in trials for both of those spaces earlier this year.",https://www.massdevice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Medtronic-Hugo-robotic-assisted-surgical-system-in-use-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:32:42.394869

The Walmart-owned Sam's Club is launching its initiative called ""Made Without"", which looks to eliminate over 40 ingredients from the private label brand Member's Mark.
Sam's Club recently surveyed its members and found that 72% are ""actively seeking minimally processed foods.""
Sam's Club has already rolled out cookies and snacks without artificial colors.
""And let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step.","A MAJOR bill that has just passed forces Sam's Club to overhaul all of its home brand items by the end of the year.

The retailer is being forced to get in line with legislation spearheaded by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr about toxic chemicals.

The Walmart-owned Sam's Club is launching its initiative called ""Made Without"", which looks to eliminate over 40 ingredients from the private label brand Member's Mark.

The removals have been seen across 96% of the Member's Mark items.

The ingredients being removed from items include things like artificial colors and aspartame, a sweetener that is roughly 200 times wetter than sugar.

One of the other reasons is thought to be the changing health preferences of the younger generations, who are becoming more conscious about what they eat.

Sam's Club recently surveyed its members and found that 72% are ""actively seeking minimally processed foods.""

While 90% said that they ""either live or aspire to live a healthier lifestyle.""

Many food companies are working on their existing products and introducing new ones without these artificial dyes.

Sam's Club has already rolled out cookies and snacks without artificial colors.

The retailer had already pledged to remove them in a 2022 press release.

Sam's Club Chief Merchant Julie Barber said then: ""We take pride in the high-quality ingredients that go into our products, but what truly differentiates us are the ingredients we consciously leave out.""

Prathibha Rajashekhar, senior vice president of private brands, added: ""The Sam's Club member is at the center of everything we do, so as we continue to evolve the Member's Mark brand, we intend to develop items that are reflective of the ingredients, processes, and materials they want – and don't want – in their products.""

HEALTH PUSH

It comes as Kennedy has called for the end to synthetic food dyes in US food, in his move to address health conditions and obesity in Americans.

The US Sun reported on the popular products like Gatorade, Skittles and M&M's that fell under Kennedy's announcement.

In an April press release, the Health Secretary said: ""For too long, some food producers have been feeding Americans petroleum-based chemicals without their knowledge or consent.

We take pride in the high-quality ingredients that go into our products, but what truly differentiates us are the ingredients we consciously leave out

Julie Barber, Sam's Club Chief Merchant

""These poisonous compounds offer no nutritional benefit and pose real, measurable dangers to our children’s health and development. That era is coming to an end.""

Kennedy also hinted that this is a top priority for Donald Trump after he spoke to the heads of some top food and drink brands.

In attendance at Kennedy's meeting were CEOs from General Mills, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo North America, JM Smucker, Tyson Foods, WK Kellogg, and the Consumer Brands Association.

Some of the notable dyes being taken out includes Red Due 40, which is commonly used in things like sports drinks and chips.

FDA Commissioner Marty Makary cited a study from The Lancet science journal.

It found that artificial colors could ""result in increased hyperactivity"" among children when consumed.

Makary said: ""Now, there's no one ingredient that accounts for the child chronic disease epidemic.

""And let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step.

""For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/600-stores-vows-scrap-receipt-870924589.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1280&h=720&crop=1,N,,2025-06-12 22:29:25.242962

The planned standalone diabetes company will maintain its focus on technologies that help manage blood glucose levels and reduce the burden of diabetes care, according to the company statement.
Medtronic’s planned separation of its Diabetes business and Boston Scientific’s product discontinuation highlight the dynamic nature of the sector.","NEW YORK - Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT), a $113 billion healthcare giant with a ""GREAT"" financial health rating according to InvestingPro, announced Thursday that its planned diabetes business spinoff will be named MiniMed, reviving the original name of the diabetes technology company it acquired in 2001.

The name selection honors the 40-year legacy of the diabetes care business that was founded in 1983 by entrepreneur Alfred E. Mann, according to a press release statement from the healthcare technology company. The parent company has built a strong track record of shareholder returns, maintaining dividend payments for 49 consecutive years with a current yield of 3.2%.

""We’re thrilled to honor this rich 40-year legacy with a name that carries deep meaning and trust,"" said Que Dallara, current EVP and President of Medtronic Diabetes and Chief Executive Officer designate of MiniMed.

The diabetes business, based in Northridge, California, employs more than 8,000 people focused on developing technologies for diabetes management. The unit produces devices including the MiniMed 780G system, an automated insulin delivery system for type 1 diabetes patients.

Medtronic is targeting completion of the planned separation within 18 months of its initial announcement, subject to customary conditions and legal requirements. While the company currently prefers a split-off structure, a final decision has not been reached, and the separation may occur through various capital markets transactions.

The spinoff is part of Medtronic’s strategy to streamline its operations. The company noted that the separation remains subject to consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies.

The planned standalone diabetes company will maintain its focus on technologies that help manage blood glucose levels and reduce the burden of diabetes care, according to the company statement. With Medtronic’s current revenue of $33.5 billion and healthy gross margins of 65.5%, the spinoff comes at a time when the company appears fairly valued based on InvestingPro’s comprehensive Fair Value analysis. Investors seeking deeper insights into Medtronic’s valuation and growth prospects can access the detailed Pro Research Report, available exclusively to InvestingPro subscribers.

In other recent news, Medtronic, Inc. reported its fiscal fourth-quarter 2025 results, which included plans to spin off its Diabetes business into a separate public entity. This division accounts for approximately 8% of the company’s total revenue. Following this announcement, Needham analysts maintained a Hold rating on Medtronic stock, while Truist Securities adjusted its price target to $92, reflecting a positive response to the company’s organic revenue growth of 5.4%, although margins did not meet expectations. RBC Capital Markets also revised its price target for Medtronic to $101, maintaining an Outperform rating, citing the company’s Cardiovascular division’s strong performance as a factor. Stifel analysts held a Hold rating with a $87 target, noting potential tariff pressures impacting the company’s fiscal 2026 outlook.

Boston Scientific Corporation announced it would halt worldwide sales of its ACURATE neo2 and ACURATE Prime products due to increased clinical and regulatory requirements. Despite this, Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating and $112 price target, with the company expecting to meet its second-quarter and full-year 2025 sales and earnings guidance. The discontinuation of these products may have implications for competitors like Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic, which offer similar products.

Overall, these developments reflect strategic shifts and regulatory challenges impacting major players in the medical technology industry. Medtronic’s planned separation of its Diabetes business and Boston Scientific’s product discontinuation highlight the dynamic nature of the sector. Analysts’ ratings and adjustments provide a nuanced view of the companies’ prospects amid these changes.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is marking its 10th anniversary as an independent company with a massive rebranding campaign that replaces the traditional Hewlett Packard Enterprise longhand with an eye-catching new HPE logo.

The “bold” new HPE logo in all capital letters with the traditional green element as part of the “E” replaces the traditional, full-name Hewlett Packard Enterprise brand with the green element above it.

The new brand launches today June 12 on HPE’s website, social media channels, and with new digital signage, digital advertising and demand-gen marketing materials.

[RELATED: Here’s A Look At New HPE Brand Logo That Replaces Hewlett Packard Enterprise Tag]

Besides the new logo, the rebranding includes a new verbal identity and a new culture blueprint.

The new HPE brand logo will be on full display at HPE Discover from June 23 – 26 in Las Vegas at the Venetian Convention and Expo Center and at the Sphere entertainment arena. In addition, it will be displayed on the iconic sphere exterior and will be featured in HPE CEO Antonio Neri’s Sphere keynote.

The new brand comes 10 years after the legendary Silicon Valley crown jewel Hewlett Packard was split into two companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which took hold of the original company’s enterprise products, and HP Inc. which is focused on PCs and printers.

The capital letters of the “bold” HPE brand show “confidence and strength” that is matched with the company’s new “verbal identity” that declares HPE as the “partner that unlocks your ambition – as a leader, a doer, a visionary or a changemaker,” said HPE Vice President of Brand, Culture and Creative Paula Berg.

Even with the massive rebranding with the HPE logo signaling the company’s advancements in AI, hybrid cloud and networking as an “essential partner in the AI era” the full Hewlett Packard Enterprise name will continue to be used to identify the company.

“It’s a pretty big change, a big deal,” said Berg in an interview with CRN. “Our name as a company remains Hewlett Packard Enterprise of course, but our new logo we think mirrors the shorthand that people use to talk about us, most people just say HPE.”

The old Hewlett Packard Enterprise full name logo was a “mouthful” that took up a “lot of space” on displays at big events where HPE was looking to stand out, said Berg.

“In a big stadium if you see it, it doesn’t always read well from a distance,” she said. “On a small screen it doesn’t always read well in a sea of logos because it is so big. So when we were thinking about what we wanted for this next iteration, we wanted something simple. We wanted something that really stood out!”

HPE has also unveiled a new GreenLake logo with the old HPE GreenLake logo replaced by a sleek new “greenlake by HPE” logo with a lowercase greenlake featuring the green element as part of the small “g” combined with the eye-catching new HPE logo.

HPE will maintain the green rectangle element, which has become synonymous with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, on its products without the HPE logo.

Neri, who studied art for nine years and was a professor of drawing and painting, helped lead the creation of the new branding. “Our CEO loves it,” said Berg of the new logo and rebranding.

Berg said the new branding recognizes the “rapid adoption of AI” and the power of HPE’s AI, hybrid cloud and networking portfolio. “HPE today should be synonymous with AI, cloud and networking the way we were synonymous with printers, servers and storage in a previous era,” she said. “We’re the partner that customers want and need right now. They are telling us they are looking for this holistic, high-impact, innovative partner to navigate the AI era. They want a partner they can trust to scale across their organization. They want all their tech in one place. They want a seamless integration into their environment. We are that company. We are made for this moment.”

The new branding campaign is a culmination of 18 months of work to deliver the new branding that “clearly defines who we are now and sends a strong signal to all of our stakeholders that HPE is an essential partner for the AI era,” said Berg.

HPE Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Jennifer Temple said in a blog post that the new HPE visual is a “bold expression of HPE today and the future” the company is shaping.

“Our advancements in AI, hybrid cloud, and networking have made us an essential partner in the AI era,” said Temple in the blog post. “And with five of the world’s top 10 supercomputers — including El Capitan at #1 — we’re leading the way in AI-driven computing worldwide. Our new brand reflects that future. It’s modern, focused, and aligned to what ambitious organizations need: expertise, ingenuity, and the ability to integrate and scale — no matter the challenge.”

Temple said as the world evolves in the AI era so does HPE’s technology and brand. “As HPE approaches its 10-year anniversary, it’s time we evolve how we show up too,” she said. “Today, we debut a new brand. It’s a sharp expression of who we are, how we work, and the transformative impact we deliver for our customers every day.”

The official global activation of the new HPE brand logo with partners will take place on August 18 with new marketing materials and assets that will be in place for partner co-marketing campaigns and new training for partners on the new branding.

HPE said the message to partners on the rebranding is clear: “We’re in this together and we want to do everything we can to make us both successful. We want to make this as easy and mutually beneficial as possible.”

Kathleen Kinka, chief marketing officer for Comport Consulting, No. 231 on the 2025 CRN SP500, said she is a “fan” of the new HPE brand which she called simple and yet also comprehensive.

""Ten years in our business is a long time,” she said. “It was a time for a refresh. HPE is a different company than it was 10 years ago. It’s unifying and showcases HPE as the only company that is a platform company that has end-to-end capabilities. The new brand reflects that capability.”

Kinka said she was particularly impressed with the thoughtfulness and preparation that took into consideration the role of partners in the rebranding effort. “They really thought about it from the point of view of the partner with regard to how long it would take us to make changes,” she said.

Kinka said the new branding recognizes HPE as a company that has continually changed and evolved and gotten ahead of the fast-moving technology trends particularly in AI. “HPE has innovative, leadership products in the AI space so customers can quickly get into AI (with HPE Private Cloud AI) and accelerate with services that are packaged. They don’t have to integrate everything. It’s a unifying play and it’s very timely.”

Comport has also evolved its brand, said Kinka, to emphasize- like HPE- the “essential” IT services it provides customers with a full suite of managed services like ComportSecure.

Berg, for her part, said the use of the word “essential” in the HPE corporate description as the leader in “essential enterprise technology, bringing together the power of AI, cloud and networking to help organizations achieve more” is critical.

“We think essential means it is absolutely necessary,” she said. “It is extremely important. It is something you don’t want to live without. We want to be that partner.”",https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/media_178081a3fd9805d3d0e90cdfd8a09a68c41bb68c1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-06-12 22:49:22.962760
ID21,Instacart,2025-06-12 16:00:09+00:00,The Washington Times,Instacart joins Uber and DoorDash in demanding 'no tax on tips' for gig workers,"Sean Salai, The Washington Times https:, www.washingtontimes.com",,,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jun/12/instacart-joins-uber-doordash-demanding-no-tax-tips-gig-workers/,"Instacart has joined Uber Eats and DoorDash in calling on Congress to include their app delivery drivers in “no tax on tips” legislation that would exempt gratuities from federal income tax.
“That’s why we strongly support No Tax on Tips and the inclusion of independent contractors.
Uber and DoorDash have launched public campaigns supporting the House version.
Financial experts say it’s impossible to estimate how much of their tips self-employed delivery drivers lose to federal taxes due to varying income brackets.
“When companies like Instacart, Uber, and DoorDash support ‘no tax on tips’ legislation, they are signaling alignment with the cultural and economic realities of today’s workforce,” Ms. Gianchandani said.","Instacart has joined Uber Eats and DoorDash in calling on Congress to include their app delivery drivers in “no tax on tips” legislation that would exempt gratuities from federal income tax.

The San Francisco-based food delivery service told The Washington Times that the House version of the bill, which includes gig workers as “independent contractors,” would free their drivers from reporting billions of dollars as taxable income.

Known as “shoppers,” the company’s self-employed workers use the Instacart app to purchase food and deliver it to customers. They typically earn $15 to $20 an hour before travel expenses, including substantial tips.

“At Instacart, we’re committed to supporting shoppers and helping them maximize their earnings,” an Instacart spokesperson said. “That’s why we strongly support No Tax on Tips and the inclusion of independent contractors. This is a matter of fairness and ensuring all workers are able to keep more of their hard-earned income.”

According to the Flex Association, an industry group, roughly 600,000 of the nation’s 7.3 million app-based drivers work for Instacart. Instacart said they collectively earned over $15 billion between the company’s founding in 2012 and 2023.

While President Trump made “no tax on tips” a signature campaign proposal last year, it remains unclear what the Republican-controlled Congress will pass out of reconciliation for his signature.

The Senate passed a version of the tax break on May 20 that covers only hotel, beauty, beverage, food service, pizza delivery and other traditional employees. It caps the deduction at $25,000 a year.

The House version of the bill passed two days later. This proposed tax break expires at the end of 2028, has no cap on deductions, exempts overtime on top of tips, and includes self-employed contractors.

Both versions of the legislation limit the tax break to people earning under $160,000 in 2025. Social Security and Medicare taxes would still apply.

Uber and DoorDash have launched public campaigns supporting the House version.

“Millions of hardworking Dashers deserve this tax cut, and now is the time for Dashers to make sure federal lawmakers get this right,” Max Rettig, DoorDash’s global head of public policy, said in April.

“We’ve met with lawmakers, shared your stories, and partnered with others in the industry to make the case,” Uber said in a message to drivers on the House bill’s passage.

Financial experts say it’s impossible to estimate how much of their tips self-employed delivery drivers lose to federal taxes due to varying income brackets.

But Angelica Gianchandani, a marketing instructor at New York University, said the apps’ public support for the House version of the bill is more about “acknowledging the dignity of invisible labor” than publicity.

“When companies like Instacart, Uber, and DoorDash support ‘no tax on tips’ legislation, they are signaling alignment with the cultural and economic realities of today’s workforce,” Ms. Gianchandani said. “Whether the bill passes may depend less on partisanship and more on whether lawmakers are ready to evolve with the modern economy, where flexibility, not formality, defines how we work.”

According to a recent Senate HELP Committee report, 1 in 3 Americans now engage in some independent work either full-time or to supplement part-time earnings.

A Morning Consult-Flex Association survey released in April 2023 found that over half of gig workers said it improved their financial security and 85% reported that it helped them manage inflation challenges.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/05/07/US_Instacart_Uber_Eats_00795_c0-447-5760-3807_s1200x700.jpg?650e54e5e2a9d4d7ca206fbb597fd374b9dc3f41,N,,2025-06-12 22:28:35.108609

Starbucks is piloting the AI assistant in 35 coffeehouses, with more to follow.

Its launch is a step forward in the chain’s focus on decreasing friction, streamlining operations and providing time for partners to prepare beverages and connect with clients.

The coffee giant showcased the technology to more than 14,000 North American store managers at its Leadership Experience in Las Vegas.

A broad launch is planned across Canada and the US by the chain’s fiscal year 2026.

Starbucks chief technology officer Deb Hall Lefevre was quoted by CNBC: “It’s just another example of how innovation technology is coming into service of our partners and making sure that we’re doing all we can to simplify the operations, make their jobs just a little bit easier, maybe a little bit more fun, so that they can do what they do best.”

In addition to Green Dot Assist, Starbucks is previewing its next-generation point-of-sale (POS) system, which aims to improve order accuracy, uptime [the time in which machinery is in operation] and partner workflow.

The chain is testing pilot menu innovations via the Starting Five programme, in which select locations in the US trial new products.

From there, the activation will expand across Influential and Captiv8’s network of creators, covering 90% of influencers with more than one million followers, and 95% with more than 5000.

The moniker is also a nod to its roots, according to the company, with MiniMed being the name of the original developer of the system that Medtronic acquired for $3.7 billion back in 2001.

“Our journey began in 1983, when visionary entrepreneur Alfred E. Mann founded MiniMed and revolutionized diabetes care with many first-of-its-kind innovations that pushed the boundaries of care and helped simplify life with diabetes for countless people around the world,” said Que Dallara, current president of Medtronic’s diabetes unit and CEO-to-be of the upcoming company.

“We're thrilled to honor this rich 40-year legacy with a name that carries deep meaning and trust,” Dallara said in a statement. “As we step forward into this new and exciting chapter, we'll focus relentlessly on fulfilling our Mission to make diabetes more predictable so everyone can embrace life to the fullest.”

Medtronic announced its plans to divest the $2.8 billion business last month, and form what it has said will become the only player in the space that offers a complete insulin management ecosystem—featuring the MiniMed 780G pump, as well as the company’s continuous glucose monitors and smart insulin pen hardware.

The Los Angeles-based radiology services provider announced the achievement Wednesday, with Barclays Bank PLC the lender. RadNet’s new term loan is slated to mature on April 18, 2031, coinciding with the $868.4 million balance on its existing credit line.

The nine-figure sum is in addition to its current cash balance of $717 million as of March 31. Leaders said these funds position RadNet to “advance our growth strategy and create long-term value for our stockholders.”

“We appreciate the continued support of Barclays and our relationship banks and term-loan lenders,” Mark Stolper, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in a statement June 11. “This incremental financing increases our capacity to execute on a pipeline of acquisition opportunities while maintaining our conservative capital structure.”

Quarterly payments of principal on the loan will be about $2.4 million compared to $2.2 million prior to the amendment. All other terms and covenants remain unchanged, Stolper and colleagues noted.

RadNet has executed several acquisitions in recent months while expressing the desire for more. Last week, the company said it had finalized the purchase of Australia-based ultrasound artificial intelligence vendor See-Mode Technologies for an undisclosed sum. Plus, in April it announced the planned acquisition of breast imaging AI company iCAD for $103 million, a deal funded with stock rather than cash or debt.

In March, leaders shared plans to expand outside of RadNet’s eight core markets, potentially using the hefty cash balance. Currently, the company operates 401 outpatient imaging centers across Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Texas. RadNet last expanded geographically into the Houston market in 2024, starting with the acquisition of Houston Medical Imaging and its seven centers.

“I'll emphasize that we do have an active pipeline of imaging center acquisition opportunities,” Stolper told investors in April. “I'm highly confident that we will put some capital to work this year with some of the dislocation in the capital markets, both on the equity side as well as the debt side. It's putting more and more pressure on some of the smaller operators, some of the private equity-owned operators, and that bodes well for more opportunities on the core imaging center side, going forward. We have been extremely disciplined with regards to price and valuation. We'll continue to be that way. We feel we have a very good sense of what businesses are worth in our industry, but I'm also highly confident that we'll get some transactions done this year.”",https://radiologybusiness.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/assets/articles/Dollar.jpg?itok=P_wAx_2z,N,,2025-06-12 22:18:37.881482

Tesco intends to pull on all levers to maintain its position in an “intensely competitive market”, CEO Ken Murphy told media today (12 June) as the business reported its first quarter financial results.

“Customers are recognising that we are particularly competitive across all aspects of the shopping trip, not just price,” he said.

Tesco is seeing an “intensification in competition”, however Murphy also described it as a “rational intensification, in the sense that everybody is kind of staying toe to toe with each other”.

Tesco pledges to use ‘firepower’ in competitive market as brand perceptions soar

“So, you’re not necessarily seeing massive movement and relative competitiveness, but everyone has, I think, upped their game a notch and that would be broadly what we’re seeing across the industry,” he said.

Murphy claimed Tesco has responded “very effectively” to the competition, “without dropping the ball on quality and innovation”.

The retailer’s market share is up 44 basis points for the 12 weeks ending 18 May 2025, according to Kantar data, marking 24 consecutive four-week periods of share gains.

Tesco’s brand perception has also risen by 65 basis points, according to YouGov data, noting “progress across a broad range of pillars” such as quality and price.

Quality and price

“When it comes to value, quality is as important as price. So, we have continued our focus on improving and innovating across all our ranges,” said Murphy.

The CEO cited F&F Clothing’s move online in May and growth from fast delivery service Whoosh as contributing to Tesco’s market position.

The supermarket also launched more than 350 own brand products in the last quarter and is promising “exciting innovation” for its summer ranges.

Tesco Finest, the supermarket’s premium own brand offering, grew 18% “as the brand continues to resonate with customers looking for affordable ways to treat themselves”.

Group like-for-like sales grew by 4.6% to £16.4bn in the 13 weeks to 24 May. The retailer is maintaining its profit guidance first published in April, with an expected adjusted operating profit between £2.7bn and £3bn this year.

‘A blank sheet of paper’: Tesco’s marketing boss on the power of ‘restless’ leadership

“The market remained intensely competitive and we are committed to ensuring customers get the best value in the market by shopping at Tesco, we are therefore reiterating the full year guidance we gave in April,” explained Murphy.

Sales in the UK grew 5.1% – an uptick on last quarter’s 4.3% – while Republic of Ireland sales grew by 5.5%.

Overall food sales grew by 5.9%, while non-food sales excluding toys increased by 6.2%, boosted by warmer weather and innovation ahead of summer. Tesco’s online sales were up 11.5 percentage points.

Will BYD’s new Dolphin Surf spark a new EV price war overseas?","After China warned that BYD’s recent EV price cuts are creating “war panic,” the company is now turning up the pressure overseas. BYD launched its most affordable EV in Europe, the Dolphin Surf, starting at about $25,000. The tiny EV is BYD’s top seller in China. Will it have the same impact in Europe?

BYD’s EV price war heads overseas with the Dolphin Surf

The Dolphin Surf is the European version of BYD’s best-selling EV in China, the Seagull. The Seagull is already sold for under $10,000 (69,800 yuan) in China, but after another round of price cuts last month, it’s now listed at just $7,800 (55,800 yuan).

Although it didn’t single out BYD, the China Automobile Manufacturers Association warned earlier this month (via Bloomberg) that recent price cuts are “triggering a new round of price war panic” in China.

After launching the Dolphin Surf in the UK and Europe, starting at just £18,650 (just over $25,000), BYD is now bringing its EV price war overseas.

BYD outsold Tesla in the UK last month, registering 3,025 vehicles compared to Tesla with 2,016, and it’s quickly closing in on full-year sales.

In what’s being called a “watershed moment,” the Chinese EV giant also registered more vehicles than Tesla in Europe for the first time in April. And that’s before the Dolphin Surf arrived, which is now among the cheapest cars in the UK.

The UK’s cheapest EV is currently the Dacia Spring, starting at £14,995 ($20,000) with a WLTP range of 140 miles.

BYD’s base Dolphin Surf “Active” offers 203 miles WLTP range. A longer-range “Boost” variant is available with a range of up to 305 miles (507 km), starting at £21,950 ($30,000). Both include tech and features typically found on more premium vehicles, including a 10.1″ rotatable touchscreen and smart driving capabilities.

“Compact cars are the next frontier for electrification in Europe,” BYD’s executive vice president, Stella Li, said during the recent Dolphin Surf launch event in Rome.

Will BYD’s new Dolphin Surf spark a new EV price war overseas? Although China is warning it will have devastating impacts on domestic auto brands, it could fuel EV demand in Europe and the UK with more affordable options arriving.

Electrek’s Take

With a commanding lead in China, BYD is rapidly expanding its presence overseas to drive growth over the next few years.

According to S&P Global Mobility, BYD is expected to more than double its sales in Europe in 2025 to around 186,000 units. By 2030, BYD’s sales in Europe could reach upwards of 400,000.

And it’s not just Europe. BYD is already a leading EV brand in overseas markets, such as Brazil, Thailand, and Mexico, and is emerging as a threat in South Korea, Japan, and other key regions.

By building nearly all vehicle components in-house, including EV batteries and powertrains, BYD can offer electric vehicles at a significantly lower cost and still make a profit.

Its decision to stop making purely gas-powered vehicles in 2022 is already paying off as BYD emerges as a true global threat. One thing is for sure: BYD will be a brand to watch over the next few years as demand for lower-cost, efficient electric cars continues to grow.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/BYDs-EV-price-war-overseas.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-12 22:37:30.062935

UNH is

witnessing robust growth in its medical membership, reflecting a

strong demand for both commercial and government-supported health

plans. In 2023, the company served 47.2 million people in the

United States, which increased 5% year over year in 2024, followed

by 2% growth in the first quarter of 2025 to 50.1 million. As of

March 31, 2025, UnitedHealthcare served around 780,000

consumers.

One of the major driving factors of this growth is

UnitedHealth's vertically integrated strategy. This strategy brings

together its insurance unit, UnitedHealthcare, with its care

delivery and pharmacy services through the Optum unit. By providing

coordinated, value-based care, the company has been able to attract

both seniors and those enrolled in employer-sponsored plans.

However, UNH had to suspend its full-year guidance due to

unexpectedly high medical costs in the Medicare Advantage segment

in the first quarter of 2025. The return of its new CEO, Steve

Hemsley, indicates a strong focus on operations, improved pricing,

adjusted risk and improved care coordination.

Membership numbers are on the rise, but to keep that

sustainable, it will require careful planning and tighter control

over costs. With the 2026 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid

Services (CMS) rate increase on the way and a changing competitive

environment, the company has to find a way to balance between

growing and staying profitable.

How are Competitors Faring?

Some of UNH's major competitors in the healthcare plan provider

space are

Humana Inc.

HUM and

Elevance Health, Inc.

ELV.

Humana's total medical membership of the insurance segment

declined 8.3% year over year in the first quarter of 2025 to 14.8

million. Humana anticipates Individual Medicare Advantage

membership to witness a decline of around 550,000 in 2025. Its

rising costs are concerning.

Elevance Health's total medical membership witnessed a decline

of 0.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2025 to 45.8

Everyone wants AI as a growth engine.” French President Emmanuel Macron met with Mr. Huang and Arthur Mensch, co-founder of French AI startup Mistral AI, during the event.
The new initiative, named Mistral Compute, will be located about 30 kilometers south of Paris, in the Essonne department.
Nvidia also showcased its advances in robotics with Grek, a robot trained in a virtual environment.
On stage, Grek walked, jumped, and danced with Mr. Huang.","Nvidia’s founder and CEO Jensen Huang unveiled an ambitious vision for the future of computing and artificial intelligence on Wednesday (11) in Paris, forecasting a new industrial revolution led by robots trained in virtual environments.

Speaking at the most anticipated session of a multi-day event hosted by Publicis Groupe, Mr. Huang said the world is entering the era of AI agents—autonomous systems powered by large language models—and emphasized that AI is now capable of applying learned rules to solve new problems “just like an intelligent human being.”

“We are launching a new wave of AI. Intelligence means perception, reasoning, planning, and execution,” he said.

During his nearly two-hour keynote, Mr. Huang announced the creation of the world’s first industrial AI cloud, to be based in Germany and equipped with 10,000 GPUs—electronic circuits designed to perform high-speed mathematical operations. The infrastructure will serve European manufacturers in areas ranging from product design to engineering, robotics, and logistics. Partners in the initiative include Siemens, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Toyota.

He also revealed plans to open or expand AI centers in seven European countries—France, Sweden, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland—to develop, train, and deploy AI models. According to Mr. Huang, Europe is on track to increase its AI capacity tenfold within two years.

“These AI data centers are not classic data centers. They are revenue-generating facilities designed to manufacture tokens—tokens that can be transformed into productive intelligence across sectors,” Mr. Huang said. “These AI factories are now part of a country’s infrastructure. That’s why you see me traveling the world, talking to heads of state. Everyone wants AI factories. Everyone wants AI as part of their national infrastructure. Everyone wants AI as a growth engine.”

French President Emmanuel Macron met with Mr. Huang and Arthur Mensch, co-founder of French AI startup Mistral AI, during the event. The meeting included the announcement of a partnership to build European AI infrastructure.

The new initiative, named Mistral Compute, will be located about 30 kilometers south of Paris, in the Essonne department. It will initially feature a 40-megawatt data center, with potential expansion to 100 megawatts. The launch is planned for 2026.

The facility will be equipped with around 18,000 of Nvidia’s latest and most advanced—and expensive—superchips, each costing between $30,000 and $70,000.

France 2030

The project is part of France 2030, a national investment plan launched by Macron in 2021 that commits €54 billion through the end of the decade to accelerate the country’s digital and energy transition. The program focuses on emerging technologies such as AI, robotics, biotechnology, and clean energy.

Founded just two years ago, Mistral AI is reportedly aiming to raise around $1 billion to make the project viable, Financial Times reported. The startup plans to scale up from developing AI models to also offering the computing power to train and run them, through its own servers installed in France.

Calling the alliance “historic,” Mr. Macron said it marked a paradigm shift for Europe. “We want our own cloud, our own data centers, our own computing capabilities, and all the services and infrastructure that allow us to preserve this intelligence and the diversity of who we are. This is our fight for sovereignty and strategic autonomy,” he said.

Later, in a conversation with French entrepreneurs, Mr. Macron reiterated his vision of innovation grounded in European values and warned against external dependence. “I don’t believe in a Europe that follows the United States in a post-humanist model. I believe in our values. But we need to regain our strength. Eighteen months ago, France had no major data centers. We were losing the battle. Now we have Mistral, Nvidia, and we’re climbing the ranks,” he said.

Nvidia also showcased its advances in robotics with Grek, a robot trained in a virtual environment. On stage, Grek walked, jumped, and danced with Mr. Huang. “An industrial revolution has begun. The next waves of AI have started. Greg is a perfect example of what’s now possible in robotics,” Mr. Huang said. “Every industry will be affected. And a new industry will also emerge—just like what happened with electricity.”

Leading organizations today embed sustainable practices across all aspects of their operations—from product development to customer engagement to community support.","In an exclusive interaction with Asia Business Outlook, Greg Lukasik, SVP & CEO of Ecolab Southeast Asia, discusses how aligning organizational culture with long-term strategic goals enables companies to foster innovation, sustainability, and operational efficiency. He advocates for a purpose-driven mindset, digital transformation, customer-centric innovation, and workforce development as essential pillars for building resilient, future-ready businesses. A seasoned business leader, Greg Lukasik brings over two decades of global leadership experience across industrial sectors. He specializes in strategy, sales, marketing, and general management, with a strong track record in driving sustainable growth and operational excellence.

A strong organizational culture is crucial for driving long-term success. How can businesses ensure that their culture is aligned with strategic goals to foster collaboration, innovation, and performance?

In the evolving business landscape, organizations with a clear, purpose driven culture are better placed to create competitive advantages that sustain the business, encourage innovation, and leave a lasting, realized impact. A strong organizational culture is no longer just an inner strength, but also a strategic differentiator.

The first stage for any organization is to make sure that leadership openly and consistently defines its purpose and values to employees, customers, community partners, suppliers and other stakeholders in a way that is grounded within their experience of the organization.

Sustainability is a core of purpose-driven strategies. Leading organizations today embed sustainable practices across all aspects of their operations—from product development to customer engagement to community support. For instance, Ecolab partners with industries to help reduce waste, conserve energy and water, and drive results at lower total costs. Their model demonstrates how sustainability can be both a business imperative and a customer value proposition.

Mindset is another cultural lever worth promoting. High-performing organizations build leadership frameworks that deliberately prioritize innovation, inclusion, learning, and customer-centricity into their organizational mindsets. These mindsets help teams continuously think about opportunities for value-delivery and ensure they can pivot, adapt to changes, and focus their efforts on the purpose of their work. Investing in the establishment of a culture of high performance that embraces continuous improvement provides not only an opportunity for growth but also strengthen the ability of the company to bring and deliver sustainable solutions to problems of concern.

Finally, consistency is important. Cultures thrive when values are instilled and reinforced consistently in markets, teams, and even customers - creating a feeling of shared mission while allowing improvisation due to local market adaptations. If a company operates across multiple regions with diverse customer cultures, providing a shared but adaptable culture with a shared core to the organization can bolster collaboration, innovation, and sustainable performance.

Ultimately, companies that think about culture as a strategic advantage and place the necessary investments into making sure culture is aligned with their long-term vision, enable themselves to collectively build a resilient team that is innovative and high-performing in the future.

Businesses often struggle to align short-term performance pressures with the need for long-term strategic investment. How can companies effectively balance these two seemingly conflicting priorities to foster sustainable growth?

Organizations today are feeling constant pressures to produce immediate results while at the same time develop for the future. I believe the capacity to deliver on both short and long-term missions is about establishing a direct and purposeful link between near-term activities and long-term goals.

This means embedding long-term strategic objectives into everyday decision-making is the first step. This includes establishing performance metrics that reward not just successes, but for making tangible progress against goals, such as building capability, innovation, or entering new markets. Continuous investment in digital technology and building talent isn't going to have an immediate impact on financial performance but are important for driving results over the long-term and maintaining competitive advantage.

An agile approach is equally essential. By breaking down long-term initiatives into manageable milestones, organizations can deliver incremental wins that build confidence, demonstrate value, and allow for adaptation as market conditions evolve. Agility ensures that progress remains steady without losing sight of overarching goals.

Just as important is fostering a culture of transparency and alignment. Ensuring that every team understands how their daily efforts contribute to the broader strategy creates a sense of ownership and purpose.

Companies that succeed are those that consistently deliver results, while investing boldly in the capabilities and innovations that will define their future.

Understanding customer needs is essential to drive relevant innovation. How can businesses ensure that their innovation strategies remain customer-centric without being overly influenced by short-term trends?

Firstly, the best companies are customer-focused and listen continuously. Not just around current challenges, but also their customers’ emerging priorities and future ambitions. By building long-term partnerships focused on solving systemic issues, businesses can align innovation efforts with lasting customer value, rather than fleeting market shifts.

For instance, in sectors facing increasing resource constraints, solutions like circular water management have emerged not because of short-term pressures, but because they address a long-term, structural challenge critical to customers' sustainability and operational resilience.

Secondly, embedding a robust needs-assessment framework also helps focus action on the objectives that will provide returns on action both now and in the future. The ability to use data insights, horizon-scan market patterns, and leverage co-creation with customers, rather than react to each new trend, allows organizations to mitigate the risk of innovation investments being poorly aligned and provide the most ongoing relevance. For instance, deploying advanced technologies like real-time monitoring of processes, and predictive analytics may expose inefficiencies and reveal risks that the customer may not have yet fully recognized, keeps you ahead in both meeting needs and expectations.

Thirdly, the best firms instill a balance between agility and discipline in their culture. It’s important to stay responsive to evolving customer requirements without losing sight of the broader mission. Cross-functional integration of research and development, customer-facing, and strategy groups could help organizations look at trends with a view to long-term consumer outcomes.

To make sure that innovation strategies remain consumer-centric, firms must think beyond short-term trends but rather think about long-term value for consumers. This starts with deep understanding of evolving customer priorities, not just what they need today but what will matter tomorrow. Also embedded in innovation are principles like sustainability, resilience, and compliance, which will help an organization deliver for consumers in relevant and future-fit ways. Businesses can foster lasting customer trust and differentiation in a rapidly changing market by prioritizing solutions that enhance performance while supporting broader environmental and societal outcomes.

In short, businesses that listen deeply, think long-term, and innovate responsibly will ensure their strategies remain customer-centric, delivering relevance today and resilience for tomorrow.

Effective resource allocation is a key challenge for businesses aiming for sustainable growth. How can businesses optimize their use of resources to support innovation while maintaining operational efficiency?

It is important to engage your customers not only on what they need today, but also on their future risks and opportunities. Water and resource scarcity management are major areas of need across our region fast becoming concerns. Businesses that address these challenges today will be better equipped to be resilient in the future. Through creating and implementing advanced AI-driven technologies, providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and proactive maintenance insights - businesses have been able to transition from reactive to preventative actions, anchored within improved operational performance and sustainability in the long run.

I believe innovation needs to be linked directly to recognized outcomes. Our development of a partnership with Digital Realty (a leading global data center), is an excellent example of this. We implemented AI-driven monitoring into their cooling system to identify inefficiencies and make improvements that will lead to water savings of approximately 15% to conserve operations and protect local watersheds. Businesses that support their innovation and aspirations within a clearly defined environmental and operational ROI can encourage stronger customer loyalty and increased long-term competitive advantage over time.

Ultimately, businesses should consider their work as part of a systems-level process. As an example, programs like Ecolab Water for Climate demonstrate that organizations can leverage a framework for their work, understand their objectives and intentions, build insights, take action, and measure outcomes, in order to consistently realize sustainability goals as operational reality.

Equally important is investing in the future workforce. Strengthening technical education and occupational skills development ensures a strong talent pipeline aligned to emerging sectors like water management and digital infrastructure. Companies that invest in skills for the future today will be better positioned to respond to future market demands.

Customer-orientated innovation is not just about technology; it is a mindset. Companies that embrace a mindset of collaboration invested in future capability that innovates with real world outcomes will not only engage with and meet future challenges but, they will also start to lead and shape the next-generation economy.",https://www.asiabusinessoutlook.com/uploaded_images/newstransfer/el4ojGreg.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:25:35.911145

The threat of revocation of this distribution permit was then granted to PT Danone Indonesia, even the Bali Provincial Government would ask the district/city government to revoke its permit to the grassroots.
Moreover, the policy to stop the production and distribution of AMDK is considered the only option for the common good.
PT Danone Indonesia agreed with a request for relief, namely an extension of the limit for 6 months for adjustment.","Bali Governor Wayan Koster finally destroyed the giant drinking water company PT Danone Indonesia to stop the production of bottled drinking water (AMDK) under 1 liter in Bali.

This was conveyed by Koster at the BBTF travel exhibition in response to the previous condition in which the company that owns the Aqua drinking water brand was the only one who did not agree with this policy.

""Of these 18 manufacturers, only one was a bit annoying, Danone, an Aqua beverage producer, the other day I called the second, finally softened,"" said Koster, Thursday, June 12.

The Bali Provincial Government has made a policy to prohibit the production and distribution of AMDK under 1 liter starting in 2026, this aims to suppress the emergence of plastic waste in the midst of the complicated waste problems on the Island of the Gods.

Koster explained that during the first meeting only the company had not yet agreed on this policy, so he emphasized that if it was not complied with, the permit would be revoked.

""If everything else is okay, so I forbid producing, I summon all single-use plastic drink producers so that they obey the policy for banning production, circulation, and use,"" he said.

The threat of revocation of this distribution permit was then granted to PT Danone Indonesia, even the Bali Provincial Government would ask the district/city government to revoke its permit to the grassroots.

This process is also to see the permits of bottled drinking water companies in Bali, because if their permits are complete, they are only sanctioned because they do not comply and if they are found that the permits are also incomplete, they will be subject to criminal sanctions.

""Just for me, if he doesn't obey, I have to revoke it, don't make it good for him to make a profit, make garbage, other people are told to take care of it, then our tourism has a declining image,"" said the Governor of Bali.

The Bali Provincial Government is confident in the policy included in the Circular Letter of the Governor of Bali Number 9 of 2025 concerning the Bali Cleaning Waste Movement, because support from various elements has been pocketed, including from the Minister of Environment.

Moreover, the policy to stop the production and distribution of AMDK is considered the only option for the common good.

PT Danone Indonesia agreed with a request for relief, namely an extension of the limit for 6 months for adjustment.

“I’m genuinely excited about the opportunity for our company,” Niccol told NBC News’ Hallie Jackson in an interview.
Starbucks’ fiscal year concludes at the end of September.
There’s also a chance, according to Niccol, that Starbucks may roll out trendy mushroom-infused coffees in future.
“The thing that’s great about Starbucks is we’re a global company.","Despite price pressures from tariffs and an extended sales slump, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said he is optimistic the company is on the comeback trail.

“I’m genuinely excited about the opportunity for our company,” Niccol told NBC News’ Hallie Jackson in an interview.

Niccol is known as a turnaround expert, given his experience running Chipotle, which thrived under his watch. He’s looking to replicate that success at Starbucks, the biggest coffee company in the world with 32,000 locations and $36 billion in annual revenue as of the last fiscal year.

Competition from the likes of Dunkin', McDonald's and Dutch Bros. has taken a toll on Starbucks, as has consumers' weariness of stubborn inflation and rising prices. The company’s same-store sales have fallen for five straight quarters, and it announced in April that its profit was cut in half compared to a year earlier.

Since taking over in September, though, Niccol has rolled out changes to Starbucks’ business model — cutting 30% of its menu, requiring that customers buy a menu item to sit in its stores and introducing a new “green apron” service model that uses an algorithm to help baristas sequence orders. Starbucks' stock is on the upswing since the company’s lackluster earnings report in late April. Its growth this year has outpaced gains in the broad S&P 500 stock index.

Niccol pinned the company’s recent struggles on a lack of focus on customers’ experience.

“We veered away from, I think, owning the idea of the third place, the coffeehouse experience, making sure that the customer was front and center,” Niccol said.

Prices are a big part of his proposition to customers, as well.

“That was our commitment. For this fiscal year we’re not moving on prices. What I can’t commit to is where the future goes,” Niccol said. Starbucks’ fiscal year concludes at the end of September.

“But what I definitely can commit to,” he added, “is we’re going to give people a great experience so that what you get for what they pay, they feel like they got a great value.”

Starbucks is introducing some targeted new products, including a new protein vanilla latte this week in select stores. There’s also a chance, according to Niccol, that Starbucks may roll out trendy mushroom-infused coffees in future.

Niccol acknowledged the company will continue to deal with external challenges — especially from Washington. President Donald Trump’s uniform 10% tariff on all imports will likely raise the cost of Starbucks’ raw coffee beans, which Niccol said “frankly cannot be grown in the United States.”

But Niccol is confident Starbucks can withstand any additional costs.

“The thing that’s great about Starbucks is we’re a global company. We’re an iconic brand,” Niccol said. “We have the flexibility and scale to navigate wherever these policy changes go.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250612-Starbucks-RS-a33487.jpg",N,,2025-06-12 22:39:42.983552

(LEVI): Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","America's Car-Mart (CRMT) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.26 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.87 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.06 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 44.83%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this auto retailer would post a loss of $0.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.37, delivering a surprise of 3,800%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

America's Car-Mart, which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Whole Sales industry, posted revenues of $370.17 million for the quarter ended April 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.69%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $364.67 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

America's Car-Mart shares have added about 12.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.4%.

What's Next for America's Car-Mart?

While America's Car-Mart has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for America's Car-Mart: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.69 on $375.49 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.55 on $1.51 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Automotive - Retail and Whole Sales is currently in the top 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, Levi Strauss (LEVI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended May 2025.

This jeans maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Levi Strauss' revenues are expected to be $1.37 billion, down 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.

Mars Inc. has overhauled its global marketing operations and picked Publicis Groupe to lead a wide range of communications activities. Mediapost in its report said this followed a closely contested review process that began in late 2024.

This move gives Publicis control over Mars’ media planning and buying, content production, social media engagement, influencer partnerships and commerce integration.

COMvergence reports that Mars allocated around $1.76 billion to global media efforts in 2024.

This development delivers another setback to WPP, which previously managed the media account but now exits the picture.

For Publicis to handle and Mars global media vision is a decision that follows a recent client losses for WPP, including Coca-Cola’s North American business and Paramount, both now with Publicis.

Publicis will also join a newly structured agency model called “One Mars,” designed to streamline collaboration across partners.

IPG-owned Weber Shandwick will lead brand public relations across Mars’ diverse portfolio, including M&M’s, Snickers, Twix, Skittles, and pet care products.

Mars confirmed it will retain its primary creative partners, Omnicom and T&P, as the latest review did not include creative assignments.

Gülen Bengi, Chief Marketing Officer for Mars and Growth Officer for its snacking division, described the move as a bold redesign of audience connection.

Bengi said Mars must constantly evolve to keep its brands relevant.

A vermifilter system for reducing nutrients and organic-strength of dairy wastewater.","Decarbonizing dairy is a challenge that no single company can address alone. For several years, Danone has been working with its suppliers to integrate sustainability into its contracts, actively engaging in collaborative projects to accelerate emission reduction in dairy farming.

Through this partnership with Leprino, we aim to reduce emissions on dairy farms in the USA, with a focus on manure management practices. The objective is to select levers that not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also deliver significant co-benefits to the resilience of farms, notably impacting water, soil health, and nutrient management planning of farmers.

BioFiltro wastewater treatment technology is a nature-based solution that uses worms and microbial bacteria to process the liquid from cow’s manure, preventing the formation of methane emissions from manure storage by up to 90%1, while drastically reducing nitrogen in the water applied to fields2.

By upcycling wastewater into irrigation water, it provides farmers with flexible access to clean irrigation water that they can store and use when needed, a critical practice in areas like California where water can be a scarce resource.

By generating worm castings, which is a nutritious and valuable soil amendment, this technology can also contribute to improving crop yield and soil health.

Through this first installation, we expect an annual reduction of 40,000 tons of GHG emissions starting in 2026 and the upcycling of nearly 0.7 billion liters of wastewater per year.

This initiative marks new progress in Danone’s global roadmap to build more resilient dairy farming models. It supports farmers in their transition to regenerative agricultural practices while investing in innovative solutions adapted to each farm’s profile.

Annual foot traffic rose 22 percent its first year.
Urban retail corridors often welcome bold architecture because foot traffic translates directly into sales.
On the corporate side, design compliance can shave three to six months off permit approval, saving six-figure rents.","Pull into Sedona, Arizona, and one surprise greets you even before the famous red cliffs: a McDonald’s logo in turquoise instead of bright gold. Opened in 1993, the store became the first (and still only) location on Earth where the arches match the landscape rather than the corporate style guide.

Sedona’s council insisted the normal school-bus yellow would compete with the rust-colored buttes that drive the town’s tourism. After months of back-and-forth, McDonald’s designers settled on Pantone 321, a blue-green shade that echoes desert succulents and Native jewelry. The arches shine at about 70 percent of the usual brightness to meet the city’s low-glare limits.

What started as a zoning requirement is now an attraction in its own right, drawing steady streams of selfie-seekers who spend a few extra dollars inside.A store manager told local press that foot traffic runs 5–8 percent higher than at a similar-size McDonald’s in Flagstaff.

Corporate headquarters quietly keeps the color and lighting specs on file in case other towns request muted arches. Sedona’s choice shows how local design rules can even help the bottom line.

How big brands blend into their surroundings

Sedona’s McDonalds is not the only store which has adapted like a chameleon to its surroundings:

Starbucks, Forbidden City (Beijing): No mermaid sign outside; the storefront uses dark timber and Chinese calligraphy to respect the palace aesthetics.

IKEA, Burbank (California): Exterior painted a slate blue 50 percent darker than the chain’s trademark hue after downtown officials asked for less visual “noise.”

Apple Store, Georgetown (Washington, DC): A restored 1880s brick façade bears only a subtle etched logo; modernization happens behind original windows and cornices.

McDonald’s, Freeport (Maine): Cedar shingles, white trim, and a wooden arch conform to the town’s colonial-heritage code rather than fast-food prefab styling.

Cities defend these rules with numbers. A National Trust Main Street study shows districts with tight façade guidelines saw property values rise nine percent faster than comparison areas over a decade. Sedona’s own tourism board found visitor satisfaction scores drop by up to 25 percent when neon clutter dominates scenic views.

When brands lean into contrast and turn into landmarks

On the other hand, some companies prefer to play it dangerous and bet on iconic (and polemical) exteriors:

Louis Vuitton Maison, Fifth Avenue (New York): A multi-story glass skin shaped like translucent travel trunks commands attention next to St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Annual foot traffic rose 22 percent its first year.

Apple Cube, Fifth Avenue (New York): A glowing 32-foot glass cube entrance to an underground store became a top-ten spot on Manhattan Instagram maps.

Selfridges, Birmingham (UK): Fifteen-thousand aluminum disks ripple across curved walls, lifting mall visits by 30 percent after opening.

Uniqlo Megastore, Ginza (Tokyo): A digital façade plays color animations and brand messages, turning the entire building into a street-level billboard.

The contrast strategy can be pricey. Louis Vuitton’s Fifth Avenue frontage reportedly cost $100 million, yet sales per square foot doubled, giving the chain its best-performing U.S. location.

Even modest tweaks carry a bill: Sedona’s custom arches added about $150,000 in design and lighting changes, but extra tourist traffic recouped that within four years.

Context, contrast, and the bottom line

So how does a company decide between blending in and standing out? Tourist towns or heritage districts favor subtlety; a lower-key storefront keeps the skyline coherent and preserves property values.

Urban retail corridors often welcome bold architecture because foot traffic translates directly into sales.

The idea is to more readily connect sales and conversion data from a brand or merchant with campaign optimization happening on TTD.
The Connector App goes beyond a typical data onboarding setup, something Snowflake and TTD have had as an integration for years.
And for Snowflake it’s a useful tool because, within its internal structure, Media, Entertainment & Advertising is a totally separate vertical as Retail.
But they don’t think of Snowflake as a natural conduit for their retail media network businesses.","The Trade Desk on Thursday announced its first native app built for use with a separate cloud or data warehouse. It’s called the Connector App on Snowflake.

The idea is to more readily connect sales and conversion data from a brand or merchant with campaign optimization happening on TTD.

“Until now, a lot of what we’re talking about was present in Snowflake, but definitely required resourcing of a data engineering team in order to make it actionable,” Gabe Richman, TTD’s GM of global identity and platform strategy, told AdExchanger.

What’s different now, he said, is the data is immediately live. It never leaves the Snowflake account and can be operated by most ad tech or agency execs, he said.

Or, as put by David Wells, Snowflake’s industry principal for its Media, Entertainment & Advertising vertical, the data is now “accessible to non-technical personas.”

So, what’s the point?

Aside from simplifying the data science to be serviceable for people who don’t know the SQL coding language, there is one killer use case advantage with the new Connector App, Wells said. Retail conversion data can now be returned at the SKU level. Rather than having an aggregated view of sales in, say, the orange juice category, he said. Now, an advertiser or retailer might target the kinds of shoppers who prefer high-pulp OJ.

It’s a feature that more retail media advertisers are calling for, he said. So retailers are doing more to provide the “the granularity of insights in terms of what’s working.”

It is also the second time this week that TTD has announced a new data integration that is relatively innocuous, except for the fact that SKU-level sales information is being passed to the DSP. The other example being a new tie-up between TTD and Instacart and Ocado.

The Connector App goes beyond a typical data onboarding setup, something Snowflake and TTD have had as an integration for years. Onboarding is just a data dump and match, but with this live app native on Snowflake, live TTD campaigns can receive feedback on what types of media or targeting led to those sales.

And for Snowflake it’s a useful tool because, within its internal structure, Media, Entertainment & Advertising is a totally separate vertical as Retail. Many retailers use Snowflake as their data warehouse for planning and inventory management, or as a martech ecosystem hub, Wells said. But they don’t think of Snowflake as a natural conduit for their retail media network businesses.

But as TTD goes out and wins more business among retailers, their number of “mutuals” (which is to say, customer overlap) increases, Wells said. And then those retailers will see the use cases Snowflake has outside of the retail category, and within the ads vertical.",https://www.adexchanger.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Great-Data-Lakes-Snowflake-AWS-Google-Cloud-Databricks-Microsoft-Azure-feature-comic.png,N,,2025-06-12 22:28:53.257539

We’re beginning with Kraft Heinz’s plans to invest $3 billion in upgrading its U.S. manufacturing facilities. The plant updates are intended to be more efficient and reduce costs while helping the Kraft Mac & Cheese and Heinz ketchup maker defend its market share. Check out this article about the company’s most significant manufacturing investment in 10 years.

In major robotics news, Kawasaki has unveiled a quadruped ""robot horse” concept with two seats that riders can steer using body language and AI navigation features. While the promotional video of a CGI simulation shows the Corleo vehicle leaping and moving at high speeds, the current prototype can only stand and pose. Watch our video coverage and learn when this project could become a reality.

Meanwhile, Fiat Professional has introduced the Tris, a three-wheel electric vehicle designed for last-mile delivery with a 55-mile range and the ability to recharge using a standard domestic socket in under 5 hours. The compact commercial vehicle can carry up to 1,190 pounds and comes in three configurations to serve urban logistics needs. Read our article about the last-mile delivery vehicle solution.

More automotive news was that General Motors will make an $888 million investment to update its New York Tonawanda Propulsion facility, supporting production of sixth-generation V-8 engines for SUVs and trucks. The plant will continue producing fifth-generation engines while preparing for the new production beginning in 2027. Head over to this write-up about GM’s venture.

Finally, Subaru has introduced the ""world’s first airbag for cyclists” on its Forester crossover in Japan. The automaker’s new U-shaped external airbag deploys across the hood and up along the A-pillars to protect cyclists and pedestrians in collisions. See how the brand-new safety feature works in this video.

Publicis Groupe has acquired quite an array of influencer marketing assets in the last couple of years, with Captiv8 and Influential among them — and will be showing them off at the Cannes Lions Festival next week with a global influencer campaign that promotes George the lion, a real lion known in wildlife circles.

According to the company, the campaign will demonstrate the “Super Bowl” type of reach that can be achieved with influencer marketing.

The operation launches on June 16, with a joint Instagram post from top wildlife influencers @shandorlarenty (9.3M TikTok, 596K Instagram) and @Pubity (40M Instagram, 17M TikTok), to introduce George the lion.

From there, the activation will expand across Influential and Captiv8’s network of creators, covering 90% of influencers with more than one million followers, and 95% with more than 5000.

The “Lion Tracker” at Influential Beach (the third annual activation the platform has put on at Cannes, and the first under Publicis ownership) will monitor the lion’s growing audience in real time. By the end of the Cannes Lions Festival, he will have reached “big game” reach, according to the holding company.

The campaign includes a playful digital OOH component comparing the cost of a Super Bowl-worthy influencer buy to the cost of a week in Cannes.

Arthur Sadoun, CEO of Publicis Groupe commented: “With every acquisition — from Captiv8 to Influential — and every innovation, like CoreAI, we’re building a future-ready platform to help clients navigate an increasingly complex and challenging marketing landscape. At Cannes this year, we’re focused on turning AI hype into business upside — with practical, Monday-ready solutions our clients can put to work immediately.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/06/12/publiciscannes-1_yBBrR1u.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:37:05.934563

The strategy returned -3.32% (Gross) in the quarter compared to -4.27% for the index. Both sector allocation and security selection were positive during the quarter.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index?
An index value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility.
When is the next release of the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index?
The next release of the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is scheduled for 8 a.m.","Summary

S&P Global Inc (SPGI, Financial) released its latest GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index on June 12, 2025, revealing a decline to -0.46 in May from -0.39 in April. This indicates increasing spare capacity across global supply chains, largely due to ongoing tariffs and trade tensions. The report highlights significant regional disparities, with Asia experiencing the most underutilization, while Europe shows signs of industrial recovery. The U.S. manufacturers are front-loading inventories in anticipation of further tariffs, despite underutilization in North American factories.

Positive Aspects

European industrial sector is edging closer to recovery, buoyed by fiscal stimulus measures, particularly in Germany.

Global material supply levels remain robust, with vendors having sufficient stock to meet orders.

Transportation costs are broadly in line with their long-term average, indicating stability in logistics expenses.

Negative Aspects

Asia's supply chains are the most underutilized since December 2023, with significant retrenchment in Chinese factories.

North American supply chains remain underutilized, with persistent weakness in Mexico and Canada.

The U.K. manufacturing industry shows marked weakness, with considerable slack across supply chains.

Financial Analyst Perspective

From a financial analyst's viewpoint, the report underscores the challenges faced by global manufacturers due to geopolitical tensions and tariffs. The underutilization of supply chains, particularly in Asia and North America, suggests potential inefficiencies and cost implications for companies reliant on these regions. However, the proactive inventory strategies in the U.S. could mitigate future risks associated with price hikes and supply disruptions. Investors should monitor these trends closely, as they could impact corporate earnings and supply chain resilience.

Market Research Analyst Perspective

As a market research analyst, the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index provides critical insights into regional supply chain dynamics. The contrasting trends between Europe and Asia highlight the importance of regional strategies in navigating global supply chain challenges. Companies may need to diversify their supplier base and adapt procurement strategies to mitigate risks associated with underutilization and potential supply chain disruptions. The report also suggests that fiscal policies and economic stimuli can play a significant role in regional industrial recovery.

After months of testing, Taco Bell is finally bringing its Crispy Chicken Strips, Crispy Chicken Burrito, and Crispy Chicken Taco (aka its version of the Snack Wrap) to menus nationwide.
Taco Bell Debuts Crispy Chicken Strips, Taco, and Burrito Taco Bell began testing chicken strips a few years ago, then again in March of this year with its Crispy Chicken Bacon Club Burrito.
While Taco Bell has said that Crispy Chicken is coming to permanent menus, this is not that launch.
The Crispy Chicken Strips, taco, and burrito are only joining the lineup for a limited time—but the chain promises more crispy chicken is coming soon.","By now, it’s almost comical to see just how many fast food chains have released their version of a snack wrap before McDonald’s brings its fan-loved offering out of retirement. Despite Mickey D’s setting a date for the iconic Snack Wrap’s return (it’s July 10, FYI), Ronald McDonald’s is still getting beat at his own game.

Popeyes introduced its chicken wraps on June 2 and now even Taco Bell—yes, the Tex-Mex chain—is getting in on the chicken wars 2.0.

One of Taco Bell’s most successful—and maybe most surprising—launches was its Crispy Chicken Nuggets in 2024. The nuggets, made with a tortilla chip-infused breading, quickly sold out, but the chain brought them back again this year with much fanfare.

At Live Más Live 2025, the chain teased that its beloved nuggets wouldn’t be the only crispy chicken option fans see this year. In fact, Taco Bell promised that it would add a crispy chicken offering to its permanent menu by 2026.

As of June 12, we’re one step closer to that goal. After months of testing, Taco Bell is finally bringing its Crispy Chicken Strips, Crispy Chicken Burrito, and Crispy Chicken Taco (aka its version of the Snack Wrap) to menus nationwide.

Taco Bell Debuts Crispy Chicken Strips, Taco, and Burrito

Taco Bell began testing chicken strips a few years ago, then again in March of this year with its Crispy Chicken Bacon Club Burrito. The chain seemed to land on its new Crispy Chicken Tacos and Crispy Chicken Burritos in May when it launched its final market test in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Now, the taco, burrito, and strips themselves are headed to menus across the country.

The star of the launch is the new Crispy Chicken Strips, which are marinated in jalapeño buttermilk flavor and coated with tortilla chip breadcrumbs before being fried. The strips can be ordered on their own or with the new Spicy Ranchero Sauce, made with Anaheim and jalapeño peppers, tomatoes, garlic, and onion, or Avocado Ranch sauce, a mild, creamy ranch sauce with a hint of avocado flavor.

The Crispy Chicken Taco features a Crispy Chicken Strip topped with purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo, and shredded Cheddar cheese on a tortilla, served with Spicy Ranchero or Avocado Ranch sauce. Taco Bell’s new Crispy Chicken Burrito is double the size of the taco with two Crispy Chicken Strips, purple cabbage, lettuce, pico de gallo, and Cheddar cheese on a full-sized tortilla with your choice of Spicy Ranchero or Avocado Ranch sauce.

While Taco Bell has said that Crispy Chicken is coming to permanent menus, this is not that launch. The Crispy Chicken Strips, taco, and burrito are only joining the lineup for a limited time—but the chain promises more crispy chicken is coming soon.

Considering that Taco Bell just finished up its market test in North Carolina and the chicken strips are already on the menu, it’s likely that they’ll be as big of a hit as the Crispy Chicken Nuggets. So, you might want to try them soon, in case they sell out as quickly as the nuggets did.",https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/g1yK4djA0aywH2dFKj3oYUiJwhE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AR-Taco-Bell-Batch-Getty-05-2x1-f976f21e0fca4012b4e40bca243884f3.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 22:32:01.098756

And we are, above all else, a coffee company,"" Schultz added.
The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores,"" Schultz wrote on LinkedIn.
That idea of focusing on stores was echoed in Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" plan, which he unveiled shortly after taking over as CEO.
""Our financial results don't yet reflect our progress, but we have real momentum with our 'Back to Starbucks' plan,"" Niccol said in April.","Howard Schultz, the former chair and CEO of Starbucks, enthusiastically lauded Brian Niccol's turnaround plan for the coffee chain at a company event on Wednesday.

Schultz was speaking at ""Starbucks Leadership Experience 2025,"" an event which saw over 14,000 North American store managers gather in Las Vegas, when he praised Niccol's work. The former and current CEOs of Starbucks discussed the company's future during a fireside chat on Wednesday.

""I want to say, when I heard you speak for the first time about 'Back to Starbucks,' I did a cartwheel in my living room,"" Schultz told Niccol.

""First of all, it was so brilliant. It's short. It's to the point, and it's exactly the tip of the spear of who we should be, and who we are. And we are, above all else, a coffee company,"" Schultz added.

Starbucks told Business Insider it had no further comments on Schultz's remarks.

Niccol was the CEO of the Mexican grill chain Chipotle before he became the CEO of Starbucks in September.

Niccol's predecessor, Laxman Narasimhan, stepped down after 17 months. During Narasimhan's tenure as CEO, the company struggled with declining sales in the US and China.

Schultz publicly criticized Starbucks' management in a LinkedIn post he wrote in May 2024. Schultz said the coffee chain's senior leaders and board members ""need to spend more time with those who wear the green apron"" and overhaul its retail strategy.

""The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience, through the eyes of a merchant. The answer does not lie in data, but in the stores,"" Schultz wrote on LinkedIn.

That idea of focusing on stores was echoed in Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" plan, which he unveiled shortly after taking over as CEO.

""Today, I'm making a commitment: We're getting back to Starbucks. We're refocusing on what has always set Starbucks apart — a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas,"" Niccol wrote in an open letter in September.

Starbucks announced its second-quarter earnings in April. The company reported $8.8 billion in net revenue, slightly lower than the $8.83 billion estimate compiled by Bloomberg.

""Our financial results don't yet reflect our progress, but we have real momentum with our 'Back to Starbucks' plan,"" Niccol said in April.

Jason Haas CFA has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors influencing Ecolab’s current market position. The company is maintaining its pricing surcharge strategy, which is expected to be realized in the latter half of the year, despite facing a challenging demand environment. This approach is supported by Ecolab’s technological capabilities to demonstrate value to clients, although the company is still contending with rising commodity costs due to supply chain shifts.

While Ecolab is experiencing soft demand in several basic industries, it is making strides in areas like pest elimination and life sciences, which are showing positive momentum. The company is also committed to achieving a 20% operating margin by 2027, driven by innovation and efficiency improvements. Although digital growth is promising, it remains a smaller segment of the business. Consequently, the Hold rating reflects a balanced view of Ecolab’s potential and current market challenges, with a price target maintained at $260.

In another report released yesterday, Evercore ISI also maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $265.00 price target.

Based on the recent corporate insider activity of 123 insiders, corporate insider sentiment is negative on the stock. This means that over the past quarter there has been an increase of insiders selling their shares of ECL in relation to earlier this year.

The Japanese Kitchen Appliances Market was valued at USD 8.98 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 12.56 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 5.75%.

Market growth is primarily driven by increasing urbanization and the rise of nuclear households, boosting demand for compact, multifunctional appliances suited to limited living spaces. Consumers are increasingly embracing smart, energy-efficient kitchen solutions featuring IoT integration, automation, and sensor-based technology, enhancing convenience while lowering energy consumption.

Rising disposable income and higher living standards are encouraging investment in premium appliances with advanced capabilities. The trend toward healthier lifestyles is fueling demand for products like air fryers and steam ovens.

Additionally, Japan's aging population is influencing the market, with a growing preference for intuitive, safe-to-use appliances that support independent living. These factors, coupled with technological innovation and a strong focus on sustainability, are reshaping Japan's kitchen appliance sector and driving robust growth across both residential and commercial segments.

Key Market Drivers

Surging Disposable Income & Changing Lifestyles: The growth of disposable income and evolving consumer lifestyles are key forces accelerating the Japan kitchen appliances market. In 2024, the average monthly disposable income for multi-person working households in Japan rose to approximately USD 3.66 thousand - a 2.3% increase year-on-year in real terms. This financial improvement enables consumers to spend more on premium kitchen solutions that offer modern functionality and efficiency.

Urban living has intensified the need for time-saving appliances like smart refrigerators, automated cookers, and microwave ovens. In addition, as consumers adopt healthier eating habits, demand is increasing for appliances like steam ovens and air fryers that support nutritional cooking. The growing preference for connected appliances equipped with IoT also reflects the shift toward smart living. These lifestyle trends are reshaping kitchen spaces and driving innovation, as Japanese households seek convenience, health, and technology integration in their everyday cooking routines.

Key Market Challenges

High Market Saturation: The Japan kitchen appliances market is challenged by high saturation, which limits expansion opportunities and intensifies competition. The market is mature, with strong participation from both local and international players, resulting in intense price wars and narrow profit margins. Japanese consumers are brand-loyal and demand high-quality products, which makes it difficult for newer or smaller entrants to gain traction.

The market's saturation leads to slower sales volume growth and pressures companies to differentiate through innovation and advanced features. However, continuous innovation requires significant R&D investment - something smaller firms may struggle to sustain. Established companies benefit from well-developed supply chains and brand recognition, putting additional strain on emerging players. This competitive environment makes strategic innovation, differentiation, and targeting niche segments essential for sustained success in Japan's kitchen appliance industry.

Key Market Trends

Rising Government Support for Smart Homes: Government initiatives in Japan are playing a pivotal role in shaping the kitchen appliances market, especially through the promotion of smart homes.

Programs like the housing eco-point system incentivize the integration of energy-efficient and intelligent technologies into residential construction and renovation projects. Local governments also offer rebate schemes for energy-saving appliances, reinforcing the demand for eco-friendly solutions. These policies align with Japan's long-term sustainability goals and are encouraging both manufacturers and consumers to prioritize smart kitchen technologies. As a result, appliances equipped with connectivity features, energy optimization, and user-friendly automation are gaining traction.

Government-backed initiatives are not only accelerating adoption but also influencing the direction of product innovation across the kitchen appliance industry.

Highlights

Vietnam is actively seeking support from major American garment companies, including Gap Inc. and Levi Strauss & Co., to mitigate the impact of President Donald Trump's proposed 46 percent trade tariff.

Vietnam's Minister of Industry and Trade, Nguyen Hong Dien, emphasized the country's commitment to being a reliable partner in the global supply chain during meetings with leaders from the American Apparel and Footwear Association and major brands.

The United States was Vietnam's top export market, with exports reaching $57 billion in the first five months of 2025, a significant increase from $44 billion during the same period the previous year.

Vietnam has sought to enlist major US garment companies including Gap and Levi Strauss as it tries to head off President Donald Trump's threatened 46 percent trade tariff.

The country, a major producer of clothing and footwear for international brands, has the third-biggest trade surplus with the United States after China and Mexico, making it a target for Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff blitz in April.

Officials have been locked in talks with their US counterparts to avoid being hit, seeking support from American tech giants and signing agriculture deals with Washington to ease the problem.

On a visit to the United States, Vietnam's minister of industry and trade Nguyen Hong Dien on Monday met leaders from the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) and leading brands Gap, Levi Strauss, and Under Armour.

The United States was Vietnam's number one export market with $57 billion in the first five months of 2025 -- up from $44 billion over the same period a year ago.

Textiles and footwear were among the leading products sent to American clients.

A trade ministry statement posted online late Tuesday said Dien wanted to cement Vietnam's willingness ""to be a reliable partner in the global supply chain"".

""Cooperation with Vietnam will bring long-term strategic benefits and contribute to improving the trade balance in a fair, harmonious and sustainable direction between the two countries,"" he was quoted as saying.

Dien also met Jeffrey Perlman, the head of Warburg Pincus Investment Fund, the statement said.

When announcing his raft of levies in April, Trump claimed Vietnam charged the United States a 90 percent tariff, which was based on Hanoi's trade surplus of $123.5 billion last year.

His administration also appeared particularly angry about what it sees as the Asian nation's role in attempts to get around tariffs imposed on China.

Advt

But given Vietnam's vital role in global supply chains, many parties -- including US companies in the country -- have urged the White House to walk back the tariffs.

Vietnamese and US trade negotiators held their latest round of talks in Paris last week, and are scheduled to meet again in the next few days.

Hanoi last week signed several agreements worth up to $3 billion of agricultural products and other raw materials from the United States as it sought to rebalance their trading partnership.

Trump's real estate group also broke ground last month on a $1.5 billion luxury golf resort in Vietnam, while his son Eric has been scouting locations for a potential tower project in Ho Chi Minh City, the country's southern business hub.

As new data show 4 out of 5 U.S. adults don't feel confident in their knowledge of health insurance benefits, new digital tools use clear, conversational language to boost understanding and help customers get more out of their coverage

BLOOMFIELD, Conn., June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Cigna Healthcare, the health benefits division of The Cigna Group (CI), is introducing a series of new digital features to improve the customer experience during common health insurance interactions, such as checking benefits coverage, estimating costs and finding care. These enhancements are designed to provide a reliably simple experience for everyday needs and are an important step in delivering on the company's commitment to make health care easier for customers.

""We're committed to making our customers' experiences simpler, seamless and more reliable,"" said Heather Dlugolenski, chief strategy officer, Cigna Healthcare. ""That's why we're creating smarter, more connected digital experiences that anticipate our customers' needs while bringing clarity and compassion to everyday moments.""

The new digital features, which were developed with rigorous research and testing within a comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) governance framework, are being made available in a phased rollout through Cigna Healthcare's myCigna member portal. They include:

AI-Powered Virtual Assistant: More than a chatbot, this industry-first generative AI tool provides clear, conversational and personalized answers to common questions about benefits coverage, claims and care options. If additional assistance is needed, the virtual assistant seamlessly connects customers to a customer service advocate. Early results show that 2 out of 3 customers who had access to the virtual assistant used it proactively, and more than 4 out of 5 found it helpful.

Personalized Provider Matching: This proprietary matching tool gives customers a tailored list of in-network providers and care delivery methods based on their specific health care needs and preferences. The tool will be integrated soon with the AI Virtual Assistant to help customers quickly find relevant care.

Real-Time Cost Tracking: This redesigned tool provides a simple breakdown of deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, and integrated bill payments, helping customers track their costs in real time and estimate costs with providers and specialists before engaging.

Smart Claim Submission: This user-friendly feature enables customers to upload bills they receive from physicians and other providers, such as chiropractors or therapists. The tool reads the bill, auto-fills claim details for easy submission, and provides digital updates using plain language on claim statuses and decisions.

Plan Selection Support: Customers who get their health insurance through their employer can compare prices, search for providers, and estimate their potential health care costs when selecting their benefits plan. This helps customers make more informed plan decisions during the open enrollment period.

Early Access to myCigna for New Customers: Customers new to Cigna Healthcare and those with changes to their benefits plans can sign into the myCigna member portal before their plan effective date so they can better plan their health care needs in advance and add their digital ID card to their Apple or Google wallets or provider portals for less paperwork.

""Everyday moments in health care need to be easier,"" said Katya Andresen, chief digital and analytics officer at The Cigna Group. ""Customers need to be met where they are with experiences that are adapted to their unique needs. While there is still a lot of work to do to simplify health care, these enhancements are a significant step in our journey to transform the experience and put customers at the heart of it.""

Recent research by Cigna Healthcare reveals that only 1 in 5 U.S. adults feel confident in their ability to understand, evaluate and effectively use health care services. The report found that the more a person understands their health insurance, the more effectively they can navigate the health care ecosystem, leading to better health outcomes, fewer financial surprises and higher overall vitality. By offering intuitive, personalized digital tools that use clear, conversational language, Cigna Healthcare aims to help consumers get more value out of their health insurance benefits and navigate the healthcare ecosystem more effectively.

For customers with complex health needs, such as managing a chronic condition or navigating a serious diagnosis, Cigna Healthcare is expanding access to dedicated My Personal Champion advocates. The company is also investing in new centralized agent teams to help customers more quickly resolve administrative needs, including prior authorizations and post-care claims.

The Cigna Group's broader technology strategy has long aimed to transform and improve health care delivery to create a more personalized, seamless and connected health care experience that empowers customers to improve their overall health and vitality. The strategy's flexibility allows the company to adapt and lean into the changing needs and expectations of the millions of people it serves, such as delivering on the commitments it made earlier this year to meaningfully improve the customer experience.

However, 31% of survey respondents note their downtime costs had increased, while 49% say their downtime costs remained the same.
Just one in five survey respondents say their downtime costs decreased despite experiencing a drop in unplanned downtime.
What can organizations do to make the most of their maintenance time and decrease downtime costs?","Maintenance professionals have an incredibly important job: keeping production lines and facilities running, no matter what challenges are thrown at them.

But what do those challenges look like? And how can they be overcome?

MaintainX aims to find out. As part of its State of Industrial Maintenance report, the maintenance and asset management platform recently surveyed 1,320 professionals across the U.S. and Canada with the goal of understanding the obstacles they face in 2025 and beyond.

Cofounder Nick Haase, who recently discussed SOP generation on The Food Engineering Podcast, notes organizations want to move to a predictive maintenance approach, but that’s often easier said than done.

“They’re struggling to break free from firefighting,” Haase writes. “Preventive maintenance is a goal for most teams — 71% say it’s their primary strategy — but reality often falls short. Less than 35% actually spend most of their time on planned tasks. This isn’t laziness or lack of ambition. It’s because their best intentions keep colliding with challenges like aging equipment and talent shortages.”

Specifically, 13% of survey respondents note they spend 60% or more of their time conducting planned maintenance activities. Just over a fifth (22%) say they spend 41-60% of their time on planned maintenance, while 26% spend 21-40% of their time on scheduled maintenance. The majority of surveyed professionals — 32% — say they spend less than 21% of their time on planned maintenance.

Unplanned downtime is a major concern, but MaintainX has good news to report there: 74% of surveyed respondents reported stabilization or a decrease in unplanned downtime over the last year.

However, 31% of survey respondents note their downtime costs had increased, while 49% say their downtime costs remained the same. Just one in five survey respondents say their downtime costs decreased despite experiencing a drop in unplanned downtime. MaintainX points to three main drivers for increasing downtime costs: machine wear and tear, rising costs of parts and shipping, and labor costs.

What can organizations do to make the most of their maintenance time and decrease downtime costs? MaintainX recommends embracing artificial intelligence (AI). For example, AI can help with work order management and scheduling, maintenance cost tracking and optimization, and predicting equipment failures before they happen.

Organizations are already exploring the use of AI in their operations — 14% of survey respondents report evaluating AI options, 7% plan to implement it within the next 12 months and 12% are in pilot program testing. Meanwhile, some manufacturers have more experience with AI, as 15% use AI in specific areas, while 17% use it across multiple maintenance processes.

Those who utilize AI are experiencing benefits. Nearly 40% cite knowledge capture and sharing as the top advantage, but they also point to reduced unexpected equipment failures, improved maintenance scheduling, more efficient work order completion, improved safety compliance and making data-driven decisions as other benefits.

Certainly there are barriers to implementing AI — budget constraints, lack of technical expertise and cybersecurity concerns — but as organizations seek to optimize their maintenance operations, AI appears to be a critical option to consider.",https://www.foodengineeringmag.com/ext/resources/Issues/2025/01-January/From_the_editor_1170x658.png?height=635&t=1736948478&width=1200,N,,2025-06-12 22:30:09.584497

New Delhi: The Indian retail sector is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the rise of Agentic AI—a transformative force that moves far beyond basic automation to enable autonomous decision-making and intelligent goal execution. Once confined to experimental tech labs, this advanced form of artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a strategic imperative for forward-thinking retailers in India. Industry leaders are not only witnessing this evolution—they’re actively shaping it, with a focus on driving efficiency, hyper-personalisation, and measurable financial returns.

According to recent data by PwC, Generative AI (GenAI) could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to global GDP by 2030. Within that future, Agentic AI will play a pivotal role, where AI agents collaborate in real-time to automate complex tasks and enhance enterprise decision-making.

From Pilot to Practice: India’s Retailers Embrace Agentic AI

Retail experts across India agree: while Agentic AI is still in its early stages, its potential is vast.

“We’re seeing retailers and other firms build AI labs to explore Agentic AI, which blends human input, data, and IoT to offer real-time, smarter interactions,” said Sharmila Senthilraja of Capgemini in an earlier interaction with IndiaRetailing. “For instance, a consumer can ask an app for the best deals on vegetables, and the system delivers live promotions automatically. It also enhances supply chain and customer interactions, resulting in seamless, informed experiences.”

Several leading retail organisations have already moved beyond AI experimentation into robust deployment.

Vrushali Parab, Marketing Head (GM) at The Belgian Waffle Co., described their digital-first mindset, despite being an offline business: “We use tech across touchpoints—menu digitisation, kiosks, and CRM.”

Anisa Virji, Head of E-commerce at Regal Shoes, spoke of integrating AI in content creation, chatbot-driven customer support, and tools for intelligent customer engagement.

Anwer Alvi, Head – Brands.com at Bestseller, stressed the foundational role of consolidated data: “We’ve integrated 15 years of offline and online data into a unified data lake to enable hyper-personalised customer experiences.”

Rupendra Kumar Nigam, Head of IT at Spykar, echoed this sentiment, citing a “single platform, single data link” for managing all data operations across the business.

Retailers at the Forefront of Advanced AI

Among the more mature deployments is Shoppers Stop, where Shashank Katakwar, Deputy GM – AI, Data & Digital Transformation, laid out a robust roadmap:

“As one of India’s oldest multi-brand retailers, we’ve long leveraged AI, starting with our First Citizen loyalty program. We now operate with a unified data lake and live agentic AI tools in production.”

Their applications include:

AI-generated model shoots

Contextual fashion discovery using LLMs

Multilingual beauty advisors and stylists via chatbot pilots

These efforts directly aim to personalise shopping experiences and accelerate digital transformation.

At Baggit, Divya Gupta, Head of E-commerce, highlighted the cost-efficiency of GenAI: “Our summer campaign used AI-generated models in Rome and Egypt—without real shoots.” She envisions AI as a core operational tool, helping improve margins and reduce waste through smarter inventory management.

Driving Strategic Value: From Efficiency to Revenue Impact

Agentic AI isn’t just about innovation—it’s about outcomes.

Shashank Shetty, Regional Sales Director at Salesforce, emphasised the accessibility of modern AI: “AI is now usable by both business and tech users, thanks to natural language interfaces. The real driver is unified data—that’s what powers the AgentForce layer for enterprise value.”

Himanshu Rajpal, Regional Sales Leader at Salesforce, crystallised the business case, saying, “AI investments must link directly to incremental revenue—that’s where the value becomes undeniable.”

Retailers are making targeted investments to address pain points tied to profitability—inventory optimisation, automation, and productivity—all with tangible ROI goals.

Challenges on the Path: Compute, Security, and Trust

Despite momentum, hurdles remain. Rupendra Nigam cited rising computing costs and unresolved data security concerns: “We’re sharing sensitive data—pricing, supply chain, financials. If breached, the implications are massive, and accountability is still ambiguous.” Still, concerns over internal readiness and cybersecurity persist.

Shashank Katakwar reinforced cloud’s benefits: “With everything on the cloud, infra maintenance and scaling aren’t issues. We analysed a 10–15-minute call for under Rs 1—cost-effective and high on insight.”

AI in Action: Solutions Aligned to Retail Priorities

Indian retailers are laser-focused on high-impact AI applications:

Customer Discovery & Support: Anwer Alvipointed to smarter bots deeply integrated with systems to resolve queries and reduce return rates.

More than 8 out of 10 (86%) defence organisations recognise the need to integrate AI and gen AI in engineering and product development

Paris, June 12 2025 – The Capgemini Research Institute’s latest report, ‘The strategic edge: How digital continuity drives business outcomes in aerospace and defence,’ published today, finds that digital continuity[1] – the seamless integration of data and information across all stages of the product lifecycle and linked to the external partner ecosystem – is emerging as a critical enabler of business transformation in the aerospace and defence (A&D) sector. Over 80% of A&D leaders surveyed view digital continuity as a driver of business transformation and a route to gaining a competitive advantage. In 2024, A&D organisations on average allocated a significant 2.1% of their annual revenue to these initiatives, to ramp up production, accelerate development cycles, reduce operational costs, and stay agile amid global pressures. In the context of rising costs, supply chain instability, and geopolitical movement, investments in digital continuity are expected to increase to 3.4% by 2028.

“Digital continuity is a critical imperative for aerospace and defence organisations to thrive in today’s challenging and uncertain geopolitical environment. If it is embraced as a way of working, it will help organisations increase productivity and free up key resources from the waste created by disconnected systems and data. Ultimately, it enables operational excellence, reduces product development cycle times and fosters a collaborative culture, setting A&D players up for long-term success. Business leaders clearly recognise this and as a result have been ramping up their investments in these initiatives,” said Lee Annecchino, Global Industry Lead, Aerospace and Defence at Capgemini. “In order to leverage the full potential, A&D organisations must focus on building interoperability across systems, enabling robust data management and adopting a comprehensive change management strategy.”

Digital continuity helps A&D organisations to ramp up quickly, driving many business benefits

Nearly nine in 10 (86%) A&D executives agree that digital continuity is important to their organisations’ ramping-up strategies, and 77% believe that improving digital continuity will accelerate the process.

Around a third (34%) of A&D organisations have already reduced costs with 13% cost reduction on average because of digital continuity. Thirty percent of A&D organisations have already realised shortened time to market and 18% have accelerated product development cycle times because of digital continuity, making it a top priority for investment.

Defence organisations are better prepared to ramp up production

According to the survey, 44% of defence organisations are prepared to ramp up production compared to just over a third of civil aerospace organisations. The readiness of defence organisations to ramp up production can be driven by geopolitical uncertainty and technological and infrastructure investment, including a more flexible manufacturing execution system (MES), and a more resilient supply chain. For example, 65% of defence organisations agree that their supply chain is adaptable to quickly changing customer demands, while only 45% of civil aerospace organisations believe the same.

The report also finds that more than 8 out of 10 (86%) defence organisations recognise the need to integrate AI and generative AI in engineering and product development and over half (56%) to develop autonomous systems. However, less than half of the defence organisations are prepared to integrate AI (44%) and only 35% are prepared to develop autonomous systems.

In order to thrive, A&D organisations must continually evolve in terms of skills, processes, technologies, security methods, and compliance policies concludes the report.

Report Methodology

In March 2025, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a global survey to assess the maturity of digital continuity in aerospace and defence (A&D) organisations and the benefits achieved. The survey included 179 A&D organisations across 16 countries in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East. Over half (51%) of the participating organisations are headquartered in the United States. The survey sample also included 28 public sector or government organisations. All surveyed organisations have annual revenues exceeding $500 million, with the majority (56%) reporting revenues greater than $1 billion.

Hiring a broker is optional, but the increasing complexities of U.S. tariffs and customs regulations are leading more importers to shell out the cash.
Amazon, meanwhile, had at least 10 U.S. customs brokerage jobs listed on its careers website.
United Parcel Service UPS raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin.
FedEx’s logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by 4% in January, according to a company spokesperson.","U.S. importers are increasingly relying on customs brokers to keep up with President Donald Trump’s ever-changing trade policies. But booming demand for help in processing foreign goods has made these services more expensive, adding another cost to the tariff burden, industry players told Reuters.

Customs brokerages, until recently an anonymous branch of the import ecosystem, handle the paperwork needed to process shipments and calculate tariff bills. Mom-and-pop brokers interviewed by Reuters say they are raising fees, while major logistics firms like Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx FDX and Germany-based DHL DHL are also adding staff to their customs compliance teams.

Market research firms ballpark customs brokering as a roughly $5 billion industry in the United States. Hiring a broker is optional, but the increasing complexities of U.S. tariffs and customs regulations are leading more importers to shell out the cash.

Independent brokers like Laredo, Texas-based JD Gonzalez are fielding dozens of questions daily from concerned clients struggling to understand what they may owe to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and whether to go ahead with shipments or hold off.

Brokers are also spending more time and labor on customs forms than ever, and have in some cases implemented new IT systems.

“With all the new information we have to process, some of the automation we’ve used has been thrown out, so there’s more work to do,” said JD Gonzalez, who is also president of custom brokerage trade group NCBFAA.

The trend is part of a broader wave of corporate efforts to bolster trade compliance operations. Major companies, from Nike NKE to Amazon AMZN to Lowe’s LOW, had published job postings as of Wednesday for trade and customs professionals.

Nike was seeking a “lead” for trade and customs, who would “play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our trade compliance framework,” according to the post on Nike’s careers website. Amazon, meanwhile, had at least 10 U.S. customs brokerage jobs listed on its careers website. Lowe’s had three.

Nike, Amazon and Lowe’s did not respond to requests for comment.

HIGHER FEES

Independent brokers often base their fees on the number of codes they must enter to classify the contents of a given shipment. Known as harmonized tariff schedule codes, these line items help border officials distinguish car parts from children’s toys, and determine proper tariff rates.

Prior to Trump’s frenetic tariff policies, fees ranged from around $4 to $7 per code. But Gonzalez said the extra costs brokers have incurred as they ramp up systems to handle the tariff changes have led some to increase fees by $1 to $5 per code.

Gonzalez said he has raised fees “nominally,” while Steve Bozicevic, CEO of A&A Customs Brokers headquartered in Seattle and Vancouver, said his company added $3 per product type being imported into the U.S. because of merchandise facing “tariff stacking,” a phrase used when an item faces multiple tariffs.

“We raised the rates for the U.S. because of the new and added complexity,” Bozicevic said. The company has not raised rates for imports into Canada because there’s “no new complexity,” he said.

United Parcel Service UPS raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin. The move was part of general rate increases and unrelated to changes in tariffs, a UPS spokesperson told Reuters. FedEx’s logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by 4% in January, according to a company spokesperson.

These bigger logistics companies, which include brokerage services in their broader shipping offerings, are also beefing up staff. DHL has upped headcount on its U.S. customs entry team by 30% since February, according to a spokesperson for the company’s DHL Express shipping unit.

FedEx had more than 40 open job postings on its customs and trade teams as of Tuesday, mainly based in the U.S., according to its LinkedIn jobs page. UPS had 10 similar U.S. positions open, according to its jobs website.

FedEx is “adjusting our network to meet demand” in an evolving tariff landscape, which “includes hiring additional customs brokerage roles,” the spokesperson said. UPS declined to comment on the job postings.

Historically, tariff changes have been less frequent, say brokers, trade lawyers and other trade professionals, and they have come with weeks of lead time, allowing brokers to prepare for the change and provide logistical feedback to CBP.

Compare that to last week’s doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%, which Trump announced abruptly, forcing the U.S. customs department to quickly publish official guidance just hours ahead of a midnight change.

“Many brokers clear shipments ahead of time, so then you have to come back and retroactively redo it and fix it,” said Miami-based customs broker Ralph De La Rosa, whose company, Imperial Freight Brokers, was founded by his father 54 years ago.

Even brokers who have not raised fees said their services have become inherently more expensive as the number of HTS codes has spiked.

Importers slowed shipments into the United States after Trump’s massive tariff announcement on April 2, after having frontloaded purchases earlier in the year to get ahead of an expected rise in duties.

Imports of consumer goods, which include cell phones and other household items, decreased $68.9 billion to $277.9 billion in April from a month before, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Trump announced additional tariffs on steel and aluminum in June and in May threatened to impose 50% tariffs on the European Union.",,N,,2025-06-12 22:40:46.869236

Les leaders de l’aéronautique et de la défense font de la continuité numérique une priorité pour faire face aux évolutions du secteur

77 % des dirigeants du secteur estiment que l’amélioration de la continuité numérique accélérera la montée en cadence de la production, avec une réduction moyenne de 13 % du délai de mise sur le marché.

Plus de 8 organisations du secteur de la défense sur 10 (86 %) reconnaissent la nécessité d’intégrer l’Intelligence Artificielle et l’IA générative dans l’ingénierie et le développement produit.

Paris, le 12 juin 2025 – Le dernier rapport du Capgemini Research Institute, intitulé ‘The strategic edge: How digital continuity drives business outcomes in aerospace and defense‘ (L’avantage stratégique : comment la continuité numérique génère des retombées économiques dans l’aéronautique et la défense), révèle que la continuité numérique1 - c’est-à-dire l’intégration fluide des données et des informations tout au long du cycle de vie du produit, y compris avec l’écosystème de partenaires externes - devient un levier essentiel de transformation pour le secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense (A&D). Plus de 80 % des dirigeants interrogés dans cette industrie considèrent la continuité numérique comme un moteur de transformation et un moyen d’obtenir un avantage concurrentiel. En 2024, les organisations de l’industrie de l’aéronautique et de la défense ont en moyenne consacré la part significative de 2,1 % de leur chiffre d’affaires annuel à ces initiatives, afin d’augmenter leur capacité de production, d’accélérer les cycles de développement, de réduire les coûts opérationnels et de rester agiles face aux pressions mondiales. Dans un contexte de hausse des coûts, d’instabilité des chaînes d’approvisionnement et de tensions géopolitiques, ces investissements devraient atteindre 3,4 % d’ici 2028.

« La continuité numérique est une nécessité stratégique pour les organisations de l’aéronautique et de la défense qui souhaitent prospérer dans l’environnement géopolitique actuel, complexe et incertain. Si elle est adoptée comme mode de fonctionnement, elle permet d’accroître la productivité et de préserver des ressources clés des pertes engendrées par des systèmes et des données déconnectés. Enfin, elle favorise l’excellence opérationnelle, réduit les délais de développement des produits et encourage une culture de collaboration, préparant ainsi les acteurs du secteur à une réussite durable. Les dirigeants en sont pleinement conscients et intensifient leurs investissements en ce sens, déclare Lee Annecchino, à la tête du secteur Aéronautique et Défense chez Capgemini. Pour exploiter pleinement ce potentiel, les organisations doivent se concentrer sur l’interopérabilité des systèmes, une gestion robuste des données et une stratégie globale de conduite du changement. »

La continuité numérique permet aux organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense de monter en puissance rapidement, avec de nombreuses retombées économiques à la clé

Près de neuf dirigeants sur dix (86 %) du secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense estiment que la continuité numérique est essentielle à leur stratégie de montée en puissance, et 77 % pensent que son amélioration accélérera ce processus.

Environ un tiers (34 %) des organisations du secteur ont déjà réduit leurs coûts grâce à la continuité numérique, avec une baisse moyenne de 13 %. 30 % ont raccourci leur délai de mise sur le marché et 18 % ont accéléré leurs cycles de développement produit, faisant de la continuité numérique une priorité d’investissement.

Les organisations du secteur de la défense sont mieux préparées à augmenter leur production

44 % des organisations du secteur de défense se déclarent prêtes à augmenter leur production, contre un peu plus d’un tiers des organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique civile. Cette avance de l’industrie de la défense s’explique par l’incertitude géopolitique et les investissements technologiques et infrastructurels, notamment dans des systèmes d’exécution de la fabrication (Manufacturing Execution System ou MES) plus flexibles et des chaînes d’approvisionnement plus résilientes. Par exemple, 65 % des organisations du secteur de la défense estiment que leur chaîne d’approvisionnement peut s’adapter à l’évolution des demandes des clients, contre seulement 45 % dans l’aéronautique civile.

Par ailleurs, plus de 8 organisations du secteur de la défense sur 10 (86 %) reconnaissent le besoin d’intégrer l’IA et l’IA générative dans l’ingénierie et le développement produit, et plus de la moitié (56 %) dans le développement de systèmes autonomes. Toutefois, moins de la moitié sont prêtes à intégrer l’IA (44 %) et seulement 35 % à développer des systèmes autonomes.

Pour prospérer, les organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique et la défense doivent sans cesse évoluer en matière de compétences, de processus, de technologies, de méthodes de sécurité et de politiques de conformité, conclut le rapport.

Méthodologie du rapport

En mars 2025, le Capgemini Research Institute a conduit une étude à l’échelle mondiale afin d’évaluer le niveau de maturité en matière de continuité numérique dans les organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense (A&D), ainsi que les bénéfices obtenus. L’étude a porté sur 179 organisations du secteur de l’aéronautique et de la défense réparties dans 16 pays d’Asie-Pacifique, d’Europe, des Amériques et du Moyen-Orient. Le siège social de plus de la moitié (51 %) des organisations répondantes est aux États-Unis. L’échantillon comprenait également 28 organisations du secteur public ou gouvernemental. Toutes les organisations interrogées réalisent un chiffre d’affaires annuel supérieur à 500 millions de dollars, et la majorité d’entre elles (56 %) déclarent un chiffre d’affaires supérieur à un milliard de dollars.

Aerospace and defense leaders are prioritizing digital continuity to

tackle industry disruption

77% of aerospace and defense leaders believe improving digital continuity will accelerate production ramp-up as it drives shorter time to market, with a 13% reduction on average

More than 8 out of 10 (86%) defense organizations recognize the need to integrate AI and gen AI in engineering and product development

Paris, June 12 2025 – The Capgemini Research Institute’s latest report, ‘The strategic edge: How digital continuity drives business outcomes in aerospace and defense,’ published today, finds that digital continuity1 - the seamless integration of data and information across all stages of the product lifecycle and linked to the external partner ecosystem - is emerging as a critical enabler of business transformation in the aerospace and defense (A&D) sector. Over 80% of A&D leaders surveyed view digital continuity as a driver of business transformation and a route to gaining a competitive advantage. In 2024, A&D organizations on average allocated a significant 2.1% of their annual revenue to these initiatives, to ramp up production, accelerate development cycles, reduce operational costs, and stay agile amid global pressures. In the context of rising costs, supply chain instability, and geopolitical movement, investments in digital continuity are expected to increase to 3.4% by 2028.

“Digital continuity is a critical imperative for aerospace and defense organizations to thrive in today’s challenging and uncertain geopolitical environment. If it is embraced as a way of working, it will help organizations increase productivity and free up key resources from the waste created by disconnected systems and data. Ultimately, it enables operational excellence, reduces product development cycle times and fosters a collaborative culture, setting A&D players up for long-term success. Business leaders clearly recognize this and as a result have been ramping up their investments in these initiatives,” said Lee Annecchino, Global Industry Lead, Aerospace and Defense at Capgemini. “In order to leverage the full potential, A&D organizations must focus on building interoperability across systems, enabling robust data management and adopting a comprehensive change management strategy.”

Digital continuity helps A&D organizations to ramp up quickly, driving many business benefits

Nearly nine in 10 (86%) A&D executives agree that digital continuity is important to their organizations’ ramping-up strategies, and 77% believe that improving digital continuity will accelerate the process.

Around a third (34%) of A&D organizations have already reduced costs with 13% cost reduction on average because of digital continuity. Thirty percent of A&D organizations have already realized shortened time to market and 18% have accelerated product development cycle times because of digital continuity, making it a top priority for investment.

Defense organizations are better prepared to ramp up production

According to the survey, 44% of defense organizations are prepared to ramp up production compared to just over a third of civil aerospace organizations. The readiness of defense organizations to ramp up production can be driven by geopolitical uncertainty and technological and infrastructure investment, including a more flexible manufacturing execution system (MES), and a more resilient supply chain. For example, 65% of defense organizations agree that their supply chain is adaptable to quickly changing customer demands, while only 45% of civil aerospace organizations believe the same.

The report also finds that more than 8 out of 10 (86%) defense organizations recognize the need to integrate AI and generative AI in engineering and product development and over half (56%) to develop autonomous systems. However, less than half of the defense organizations are prepared to integrate AI (44%) and only 35% are prepared to develop autonomous systems.

In order to thrive, A&D organizations must continually evolve in terms of skills, processes, technologies, security methods, and compliance policies concludes the report.

Report Methodology

In March 2025, the Capgemini Research Institute conducted a global survey to assess the maturity of digital continuity in aerospace and defense (A&D) organizations and the benefits achieved. The survey included 179 A&D organizations across 16 countries in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East. Over half (51%) of the participating organizations are headquartered in the United States. The survey sample also included 28 public sector or government organizations. All surveyed organizations have annual revenues exceeding $500 million, with the majority (56%) reporting revenues greater than $1 billion.

The group aims to cut CO₂ emissions by 46% by 2030 through a series of concrete actions, like, for instance, developing products that follow a circular approach to reduce water use, chemical treatments, and microplastic dispersion. Along with it, it aims to protect biodiversity and enhance corporate social responsibility through stringent supply chain oversight.

The strategy it will enact will be based on measurable data and integrated actions along its entire value chain.

“As a global company operating across five continents, we feel the responsibility to lead the transition to a more sustainable future,” stated Gianluca Tanzi, chairman and CEO, Chargeurs PCC.

“Our mission is to act as pioneers and game changers in the transformation of the textile industry. We want to continue innovating, providing our customers with solutions that merge excellence and awareness. This is why we are pursuing a series of real and concrete commitments that will involve both our company and our supply chain, addressing environmental concerns, product innovation, and social responsibility,” he added.

To reduce its CO₂ emissions, they have already started taking some initiatives. At the historic Lainière de Picardie site in Péronne, they have restructured operations for greater efficiency, replacing steam systems with hot water, and installing advanced machinery. These changes led to cut 11% of its emissions in 2024 alone. In parallel, since December 2024, the company has engaged its suppliers to map emissions.

The group has also started committing itself to the “Local for Local” model. This approach reflects a long-term vision of responsible, regionally rooted growth. For this, it will develop projects, source materials, and work with suppliers directly within each region to support local economies and reduce environmental impact while building a more agile and transparent supply chain.

Chargeurs PCC is also committed to continuing to advance its sustainable product range. Its Sustainable 360 collection is expanding, offering certified products made from natural, bio-based, and recycled fibers. These materials are designed to reduce water use, chemical treatments, waste, and microplastic dispersion. The company has also confirmed its ongoing efforts to reduce microplastic pollution throughout its product lifecycle.

Recent innovations include some new 100% monomaterial polyester interlinings, enabling easier recycling, and the “Zero Dye Water” interlining range, a selection of lining fabrics dyed without the use of water already available in 19 color variants in France.

This process significantly preserves water and aligns itself with broader environmental goals. In 2024, the company also carried out a water risk assessment at all its production sites using the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct tool, identifying priority areas for further action.

The company is also focused on increasing transparency throughout its supply chain. By 2024, 80% of its suppliers had undergone SMETA audits, with plans underway to extend assessments across the entire chain. It also provides its customers with Transaction Certificates (TCs), ensuring raw material traceability and production integrity.

Chargeurs has also committed to recognizing and avoiding the use of components of the Restricted Substances List (RSL). Its R&D department is developing an internal blacklist of unsustainable components. This voluntary measure that currently has found out that 60% of its products and 90% of it uses substances are already.

The company registered a turnover of €202.8 million in 2024, up five percent on the previous year. Its top three markets are Asia, France, and Italy, with The US brands as the number one market benefiting from manufacturing in Asia.

The company is based in France and boasts a history of over 150 years. It operates through ten production sites, 20 test laboratories, 40 offices and distribution centers, and more than 1,000 employees worldwide.

The company serves more than 7,000 customers in 90 countries on all continents. It also owns the Shirting Division, which offers the excellence of Swiss traditional shirting fabrics.

It is part of Compagnie Chargeurs Invest, a diversified international holding company listed on Euronext Paris.

ID39,UPS,2025-06-12 02:29:50+00:00,Baird Maritime / Work Boat World,"FEATURE | US importers turn to brokers to navigate tariffs, at a cost - Baird Maritime",Not Available,,,,,https://www.bairdmaritime.com/shipping/feature-us-importers-turn-to-brokers-to-navigate-tariffs-at-a-cost,"US importers are increasingly relying on customs brokers to keep up with new trade policies.
Prior to the imposition of tariffs, fees ranged from around $4 to $7 per code.
United Parcel Service raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin.
FedEx's logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by four per cent in January, according to a company spokesperson.
Even brokers who have not raised fees said their services have become inherently more expensive as the number of HTS codes has spiked.","US importers are increasingly relying on customs brokers to keep up with new trade policies. But booming demand for help in processing foreign goods has made these services more expensive, adding another cost to the tariff burden, industry players told Reuters.

Customs brokerages, until recently an anonymous branch of the import ecosystem, handle the paperwork needed to process shipments and calculate tariff bills. Mom-and-pop brokers interviewed by Reuters say they are raising fees, while major logistics firms like Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx and Germany-based DHL are also adding staff to their customs compliance teams.

Market research firms ballpark customs brokering as a roughly $5 billion industry in the United States. Hiring a broker is optional, but the increasing complexities of US tariffs and customs regulations are leading more importers to shell out the cash.

Independent brokers like Laredo, Texas-based JD Gonzalez are fielding dozens of questions daily from concerned clients struggling to understand what they may owe to US Customs and Border Protection, and whether to go ahead with shipments or hold off.

Brokers are also spending more time and labor on customs forms than ever, and have in some cases implemented new IT systems.

“With all the new information we have to process, some of the automation we've used has been thrown out, so there’s more work to do,” said JD Gonzalez, who is also president of custom brokerage trade group NCBFAA.

The trend is part of a broader wave of corporate efforts to bolster trade compliance operations. Major companies, from Nike to Amazon to Lowe’s, had published job postings as of Wednesday for trade and customs professionals.

Nike was seeking a “lead” for trade and customs, who would “play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our trade compliance framework,” according to the post on Nike’s careers website. Amazon, meanwhile, had at least 10 US customs brokerage jobs listed on its careers website. Lowe's had three.

Nike, Amazon and Lowe’s did not respond to requests for comment.

Higher fees

Independent brokers often base their fees on the number of codes they must enter to classify the contents of a given shipment. Known as harmonized tariff schedule codes, these line items help border officials distinguish car parts from children's toys, and determine proper tariff rates.

Prior to the imposition of tariffs, fees ranged from around $4 to $7 per code. But Gonzalez said the extra costs brokers have incurred as they ramp up systems to handle the tariff changes have led some to increase fees by $1 to $5 per code.

Gonzalez said he has raised fees “nominally,” while Steve Bozicevic, CEO of AA Customs Brokers headquartered in Seattle and Vancouver, said his company added $3 per product type being imported into the US because of merchandise facing ""tariff stacking,"" a phrase used when an item faces multiple tariffs.

""We raised the rates for the US because of the new and added complexity,"" Bozicevic said. The company has not raised rates for imports into Canada because there's ""no new complexity,"" he said.

United Parcel Service raised brokerage rates in December between $3.75 and $50 per import entry, depending on the country of origin. The move was part of general rate increases and unrelated to changes in tariffs, a UPS spokesperson told Reuters. FedEx's logistics arm increased its base customs brokerage rates by four per cent in January, according to a company spokesperson.

These bigger logistics companies, which include brokerage services in their broader shipping offerings, are also beefing up staff. DHL has upped headcount on its US customs entry team by 30 per cent since February, according to a spokesperson for the company’s DHL Express shipping unit.

FedEx had more than 40 open job postings on its customs and trade teams as of Tuesday, mainly based in the US, according to its LinkedIn jobs page. UPS had 10 similar US positions open, according to its jobs website.

FedEx is, ""adjusting our network to meet demand,"" in an evolving tariff landscape, which, ""includes hiring additional customs brokerage roles,"" the spokesperson said. UPS declined to comment on the job postings.

Historically, tariff changes have been less frequent, say brokers, trade lawyers and other trade professionals, and they have come with weeks of lead time, allowing brokers to prepare for the change and provide logistical feedback to CBP.

""Many brokers clear shipments ahead of time, so then you have to come back and retroactively redo it and fix it,"" said Miami-based customs broker Ralph De La Rosa, whose company, Imperial Freight Brokers, was founded by his father 54 years ago.

Even brokers who have not raised fees said their services have become inherently more expensive as the number of HTS codes has spiked.

Importers slowed shipments into the United States after tariffs were announced on April 2, after having frontloaded purchases earlier in the year to get ahead of an expected rise in duties.

Imports of consumer goods, which include cell phones and other household items, decreased $68.9 billion to $277.9 billion in April from a month before, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.

This potential strategic realignment would aim to position Veranda to create distinct verticals which are education powerhouses—each poised for scalable, sustainable, and stakeholder-driven growth.
We are confident in the continued growth and excellence of each one of our key verticals, the commerce vertical being our largest by revenue and profitability,” said Mr. Suresh Kalpathi, Executive Director and Chairman, Veranda Learning Solutions.
### About Veranda Learning Solutions","Veranda Learning Solutions has grown leaps and bounds through organic and inorganic route over the last few years. It has now initiated a major restructuring exercise under its Veranda 2.0 vision—primarily aimed at unlocking long-term value, enabling focused growth, and sharpening operational agility in the rapidly evolving education sector by carefully studying the synergies between its various businesses and unbundling / re-bundling operations of its 4 key verticals namely, academic, commerce, government test prep and vocational training.

A sub-committee of the Board, primarily consisting of independent directors, has been set up by the Board to study the above with the help of independent consultants and make appropriate recommendations to the Board including merger/demerger of its key verticals.

Veranda’s flagship commerce education brands—JK Shah Classes, BB Virtuals, Navkar Digital Institute, Tapasya College of Commerce, and Logic School of Management have built a formidable presence in the test preparation space for CA, CS, CMA, and ACCA, with over 2000 CA rankers since 2001 and a growing roster of All-India top performers. This vertical, which is led by Prof. J.K. Shah, Founder of JK Shah Classes, would play a critical role in helping drive growth in the years ahead.

The proposed QIP for which the enabling resolution has been approved by the members in the EGM is expected to help provide liquidity, fast track growth, and to ensure that critical business verticals are made debt-free.

Commerce Education: A High-Growth Sector

Veranda 2.0 vision comes amid India’s emergence as a global hub for finance and accounting talent. With over 1,580 Global Capability Centres and 4.32 million B.Com enrolments annually, the demand for certified commerce professionals is rapidly increasing. The company’s commerce education vertical is expected to grow in line with sectoral growth but faster through consolidation of market share from local/regional players driven by Veranda’s preeminent position as the leader in this segment. It is projected to grow revenue from ₹281 crore (pro forma) achieved in FY25 to over ₹1,000 crore by FY30. Student enrolments are also expected to more than double from the present 4.01 lakh in FY25 to over 8 lakhs during the same period.

Given the scope for cross selling across brands, operational efficiencies achieved through economy of scale, offering value-added products across the entire commerce education spectrum, and by expanding the Lifetime Value of each student, the company expects to increase margins from the current 36% in FY25 to over 50% by FY30.

This potential strategic realignment would aim to position Veranda to create distinct verticals which are education powerhouses—each poised for scalable, sustainable, and stakeholder-driven growth.

“The proposed restructuring would be a strategic step toward focused execution and value creation. We are confident in the continued growth and excellence of each one of our key verticals, the commerce vertical being our largest by revenue and profitability,” said Mr. Suresh Kalpathi, Executive Director and Chairman, Veranda Learning Solutions.

The aforementioned eggs were distributed to Walmart, Safeway, chains owned by Kroger and various other independent and chain supermarkets.

Hilmar, California’s August Egg Company, a division of Gemperle Enterprises, produced the eggs and issued the recall Friday.

“August Egg Company is not selling fresh shell eggs at this time,” the company-written, FDA-posted recall notice said. “Our firm has voluntarily been diverting eggs to an egg-breaking plant for over 30 days, which pasteurizes the eggs and kills any potential foodborne pathogens.”

What’s up with the salmonella outbreak?

Saturday’s outbreak update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 79 people have been sickened in this outbreak with 21 hospitalizations. Of those 79, 63 are in California. The remaining 16 break down as Nevada and Washington (four each); Arizona, three; Nebraska and New Jersey (two each); and Kentucky, one.

Salmonella outbreaks tend to be very undercounted because most people recover without medical attention.

What is salmonella?

The CDC estimates about 1.35 million people in the United States will get salmonella each year. Of that number, 26,400 will be hospitalized, usually driven to the hospital by bloody diarrhea, and 420 will die.

Usually, salmonella just means a few days of diarrhea, vomiting, fever and stomachaches.

Specifically, they should pay attention to three structural dynamics that are altering the global landscape: capital flows, demographic shifts, and political ideology, which are ushering in a more fragmented and siloed world.

Changes to capital flows are driven largely by regulatory requirements (such as the US ban on investments in China) and investors’ pursuit of new opportunities for higher returns across sectors and regions. The United States currently represents nearly 70% of stock-market capitalisation worldwide, attracting more than 70% of flows into the $13 trillion global market for private investments, which include equity and credit. This is true despite the recent sell-off. The US stock market is where investors can generate the most attractive returns, because the US is a global innovation leader with broad, liquid, and deep capital markets.

But global debt has reached 237% of world GDP, raising concerns about who owns outstanding liabilities and the extent to which there is hidden leverage in the global financial system. The US government alone owes $36tn (or 124% of GDP) – a large proportion of which is held by China, with which relations are strained.

Moreover, hidden leverage and the shadow banking sector’s debts could become a problem. According to S&P Global, shadow banks held $63tn in financial assets at the end of 2022 – representing 78% of global GDP. And further analysis has also shown that in 2024, shadow banking accounted for 70% of US mortgage origination and leveraged lending. Investors and business leaders will need to ask themselves who holds what debt, and where debt obligations and major pools of financial leverage may lie.

The second big worry concerns demographics. The global population continues to grow at a rapid clip, with the United Nations forecasting that there will 11.2bn people by 2100, up from 8.1bn now. Already, almost 90% of the world’s population lives in poorer emerging markets, and economically poorer regions – such as Africa, India, and the Middle East – are projected to experience population growth at or above the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. Thus, these regions will continue to skew younger. Across Africa, 50-60% of the population is below the age of 25, compared to only 20% across the OECD.

Meanwhile, other countries are ageing rapidly and registering lower birth rates, with forecasts for Europe and China pointing to marked population declines. According to Eurostat, the European Union’s population is projected to peak at 453.3mn in 2026, before gradually decreasing to 419.5mn by 2100. And UN data suggest that China’s population will fall below 800mn by 2100, from 1.4bn now.

Such trends have far-reaching implications for global demand and production across a wide array of commodities such as foodstuffs and energy. For example, India, with its large, poorer population, is still heavily dependent on coal and fossil fuels, as compared to renewables.

Demographic changes will also alter financial portfolios as ageing populations switch from being capitalists (willing to take on risk) to rentiers (desiring stable, predictable fixed incomes). But markets will also have to calibrate for unprecedented intergenerational wealth transfers from baby boomers to millennials. Cerulli Associates estimates that this could amount to $84tn by 2045.

Finally, the ideological splits across countries and regions must be factored in. The breakdown of multilateralism and the fragmentation of trade, capital flows, migration, and ideas are all being priced in, and policymakers and business leaders will have to keep these trends in mind. America’s largest multinationals still generate more than half of their revenues outside the US. But they now need to consider what strained US alliances and traditional trading relationships will mean for their businesses.

For business more broadly, deglobalisation has forced a shift toward more centralised procurement, hiring, and trade in goods and services. It is also jeopardising carry trades (borrowing cheaply in New York and London to invest in higher-yielding regions) and making it harder to repatriate profits.

In the near term, the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations could affect salaries and fuel higher inflation in consumer goods, wages, and prices across sectors. Higher inflation, moreover, will likely drive up the cost of capital, which could suppress business investment. And over the long term, deglobalisation and technological advances – such as AI and quantum computing – will further entrench today’s ideological splits.

Geopolitical fissures have already raised big political questions. There is a tug of war between state capitalism and market capitalism, and over the reconfiguration of alliances and country groupings. New blocs such as the Brics+ are vying for global influence and looking to circumvent traditional multilateral institutions. The Brics+ countries already represent 45% of the world’s population and 35% of its GDP, and they are playing a growing role in the pricing and trade of many internationally traded goods and commodities. Such developments are making it harder for countries to achieve global alignment; even previously celebrated efforts like the United Nations Climate Change Conferences have been hobbled.

As global growth slows, trade, finance, religion, energy, AI, and immigration are all being weaponised, leading to much greater complexity that will make it harder to anticipate policy outcomes. As a practical matter, added complexity and reduced visibility will likely shorten the time horizons for crucial decisions about allocating capital and human resources.

Rather than looking five years ahead – typically assumed to be the length of an economic or business cycle – investors, business leaders, and policymakers may need to think more in terms of the next 18 months. Amid so much volatility, decision-makers will have to focus on adaptability. No one can afford to commit to long-term strategies based on regulatory, geopolitical, or economic conditions that might change overnight. — Project Syndicate

Express Scripts echoed these comments.
However, these tactics are already prohibited in current Arkansas law, Express Scripts argued.
CVS and Express Scripts argue that this law violates the constitution in several ways.
For Express Scripts, the company doesn’t operate brick & mortar pharmacies in Arkansas, but it does have 25 non-resident pharmacy licenses in Arkansas that would be affected by the law.","There have been several recent efforts to crack down on pharmacy benefit managers, from bills in Congress (Opens in a new window) to an investigation (Opens in a new window) by the Federal Trade Commission.

But the state of Arkansas has been the one to actually take definitive action.

In April, Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed legislation (Opens in a new window) that states that starting January 1, 2026, no PBMs can own and operate pharmacies in the state. PBMs have increasingly (Opens in a new window) bought up pharmacies in recent years, which allows them to increase drug prices and put competitors out of business, the governor’s office stated in the announcement.

The law was likely intended to check the influence of the three largest PBMs — CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and Optum Rx — that cumulatively process 80% of all prescriptions in the U.S. But it should come as no surprise that some of the PBMs are fighting back. Last week, CVS Caremark and Express Scripts filed separate lawsuits challenging the law, arguing that it is unconstitutional, will force pharmacies to close, eliminate hundreds of jobs and actually increase costs.

“With Act 624 signed into law, the Arkansas legislature and governor are forcing 23 community pharmacies to close by January 1, 2026, including some of the very few that are open 24 hours; fire more than 500 local healthcare workers; erode access to specialized pharmacy care for the 10,000 Arkansas patients with serious conditions who rely on additional support; and increase the cost of Arkansas health benefits by millions of dollars each year,” argued Amy Thibault, executive director of corporate communications at CVS Health, in an email.

Express Scripts echoed these comments.

“If this law takes effect in January, hundreds of thousands of Arkansans will be left scrambling to navigate the forced closure of pharmacies and finding new ways to get their medicines and critical clinical support,” said Susan Peppers, RPh, vice president of pharmacy practice at Evernorth Health Services, in a statement.

The decision to sue is just out of fear that they will lose marketshare, said a Sanders spokesperson.

“Governor Sanders is proud that Arkansas is the first state in the nation to hold PBMs accountable for their anticompetitive practices,” Sam Dubke, Sanders’ communications director, told MedCity News in an email. “These big drug middlemen are only attacking Arkansas in the courts because they’re worried other states will join Governor Sanders in fighting for patient access and affordable prescriptions.”

The lawsuits

In their separate lawsuits against Act 624, CVS Health and Express Scripts both argue that the new law is intended to protect in-state pharmacy businesses, which they argue charge higher prices, while punishing out-of-state competitors.

“Act 624’s text, context, and legislative history make abundantly clear that the statute’s purpose and effect is to protect local pharmacies domiciled in Arkansas from out-of-state competition, and to do so by punishing specific out-of-state competitors,” according to Express Scripts’ complaint (Opens in a new window).

The company noted that the purpose of Act 624 is to eliminate certain anticompetitive business tactics. However, these tactics are already prohibited in current Arkansas law, Express Scripts argued. It gave the example of one statute that prohibits PBMs from reimbursing a pharmacy or pharmacist in the state less than what it reimburses an affiliate for the same services.

CVS also noted the same in its complaint (Opens in a new window), and added that it actually reimburses non-affiliated pharmacies at a higher rate than its own pharmacies.

In addition, CVS argued that the law unfairly exempts Walmart, one of Arkansas’ largest employers, which the company said “effectively operates PBM-affiliated pharmacies.” The original draft of the bill would have applied to Walmart, but it “almost died” in committee because of this, the complaint stated. The complaint noted that one senator said he couldn’t vote for the original bill because it would have prevented Walmart from having pharmacies. But the bill’s “architects devised a fix,” CVS charged.

“Notwithstanding the legislature’s putative concern that PBMs act as ‘fox[es] guarding the henhouse’ when they serve as ‘a price setter and price taker,’ HB 1150 was amended to include an exemption for PBM-affiliated pharmacies if the PBM serves only the pharmacy’s own employee benefit plan,” CVS argued in its complaint. “That exemption covers Walmart. So while Walmart could continue to operate its pharmacies, one of its biggest out-of-state competitors—CVS—would be forced to leave Arkansas altogether.”

It’s important to note that Walmart is not a PBM. However, the company provides PBM services, according to CVS. The CVS spokesperson pointed this MedCity News reporter to an article that announced that the Purchaser Business Group on Health, an employer coalition that includes Walmart, launched (Opens in a new window) a firm called EmsanaRx in 2021 that provides PBM services for employers.

CVS noted in the complaint that Walmart has announced plans to expand its pharmacy offerings in Arkansas and has seen an increase in prescription orders since the law.

CVS and Express Scripts argue that this law violates the constitution in several ways. However, according to one healthcare legal expert, their strongest case is on the Dormant Commerce Clause, which says that states cannot pass laws that unfairly hurt or discriminate against businesses from other states. Both CVS and Express Scripts have this same claim. Other than that, they have different arguments for ways this law is unconstitutional, noted Jesse C. Dresser, partner in Frier Levitt’s Life Sciences Department.

In addition, even if the law is justified, it will hurt out-of-state PBM affiliated pharmacies in favor of Arkansas-based pharmacies, which could be viewed as discriminatory, he said.

“That all being said, I do not think that the PBMs’ lawsuit will be successful,” Dresser added. “States have broad authority to regulate pharmacies under the general police powers, and recent cases have shown that the Dormant Commerce Clause does not prohibit all state regulation that affects interstate commerce.”

What could come next?

Like Arkansas, several other states are considering similar efforts, including Vermont and New York. And the results of these lawsuits in Arkansas could spur them into action.

“It may be that once we see how these cases shake out with Express Scripts and CVS, that these other states might pick up the mantle and try to do something similar as well,” Dresser said.

A major reason for why Arkansas was the first state to pass this law could be that it has a smaller concentration of some of these PBM-affiliated pharmacies, meaning it wouldn’t take as big of a hit of pharmacies closing compared to some other states, according to Dresser.

He added that he was surprised when CVS said that it will only have to close 23 pharmacies, expecting the company to have a much bigger presence.

For Express Scripts, the company doesn’t operate brick & mortar pharmacies in Arkansas, but it does have 25 non-resident pharmacy licenses in Arkansas that would be affected by the law. The company would not be able to provide care to 50,000 Arkansans who fill prescriptions or receive in-home nursing care through an Evernorth Pharmacy, which is a subsidiary of Cigna.

Several advocacy organizations have come out in support of Arkansas’ law. This includes the National Community Pharmacists Association, who said the legislation is groundbreaking because it tackles vertical integration itself instead of creating laws to deal with its downstream effects.

“HB 1150 removes many of the bad actors who have massive conflicts of interest, actors who have not complied with – or have found ways to work around – previously enacted laws,” said Joel Kurzman, director of state government affairs at the National Community Pharmacists Association. “The legislation levels the playing field for a more competitive pharmacy environment that is ultimately more friendly to patients.”

NCPA gave the example (Opens in a new window) of an audit by the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, which found that Express Scripts reimbursed its owned or affiliated pharmacies at higher rates than those not owned or affiliated by the PBM, which is against the state’s law.

Patients for Affordable Drugs Now echoed the issues around vertical integration.

“Vertical integration allows PBMs to control which drugs are covered and where prescriptions are filled — steering patients toward their own pharmacies, favoring higher-priced drugs that increase their profits, and squeezing out independent pharmacies that many patients, particularly in rural areas, rely on,” said Merith Basey, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs Now.

There are also efforts at the federal level to ban PBMs from owning pharmacies, such as the Patients Before Monopolies Act (Opens in a new window). This was a bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) in December. However, Dresser finds it unlikely that this would be the first significant PBM reform to come at the federal level. Instead, there will probably be legislation that requires more transparency from PBMs first.

“I am thrilled that Silesia is doubling down on their commitment to Illinois and expanding on an already rich legacy in our state,” Pritzker said. “With the opening of the new flavor innovation and production facility in Huntley, Silesia is bringing good jobs and opportunity to our people while further solidifying our status as a national leader in food and beverage manufacturing and processing.” ​

With support from the State’s EDGE incentives, Silesia is reaffirming its commitment to the region through the construction of the manufacturing facility, officials said.

The new Huntley plant will produce powdered savory and sweet flavors, as well as liquid savory flavors, for distribution across North and South America.

Equipped with cutting-edge culinary research labs, the facility will enable co-creation opportunities with customers. It will be used in a wide range of products, including sauces, dressings, and snacks, officials said.

Sweet, powdered flavors will serve applications ranging from sports nutrition to confectionery, officials said.

“The Village of Huntley is proud that Silesia has chosen our community as their next home for expansion, a decision that truly highlights the outstanding synergy between a growing business and a thriving community,” said Huntley Mayor Tim Hoeft.

Silesia’s decision to expand its operations builds upon Illinois’ global reputation as a leader in the food processing industry, officials said.

Guided by Illinois’ Economic Growth Plan, the State is laying the foundation for long-term success by focusing on key, high-growth industries, including food processing. ​ Illinois is home to Ferrero’s first chocolate factory in North America, innovation and R&D labs designed to help companies grow and innovate, as well as headquarters such as Kraft Heinz, Wrigley, and Mondelez, officials said.

Actually, just a hair under 100 million.

This is because, as it turns out, motorists in the US aren’t buying cars anymore.

And it’s probably exactly for the reason you suspect.

DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie

According to S&P Global Mobility, a market trend researcher, the number of passenger cars on the road in the US has fallen below 100 million for the first time since the 1970s.

And that number is still going down.

Between 2020 and 2023, for example, over 27 million cars were sent to the crusher, while new car registrations topped out at just 13 million.

Why? The answer consists of three words: SUVs and trucks.

People aren’t buying passenger cars because they’re buying SUVs and trucks instead.

This is becoming a bit of a catch-22 situation.

As in, people aren’t buying cars because automakers are mostly focusing on SUVs… because people aren’t buying cars…

And it goes on.

The best-selling vehicle in North America last year was an SUV, the Toyota RAV4.

The second best-seller was the Ford F-150, which is a truck.

In fact, you have to go all the way down to number six to find the first sedan, the Toyota Camry.

And then we have vehicles that used to be sedans but are now SUVs.

For example, Ford decided to use the Mustang nameplate for an SUV, the Mach-E, which is actually outselling the ‘normal’ Mustang.

And the list of nameplates that used to be cars that are now SUVs is long, and it includes – among others – the Mitsubishi Eclipse and the Ford Puma.

After all, people want what they want.

And, at least for now, people clearly want SUVs and trucks.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/N7-2.png,N,,2025-06-08 13:03:57.160125

""We’re watching an accelerated genocide unfold before our eyes in Gaza, where innocent women and children account for around 70 per cent of the rising death toll.

Until there is enough momentum from companies making things in the United States, the fabric, zippers and buttons will have to be brought into the country.
In the United States, Saitex has spent around $25 million.","HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam – President Donald Trump ignited a global trade war on a gamble that taxing other countries would bring jobs and factories “roaring back” to the United States.

Many business leaders are skeptical. Some are incredulous. Sanjeev Bahl is optimistic.

From his factory in Los Angeles, Bahl oversees around 250 people who sew, cut and distress jeans for brands like Everlane, J. Crew and Ralph Lauren. They stitch together 70,000 pairs of jeans a month. America, he insisted, can make stuff again.

But there is a catch. The operation works only because his company, Saitex, runs a much bigger factory and fabric mill in southern Vietnam where thousands of workers churn out 500,000 pairs of jeans a month.

Trump’s tariffs have upended supply chains, walloped businesses and focused the minds of corporate leaders on one question: Does America have what it takes to bring jobs back?

In many industries, the undertaking would take years, if not decades. The United States lacks nearly every part of the manufacturing ecosystem – the workers, the training, the technology and the government support.

“There are some harsh realities,” said Matt Priest, CEO of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a trade group.

And Trump’s strategy is shrouded in uncertainty. Last month, he said, “We’re not looking to make sneakers and T-shirts” in the United States. But his steepest tariffs, set to take effect in July, were directed at countries that make clothes and shoes for sale to Americans. Vietnam, at 46%, was one of the hardest hit.

Those tariffs, intended to push companies to bring factory work home, were deemed illegal by a ruling last week by the U.S. Court of International Trade. That decision was temporarily paused by a different court, giving judges time to evaluate an appeal by the Trump administration. Amid all the legal wrangling, Trump has promised to find other ways to disrupt the rules of trade.

Trump has exposed the difficulties in closing the vast distances, geographical and logistical, between where many products are made and where they are consumed. The gulf was laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic, when strict health policies in Asian countries led to the shutdown of factories. When they reopened, orders had piled up and snarled shipping routes trying to ferry goods across thousands of miles.

For executives like Bahl of Saitex, the turmoil caused by Trump’s trade policies has brought fresh urgency to the challenges of managing global supply chains.

“The extended fear and uncertainty that COVID brought was unforeseen,” Bahl said. “There was nothing that could help us except survival instinct.”

In response, Saitex opened a factory in Los Angeles in 2021. Since Trump announced his intention to impose steep tariffs on Vietnam, Bahl has been thinking about how much more he can make in the United States. He could probably bring about 20% of production to the States, up from 10% today, he said.

He believes Saitex could be a blueprint for other apparel companies: “We could be the catalyst of the hypothesis that manufacturing can be brought back to the United States,” he said. But his experience highlights how hard it would be.

There are no mills in America on the scale of what the industry needs, nor major zipper and button suppliers. The cost of running a factory is high. Then there is the labor problem: There just aren’t enough workers.

American factories are already struggling to fill around 500,000 manufacturing jobs, according to estimates by Wells Fargo economists. They calculate that to get manufacturing as a share of employment back to the 1970s peak that Trump has sometimes called for, new factories would have to open and hire 22 million people. There are currently 7.2 million unemployed people.

Trump’s crackdown on immigration has made things worse.

Factory jobs moved overseas to countries, like Vietnam, that had growing populations and young people looking for jobs to pull themselves out of poverty. The future that Trump envisions, with millions of factory jobs, would have to include immigrants seeking that same opportunity in the United States.

Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, an industry lobby group, said there was a gap between a “romantic notion about manufacturing” and the availability of American workers.

“A lot of people say we should be making more clothing in the U.S., but when you ask them, they don’t want to sit in the factory, nor do they want their kids to sit in the factory,” he said. “The problem is that there aren’t any other people around,” he added.

At Saitex’s Los Angeles factory, most of the workers come from countries like Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador.

Some 97% of the clothes and shoes that Americans buy are imported for cost reasons. Companies that make everything in the United States include firms like Federal Prison Industries, also known as Unicor, which employs convicts to make military uniforms for less than minimum wage, Lamar said.

Other companies make some of their fashion lines in the United States, like New Balance and Ralph Lauren. Others are playing around with a model where they make small batches of clothes in the United States to test designs and determine their popularity before commissioning big orders – usually from factories in other countries.

It is hard to make things in great volume in America. For Bahl, it boils down to the cost of a sewing machine operator. In Los Angeles, that person gets paid around $4,000 a month. In Vietnam, it is $500.

In Saitex’s factory there, which Bahl set up in 2012 in Dong Nai province, an hour’s drive from Ho Chi Minh City, more than a dozen sewing lines are neatly laid out and humming six days a week.

On a recent day, hundreds of workers pushed panels of jeans through sewing machines so quickly that the fabrics, briefly suspended in the air, looked as though they were flying. The work was augmented by sophisticated machines that can stitch labels onto a dozen shirts at a time, or laser a distressed pattern onto multiple jeans. Nearby, at a spray carousel, a robot mimicked the precise movements of a worker spraying denim.

“The speed is much higher in Vietnam,” said Gilles Cousin, a plant manager overseeing the sewing section.

If Trump really wants to bring jobs back, Bahl said, he should give some tariff exemptions to companies like Saitex that are doing more in the United States. American factories like his can’t expand without importing many of the things that go into their finished products. For its part, Saitex ships bales of American cotton to Vietnam, where its two-story mill turns fluffy cotton lint into thread and, eventually, rolls of fabric. That fabric is then dyed and shipped back the United States for his Los Angeles factory.

Until there is enough momentum from companies making things in the United States, the fabric, zippers and buttons will have to be brought into the country.

Moving production from overseas would require huge investments, too. Saitex has plowed around $150 million into Vietnam, where its factory recycles 98% of its water, air dries its denim and uses technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and cut down on labor-intensive practices. In the United States, Saitex has spent around $25 million. These are long-term commitments that take at least seven years to recover, according to Bahl.

Ultimately, if Trump decided to stick to his original 46% tariff on Vietnam and Saitex could not soften the financial blow, it would have to look to other markets to sell the products it made in Vietnam – like Europe, where it sends about half of what it makes.

“But then,” Bahl said from Los Angeles, “what happens to our factory here?”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/ycbf7H1H5ni5cNvIj-BHD7RIPtE=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/06/05/6840748fb1ea6.hires.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 13:03:42.746554

Key Factors Affecting the Global Trade in 2025

China v/s European Union: The European Union has strengthened subsidy laws on Chinese exports, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs). China is acting with tariff increments on European luxury goods.

U.S. China Trade and Commerce War 2.0: The U.S. continues to force penalties and sanctions on Chinese technology corporations, while China is creating its own supply chains to counteract reliance on the west.

India’s Protectionist Policies: India is increasing import tariffs on electronics and manufacturing components to promote Make in India initiative, while affecting global brands that rely on Indian manufacturing sector.

Penalties on Russia and Middle East: West have imposed sanctions on Russia, forcing global energy and utilities markets to diversify oil and gas suppliers. Further, the MEA remains volatile, affecting shipping routes, such as Suez Canal.

Impact of Digital Trade and Technology

Adoption of Blockchain: Organizations utilize blockchain-powered trade documents to meet regulatory constraints across multiple authorities.

AI & Predictive Analytics in Global Supply Chains: AI enables businesses of all sizes to predict trade disruptions and optimize tracking strategies.

Globalization of digital platforms: E-commerce platforms such as Flipkart, Alibaba, and Amazon are making it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to enter new international markets.

Central Bank Digital Currencies: Governments of several countries are assessing their own digital currencies and cryptocurrencies to boost-up their cross-border commerce and transactions, to reduce dependence on conventional banking systems.

Policy Divergence and Rising Trade Frictions

Policy Separation: Several countries are pursuing different policies, such as the US shifting trade away from China and toward other economies, and the EU moving away from trade with Russia. This is also happening with China using inducement policies to maintain export momentum.

Shifting Trade Relationships: Trade relationships are being reconfigured, with the U.S. and EU shifting trade away from traditional partners and towards other economies. In early April, Trump administration imposed new tariffs, including 10% global tariffs and upto 50% duty on 57 countries. The European Union and China are preparing retaliation, while Canada and Mexico have secured partial exemptions under United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Market Navigate Turbulence

The U.S. stock market experienced a significant volatility with regards to tariff announcements. In response to this, major indexes, such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones saw substantial declines. The S&P 500 fell more than 9.5% on April 9, 2025. Businesses are encouraged to adopt a resilience mindset, develop risk mitigation strategies, and be adaptable to constant changes in the global environment. Further, businesses are diversifying their supply chains and exploring alternative trade routes to reduce reliance on single sources and regions.

Moreover, the increase in gold prices has been one of the remarkable financial developments in early 2025. Gold has reached record levels due to growing geopolitical uncertainty and the apprehensions of the investors regarding inflationary pressures from tariffs. Since 2022, gold’s price movements have become less tied to US interest rates and the US Dollar. This shift is primarily due to two factors: central banks significantly increasing their gold acquisitions and a rise in investment demand for gold from emerging markets. A major contributor to gold’s upward trend is the altered pattern of central bank gold purchases. From 2022 onwards, central banks have effectively doubled their annual gold buying, surpassing 1,000 tons each year, with a notable 1,045 tons acquired in 2024 alone.

The investment demand from emerging markets has grown significantly. In China, a struggling property sector has prompted investors to seek refuge in gold. Meanwhile, in Turkey, there’s been a significant uptick in gold demand as households turn to the precious metal to protect their wealth from rapid currency depreciation. In India, government reductions in import duties have further stimulated gold purchases.

Even with market fluctuations, credit markets are stable. Corporate bond risk premiums have risen slightly, but investors generally don’t expect a severe recession. Emerging markets have struggled, especially those reliant on global trade and vulnerable to a strong dollar. However, commodity exporters, like those in the Gulf and parts of Africa, have done well due to high resource prices and investors seeking value.

Conclusion

Even though inflation is easing and some areas are still experiencing growth, increasing trade disputes and geopolitical instability are rapidly altering the risk landscape. Conventional economic models might not fully account for the effects of sudden policy changes, particularly regarding tariffs and capital flows. As the global economic environment becomes more precarious, it will be crucial to grasp cross-border economic dynamics and modify predictions and investments accordingly.",https://i0.wp.com/www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shutterstock_2255577621-1-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1205&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-08 13:04:02.108284

Why it matters: Musk's grievances against the president's signature tax-and-spending package have been echoed by some GOP fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill.

Senators last week strategized with Trump and other administration officials on how to cut spending further than the House-passed legislation did.

Driving the news: Johnson said on ABC's ""This Week"" that he hasn't spoken to Musk on the phone since Monday of last week, before the Trump-Musk alliance publicly exploded on Thursday.

""We were disappointed, surprised,"" Johnson said. ""I'd had a lot of great interaction, discussion with him about the one big, beautiful bill to make sure he had accurate information because I was concerned that people were telling him things that just simply weren't true.""

Musk on Thursday posted that he never saw the bill, denying Trump's claim that he was familiar with the inner workings of the legislation.

Johnson told ABC's Jon Karl that Musk had expressed in text messages that his primary concern was about spending in the legislation.

He added that there have been ""almost no calls"" to GOP lawmakers' offices, despite Musk urging his 220 million followers to call their representatives over the bill.

What he's saying: ""I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world,"" Johnson said. ""What we're trying to do is help hard-working Americans who are trying to provide for their families and make ends meet.""

Johnson declined to elaborate on Trump's threat to cut Musk's government contracts.

""What I'm trying to do is make sure that all of this gets resolved quickly,"" he said. ""That we get the one big, beautiful bill done and then hopefully these two titans can reconcile.""

Zoom out: But Trump, in a phone interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker, said he had no desire to mend his relationship with Musk following the explosive falling out.

Trump also told NBC on Saturday that there would be ""serious consequences"" if Musk started funding Democratic candidates.

Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) sidestepped Trump's comment when asked about it on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, saying, ""We have a lot of social media drama going on between two of the most active social media individuals in the world ... back and forth on that. And I know a lot of people are focused on that.""

Friction point: White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that Trump has not spoken to Musk since the spat and that she doesn't believe he intends to.

""We were all hoping for the best for Elon,"" she said. ""And I think it's unfortunate that now that he's gone back to his companies, he is lambasting this bill that he was very much supportive of by all accounts.""

The court hearing comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada have cast a shadow over the CRTC’s attempts to regulate online streamers.
Then, as the CRTC launched its hearing on modernizing the definition of Canadian content in May, Netflix, Paramount and Apple cancelled their individual appearances.","Some of the world’s biggest streaming companies will argue in court on Monday that they shouldn’t have to make CRTC-ordered financial contributions to Canadian content and news.

The companies are fighting an order from the federal broadcast regulator that says they must pay five per cent of their annual Canadian revenues to funds devoted to producing Canadian content, including local TV news.

The case, which consolidates several appeals by streamers, will be heard by the Federal Court of Appeal in Toronto.

Apple, Amazon and Spotify are fighting the CRTC’s 2024 order. Motion Picture Association-Canada, which represents such companies as Netflix and Paramount, is challenging a section of the CRTC's order requiring them to contribute to local news.

In December, the court put a pause on the payments — estimated to be at least $1.25 million annually per company. Amazon, Apple and Spotify had argued that if they made the payments and then won the appeal and overturned the CRTC order, they wouldn’t be able to recover the money.

In court documents, the streamers put forward a long list of arguments on why they shouldn’t have to pay, including technical points regarding the CRTC’s powers under the Broadcasting Act.

Spotify argued that the contribution requirement amounts to a tax, which the CRTC doesn’t have the authority to impose. The music streamer also took issue with the CRTC requiring the payments without first deciding how it will define Canadian content.

Amazon argued the federal cabinet specified the CRTC’s requirements have to be ""equitable.""

It said the contribution requirement is ""inequitable because it applies only to foreign online undertakings and only to such undertakings with more than $25 million in annual Canadian broadcasting revenues.""

Apple also said the regulator ""acted prematurely"" and argued the CRTC didn’t consider whether the order was ""equitable."" It pointed out Apple is required to contribute five per cent, while radio stations must only pay 0.5 per cent — and streamers don’t have the same access to the funds into which they pay.

The CRTC imposes different rules on Canadian content contributions from traditional media players. It requires large English-language broadcasters to contribute 30 per cent of revenues to Canadian programming.

Motion Picture Association—Canada is only challenging one aspect of the CRTC’s order — the part requiring companies to contribute 1.5 per cent of revenues to a fund for local news on independent TV stations.

It said in court documents that none of the streamers ""has any connection to news production"" and argued the CRTC doesn’t have the authority to require them to fund news.

""What the CRTC did, erroneously, is purport to justify the … contribution simply on the basis that local news is important and local news operations provided by independent television stations are short of money,"" it said.

""That is a reason why news should be funded by someone, but is devoid of any analysis, legal or factual, as to why it is equitable for foreign online undertakings to fund Canadian news production.""

In its response, the Canadian Association of Broadcasters said the CRTC has wide authority under the Broadcasting Act. It argued streamers have contributed to the funding crisis facing local news.

""While the industry was once dominated by traditional television and radio services, those services are now in decline, as Canadians increasingly turn to online streaming services,"" the broadcasters said.

""For decades, traditional broadcasting undertakings have supported the production of Canadian content through a complex array of CRTC-directed measures … By contrast, online undertakings have not been required to provide any financial support to the Canadian broadcasting system, despite operating here for well over a decade.""

A submission from the federal government in defence of the CRTC argued the regulator was within its rights to order the payments.

""The orders challenged in these proceedings … are a valid exercise of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission’s regulatory powers. These orders seek to remedy the inequity that has resulted from the ascendance of online streaming giants like the Appellants,"" the office of the attorney general said.

""Online undertakings have greatly profited from their access to Canadian audiences, without any corresponding obligation to make meaningful contributions supporting Canadian programming and creators — an obligation that has long been imposed on traditional domestic broadcasters.""

The government said that if the streamers get their way, that would preserve ""an inequitable circumstance in which domestic broadcasters — operating in an industry under economic strain — shoulder a disproportionate regulatory burden.""

""This result would be plainly out of step with the policy aims of Parliament"" and cabinet, it added.

The court hearing comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada have cast a shadow over the CRTC’s attempts to regulate online streamers.

The regulator launched a suite of proceedings and hearings as part of its implementation of the Online Streaming Act, legislation that in 2023 updated the Broadcasting Act to set up the CRTC to regulate streaming companies.

In January, as U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term, groups representing U.S. businesses and big tech companies warned the CRTC that its efforts to modernize Canadian content rules could worsen trade relations and lead to retaliation.

Then, as the CRTC launched its hearing on modernizing the definition of Canadian content in May, Netflix, Paramount and Apple cancelled their individual appearances.

While the companies didn’t provide a reason, the move came shortly after Trump threatened to impose a tariff of up to 100 per cent on movies made outside the United States. Foreign streamers have long pointed to their existing spending in Canada in response to calls to bring them into the regulated system.

""Now I can start having more fun,"" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in a Wall Street Journal interview this past week.
One place Wall Street expects Wells Fargo to more quickly show improvement over the near term is its spending on risk and compliance costs.
Perhaps the most significant thing for Wells Fargo this week is that its overseers have signaled ""a clean bill of health,"" according to Siefers.
Even Dimon has acknowledged that he expects Wells Fargo to be a much more formidable competitor going forward.","In This Article:

Wells Fargo (WFC) spent years worried about the past. Now it can focus on the future.

The fourth-largest US bank plans to pursue growth and expansion in investment banking, credit cards, and wealth management now that it has shed a major growth restriction imposed last decade by regulators as punishment for a fake accounts scandal that roiled the San Francisco-based financial institution.

""Now I can start having more fun,"" Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said in a Wall Street Journal interview this past week.

The lifting of a $1.95 trillion asset cap will help Scharf go on the offensive as he tries to make Wells Fargo into a major Wall Street investment banking player, edging deeper into a hypercompetitive business where it lags behind Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS).

In fact, Scharf told the Wall Street Journal he wants Wells Fargo to be one of the top five investment banks, and ""then there'll be an argument about, 'Well, why top five? Why not four or three?'""

On Main Street, Wells Fargo also wants to play catch-up after missing out on major opportunities to lap up deposits during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 regional banking turmoil. It also wants to add more credit card products and better integrate its wealth management with its retail branches.

Its growing pains under the asset cap have for years put Wells Fargo at an increasing disadvantage behind larger rivals — ""the gift that keeps giving"" for competitors, Piper Sandler bank analyst Scott Siefers told Yahoo Finance.

Growing its US consumer bank is where the ""heavy lifting"" is needed to move Wells Fargo's stock higher, TD Securities analyst Steven Alexopoulos added in a note this past week. The consumer business pulls in almost half of the bank's revenue.

Still, ""igniting growth in this area is far from a layup,"" Alexopoulos added.

Even after passing its crucial milestone, Wells Fargo's stock didn't soar, ending up 2% this past week. But it is up 30% for the past 12 months, ahead of rivals Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) while lagging JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.

For years, the bank has funneled millions into ramping up those operations to meet regulators' expectations. Now that Wells Fargo's growth restrictions have been removed, analysts hope a lot of the extra spending will be plowed back into growing the bank.

To catch up with bigger rivals JPMorgan and Bank of America, that will mean investing some compliance cost savings into its brick-and-mortar branch network, stocking those buildings with investment advisers, and spending more on marketing efforts for its credit cards.

Perhaps the most significant thing for Wells Fargo this week is that its overseers have signaled ""a clean bill of health,"" according to Siefers.

""The bank can no longer be pointed to as the sick child of the industry, and I think all this time with that regulatory scrutiny and restriction has probably also left it as the cleanest big bank in the country.""

On Friday, S&P Global upgraded its outlook on Wells Fargo to ""positive"" from ""stable"" and said it expects Wells to expand its commercial and investment banking business — ""the unit most affected by the asset cap and one that had to turn away some nonoperational deposits from customers.""

The milestone for Wells this week drew praise from one of the bank's rivals, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Scharf's former boss earlier in his career.

""Charlie and his team worked extremely hard to resolve these heritage issues, which is good for the entire banking system,"" Dimon said in emailed comments.

Even Dimon has acknowledged that he expects Wells Fargo to be a much more formidable competitor going forward. Not that it will be easy.

""The bank has changed a lot, and yes, they're going to grow. They may see assets grow, but all the banks are going to see assets grow,"" Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance.

McDonald’s seems to have found the perfect balance between innovation and nostalgia. Although its new move started outside the United States, everything suggests that its impact will soon cross the border.

The chain has once again bet on a strategy that marked generations: the McDonaldland characters. From the return of the popular Grimace to new flavors on its menus, the company is creating a wave of excitement. The most recent launch has captured everyone's attention and threatens to overshadow the competition, including Burger King.

The power of nostalgia returns to the menu

During the 1970s, McDonald’s won over the youngest customers with its own universe full of characters. Ronald McDonald, the Hamburglar, Birdie, or Grimace were part of a marketing strategy that could be seen everywhere: toys, ads, and special menus. However, in the 2000s, this line was set aside to focus on a more adult audience.

Recently, the brand has decided to revive that childlike spirit with some occasional appearances. In 2023, Grimace returned to ads and his birthday was celebrated with a purple shake that went viral. Even his Irish uncle, O’Grimacey, made a brief comeback with the classic Shamrock Shake, available for a limited time.

Now, in a new attempt to emotionally reconnect with customers, McDonald’s has introduced a proposal that not only awakens the appetite but also memories. A sugary drink that brings back summer fairs, prizes won at raffles, and that feeling of a happy childhood, according to The Street.

A Canadian bet that could reach the US

The big news is called Cotton Candy Shake: a cotton candy shake mixed with vanilla ice cream. McDonald’s announced it after several days of hints on social media, fueling their followers' expectations. Its flavor aims to take you straight back to childhood summers, according to the company itself.

For now, this new drink can only be enjoyed in Canada, which has left American consumers wanting more. It's not unusual for McDonald’s to adapt its menu according to the country, taking advantage of available ingredients or regional tastes. However, when a product succeeds, they don't take long to replicate it elsewhere.

Although there is no official confirmation about its arrival in the United States, the success in Canada could be decisive. If the ingredients and interest are kept, this shake could be the next big summer sensation in the US. If that happens, Burger King will have to work twice as hard to keep up in the competition.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-restaurante-mcdonalds-burger-king-emoji-preocupado_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-06-08 12:11:21.207652

These sectors reflect both continuity in pre-war investment strategies and adaptation to new market gaps created by Western companies’ exits.","Turkish companies continue to play a prominent role in the Russian economy, with Ant Yapi, Hayat Holding, and Koc Holding emerging as the top investors, according to a recent report by NSP, one of Russia’s most established legal consultancies.

The findings, featured in Russia’s leading business publication Vedomosti, reveal that Turkish firms have not only maintained their operations in the face of sweeping Western sanctions but, in many cases, have expanded them.

Ant Yapi tops the list with landmark projects

Ant Yapi, a Turkish international contractor, stands as the leading Turkish investor in Russia, with total assets valued at 35 billion rubles (approximately $440 million).

Ranked among the world’s top 100 construction companies, Ant Yapi is also active in the United States and the United Kingdom. The firm has left a significant mark on Moscow’s skyline through several major high-rise developments.

Hayat Holding follows with major new facility launch

Second on the list is Hayat Holding, a Turkish manufacturer of hygiene and personal care products, which recently launched a new facility. The group’s investments in Russia now exceed 24.5 billion rubles ($300 million).

Hayat Holding’s operations span paper production and consumer goods manufacturing—areas in which Turkish companies have increasingly stepped in to meet local demand following the exit of Western brands.

Koc Holding maintains diverse operations worth $250 million

Koc Holding, Türkiye's largest conglomerate, ranks 3rd among Turkish investors, with assets totaling 20 billion rubles ($250 million).

Through subsidiaries such as home appliance manufacturer Arcelik, the group has continued to operate and grow in the home appliance and automotive parts sectors. Its acquisition of U.S.-based home appliances firm Whirlpool’s local assets, following the American company’s withdrawal, has further solidified its standing.

Geographic reach extends across major Russian regions

The report also highlights the regional distribution of Turkish investments, which have penetrated various parts of Russia. In Moscow alone, Turkish firms have invested roughly $450 million. Other significant investment hubs include Kaluga ($300 million), Lipetsk ($280 million), and Bashkortostan ($250 million), suggesting a well-diversified portfolio across both industrial centers and emerging markets.

Anadolu Efes asset remains under seizure

Despite the overall continuity of Turkish business activity in Russia, Anadolu Efes—one of Türkiye’s largest investors in the country—has faced state intervention. Since December, its joint venture, AB InBev Efes, has been placed under trusteeship.

The venture, established in 2018 with Belgian multinational AB InBev, had held a 29% share of the Russian beer market.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting increase in business risk for Western firms, Anadolu Efes and AB InBev had agreed to dissolve the partnership.

Under the agreement, Anadolu Efes would acquire 100% of the Russian operations, while AB InBev would take full control of the Ukrainian business.

The two companies had submitted the proposed transfer for regulatory approval in Russia, but, instead of receiving a response, they faced the seizure of the joint venture.

The seizure marked the first such action against a firm from a country classified by Russia as “friendly.”

Strategic sectors remain central to Turkish investment

Following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, a record number of over 12,000 international sanctions were imposed against Moscow by the United States, the European Union, and their allies.

In response, many Western multinationals—including globally recognized corporations—either exited the Russian market or transferred their local assets. This vacuum, the report suggests, has allowed companies from Türkiye, China, and Iran to expand their footprint.

According to NSP’s findings, Turkish capital in Russia has been concentrated in strategic sectors including construction, paper and hygiene products, household appliances, and automotive components.

ID35,S&P Global,2025-06-08 13:15:51+00:00,Grist,Data centers are building their own gas power plants in Texas - Grist.org,"Dylan Baddour & Arcelia Martin, Inside Climate News, Dylan Baddour & Arcelia Martin, Inside Climate News",,,,,https://grist.org/energy/data-centers-are-building-their-own-gas-power-plants-in-texas/,"It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road.
“There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas.
However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers.
“They care about power.” Gas plants for data centers Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers.
Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity.","Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it.

The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road.

“It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.”

The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this build out promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come.

The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.”

Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar, and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability.

“There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.”

IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers—giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said.

There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totaling 411,600 MW of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, S.B. 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies.

Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply.

Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today.

Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation.

Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try to slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand.

This build-out promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records.

Texas, with 9 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15 percent of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26 percent of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state.

GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers.

For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand.

“The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.”

It forecast up to a 20 percent increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers.

Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals, and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate.

It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines have quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook.

“If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said.

The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March.

About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference.

“Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.”

Gas plants for data centers

Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 MW of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity.

Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 MW cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940.

“Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.”

CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 MW gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 MW data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart.

Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 MW South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 MW megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar, and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 MW from the grid.

Altogether, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global.

“There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.”

However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals.

Restrictions on renewable energy

Looking forward to a build out of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer.

Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power.

“It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.”

While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry.

One failed bill, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, H.B. 3356 and S.B. 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating.

When the legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund.

Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, S.B. 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas, or nuclear — needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass.

Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state.

Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue.

More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40 percent of their income.

He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the legislature is headed with renewables.

“I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/data-center-protest.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-08 11:01:47.198705

It's a model that has been copied heavily by growing rivals like 7 Brews, but at the time it was a stripped-down, back-to-basics model.

The company literally began as cart way back in 1992, before the chain began franchising in 2000. It was a slow climb to becoming a real player, but it has steadily grown, reaching a milestone earlier this year.

Dutch Bros.' growth is about more than drinks

When you look at the Dutch Bros. menu, it's almost entirely drinks. The chain has expanded beyond coffee into smoothies, lemonades, iced teas, sodas, and more.

It also offers a very limited snack menu consisting mostly of muffin tops.

The chain does, however, see a growth opportunity in food. Barone spoke about that as well.

""We see a clear path forward with Order Ahead, throughput and food,"" she said.

The coffee chain has been testing a small breakfast menu in a handful of locations.

""We are thrilled with the success of our limited food test launched late last year and are excited to continue testing and refining this initiative throughout 2025,"" she added.

The hot breakfast menu includes four smaller-sized items: a sausage, egg, and cheddar slider; bacon, egg, and cheddar slider; chorizo wrap; and a maple waffle, according to Nation's Restaurant News.

The test will be expanded to more locations this year.

Dutch Bros. has a clear plan

The coffee chain has taken a ""move slowly"" approach to growth. It's going to continue to do that.

""Building on the success we are having with our Order Ahead initiative, we believe food can generate incrementality in the morning day part and drive frequency. Our approach to this test is both strategic and deliberate. We recognize the potential multi-year growth opportunity with our current food mix at less than 2% of sales,"" Barone said.

Dutch Bros. has also remained focused on making sure it keeps its workers happy.

""Our goals for this test are clear: maintain existing high levels of barista job satisfaction, continue to support throughput efficiency, minimize complexity, and offer a targeted assortment that allows us to satisfy our customers' craving for food while capturing incremental beverage opportunities,"" she added.

Barone made it clear exactly how the company decided what it adds to its menus.

""The pilot test has informed our decision to now offer eight SKUs, including four hot food offerings. With the completion of an initial pilot, we recently expanded this initiative from eight to 32 shops,"" she shared.

That's only the beginning, as Dutch Bros. sees adding breakfast as a massive opportunity.

""Looking ahead, expanding the food test pilot is a crucial step towards a broader test and rollout anticipated to occur throughout 2026.

The report, he said in a LinkedIn post, is “a testament to our belief in the transformative power of sport”. Nike had released some version of it since at least 2001, often with similar fanfare.

But this year, the company won’t publish that report.

Nike joins a growing list of companies that includes JPMorgan Chase, Constellation Brands and Akamai Technologies that are either cancelling or delaying publication of their so-called sustainability or corporate impact reports for shareholders. While companies aren’t legally obliged to disclose such information, most S&P 500 members did so in 2024.

For more than a decade, this is usually the time period when companies tout the steps they’re taking to lower carbon emissions and improve the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) of their businesses.

Opposition to these reports first surfaced about three years ago when GOP lawmakers and activists began pressing companies to scale back such efforts. And some companies have reacted by taking steps such as scrubbing ESG (environmental, social and governance) and DEI-related words from public documents.

Anti-DEI movement

The election of President Donald Trump has further empowered the anti-DEI movement. During his first week in the White House, he signed executive orders ending federal diversity programs and restricting gender definition to two sexes – male and female. None of the companies contacted said Trump’s actions changed their planning for releasing sustainability reports.

“The consequences of reported information are much greater now than they were a decade ago,” said Martin Whittaker, chief executive officer of Just Capital, noting that both progressive and conservative activists are searching for evidence of companies’ missteps.

He estimates that about 25 per cent of sustainability-related corporate reporting is behind schedule this year.

Here are some of the S&P 500 companies that have yet to publish sustainability reports, according to researchers at DiversIQ.

Nike, JPMorgan, Constellation Brands and Akamai Technologies have different explanations for why their sustainability reports haven’t been published this year.

Nike said in an e-mail that it still plans to share the work it’s doing to create a more inclusive and sustainable world for athletes in other formats and that its commitment to diversity goals for 2025 hasn’t changed.

In a regulatory filing, JPMorgan said it plans to release a consolidated report on ESG and climate topics later this year. However, the bank added that it will “monitor the evolving disclosure landscape as we iterate on our approach to disclosure”. JPMorgan published its “2024 Climate Report” in November.

At Constellation Brands, a spokesperson said the timing of the publication’s release was adjusted after receiving “stakeholder feedback”, and that the next report is scheduled to be issued next month. Cloud computing and cybersecurity company Akamai said its data-centre vendors were partly to blame for a delay in publication until the end of this quarter. The company wasn’t more specific.

For the past several years, Pfizer had published an impact report by April. When contacted last week about the delay in publication, a company spokesperson said the timing was adjusted to “allow for necessary internal processes in preparation for evolving global ESG reporting requirements”. The company released its report this week.

The lack of information is a blow, even if temporary, to corporate transparency. Many shareholders rely on the disclosures to gauge how serious companies are about addressing ESG issues, inequities in the workforce, and other factors that can impact the short and long-term value of their investments.

Activist investors who’ve pressed companies to release more data on DEI and climate initiatives have been willing to cut companies some slack this year, given the heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration.

At risk

Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow, which supports social responsibility, said executives have been asking him privately for some flexibility in what information they release this year.

“We told them to not put themselves at risk right now,” he said. “That isn’t good for anyone.”

And the caution is warranted, said GianCarlo Canaparo, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has warned against possible discrimination in company DEI programmes.

Corporate leaders are aware that Trump has asked agency heads to identify nine companies or organisations that should be investigated for possible illegal DEI activities, he said. So far, the names haven’t been made public, but it’s clearly on companies’ radar, he added.

“If you have been using race preferences, you really want to make sure you don’t get caught,” Canaparo said. “And if you haven’t, you want to make sure you aren’t dragged into litigation to explore whether you have.” BLOOMBERG",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/8169597847b68a52ca9e61678d69bc3581fa53b02c40add846b08bb6f68aaeb1?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-06-08 09:59:32.308029

Barclay, Nick Turner, Sandy Hershcovis",,,,,https://theconversation.com/why-bystanders-defend-bad-behaviour-at-work-even-when-they-know-its-wrong-257941,"When mistreatment seems inevitable — when people think “that’s just how things work around here” — bystanders face a psychological dilemma.
Witnessing workplace mistreatment We interviewed 554 employees who had witnessed workplace mistreatment within the past two weeks at the time the survey was conducted.
When they respond quickly, support targets openly and hold perpetrators accountable, they challenge the perception that mistreatment is inevitable.
Support targets openly and meaningfully System justification often works by undermining the credibility of those being mistreated.
Why this matters Much of the existing research on workplace mistreatment has focused on the importance of bystander and leader intervention.","“You always mess things up. Why are you even on this project? Just quit already.” Demeaning, hostile or undermining behaviour like this is more common in the workplace and damaging than many people realize. One in three employees experience such behaviours, and almost half witness them.

Rather than intervening, supporting targets or reporting the misconduct, research shows bystanders may downplay it, withdraw support or even blame the target, which ultimately reinforces the mistreatment.

As our recent study shows, this is largely because when mistreatment seems inevitable or commonplace, bystanders are psychologically motivated to justify it rather than challenge it.

Why do bystanders rationalize mistreatment?

Humans are hardwired to see mistreatment as wrong. Most of us value fairness and want to punish wrongdoing. But if this is the case, why do bystanders so often fail to act when they witness mistreatment?

Our recent research explores this question drawing on system justification theory — the idea that people are motivated to see the systems they live and work in as fair, legitimate and stable.

When mistreatment seems inevitable — when people think “that’s just how things work around here” — bystanders face a psychological dilemma. They can either challenge the behaviour and risk conflict, exclusion or backlash, or they can rationalize it as normal or deserved.

Most people, often without realizing it, choose the latter. This mental shortcut allows them to preserve the comforting belief that the system is fair and people get what they deserve.

Witnessing workplace mistreatment

We interviewed 554 employees who had witnessed workplace mistreatment within the past two weeks at the time the survey was conducted. They shared their thoughts on how inevitable they believed the mistreatment incident was, and how tolerant they felt their organization was toward such behaviour.

In a follow-up survey, we asked these employees whether they felt the incident they witnessed was justifiable and the target as deserving. A week later, in a third survey, we asked these bystanders to report how they behaved toward the target, and whether they tried to address or minimize the incident.

We found that when bystanders perceived mistreatment as inevitable, they were more likely to see the incident as justified and targets as deserving of that treatment. These bystanders were more likely to socially distance themselves from the target, engage in negative gossip about them and were less willing to offer help.

Bystander inaction wasn’t due to cowardice or callousness, but was often a defence mechanism. Rationalizing mistreatment allowed bystanders to preserve the belief that their workplace was just. But this coping strategy can deepen harm for those who experience mistreatment, who may be further marginalized, isolated or discredited.

How mistreatment is normalized

Workplace climates play a key role in the normalization of mistreatment. Our findings indicate when employees believed their workplace tolerated mistreatment, they were more likely to rationalize it and less likely to support the person being mistreated.

In these contexts, mistreatment isn’t just ignored, but is quietly accepted. Tacit acceptance sends a powerful message: this is normal, this is deserved, this is not worth challenging.

What does a toxic, permissive workplace look like? Warning signs include staff who feel anxious about coming to work and leaders who publicly criticize employees or tell them to “toughen up” or “not take it personally.”

If negative gossip is tolerated, or reports of mistreatment are ignored or delayed, these are also strong indicators that mistreatment has been normalized.

Organizations may fail to acknowledge these patterns for a variety of reasons, including resistance, denial or a lack of readiness. But surfacing these issues is a strength, not a weakness. It allows organizations to address root causes, retain valuable employees, and foster a more respectful environment.

4 ways to create positive change

Even in workplaces where mistreatment has become normalized, positive change is possible. Research shows that effectively managing everyday incidents can create bottom-up effects that support broader positive change within the workplace, ultimately improving workplace climate.

Managers have a particularly pivotal role to play. When they respond quickly, support targets openly and hold perpetrators accountable, they challenge the perception that mistreatment is inevitable. They also send a broader message about what behaviours are and aren’t acceptable in the workplace.

Here are four evidence-based strategies that can help disrupt the bystander dynamic and improve workplace culture:

1. Challenge the narrative of inevitability

Organizations should clearly signal that mistreatment will not be tolerated in their workplace. This includes explicitly communicating behavioural expectations, investigating reports quickly and transparently, and ensuring senior leaders model respectful behaviour. These small but visible actions disrupt the sense that mistreatment is “just how things work.”

2. Reduce ambiguity

When organizations don’t define behavioural norms clearly, bystanders are more likely to rationalize mistreatment. Organizations should define what mistreatment includes, such as exclusion and sarcastic comments, and distinguish it from tough feedback or constructive conflict. Training can help employees recognize subtle forms of harm and reflect on how their reactions would appear to someone they respect.

3. Enforce consequences consistently

When policies exist but aren’t enforced, bystanders learn that mistreatment carries no cost. Organizations need to follow through on mistreatment policies, protect those who report it and make it clear that retaliation is unacceptable. Visibility matters: people need to see that action is taken.

4. Support targets openly and meaningfully

System justification often works by undermining the credibility of those being mistreated. Managers can counteract this by affirming the value of a person targeted, encouraging reintegration and monitoring their teams for subtle social exclusion. When targets are supported by respected leaders, bystanders are more likely to follow suit because people tend to look to leader behaviour towards employees as a sign of their value to the group.

Why this matters

Much of the existing research on workplace mistreatment has focused on the importance of bystander and leader intervention. Our research adds a deeper layer by illustrating that bystanders may not intervene because they are subconsciously defending their belief in a fair and legitimate system.

This defence mechanism is especially dangerous when mistreatment is common, creating a cycle in which the most vulnerable employees are harmed twice: first by the perpetrator, and then by those who fail to stand by them.

Breaking this cycle requires more than training videos or one-off statements. It requires reshaping the climate that makes mistreatment seem normal, inevitable or trivial.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/671693/original/file-20250602-62-ogqtgk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C487%2C5411%2C2705&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-08 12:10:52.228648

But does the US have ...,"spotmedia.ro, Ioana Ene Dogioiu, Gabriela Pleș, Redacția SpotMedia.ro, Toni Dumitru",,,,,https://spotmedia.ro/en/news/business/trump-wants-america-to-start-producing-again-the-things-they-import-but-does-the-us-have-what-it-takes,"The United States lacks nearly every element of the production ecosystem - workers, training, technology, and government support.

He could probably bring about 20% of production to the United States, up from the current 10%, he said.
Until there is enough momentum from companies producing various things in the United States, the material, zippers, and buttons will have to be brought into the country.
In the United States, Saitex has spent approximately 25 million dollars.","Donald Trump wants to open and reopen factories, using tariffs as a tool. Companies looking to relocate their production are trying to find the right ways to do so.

The American president has triggered a global trade war based on a bet, namely that taxing other countries would bring back jobs and factories to the United States. Many business people are skeptical. But Sanjeev Bahl is optimistic.

From his factory in Los Angeles, Bahl oversees about 250 people who sew, cut, and fold jeans for brands like Everlane, J. Crew, and Ralph Lauren. Together, they produce 70,000 pairs of denim jeans per month. ""America,"" he says, ""can make things again.""

However, there is a problem. The operation only works because his company, Saitex, owns a much larger factory and spinning mill in southern Vietnam, where thousands of workers produce 500,000 pairs of jeans per month.

The tariffs imposed by Trump have disrupted supply chains, affected businesses, and brought corporate leaders together on one question: does America have what it takes to bring jobs back home? - writes The New York Times.

What America is Missing

In many industries, this approach would take years, if not decades. The United States lacks nearly every element of the production ecosystem - workers, training, technology, and government support.

""There are some harsh realities,"" said Matt Priest, executive director of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade group.

And Trump's strategy is shrouded in uncertainty. Last month, he stated, ""We don't want to make sneakers and T-shirts"" in the United States. However, the toughest tariffs he imposed, set to take effect in July, were aimed at countries producing clothing and footwear for the American market. Vietnam, with 46%, was one of the most affected countries.

China Uses Vietnam to Bypass Trump's Huge Tariffs

These tariffs, designed to compel companies to bring their production capabilities back home, were deemed illegal by a ruling issued last week by the U.S. International Trade Court. The decision was temporarily suspended by another court, giving judges time to evaluate an appeal by the Trump administration. Amid all the legal disputes, Trump promised to find other ways to disrupt trade rules.

The Trump administration's policy has exposed the difficulties in reducing the vast geographical and logistical distances between where many products are manufactured and where they are consumed.

For executives like Bahl of Saitex, the disruptions caused by Trump's trade policies have added another issue to the challenges of managing global supply chains.

""The prolonged fear and uncertainty brought by the Covid pandemic were unforeseen. There was nothing to help us but the instinct for survival,"" said Bahl.

He believes Saitex could be a model for other clothing companies. ""We could be the catalyst for the hypothesis that production can be brought back to the United States,"" he said. But his experience underscores how difficult it would be. There are no factories in America the size the industry needs, nor major zipper and button suppliers. The operating cost of a factory is high. Then there is the labor issue: there simply aren't enough workers, notes the American newspaper.

In response to the pandemic situation, Saitex opened a factory in Los Angeles in 2021. Since Trump announced his intention to impose high tariffs on Vietnam, Bahl has been considering how much more he could produce in the United States. He could probably bring about 20% of production to the United States, up from the current 10%, he said.

Americans Don't Want to Work in Factories, and Immigrants Are Expelled from the U.S.

American factories are already struggling to find people for about 500,000 jobs in this field, according to economists at Wells Fargo. According to their calculations, for the share of production in employment to return to the peak of the 1970s, to which Trump has sometimes referred, new factories employing 22 million people would need to be opened.

Currently, there are 7.2 million unemployed people in the U.S., the newspaper notes.

Trump's punitive approach to immigration has worsened things. Factory jobs have moved abroad, to countries like Vietnam, which had a growing population and young people looking for jobs to escape poverty.

The future Trump envisions, with millions of factory jobs, should include immigrants seeking the same opportunities in the United States.

Under Pressure from American Tariffs, Vietnam Plays a Double Game Between the U.S. and China

Steve Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, a lobbying group for the fashion industry, said there is a gap between the ""romantic notion of manufacturing"" and the availability of American workers.

""Many say we should make more clothes in the U.S., but when you ask them, they don't want themselves or their children to work in a factory,"" he said. ""The problem is there are no other people around,"" he added.

At the Saitex factory in Los Angeles, most workers come from countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador.

Approximately 97% of the clothing and footwear Americans buy are imported for cost reasons. Companies that produce everything in the United States include firms like Federal Prison Industries, also known as Unicor, which employ inmates to make military uniforms for less than the minimum wage, Lamar said.

Other companies, like New Balance and Ralph Lauren, produce some of their fashion lines in the United States. Others are experimenting with a model where they produce small batches of clothing in the United States to test patterns and gauge popularity before placing large orders - usually from factories in other countries.

Important Lesson for Europe: Trump Backs Down Under Pressure

It is difficult to produce things in large volume in America. For Bahl, it all comes down to the cost of a sewing machine operator - in Los Angeles, that person is paid about $4,000 a month. In Vietnam, the salary is $500.

In his factory there, which Bahl established in 2012 in Dong Nai province, an hour's drive from Ho Chi Minh City, over a dozen sewing lines are carefully arranged and operate six days a week.

""The speed is much faster in Vietnam,"" says Gilles Cousin, a factory manager overseeing the sewing section.

All Calculations Depend on an Unpredictable Man

If Trump truly wants to bring back jobs, he should grant some tariff exemptions to companies like Saitex, which have a larger presence in the United States, Bahl said. American factories like his cannot expand without importing many of the components that go into their finished products.

In turn, Saitex delivers bales of American cotton to Vietnam, where its two-story factory turns fluffy cotton lint into yarn and eventually into rolls of fabric. The textile is then dyed and shipped back to the United States for the Los Angeles factory.

Until there is enough momentum from companies producing various things in the United States, the material, zippers, and buttons will have to be brought into the country.

Shifting production from abroad would also require massive investments. Saitex has invested around $150 million in Vietnam, where its factory recycles 98% of water, air-dries denim, and uses technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate labor-intensive practices.

In the United States, Saitex has spent approximately 25 million dollars. These are long-term commitments that take at least seven years to recover, Bahl explains.

In the end, if Trump decides to maintain the initial 46% tax on Vietnam, and Saitex cannot mitigate the financial impact, they should look towards other markets to sell the products manufactured in Vietnam - such as Europe, where they currently deliver about half of what they produce. ""But then what happens to our factory here?"" Bahl asks about the California unit.

It all depends on Trump. And, ultimately, on American justice.

Burger King is betting on offering memorable experiences that go beyond the product.","Burger King has launched a campaign that's generating a lot of buzz in the United States. The chain has just introduced a special menu inspired by the popular movie ""How to Train Your Dragon."" This strategy aims to attract families and movie lovers. In addition, it represents a major blow to McDonald's, its historic competitor, known for their collaborations with children's movies.

Since May 27, the themed menu has been available at Burger King locations across the country. The star dish is the ""Dragon Flame-Grilled Whopper."" It's a burger with the brand's classic flame-grilled flavor, but with a special touch that makes it unique.

Alongside this burger, mozzarella and Calabrian chili fries are offered. This combination gives it a different flavor, a mix of creamy and spicy, that aims to surprise customers. Strawberry lemonade is also included, a refreshing and sweet drink that perfectly complements the meal.

Themed desserts complete the menu, creating an experience that goes beyond flavor. Burger King wants every bite to remind customers of the movie and for the meal to be part of the fun.

The chain has added an element that's sure to delight the youngest customers. The kids' menus now include ""How to Train Your Dragon"" themed toys. These toys are designed to connect with the story and characters from the movie, increasing children's excitement when visiting Burger King.

Burger King Goes Much Further

The experience doesn't end there. Burger King has launched an interactive game on its mobile app. Customers can play and win prizes related to the promotion.

Among the prizes are gift cards for AMC Theatres, the movie theater chain where the film can be enjoyed. There's also a trip to Universal Orlando Resort, a very popular destination among families.

This initiative not only aims to attract customers, but also to keep them loyal. By offering prizes and fun, Burger King creates a stronger connection with its consumers. This strategy also puts McDonald's on the spot, as they have traditionally led promotions linked to children's movies.

Burger King has shown that it's willing to innovate and compete aggressively in the U.S. market. Betting on such a beloved franchise as ""How to Train Your Dragon"" is a calculated move to capture the attention of the family audience.

This campaign comes at a time when competition in the fast food sector is more intense than ever. Chains are seeking to differentiate themselves not only with the quality of their food, but with experiences that attract different customer segments.

The combination of themed food, toys, and an interactive game with prizes turns a visit to Burger King into more than just a meal. It's an event that can attract the whole family and generate a greater flow of customers.

Ultimately, Burger King has managed to create a complete and appealing promotion. By integrating the movie, the food, and the prizes, the chain positions itself strongly in a highly competitive market.

This initiative could mark a turning point in how fast food chains design their promotional campaigns.

The road to better EV batteries has been decades in the making, but the next big breakthrough might be right around the corner.","Press Release

It’s easy to think of electric vehicles as a modern innovation, but over a century ago, they dominated the streets. In 1900, lead-acid batteries provided a range of up to 100 miles, which was quite remarkable at the time. As roads improved and vehicles became faster though, these heavy, low-energy-density batteries struggled to keep up. Internal combustion engines took over, and EVs faded into history.

Fast forward to 1996. An American manufacturer launched an all-electric car that relied on the same lead-acid technology from a hundred years before. Its second generation, also equipped with nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, failed to compete with gasoline-powered vehicles. The problem? Energy density. These batteries simply couldn’t store enough power to make EVs practical for daily use.

Then, in 1998, A Japanese manufacturer introduced an EV with a lithium-ion battery. It didn’t make headlines, but in hindsight, it marked a turning point. Lithium-ion technology could store up to three times more energy than lead-acid batteries and about twice as much as NiMH. A decade later, the world finally took notice.

However, “lithium-ion” is not a single technology but an umbrella term for several distinct chemistries. Most rely on a graphite anode, but the real advancements come from the cathode.

Early lithium-ion batteries combined lithium with nickel, cobalt, or manganese. Over time, manufacturers fine-tuned these blends to balance energy density, safety, and cost. One thing has remained consistent: the industry has been reducing cobalt content, which is both expensive and ethically controversial, in favor of high-nickel formulations.

Another chemistry, lithium iron phosphate (LFP), has taken off for its affordability and safety. The trade-off? Slightly less energy storage. Yet, by 2024, LFP and nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries are expected to power 94% of light electric vehicles worldwide, according to S&P Global Mobility.

The improvements aren’t just on paper. A recent study by Geotab found that EV batteries now degrade at just 1.8% per year, down from 2.3% in 2019. At this rate, batteries could last over 20 years—far exceeding concerns about longevity.

Companies like VinFast are capitalizing on these advancements. Their vehicles integrate cutting-edge battery management systems designed to extend battery life and improve safety.

But they’re not stopping there. VinFast is actively investing in battery research and collaborating with leading partners to develop the next wave of EV technology. Their confidence shows in their industry-leading warranties—spanning seven to ten years, depending on the model. For EV buyers, that means less worry and more miles on the road.

What’s Next for EV Batteries?

Looking ahead, two emerging technologies could change everything.

Solid-state batteries replace flammable liquid electrolytes with stable, solid materials. This shift could boost energy storage by 50-80% while reducing fire risk.

Sodium-ion batteries offer another breakthrough. Instead of relying on lithium, they use abundant sodium, making them cheaper and more sustainable. Their energy density is lower than LFP, but they excel in safety and cold-weather performance.

Both technologies still have challenges to overcome, but advancements are picking up speed. As costs fall and performance improves, EVs could soon surpass gas-powered cars in both longevity and reliability.

The road to better EV batteries has been decades in the making, but the next big breakthrough might be right around the corner.",,N,,2025-06-08 05:01:20.029554

Barclays analysts following the closing arguments came away with mixed views.

“We listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better, in terms of GOOGL stock price impact,” analyst at Barclays said.

A decision is expected in late July or early August, and any measures could begin 60 days later.

Barclays flagged the potential cancellation of Google’s traffic acquisition costs and ad syndication deals as the biggest financial risks, estimating they could account for up to 20% of gross profit globally, or 10% if applied only to the U.S. market.

While a forced sale of Google’s Chrome browser still appears unlikely, Barclays said the odds have “increased” and called such a move a major blow to GOOGL but a significant win for any acquirer, citing names like OpenAI.

The global population continues to grow at a rapid clip, with the United Nations (UN) forecasting that there will 11.2 billion people by 2100, up from 8.1 billion now.","In a world that increasingly feels volatile and perplexing, a seismic shift in the paradigms guiding global economics is underway. In this commentary provided by Project Syndicate (PS), Dambisa Moyo, an international economist, and author of four New York Times best-selling books, advise policymakers and business leaders to recalibrate their mental models to address three transformative structural dynamics: the ebb and flow of capital, relentless demographic shifts, and the ideological divides fracturing global unity.

As the world becomes more volatile and confusing, policymakers, business leaders, and investors will need to rethink the mental models they use to analyse the global economy. Specifically, they should pay attention to three structural dynamics that are altering the global landscape: capital flows, demographic shifts, and political ideology, which are ushering in a more fragmented and siloed world.

Changes to capital flows are driven largely by regulatory requirements (such as the US ban on investments in China) and investors' pursuit of new opportunities for higher returns across sectors and regions. The United States currently represents nearly 70pc of stock-market capitalisation worldwide, attracting more than 70pc of flows into the 13 trillion dollars global market for private investments, which include equity and credit. This is true despite the recent sell-off.

The US stock market is where investors can generate the most attractive returns, as the US is a global leader in innovation with broad, liquid, and deep capital markets.

But global debt has reached 237pc of world GDP, raising concerns about who owns outstanding liabilities and the extent to which there is hidden leverage in the global financial system. The US government alone owes 36 trillion dollars (or 124pc of GDP), a large proportion of which is held by China, with which relations are strained.

Hidden leverage and the shadow banking sector's debts could become a problem. According to S&P Global, shadow banks held 63 trillion dollars in financial assets at the end of 2022, representing 78pc of global GDP. And, further analysis has also shown that in 2024, shadow banking accounted for 70pc of US mortgage origination and leveraged lending. Investors and business leaders will need to ask themselves who holds what debt, and where debt obligations and major pools of financial leverage may lie.

The second big worry concerns demographics. The global population continues to grow at a rapid clip, with the United Nations (UN) forecasting that there will 11.2 billion people by 2100, up from 8.1 billion now. Already, almost 90pc of the world's population lives in poorer emerging markets, and economically poorer regions – such as Africa, India, and the Middle East – are projected to experience population growth at or above the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.

Thus, these regions will continue to skew younger. Across Africa, 50pc to 60pc of the population is below the age of 25, compared to only 20pc across the OECD.

Other countries are aging rapidly and registering lower birth rates, with forecasts for Europe and China pointing to marked population declines. According to Eurostat, the European Union's population is projected to peak at 453.3 million in 2026, before gradually decreasing to 419.5 million by 2100. According to UN data, China's population is expected to decline below 800 million by 2100, from its current level of 1.4 billion.

Such trends have far-reaching implications for global demand and production across a wide array of commodities such as foodstuffs and energy. For example, India, with its large, poorer population, is still heavily dependent on coal and fossil fuels, as compared to renewables.

Demographic changes will also alter financial portfolios as aging populations switch from being capitalists (willing to take on risk) to rentiers (desiring stable, predictable fixed incomes). But markets will also have to calibrate for unprecedented intergenerational wealth transfers from baby boomers to millennials. Cerulli Associates estimates that this could amount to 84 trillion dollars by 2045.

Finally, the ideological splits across countries and regions should be factored in. The breakdown of multilateralism and the fragmentation of trade, capital flows, migration, and ideas are all being priced in, and policymakers and business leaders will have to keep these trends in mind. America's largest multinationals still generate more than half of their revenues outside the US. But they now need to consider what strained US alliances and traditional trading relationships will mean for their businesses.

For business more broadly, deglobalisation has forced a shift toward more centralised procurement, hiring, and trade in goods and services. It is also jeopardising carry trades (borrowing cheaply in New York and London to invest in higher-yielding regions) and making it harder to repatriate profits.

In the near term, the Trump administration's tariffs and deportations could affect salaries and fuel higher inflation in consumer goods, wages, and prices across sectors. Higher inflation, moreover, will likely drive up the cost of capital, which could suppress business investment. Over the long term, deglobalisation and technological advances – such as AI and quantum computing – will further entrench today's ideological splits.

Geopolitical fissures have already raised big political questions. There is a tug of war between state capitalism and market capitalism, and over the reconfiguration of alliances and country groupings. New blocs, such as the BRICS+, are vying for global influence and seeking to circumvent traditional multilateral institutions. The BRICS+ countries already represent 45pc of the world's population and 35pc of its GDP, and they are playing a growing role in the pricing and trade of many internationally traded goods and commodities.

Such developments are making it harder for countries to achieve global alignment; even previously celebrated efforts like the United Nations Climate Change Conferences have been hobbled.

As global growth slows, trade, finance, religion, energy, AI, and immigration are all being weaponised, leading to much greater complexity that will make it harder to anticipate policy outcomes. As a practical matter, added complexity and reduced visibility will likely shorten the time horizons for crucial decisions about allocating capital and human resources.

Rather than looking five years ahead, typically assumed to be the length of an economic or business cycle, investors, business leaders, and policymakers may need to think more in terms of the next 18 months. Amid so much volatility, decision-makers will have to focus on adaptability. No one can afford to commit to long-term strategies based on regulatory, geopolitical, or economic conditions that might change overnight.

Cointet expressed a slightly different view, stating that the demand for malls in Saudi Arabia is expected to rise in the coming years due to population growth.","RIYADH: Shopping malls in Saudi Arabia have strong growth prospects, as consumers increasingly prefer the convenience of retail and entertainment offerings combined under one roof, experts have told Arab News.

Strengthening the Kingdom’s retail sector, including the development of shopping destinations, is one of the crucial goals outlined in the Vision 2030 program, as Saudi Arabia aims to become a global hub of business and tourism by the end of the decade.

In June, a report by global real estate consultancy Knight Frank revealed that Riyadh is leading the Kingdom’s retail transformation, with mall rents up 4 percent in a year and 2.2 million sq. meters of new retail space planned by 2030.

According to the analysis, average mall rent in the Saudi capital rose to SR2,848 ($765) per sq. meter by the end of March, with occupancy rates up 5 percent to reach 92 percent in the first quarter of 2025.

Speaking to Arab News, Olivier de Cointet, senior adviser at management consulting firm Arthur D. Little, said that shopping malls are set to thrive in the Kingdom as they evolve into social venues rather than mere shopping destinations.

“With retailtainment, which is the fusion of retail and entertainment, becoming an essential part of the customer experience, malls play a significant role in supporting the Kingdom’s vision to become a business and tourist destination hub,” said Cointet.

He added: “These destinations enhance Saudi Arabia’s appeal as a business and tourism hotspot and keep more consumer spending within the Kingdom.”

Anthony Spary, head of retail, leasing, and offices at CBRE for the Middle East and North Africa region, echoed similar views, saying that shopping malls in the Kingdom could serve as social hubs for both locals and visitors, promoting cultural exchange and providing a platform for both international and homegrown brands.

Today’s consumer expects seamless integration between all channels, and this benefits physical as well as digital retail in terms of driving footfall, experience, and convenience.

“Malls often feature concepts such as family entertainment centers, cinemas, cultural events as well as unique anchor attractions, all of which will draw tourists and encourage repeat footfall with residents,” said Spary.

Joe Abi Akl, partner and head of Oliver Wyman’s Retail and Consumer practice for India, the Middle East and Africa, said that shopping malls in Saudi Arabia have allocated nearly half of their gross leased area to non-retail activities, which could help them serve as social and entertainment destinations.

“Shopping malls, with a pipeline exceeding 6 million sq. meters of GLA, play a vital role in this vision by offering integrated, experience-led environments. With more than 40 percent of mall space planned for non-retail activities, they’re not just commercial centers, but social and cultural anchors that enrich the Kingdom’s appeal as a leisure and lifestyle destination,” said Abi Akl.

These comments align with Saudi Arabia’s efforts to become a global hub for tourism and business by the end of the decade, with the Real Estate General Authority projecting the property market to reach $101.62 billion by 2029, representing a compound annual growth rate of 8 percent from 2024.

Shaping retail spending

CBRE’s Spary said the rising number of shopping malls in the Kingdom is expected to boost retail spending as they provide consumers with convenience and a wide variety of product choices.

“Saudi Arabia offers a unique retail landscape in the region, providing a blend of strip malls, line retail, as well as community and regional shopping districts. This new wave of shopping malls will only add to this offering and create a more varied mix for the consumer,” added Spary.

These views regarding consumer spending align with the findings of a recent report published by global consulting firm AlixPartners, which said the Kingdom’s consumer market is evolving rapidly, characterized by adaptability, shifting spending patterns, and resilience in the face of global economic challenges.

AlixPartners noted that the groceries and clothing categories are expected to remain key spending sectors in 2025, with consumers prioritizing value-driven deals and savings.

Craig Watson, head of retail at JLL in the Kingdom, stated that the development of several high-quality retail centers will transform the consumer experience across Saudi Arabia, offering a wide array of choices and ultimately boosting overall spending.

“When regions go through extensive and rapid growth, the consumer is always the winner, with increased supply providing new and exciting concepts to experience. The retail mix, success, and execution of these places will ultimately determine the share of wallet and who benefits most,” said Watson.

In February, during the Retail Leaders Circle, Abdellah Iftahy, senior partner at McKinsey and Co., said that the Kingdom’s retail sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by a digitally savvy young population and increasing consumer confidence.

He added that by 2035, 75 percent of retail spending is expected to come from the Saudi youth.

E-commerce vs. shopping malls

Although the growth of e-commerce in Saudi Arabia may pose challenges for traditional retail formats, it can also complement the development of malls in the Kingdom, according to experts.

Watson notes that the Kingdom has emerged as a major e-commerce hub in the Middle East and North Africa, driven by its young, tech-savvy population and expanding internet coverage.

He believes the growth of the e-commerce sector will not negatively impact the operations of shopping malls nationwide.

“As is the case with every region, the overwhelming majority of retail sales is derived from brick-and-mortar transactions. Malls will need to adapt by integrating technology, enhancing the customer experience and offering unique in-person experiences that cannot be replicated online,” said Watson.

According to Spary, many consumers still prefer the tactile experience of shopping in person, and malls can integrate e-commerce by offering click-and-collect services.

“Malls can serve as experiential spaces where brands showcase their products, attracting customers who enjoy the physical shopping experience. Taking into account both cultural shopping preferences as well as the impact of the climate on consumer behavior, increasing e-commerce penetration will add to the overall omnichannel approach that retailers are adopting across the region,” said Spary.

Sundeep Khanna, partner at ADL, said that the growth of the e-commerce sector is not cannibalising shopping malls, but is actually complementing them.

“Today’s consumer expects seamless integration between all channels, and this benefits physical as well as digital retail in terms of driving footfall, experience, and convenience,” said Khanna.

Attracting international brands

Spary told Arab News that the transformation and upgrade of retail offerings in the market of Saudi Arabia will pave the way for new international brands to enter and grow within the Kingdom, contributing to the country’s wider economic goals.

According to the CBRE official, the entry of new brands will not only enhance consumer choices but also stimulate a competitive environment that encourages brand expansion and attracts investment.

“CBRE is currently seeing record levels of demand from international brands looking to expand into the region. This demand is likely to continue given the robust and ever-maturing nature of this market,” said Spary.

Cointet noted that Saudi Arabia has become an attractive destination for global fashion, luxury, and food and beverage retailers, drawn by the population’s strong spending power and the rise of premium mall spaces such as Riyadh Park and Mall of Arabia.

“Mall expansion goes hand-in-hand with pro-investment reforms — for example, Saudi Arabia now allows 100 percent foreign ownership in the retail sector, encouraging international companies and developers to invest directly,” added Cointet.

The Arthur D. Little official further stated that the expansion of shopping malls in the Kingdom will also provide local brands with unprecedented opportunities to establish a national and international footprint.

“This is critical for developing the Saudi economy and I anticipate we will see more Saudi-owned brands enter the world stage in the coming years,” added Cointet.

Potential challenges

The experts also highlighted some of the challenges in Saudi Arabia’s retail landscape, particularly surrounding shopping malls, including oversupply.

“Whilst there’s certainly a risk of oversupply with many large projects due to be delivered over the course of the next two to three years, the need for continuous innovation and adaptation to changing consumer trends will be crucial for the sustainability of shopping malls in the Kingdom,” said Spary.

The CBRE official further said that new attractions, entertainment options, and cultural elements will play a pivotal role in reshaping the retail landscape in the market.

Spary added that the integration of these features will create a more engaging and immersive experience for consumers, ultimately redefining how shopping is perceived and enjoyed in the Kingdom.

Cointet expressed a slightly different view, stating that the demand for malls in Saudi Arabia is expected to rise in the coming years due to population growth.

He explained that this challenge could be addressed by developing large-format mega malls that serve as destinations in themselves, alongside smaller community malls designed to offer convenience at the local level.

In April, a separate analysis by S&P Global said that oversupply, changing retail preferences, and pressure on rental yields amid elevated capital expenditure by landlords could exert pressure on the Kingdom’s retail sector.

According to the US-based agency, the volume of retail projects in the pipeline raises the risk of potential oversupply, particularly in secondary locations where demand may not be sufficient to absorb new retail spaces.

Discussing the risk of oversupply, Cointet said: “Saudi Arabia’s aggressive development pipeline of new retail space underway — raises the risk of too much supply coming to market, which could pressure occupancies and rents in some areas, or even threaten the launch of some of the programs.”

He added: “Landlords and developers may need to differentiate their properties with unique experiences, dining, and entertainment offerings — and even offer lease incentives — to avoid saturation and keep shoppers engaged in an evolving retail landscape.”",,N,,2025-06-08 05:01:25.131089

Once overhead costs are added, that number suggests Tesla is likely losing money on its insurance program.

To keep EV adoption on track, several policies and tools are helping to offset the cost of going electric.","Tesla's homegrown insurance venture, once touted as a smarter way to cover its cars, is facing serious headwinds — and it's the drivers who may end up footing the bill.

For years, Tesla Insurance promised lower costs by leaning into what the company claimed was a unique advantage: real-time driving data and deep familiarity with its own cars. But a new report suggests those ambitions may be unraveling.

With insurance costs for Tesla owners already being high, this latest development could make electric vehicle ownership even less affordable for everyday consumers.

What's happening?

According to new data from S&P Global, Tesla Insurance reported a loss ratio of 92.5% in 2023, meaning the company paid out 92.5 cents in claims for every dollar it brought in through premiums. Once overhead costs are added, that number suggests Tesla is likely losing money on its insurance program.

In 2019, Tesla began to roll out its insurance products in select U.S. states to help bring down notoriously high premiums for its vehicles. The company leaned on its tech-heavy features, like Autopilot and real-time Safety Scores, to personalize rates. Still, Tesla owners have mixed reviews, with some struggling to secure better quotes than they'd get elsewhere.

This latest report contradicts Tesla's repeated claims that its vehicles are less likely to crash and cheaper to repair. If that were the case, its insurance program would be thriving, not floundering.

Why is this concerning?

If Tesla Insurance continues to underperform, it could lead to higher premiums or more limited coverage options for drivers. It's not just frustrating; it could also make switching to an EV more difficult for people already weighing cost concerns, which also has broader consequences.

A slowdown in EV adoption, particularly among more budget-conscious consumers, risks slowing down our shift away from gas-powered cars, which produce pollution that contributes to the overheating of our planet.

This isn't the first sign of turbulence for Tesla. The company's 2025 sales have seen a slump, including a 62% drop in new registrations in the U.K. and the recalls linked to its Autopilot software. Together, these stories paint a picture of a company under increasing pressure to maintain its once-dominant position in the EV space.

What's being done about it?

To keep EV adoption on track, several policies and tools are helping to offset the cost of going electric. Federal tax credits, including up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models, can reduce the upfront cost of buying electric. Some states also offer additional rebates or incentives.

If you're shopping for insurance on an electric car, be sure to compare quotes across providers and check whether features like real-time tracking or usage-based pricing will actually benefit you. As EV tech evolves, informed choices can help you save money and stay on the road to a cleaner future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-recAtglsHXJSlA8kk.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 22:01:22.319721

At €2,280 million, sales were slightly down on the previous year’s figure (€2,395 million).
The free cash flow was once again significantly positive at €51 million (previous year: €56 million).
HEIDELBERG ended financial year 2024/25 with a high level of incoming orders.
This is emphasized by the high level of incoming orders at May’s China Print trade show, which will have a positive impact in the new financial year.","Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HEIDELBERG) is starting financial year 2025/26 on a strong note. Based on its global market position, its portfolio expansion in strategic growth markets, and a much-improved cost basis, and despite a difficult economic climate, the company is expecting a slight increase in sales to around €2,350 million in the new financial year and an adjusted operating margin of up to 8%.

It sees growth potential in a number of areas. These include playing a leading role as a systems integrator for packaging and digital printing with hybrid printing solutions, combining software and service business in a digital ecosystem, and expanding the operation of charging infrastructure, including DC technology.

HEIDELBERG is also expecting a big boost from the Asia/Pacific region. Healthy incoming orders at May’s China Print trade show confirmed this and created the basis for a successful start to the new financial year.

“Significant strategic and operational improvements have paved the way for further profitable growth,” says Jürgen Otto, CEO of HEIDELBERG. “Our measures will make a substantial contribution to the expected increase in sales. Enhanced efficiency and performance will further boost our profitability. Encouragingly, the capital market is also increasingly acknowledging our focus on economic efficiency and liquidity,” he added.

In financial year 2024/25, HEIDELBERG held its own in a difficult market environment and met its targets. The adjusted EBITDA margin remained stable at 7.1%, for example, ending the financial year on a successful note. The cost-cutting and efficiency measures initiated by the company successfully compensated for a slightly lower volume of sales than in the previous year, rising wage costs, and expenses relating to the drupa trade show.

In the fourth quarter alone, the adjusted EBITDA margin doubled compared with the previous year and reached around 10%. At €2,280 million, sales were slightly down on the previous year’s figure (€2,395 million). Following a weak first quarter due to purchasing restraint ahead of the drupa industry trade show, sales during the financial year increased quarter by quarter and were particularly strong in the fourth quarter. The free cash flow was once again significantly positive at €51 million (previous year: €56 million).

HEIDELBERG ended financial year 2024/25 with a high level of incoming orders. In the fourth quarter, the figure of €611 million for incoming orders was up on the previous quarters of the financial year. One reason for this is the company’s global and diversified setup, which enables HEIDELBERG to benefit from the different growth dynamics in the individual regions. This is emphasized by the high level of incoming orders at May’s China Print trade show, which will have a positive impact in the new financial year.

During financial year 2024/25 as a whole, HEIDELBERG generated incoming orders of around €2,433 million, which was 6% up on the previous year’s level (€2,288 million). This also resulted in a corresponding big increase in the order backlog as at March 31, 2025 – from €652 million on the same reference date the previous year to €722 million. The Packaging Solutions and Print Solutions segments benefited from the product innovations presented at drupa.

Their incoming orders for financial year 2024/25 both increased – by around 7% to €1,272 million for the Packaging Solutions segment and by about 6% to €1,155 million for the Print Solutions segment.

“Thanks to the improving order situation and the positive momentum from the China Print trade show, we are expecting a better start to the new financial year than we had the previous year,” said Dr. David Schmedding, chief technology & sales officer at HEIDELBERG. “Our new portfolio of very large format presses for packaging reaffirms our approach of gradually further expanding our portfolio in growth segments.”",https://www.inkworldmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/07/ink-favicon.png,N,,2025-06-07 21:01:08.337960

Britain will boost its world-leading status in research and innovation with a bumper funding package worth more than £22.5 billion a year in 2029/2030. From exploring new drug treatments and longer lasting batteries, to new AI breakthroughs, the package will drive new jobs and economic growth as well as ensuring the UK leads the way in pioneering the technologies of the future.

It comes ahead of the Spending Review, where the Chancellor will set out how the government will invest in Britain’s renewal by investing in the people’s priorities: health, security and the economy. The Chancellor will outline this government’s laser focus on investing in Britain’s renewal through projects that will bring jobs and prosperity, putting more money in working people’s pockets.

The new R&D package will mean local leaders have government backing to develop ‘innovation clusters’ across the country, to unlock the talent and opportunity in every region and nation.

It is those with skin in the game who know what is best for their region. That’s why, through the new Local Innovation Partnerships Fund, local leaders will be given the powers to decide how to target their research investment in the region and make the most of skill sets of the community, boosting high skilled jobs and igniting growth across the country, the core mission of the government’s Plan for Change.

The package will see every corner of the country benefit. In Liverpool, that means leveraging its expertise in life sciences to accelerate drug discovery, in Northern Ireland that means harnessing its reputation for cutting edge defence equipment to shore up our national security. And in South Wales, it means boosting expertise in designing cutting edge semiconductors that power the devices like mobile phones and electric cars we rely on every day to support growth and new jobs in those regions.

The new funding will build on work already underway to transform local communities through the Innovation Accelerator pilot scheme – a new funding approach and partnership between local authorities and government. It has supported new technology developed by the Greater Manchester advanced diagnostic accelerator, delivering quicker and cheaper detection for liver, heart and lung diseases, whilst Moonbility from the West Midlands is using AI software helping train companies to simulate, in real time, potential disruption to the network so they can alert passengers on delay length, giving advice on replanning journeys.

This government is making investments in Britain’s future that will deliver dividends for decades to come. Every £1 invested in R&D generates up to £7 in benefits to the UK economy and leverages double in private investment in the long run, with businesses that receive their first R&D grant funding seeing jobs and turnover go up by over 20% in the following years – providing a major boost to the UK economy. R&D is also at the heart of around 3 million jobs in the UK, with the power to create many more as discoveries advance.

The announcement comes ahead of London Tech Week, the UK’s flagship technology festival, with more expected in the coming days, as this government doubles down on plans to ensure the UK is once again open for business and setting the conditions for a decade of national renewal and the economic growth that is at the heart of our Plan for Change.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:

Britain is the home of science and technology. Through the Plan for Change, we are investing in Britain’s renewal to create jobs, protect our security against foreign threats and make working families better off.

Science and Technology Secretary, Peter Kyle, said:

R&D is the very foundation of the breakthroughs that make our lives easier and healthier – from new medicines enabling us to live longer, more fulfilled lives to developments in AI giving us time back, from easing our train journeys through to creating the technology we need to protect our planet from climate change.

Incredible and ambitious research goes on in every corner of our country, from Liverpool to Inverness, Swansea to Belfast, which is why empowering regions to harness local expertise and skills for all of our benefit is at the heart of this new funding – helping to deliver the economic growth at the centre of our Plan for Change.

Alongside this, nearly £5 million is being invested to kickstart a new partnership between the high-growth regions of Manchester and Cambridge, strengthening the link between these hubs of innovation to attract more business investment, and pilot new approaches to collaboration, setting examples for cities, universities and governments worldwide.

Richard Parker, Mayor of the West Midlands, said:

This is exactly how we turn our potential into progress. This investment backs regions to lead the way in the industries that will define the future.

From life sciences and advanced manufacturing to clean energy and AI, regions across the UK have the skills and the ideas - they just need the investment and the power to match.

This will drive innovation that not only grows the economy but creates jobs, builds opportunity, improves health and changes lives.

North East Mayor Kim McGuinness said:

Our region is already an advanced manufacturing powerhouse and this announcement boosts my mission to create new growth, new jobs and new opportunities in 2 exciting ways.

We will now be able to support more research and development projects in established sectors, like the car industry and green energy, which are cornerstones of the North East economy, and we can also invest in new technologies from kitchen table innovations to our fast-emerging trailblazers in the space industry and AI.

Notes to editors

The fund would give dedicated awards of at least £30 million to each of the 7 Established Mayoral Strategic Authorities in England - Greater Manchester, West Midlands, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Liverpool City Region, North East, and Greater London as well as to one equivalent region in each of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to be agreed with devolved governments. The fund will also include a competition, which will be open to all other parts of the UK. This will similarly support high potential innovation clusters to grow, and be based on a principle of co-creation with UKRI. This will allow us build on the strengths that we know exist across the country.

Following a review of the Treasury’s Green Book, the Chancellor to invest billions in the regions to support economic growth, making deliberate choices to stabilise the public finances in invest in Britain’s renewal. This announcement on R&D follows on the back off £15.6 billion of government investment in local transport in city regions in the North, Midlands and South West, which also empowers local leaders to make the best investment decisions for their areas which they know best and ensure value for money.
