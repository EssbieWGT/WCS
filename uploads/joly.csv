Why it matters: Social media has been full of questions about what the unusual arrangement means for Groq employees — both those heading to Nvidia and those staying put.

Catch up quick: Groq and Nvidia on Wednesday announced a ""non-exclusive licensing agreement,"" with media reports accurately pegging the deal value at around $20 billion.

The companies said that Groq CEO Jonathan Ross and president Sunny Madra would join Nvidia, while Groq would continue to operate as a standalone company led by new CEO Simon Edwards (who had been CFO).

It's an unusual structure, but the latest in a recent spate of Big AI deals that seem designed to avoid tripping antitrust wires.

Behind the scenes: Most Groq shareholders will receive per-share distributions tied to the $20 billion valuation, according to sources.

Around 85% will be paid up-front, while another 10% is paid midyear 2026 and the remainder at the end of 2026.

Around 90% of Groq employees are said to be joining Nvidia, and they will be paid cash for all vested shares. Their unvested shares will be paid out at the $20 billion valuation, but via Nvidia stock that vests on a schedule.

There are also around 50 members of that group whose entire stock packages are being accelerated and paid out in cash.

Remaining Groq employees will also be paid for vested shares, plus will receive a package that includes economic participation in the ongoing company.

Any Groq employee — staying or leaving — with the company for less than one year will have their vesting cliff dropped, so they can get some up-front liquidity.

By the numbers: Groq had raised around $3.3 billion in venture capital funding since its 2016 founding, including a $750 million infusion this past fall at nearly a $7 billion post-money valuation.

Backers include Social Capital, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, Samsung, 1789 Capital, Cisco, D1, Cleo Capital, Altimeter, Firestreak Ventures, Conversion Capital and Modi Venture.

The company has never done a secondary tender for either employees or investors.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is one of the one of the stocks Jim Cramer was bullish on due to share buyback activity. Cramer said, “we think the world of” the company’s CEO, as he commented:

“Fourth is a bank that I’ve come to like very much over the past couple years, and that’s BNY, the old Bank of New York Mellon. BNY shrunk its share count by 36.2% since the end of 2015, even if the stock wasn’t a real outperformer until more recently. Under CEO Robin Vince, we think the world of him, a Goldman Sachs alum who’s been leading BNY for the past three years or so. The nation’s oldest bank has found new life. They focus on selling their entire suite of financial services to investors rather than marketing this stuff as one-off products. And they’ve also leaned heavily into technology, including AI, maybe the most of all the banks I follow. It’s truly working as the stock’s nearly tripled in a little more than two years.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) provides financial services, including investment management, custody, clearing, and wealth planning. The company also offers banking, trading, and cash management solutions. Cramer mentioned the company during the July 15 episode and remarked:

“This morning, everybody was focused on the numbers from the big banks, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, but they were also watching the report from BNY, and that’s the old Bank of New York Mellon. This is one of the top custodial banks in America. And this morning, BNY reported another strong quarter with easy top and bottom line beats, not to mention a stunning nearly 28% return on something called tangible common equity. That’s one of the best results I’ve ever seen from a bank. BNY even raised its full-year net interest income forecast with the quarter. Very few did that.”

Why value investors missed Nvidia Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks.
Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.
Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019.
The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability.","In his 1992 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, said, ""We think the very term 'value investing' is redundant."" In other words, seeking value is the only way to invest. Given Buffett's affinity for value investing and his incredible success over the years, many investors seek to emulate his approach to stocks.

Unfortunately, most value investors miss the forest for the trees. And I'll explain how by using Nvidia (NVDA +3.80%) -- the best-performing large-cap stock of the past decade -- as an example.

Yes, I know it's a cherry-picked example. But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way. It's important to recognize the misconception that holds investors back from life-changing opportunities.

Why value investors missed Nvidia

Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks. And cheapness is measured by comparing the value of the company with something from its financial results, including profits.

Let's say a company is valued at $50 billion and only has $50 million in net income. This stock would be valued at 1,000 times its earnings. In other words, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (a popular valuation metric) would be 1,000. Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.

In 2019, Nvidia's market cap, the value of the company, was around $100 billion. But its average P/E ratio for the year was 35, as the chart below shows.

The average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is somewhere around 25. Anything above that has an above-average valuation and is considered expensive by value investors. Nvidia in 2019, therefore, would have been too pricey to buy.

Value investors believe that the best value stocks to buy trade at a P/E ratio below the average. And often, value investors think that the cheaper a stock is, the better.

However, Nvidia has gone on to outperform virtually every other publicly traded company since the start of 2020, despite having an above-average P/E ratio. In short, value investing, as traditionally approached, prevented some investors from buying one of the greatest stocks of our time.

How to improve the value mindset

There's another important quote from Buffett that needs to be considered here. In the same letter, he wrote, ""Growth is always a component in the calculation of value."" In other words, value investors must look ahead when looking for a bargain.

Herein lies the problem with value investing as it's usually done: The P/E ratio (and others) measures past results. But investors must buy stocks today, looking ahead to what the business results could be tomorrow.

Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019. But the P/E ratio didn't reflect the company's superb future earnings growth. As the chart below shows, the stock price is up nearly 3,000% in the last five years, but its earnings per share (EPS) are up even more than that.

Nvidia has earned $100 billion in net income over the past year. The stock traded at 35 times trailing earnings in 2019, which looked expensive. But for those with foresight, the entire value of the company then was equal to its profits right now, which is about as cheap as a stock could possibly be.

On a personal note, I missed Nvidia stock in 2019, not because of its pricey P/E ratio, but rather because I didn't foresee earnings growth of this magnitude. I didn't believe that the current build-out for AI infrastructure would be so big and last for so long. And in a traditionally cyclical space, I worried that overestimating demand would lead to lower margins at Nvidia.

I was dead wrong, and that underscores why investing is hard. Looking at a P/E ratio or a market cap is easy. Predicting where the world is going, how a company is positioned, and what that means financially is a tall order. It's why even the best investors often make mistakes.

The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability. The best stocks for the next 10 years might not look like value stocks right now. But they will be a tremendous value in hindsight.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F847355%2Fyoung-man-sitting-pensively-at-his-computer-looking-thoughtfully-at-the-screen-in-front-of-him.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-21 11:01:15.684515

This three-year partnership deal between OpenAI and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has the potential to change how Hollywood creates content and it marks a key moment in Hollywood’s embrace of generative AI. It also sidesteps worries about AI hurting jobs or intellectual property rights.

Under the licensing agreement, starting early in 2026, Sora and ChatGPT Images will generate videos with Disney characters like Mufasa, Cinderella, and Mickey Mouse. The deal does not include any talent likenesses or voices.

The Walt Disney Company’s (NYSE:DIS) CEO, Bob Iger, said that this collaboration will carefully expand the company’s storytelling with generative AI. It will also respect and protect creators and their work.

Iger first hinted at this strategy during a November investor call, where he noted that AI would let The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) offer tools to help Disney+ users make and enjoy user-generated content, primarily in short form. Under the agreement, a selection of user-generated videos will become available for streaming on Disney+. This will allow the platform to benefit from the growing appeal for short-form video content.

“These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.” In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics.
“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said.
“Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace.
“Whoever cracks scale, cost efficiency and supply resilience in batteries will define the next phase of EV leadership in India,” Bharadwaj said.","Electric two-wheelers will continue to anchor electric vehicle (EV) adoption in India, while passenger cars are set to emerge as the fastest-growing segment from 2026, according to a recent assessment by Capgemini. The consulting firm said strong total cost of ownership benefits, improving charging access and rapid digitisation of vehicles will drive the next phase of EV growth across regions and city tiers.

“Globally, passenger cars will still dominate EV volumes, but in markets like India the deepest penetration will come from two- and three-wheelers and last-mile commercial vehicles,” said Anuraag Bharadwaj, Industry Platform Leader for Automotive – India at Capgemini. “These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.”

In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics. At the same time, passenger EVs are expected to see sharp year-on-year growth as charging infrastructure expands and product options widen across cities.

Beyond the Sale

Technology is also reshaping the two-wheeler segment. Digital display clusters are increasingly mirroring car infotainment systems, offering connected features such as navigation, diagnostics and content playback. Alongside this, software-defined vehicles (SDVs) are beginning to alter OEM business models in India. “OEMs are clearly looking beyond one-time vehicle sales,” Bharadwaj said. “Subscriptions, connected services and feature-led monetisation will become increasingly important revenue streams as consumers become more value-conscious.”

Profitability Gap

However, even as adoption accelerates, Capgemini cautioned that EV profitability in India remains constrained by weak battery localisation. Batteries account for nearly 40% of an EV’s total cost, making them the most expensive component. While localisation has improved in vehicle assembly and electronics integration, domestic battery cell manufacturing remains limited, forcing automakers to rely on imports from China and other markets.

“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said. “Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace. Without a strong domestic ecosystem for cell manufacturing and raw material processing, EV profitability in India will remain structurally constrained.” In the interim, mainstream automakers such as Mahindra are sourcing advanced battery technologies like Blade cells from BYD, a configuration expected in upcoming models including the Maruti eVitara and the Toyota Urban Cruiser EV.

A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?
3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls.","Remember when desktop 3D printing felt like the Wild West? A decade ago, anyone with a printer, some filament, and a free weekend could grab models from Thingiverse, tweak a few slicer settings, and let the machine run overnight. The process—and the prints that resulted from it—were chaotic, messy, and often frustrating, but it was also…fun? It felt like the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine, and it was, arguably, glorious.

That free-for-all experimentation era is fading fast, though. In its place? Carefully curated, tightly controlled “walled gardens” where companies make not only the hardware but also the software, the consumables, and the very marketplace where files are shared. It’s the iOS ecosystem, but for 3D printers. And the kicker? While there are protests from the edges, for the most part, it actually works, and people are growing to love it.

Keep Them Coming Back for More

When I was a young engineer starting out, I worked for an automated machinery company that serviced the sewing goods industry. Sewing machines have hundreds of moving parts, and they wear out over time. My employer took me aside once and showed me one of those parts in a spare bin. He rolled it in his hand like a poker chip. The tone in his voice grew somber as he said to me, “See this plate? This costs us $15 to import. We sell it for $400. It wears out, on average, every 4 to 6 months. Always remember: Whenever possible, sell the stapler and the staples.”

He explained to me that for the business to continue running—and to grow and keep everyone employed—the initial purchase of the machinery couldn’t be a customer's only purchase. Parts and supplies like these, with incredibly high markups, were what kept the lights on. A customer who bought a machine from us could spend upward of five to 10 times more than the cost of the machine itself over its lifespan.

Fast-forward to now. I'm no longer hawking sewing machine parts. Instead, I'm writing this story in my home office, where I tinker with and test all sorts of gadgets, including 3D printers. The office is filled with not just printers, but also filament, resin, and spare parts: ""staples,"" from floor to ceiling. Plenty of other hobbyists' and entrepreneurs' home offices look just like mine, which makes you quickly realize the oodles of cash that are up for grabs selling 3D printing accessories.

So it's only natural that the walled gardens of 3D printing are growing taller, as the big players have emerged and dug in. Depending on where you stand, that’s either a long-overdue correction or the beginning of a slow suffocation. A feature, or a fetter.

What Walled Gardens Look Like in 3D Printing

The 3D printing walled garden is the hardware, firmware, cloud slicer, material profiles, model repositories, and support resources, among other elements. If you want to print, you’re encouraged—and sometimes forced—to use only what the company that made your printer sells. This is happening in two universes at the moment: The consumer side, which is what we mostly cover at PCMag, and the professional side, where many American and European companies have found respite from Chinese competitors for the time being.

Compare that to the “open” 3D printing world that I, along with many other pioneering hobbyists, grew up in, and which still exists but is fading rapidly. In that world, you can download models from a dozen free sites, slice them in Cura or PrusaSlicer, and run whatever filament happens to be on sale this week. Need a new gasket for a DIY repair, perhaps? Don't order it from Amazon or even McMaster-Carr. Just print your own on an open-source printer. It’s cheaper, but it’s also messier and more time-consuming.

This phenomenon isn't novel, of course. Printer—paper printer—manufacturers have been pulling this trick for decades by making proprietary ink cartridges. A decade ago, HP tried to block the use of third-party ink via firmware, making you fear bricking your own printer if you tried to use another vendor’s ink. (HP later abandoned this effort, at least in part.) Apple’s App Store lives on the same principle. I can’t share songs I purchase on my Android phone with my wife, who is browsing the iTunes store next to me as I write this.

The difference, though, is that in 3D printing, the stakes involve not just money but reliability, safety, and speed—things that can make or break a newbie’s first impression.

Why Companies Are Raising the Walls

If you’re wondering why companies are doubling down on lock-ins and gathering as many customers as they can into their respective gardens, the answer is simple: control.

Support Costs Drop When You Control Every Variable

Think about it from the company's perspective: Fewer random filaments means fewer angry customers sending failed print photos to your support team—the “Why is this piece of junk not working?” tickets. It also means fewer nozzles you have to ship out, at your cost, to keep their flaming fingers out of the forums and Facebook groups long enough to get them past the jam they caused with bargain-basement filament.

Safety Improves When Resins and Filaments Are Vetted

Fewer toxic fumes mean fewer mechanical misfires. Formlabs, maker of the Form 4 I recently reviewed, claims to have eliminated the dangerous VOCs found in many resins and uses ISO certification in its resins and other ancillary products to maintain consistency. The Form 4 is therefore a favorite of pros who know exactly why things like tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation, and heat deflection are critical.

Performance Is More Consistent

Tuned profiles mean smoother prints and fewer headaches. When I was coming up in the hobby, it was assumed that you were always tweaking and adjusting; printing calibration cubes, Benchies, and temperature towers. If you didn’t know how to do those things, you were a newbie to be pitied, and most of your prints probably failed.

Those days are long gone. I recently tested the Bambu Lab H2S, which not only comes with pre-tuned slicer settings for every Bambu Lab filament but also includes equivalent settings for nearly every major filament supplier. I tested both, with flawless results and no tuning or futzing required.

Recurring Revenue From Accessories Keeps the Lights On

Printers are often sold at razor-thin margins; filament and resin make up the difference. Here's some napkin math: Assuming we’re talking about a larger brand, the gross margin on filament sales is somewhere between 40% and 70%. The net margin on 3D printers, on the other hand (after all costs and overhead), is maybe 20% or 25%. When you buy a $1,500 printer, the company makes $300 in profits. Assuming you use 50 spools of filament a year per printer, that’s another $500 per year for the life of the machine. Keeping you in the garden is good for business.

Data Loops Build Better Machines

Telemetry on what succeeds and fails feeds back into better slicers, better defaults, and tighter ecosystems. Web-connected slicers like Bambu Studio bring files offsite to a cloud server and back again, which has me concerned about possible IP theft, but let's face it: If Bambu Lab knows all about the file you were printing in a machine that can measure (via cameras and sensors) how the print went, it can learn from failed prints. Tesla monitors all the data from cars using its Full Self-Driving feature to improve the AI that makes driving decisions, and 3D printer companies can take a similar approach. Instead of telemetry data and speeds, it’s g-code and video. No one I’ve ever met who owns a Tesla is mad that their driving data goes back to the corporation, because they know it’s improving their experience. Data loops within the walled garden perform the same function.

If you were raised like me, printing your 3D bits from USB keys instead of via a web app, this can be a hard leap to make. But let's not forget that life outside the garden isn't free from data-sharing pitfalls, either. In 2021, a Thingiverse data breach potentially exposed data from hundreds of thousands of users.

The Upside for Users

Let’s be honest: most people don’t want to fiddle with firmware, PID tuning, or slicer voodoo. They want the print to work the first time. Walled gardens are delivering that in spades. People are loyal to their brands as a result, with the term “fanboy” tossed around more frequently than ever. If you are a Prusa, Bambu Lab, or Creality convert, you know that the energy in those forums is akin to football fans arguing over which team is going to win the Super Bowl this year. And fandom has its concrete benefits.

First-Print Success Rates Skyrocket

A beginner can unbox, click Print, and hold a finished part hours later. I’ve met people who’ve never had a first-layer issue, while back in the day, I would spend hours fighting with my Creality Ender 3, invoking all sorts of remedies, including hairspray, glue sticks, and prayers to whatever deity was listening, to get to the second layer.

Time Savings Are Real

No more spending 3 hours browsing a forum thread to fix a stringing issue: The maker world moves faster than it ever has. I met three vendors at a maker festival in September who cumulatively had about 500 articulated figurines for sale: $5 for three. These people earn their living from these fairs and don’t have time to spare fixing things.

Quality Is Better

Tuned profiles and real-time monitoring reduce the likelihood of failure. I recently had a client come to me asking to reverse-engineer the transparent dome light on his cooking range. The manufacturer didn’t make replacement parts, and so I scanned it and printed it with the Form 4 using Formlabs' Transparent V3 resin, which I know to be dimensionally accurate. The part measured 2.95 inches wide (75.05mm, to be exact), and it was a perfect fit.

I happily pay more for the resin, knowing I can take on those types of jobs and produce an engineered replacement that measures up to what I designed in my CAD software. There's no Wild West aspect, so the experience isn't a nail-biter, but I get great prints with pre-tuned dimensional accuracy.

Safety

Certified materials and built-in interlocks aren’t just marketing; they prevent accidents. When I load the 10-watt laser module into the Bambu Lab H2S and go to cut a part from 3mm-thick birchboard, there’s a QR code sticker in the corner that tells the cutter exactly what material I’m using. It knows what power levels to use and how fast to move the laser through the wood—all the things it needs to avoid setting the board on fire and burning my house down. I trust that over my late-night intuition just before I go to bed, with best guesses driving my g-code. I’ll pay more for that, as will most people, especially when I first start working with new materials I’m unfamiliar with.

The Downsides

Of course, just like an actual wall, the walled-garden approach has multiple sides, and there are plenty of negative ones.

Costs Creep Upward

Proprietary filaments and resins cost more, and some companies use DRM chips to prevent you from using third-party resin. It can get even more extreme than that: The Form 4 and other Formlabs printers prevent owners from using whatever resin they want in their machines unless they pay hefty unlocking fees.

Innovation Slows

When companies dictate what’s allowed, experimental materials and techniques get buried. Once a company can build a large enough user base, it controls the pace of development, as opposed to the early days when innovation leaps were required to punch through into the market.

It takes a ""black swan"" innovator to force everyone with a walled garden to catch up quickly. I believe we’re seeing this now with Snapmaker’s U1 multi-toolhead printer, which has raised more than $20.6 million on Kickstarter at this writing. Bambu Lab is now attempting to compete with its upcoming Vortek tool-changing accessory.

Marketplaces Gatekeep

File visibility isn’t always merit-based; it’s algorithmic. That means the best designs don’t always win—the best thumbnails do. When you control the keys to the kingdom, you control what files people are potentially printing on your machines.

Data Is Extracted

Every print you slice in the cloud reveals information about you, your projects, and your habits to the vendor. Privacy issues are a real concern in a world increasingly reliant on 3D printers for manufacturing, and studies have shown that IP theft is a significant risk in 3D printing. The larger the garden and the more dependent users are on it compounds the possibility of theft or hacking. There’s a tremendous element of trust involved.

Longevity Questions Loom

What happens if the company shuts down its servers or moves on from your model of printer? Suddenly, your “ecosystem” is a paperweight. This has plenty of precedent, too: Google recently discontinued the smart features of older Nest thermostats.

The only company currently providing a robust path forward for upgrades is Prusa, which is arguably being left behind in terms of features as a result. While you can turn a Prusa MK3 or MK4 into a Core One, the Core One simply doesn’t compare to an H2D or H2S, Bambu Lab’s latest models.

A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing

Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?

Prusa printers are arguably the most un-walled mainstream printers out there. The company's Printables is free and open-source, though it lacks the same monetized incentive structure of Bambu Lab's MakerWorld.

(Credit: Prusa)

Formlabs is mostly closed. Its resin and software ecosystem is locked tight, but its users largely accept it because the quality is unmatched, with dimensionally tuned and accurate outputs. Want your parts to fit together properly? You need Formlabs resin.

Stratasys has always been closed. For enterprise buyers, that’s the point: certifications, compliance, security, and contracts matter more than tinkering. Like Formlabs, Stratasys—and subsidiaries like Ultimaker—have largely retreated to the educational and professional space, with a dwindling number of consumer models available.

Elegoo, Anycubic, Qidi, and Creality occupy a fuzzier space. They've largely been open, but are moving toward curated slicers and marketplaces. Everyone sees where the market is headed, and no one wants to be left behind. Each of these companies has its own filament and resin lines, with virtually every possible color and polymer available, and “pre-tuned” slicer settings in Cura or Orca to get you started quickly without fiddling.

So, should you buy into one of these gardens? It depends on what you want.

If you prioritize reliability, enter the garden. You’ll spend more, but you’ll save time and frustration. If someone were to ask me what a good first 3D printer to buy is, and I wanted them to have the easiest setup and most enjoyable experience, I would drop them off from a theoretical helicopter directly into the middle of Bambu Lab’s garden.

If you love tinkering, stay outside. Cheap filament, third-party slicers, wild mods—the Wild West is disappearing, but it's not gone. If I were on a spaceship that needed to survive a 100-year mission, I would bring a Prusa with me, along with 10,000 rolls of Prusament. Blessed are the tinkerers, and they all wear black-and-orange shirts.

If you have the space and budget for two printers, buy one of each. Use the polished ecosystem for mission-critical prints, and reserve the tinkerer’s machine for experiments with unconventional filaments and techniques. My LulzBot TAZ 5 has been printing for 10 years now. I can put any filament I want into it (I create a makeshift heated chamber by throwing an emergency blanket over it) and keep the earliest phases of my IP private in my office. Just keep your eyes open for red flags: consumables with DRM, printers that function only via cloud slicing, or companies with a history of abandoning products.

What Will the Walled Garden of the Future Bring?

I’d bet on more walls, not fewer. Expect:

Creator subscriptions and “pro” packs. This seems inevitable to me. Platforms like MakerWorld will become more like Spotify, and designers will rise as a result.

Smarter, telemetry-driven auto-profiles. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, it’s hard to envision a world where it isn’t embedded in a machine's ROM to monitor prints via sensors and cameras.

Partially walled gardens, in which vendors still allow escape hatches but prefer you don’t use them. Bambu Lab and Formlabs provide exit hatches for third-party filaments and resins, and I suppose see the necessity of a door in and out of the garden.

Lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny. If it’s illegal for HP to stop people from loading third-party ink cartridges, as some customers have (so far unsuccessfully) argued in court, it’s inevitable that regulation will catch up to what is arguably an analogous situation with 3D printers.

The genie’s out of the bottle. 3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls. The walled gardens of 3D printing aren’t inherently evil. In many cases, they make the tech more reliable, safer, and far more approachable for the average hobbyist. Without them, adoption would stall.

But make no mistake: Every convenience comes at a cost. If you step into a garden, know the price of admission, and know that the gate may not always stay open. The best gardens don’t just protect the company—they protect the users and the creators, too.

If vendors get that balance right, maybe a wall doesn’t have to feel like a prison. Maybe it can feel like an amusement park—curated, safe, and pleasant, but just exciting enough to be worth wandering into.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05w23Zdc93miv2kx7tU2mqh-7.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1766003609.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 08:59:52.091490

While the headlines point to a bleak midwinter for the UK economy, if you apply enough festive cheer it is just about possible to imagine a better 2026.","Stalling growth, sticky inflation and fragile bond markets, the UK’s economic record in 2025 has hardly been one to inspire cheer. But in the spirit of the festive season, here are a few reasons to hope for a happier new year.

The first is that, barring external forces, 2026 should not involve a repeat of this year’s fiscal drama.

Rachel Reeves more than doubled the margin of error, or headroom, against her fiscal rules at last month’s budget, and that should gift the Treasury a quieter 2026.

The chancellor’s spring statement should be a non-event for another reason, too: she announced that while the Office for Budget Responsibility will still carry out a forecast, it will not formally assess her against the rules.

So as some wise men – and women – advised her to do last year, even if there has been a marked deterioration in the outlook, Reeves intends to stand firm until the autumn budget. That would mark a welcome contrast with the tax and spend saga of the past year (though if Labour MPs choose to change the top team in Downing Street, the drama would be very much back on).

A second reason for optimism is that after a gloomy year, recent surveys have included glimmers of hope.

Official figures show Britain’s economy unexpectedly shrank in October. But the snapshot is backward-looking, assessing how activity had fared through the rear-view mirror. The latest flash purchasing managers index for December, published by data provider S&P Global, suggests things could be improving. The reading on its monthly index jumped to 52.1, from 51.2 in November – with 50 marking the divide between growth and contraction.

In the private sector, S&P said, “the rise in new business was the strongest for 14 months and mainly reflected a solid improvement in demand across the service economy”.

It would make sense that if, as many business groups have claimed, the chaotic budget buildup killed confidence, we should get a modest uptick in activity now that it is over.

Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, says that chimes with what he is hearing from member companies.

“There was a general sense that things got quite a lot better from the first week of September, and October, then the brakes went on a little bit in November, because of pre-budget chat.”

He adds: “[Hiring] won’t come back this month because it’s December, but quite a few people are quite hopeful about what comes through in January and February.”

A third source of optimism is the hope that consumers could respond positively to the latest Bank of England rate cut, the government’s £150-a-year energy bills relief package, and an end to months of tedious speculation over tax.

There are plenty of reasons for caution here. Not least a reluctance at the Bank to cut rates much further, despite weakness in the labour market.

But if cheaper mortgages and energy bills do help to ease the squeeze, and – whisper it – restore a bit of feelgood factor, the evidence suggests some consumers could have some financial capacity to respond.

The household savings rate – the share of income workers put away for a rainy day – has jumped to well above the long-run average since the Covid pandemic. In the second quarter of this year, it was running at 10.7% – about 2.5 percentage points higher than the 1987-2019 average.

Analysis by Michael Saunders, a former Bank rate setter, now of the consultancy Oxford Economics, suggests a heightened sense of financial insecurity is one explanation. After the jarring shock of Covid shutdowns, the energy price spike, and soaring interest rates, that would make sense.

He is concerned this higher propensity to save could “cap consumer spending growth” for some time to come, dampening the economic recovery. But viewed in a festive spirit of optimism, it does indicate a capacity for some households to loosen their belts a little, if the mood should take them.

The fourth reason for hope is even more tentative, but potentially significant: recent productivity data has been improving.

In what Andrew Wishart of Berenberg bank called recently “the good news story of the year”, the key measure of economic output per worker (vital for lifting wages and living standards) rose by 1% in the first half of 2025. This puts productivity “on course to record one of its better years since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009”.

In some labour-intensive sectors, where there have been job cuts following Reeves’s changes to employer national insurance contributions (NICs), that is little more than a mathematical effect – fewer workers for a given level of GDP means more output per worker.

But Wishart’s early analysis also suggests productivity gains in other sectors, including IT. “We could plausibly be witnessing the beginnings of a boost from artificial intelligence,” he argues.

As Reeves’s former chief economic adviser, the London School of Economics academic John Van Reenen has long argued, UK businesses have tended to underinvest in technology and innovation, leaning instead on the plentiful supply of cheap workers.

Part of the largely unspoken logic of raising the minimum wage and employer NICs – which drove up the cost of hiring – was to tip the balance towards productivity-enhancing investment and innovation, which should be good for growth. Much, though, depends on the labour market’s capacity to re-absorb the workers laid-off in the process.

For investors watching analyst optimism, those steady payout decisions help frame whether the current earnings and margin momentum can support both shareholder returns and the higher valuation the stock now carries.

""While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,"" said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe's.
Walmart revamped its training program in the spring of 2024, focusing on its own workers with a tuition-free training initiative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
As of mid-November, almost 400 employees had graduated from the program, Walmart said.
Walmart said its goal is to put 4,000 workers through the training program by 2030.","BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- As the number of skilled tradespeople dwindles in the United States, Walmart is trying to build up its own workforce to keep conveyor belts moving, refrigerated grocery cases cold, and drains and parking lots flowing.

The nation's largest retailer and private employer revamped its training program last year to increase the pipeline of maintenance technicians who do everything from repair equipment to electrical work at Walmart's distribution centers and stores -- jobs that have become increasingly difficult to fill because of a shrinking labor pool.

The shortage has opened opportunities for people like Liz Cardenas, 24, who started at Walmart in May 2023 as an automation equipment operator at a distribution center in Lancaster, Texas, making sure boxes were securely taped and went through a conveyer belt upright. Today, she is responsible for fixing conveyor belts and other equipment when they break at distribution centers.

Cardenas, who nearly doubled her hourly pay to $43.50 per hour, said she plans to pursue more training, which will mean an even higher salary and more responsibility. It also means financial freedom.

""I was able to move out of my parents' house,"" she said. ""I have my own apartment. I was able to get a car, and and I'm able to give more to my 401(k).""

A surge of retirements, along with a slowdown in immigration that began during the pandemic but now is accelerating with President Donald Trump's aggressive deportations, are among the main factors behind labor shortages that bedevil some employers, analysts say.

But in skilled trades, the problem is even more acute. Consulting firm McKinsey analyzed 12 types of trade job categories, including maintenance technicians, welders, and carpenters, and predicted an estimated imbalance of 20 job openings for every one net new employee from 2022 to 2032.

McKinsey noted ""the extraordinary rate of churn"" could cost companies more than $5.3 billion every year in talent acquisition and training costs alone.

The shortages are happening as some companies are also laying off workers amid rising operational costs from new tariffs, shifting consumer spending and increased spending on artificial intelligence.

Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of CEOs from roughly 150 companies representing millions of employees nationwide, launched in June a new initiative to address worker shortages in skilled trades, including maintenance technicians. The initiative, co-championed by home improvement retailer Lowe's, entails working with elementary, middle and high schools to raise awareness.

""While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,"" said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe's.

For its part, Lowe's in 2022 started a 90-day online training program for employees who want to pursue jobs like carpentry and utility maintenance. Separately, its charitable arm has invested $43 million since 2023 to 60 organizations including technical colleges and non-profit groups to help recruit and train skilled tradespeople like maintenance technicians and plumbers.

Mervin Jebaraj of the University of Arkansas's Walton College of Business in Fayetteville, Arkansas, noted these programs will help ease the shortages, but they won't eliminate the gap, particularly given Trump's clampdown on immigration.

""For as long as somebody physically needs to fix this, the shortage will persist, even though on the margins it'll mitigate some of the shortage,"" he said. ""We don't have enough people.""

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently told The Associated Press he believes part of the reason for the shortages is ""lack of awareness.""

""I think most Americans probably don't know what a tech makes that helps take care of our stores and clubs and that we can help them learn how to be a tech,"" he said. ""So we have a need to get the word out so that people know there are some great jobs.""

Walmart revamped its training program in the spring of 2024, focusing on its own workers with a tuition-free training initiative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. This year, it added new training sites in Vincennes, Indiana, and Jacksonville, Florida. The initiative combines hands-on instruction and classroom learning in fields like heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical work, and general maintenance.

As of mid-November, almost 400 employees had graduated from the program, Walmart said. With its first class of 108 associates who completed the Dallas/Fort Worth pilot program, every graduate secured a technician role, putting them on a path to earn an average of $32 per hour. Walmart said its goal is to put 4,000 workers through the training program by 2030.

R.J. Zanes, vice president of facility services for the U.S. divisions of Walmart and Sam's Club, said Walmart was able to attract workers from all over the country with different backgrounds, including employees running cash registers.

Maintenance technician roles are crucial to keeping Walmart's operations running smoothly, but especially so during the holiday season. For example, if a refrigeration system goes down within a Walmart store, it could cost up to $300,000 to $400,000 worth of lost product, according to Zanes.

""We've got to stay out in front of that,"" he said. ""We have to ensure that we've got the right skills there to do preventative maintenance, and when we do have a breakdown, to make sure that we get it back up as fast as possible to minimize that cost of downtime.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211816062_211816062-a2007b0fbd79460395fc47bc9686049a_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-12-21 06:59:43.031371

The mood is cautiously optimistic: the bulls still control the longer term trend, but the latest sessions show a market that is far more selective and sensitive to every new data point.

Live updates, products and investor resources on Adobe Inc. stock

One-Year Investment Performance

An investor who bought Adobe Inc. stock roughly a year ago and simply held on would today be sitting on an impressive gain, in the region of 25 to 35 percent depending on the exact entry point. That outperformance towers over the broader market and highlights how decisively the company has convinced Wall Street that its AI push and subscription engine can keep delivering double digit earnings growth. Yet that very success now fuels the main risk: sentiment has swung from skepticism to high expectations, which leaves less room for error if growth even slightly disappoints.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week, traders continued to digest Adobe’s most recent earnings update, where the company once again demonstrated resilient demand in its core Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses. Management leaned heavily into the narrative that Firefly and other AI features are already driving higher engagement and willing-to-pay among professional users, a message that resonated with growth-focused investors.

Over the past several days, commentary has also circled back to competitive pressure from both traditional rivals and new AI-native tools, particularly those from big tech platforms and upstart design apps. While there have been no shocking negative headlines, the market has treated even small hints of pricing scrutiny or slower enterprise deal cycles as a reason to lock in profits, contributing to a choppy, consolidation-style trading pattern following the earlier surge.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Wall Street research desks remain broadly constructive on Adobe. Analysts at major houses such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs still frame the shares as a Buy, with price targets that typically imply upside in the low double digits from current levels. Others, including more valuation-focused firms like Bank of America and JPMorgan, have tended toward a more balanced stance, often at Overweight or Neutral, arguing that while the long term AI monetization story is compelling, the stock already discounts much of that growth. Taken together, the consensus skews positive but not euphoric: Adobe is widely viewed as a core quality holding in software, yet its premium multiple leaves little tolerance for execution missteps.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Adobe’s business model rests on deeply embedded creative and document software, sold almost entirely via recurring cloud subscriptions and increasingly enhanced with proprietary generative AI. The company’s next leg of performance will depend on three levers: how convincingly it can upsell AI features across its large installed base, whether it can maintain pricing power in the face of new low cost rivals, and how effectively it expands deeper into marketing and experience software for large enterprises. If management executes on that strategy and macro conditions remain stable, the stock has room to grind higher from consolidation, but any sign that AI monetization is slower than promised could quickly shift today’s cautious optimism back toward a more critical, valuation-driven reset.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405044_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 09:59:41.614629
