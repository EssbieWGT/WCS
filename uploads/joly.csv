“We’re working hard to ensure our coffeehouses have the right vibe…We want to invite customers in, showcase our great coffee, provide a comfortable place to stay and make them feel like their visit was time well spent,” Niccol told investors.

“We have a clear path forward.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol briefed investors on the progress of the coffee giant’s turnaround program at its investor day Wednesday. He touted a host of changes, most of which had already been publicly disclosed, intended to revive the brand’s coffeehouse image.

But Niccol cautioned the chain is still “in the early days of our turnaround, and [has] much more to do to return the business to growth.”

The company’s medium-term future includes more changes to its in-store experience, he said.

“Imagine coffeehouses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating options, power outlets and abundant food displays, stores with more separation between the cafe and mobile order experience, featuring new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create an intuitive hand-off, and cafes anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater,” Niccol said.

Some U.S. stores have already begun testing these features, and the technology to enable them, like a mobile-ordering sequence algorithm.

“The early progress we’ve seen wouldn’t be possible without our Green Apron partners,” Niccol said.

Niccol said the chain has added several benefits, doubled parental leave and increased hours at 3,000 cafes to ensure that it was the best employer in the retail and restaurant sector. The chain is also trying to promote its managers from within.

Jasmine Leli, a Starbucks Workers United member who works at one of the first Starbucks to unionize in Buffalo, New York, told Restaurant Dive that workers issues were intertwined with efforts to revive the brand, and that aesthetic changes in the coffee shop wouldn’t solve operational issues. At her store, Leli said, there are rarely enough workers for the afternoon daypart.

“[Customers] want to be able to get in and get out when they come to pick up their orders, or they come in to place an order. And that's not always possible when you're working with a skeleton crew,” Leli said.

Niccol said Starbucks has invested considerably in its workers since he joined. But one employee has been a disproportionate recipient of that investment. According to a disclosure in the brand’s proxy statement, Niccol’s total compensation, comprised largely of bonuses and stock awards, was $97.8 million in 2024. Comparatively, the median worker, a part-time barista in the U.S. made $14,674 in 2024, per the proxy statement, meaning Niccol received 6,666 times the compensation of a representative worker.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the individual poverty line in the U.S. is $15,650. At least 50% of Starbucks workers earn less than this in total compensation per year, per the proxy statement. The median Starbucks worker earned almost exactly half of what the median waiter, fast food cook or foodservice and prep worker earned in 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“We're watching the CEO make all of this money, and we got less money in raises and they're laying people off. We want our contract to be finalized and we want Starbucks to invest money in the union workers,” Leli said.

Starbucks Workers United responds to investor day with increased pressure

Accompanying the investor day, Starbucks Workers United staged actions, including strikes, in several cities. At least 16 people were detained during sit-ins organized by SBWU, according to a press release emailed to Restaurant Dive.

SBWU members felt let down by the company’s failure to reach a contract with the union, despite its previous statements indicating it wanted to do so by the end of 2024.

Sara Kelly, the brand’s chief partner officer, said Starbucks and the union have engaged a mediator to resolve issues in bargaining for a foundational framework.

Getting to that contract, Leli said, will require a mix of continued workplace organizing, consumer action and pressure on shareholders to persuade the company to invest more in its hourly workers.

Some of the changes made have had unintended consequences, Leli said. Niccol described the elimination of some drinks, as a way to free up Starbucks to pursue culturally driven LTOs and to add new, innovative drinks like the Cortado.

But this hasn’t kept customers from ordering those drinks through laborious customizations in-store, Leli said. A frappuccino with several modifications to resemble a discontinued drink build takes longer to ring up than the old menu item would’ve.

And that hasn’t solved the problem of consumers seeking out social media-driven drink trends.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xvcdufuoTMoZETHEia52AtgE-HDEk33lBl_Uh57WZfY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8xX1lPaE02MGIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-03-13 13:05:57.213347

Full transcript - J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference 2025:

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: Hi, good morning. I’m Jeff Zekauskas. I analyze chemicals at JPMorgan. It’s my pleasure this morning to introduce the management of Ecolab. And representing Ecolab is Christophe Beck, who’s been the CEO of Ecolab since 2021.

And in my opinion, Christophe has done a really remarkable job in that the previous CEO of Ecolab was Doug Baker, and he was a very, very capable executive. But when he left Ecolab, we were a little bit post COVID. There were pressures and demand in the institutional business. There were issues around raw material inflation and pricing. And I think Christophe has really managed those issues very, very well in tandem with the Ecolab management and really revived the company from where it was three or four years ago.

So we’re very much looking forward to his presentation. And then he may have some time for questions afterward. Christophe?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Thank you so much, Jeff. Always a pleasure to see you, to be here in New York. Always a special conference for us and always an opportunity to share our success story. We’ve been one hundred and two years in business, which is unusual for an American company. But there are a few, including JPMorgan, by the way, which is great.

So I’ll share with you a bit where we’re coming from, where we are, where we’re going. And as Jeff has mentioned, so we’ll cover a few questions as well at the end. I draw your attention, obviously, on the cautionary statement since we’ll be talking about the near future and the future as well, which is not obvious to fully understand, obviously, since it’s changing a little bit on a daily basis. But we’re really trying as an organization, as a company to focus shareholder. And that’s been true for a very long time.

So for the ones a little bit less familiar with us, what we do? What’s our purpose. Our purpose is to protect what’s vital: people from infections and natural resources and doing it in a way that helps our customers improve performance. Our name, Ecolab, came from Economics Laboratory in 1923 with the promise that we would help customers do better, produce better results at a lower total cost because they use less natural resources and less labor. That was the promise in 1923.

It was always a business promise, a business idea, and it’s remaining one as well even views and sustainability are changing over time. Improving business performance the right way is something that has been at the core of who we are and who we want to be as a company. So we have the means as well of our ambitions, which is important. It’s not just a slogan out there. This is what we’ve been doing and what we’re doing on a day by day basis.

We have 48,000 people. 28,000 people of that team are serving millions of customers in the world. We helped protect one point four billion people from infection last year. We touched a third of the world food production, almost a quarter of the power, the electricity that’s being generated, which is becoming even more important, as we all know, as you know, because of what AI is requiring, and I’m going to come back as well to that in a second. And what’s important as well is that we have 3,000 people in science, in R and D, in digital technology, in data science that are helping us power all the offerings that we are providing to our customers.

And when we think about it, most of what we do is around water. And 70% of what we do is helping customers produce better outcomes while reducing their water usage, their net water usage, and ideally to get to net zero at some point as well. And in many cases, we’ve reached that as well. So we have roughly 10,000,000,000 in sales in water technologies, which makes us as well the largest water company in the world, and that’s been true for quite a while. And we keep growing and performing very well because of that promise.

We are protecting the most trusted brand out there in all industries. We serve 40 different end markets. So it can be in industrials, like many companies that have been presenting over the last few days as well. It can be an institutional market. What it means for us, it’s restaurants, it’s hotels, it’s retail stores, convenience stores where people are going, obviously.

It’s in Life Science, which is the pharma industry for us. And last but not least, best elimination. Those are the bugs that you see. The other ones, you don’t see, but those ones that you see matter too, obviously, which is a great business for us, which is essential for many of the brands that we’re serving, being in retail, being in food and beverage, being in hotels, wherever we serve. But it’s always a B2B promise.

We’re not in the consumer business, as most of you know. When you look at our portfolio, I’m really proud of this one because we have great end markets, and they’re pretty well spread. At the same time, we serve 172 countries, so 40 industries in 172 countries. And when I look back then fifteen years ago, we were in a very different place. Our earnings, 90% or 80% plus, were coming from one business, institutional, hotels and restaurants in The United States.

A great business that has built a great franchise, but that was a bit of a clear focus. That has changed over time. And today, so half our business is in North America and half is outside with a very good geographic coverage. And what’s really interesting is that the heads of those businesses by end market or by geographies is very strong. So we make more or less the same margin within more or less five percentage points, the same in every business and in every market around the world, which is really a great way to build resilience as a company because we never exactly know where the growth is going to come from, especially it’s a short term in terms of geographies or in terms of end markets as well.

Wherever it comes from, we have a healthy balance of mix of earnings, which helps us stay very steady as well, so from an earnings delivery perspective. And talking about margins, we made that promise to get to 20% by 27%, and I feel really good about getting there. We’ve delivered 17% in 2024. I’ve committed to 18% in 2025, and we will get to the 20% by 2027. And it’s not the end of the story, obviously.

So when we get there, there needs to keep building to the next level. And we have many businesses that are already north of 20% today, so we know exactly how to get there. But it’s going to be mostly a top line, a gross margin story. It’s not a cost cutting exercise, even though operating performance is important. But this is not my number one priority when I think about the company, which is why I feel really good about delivering a strong double digit 12% to 15% earnings growth for the long run, for 2025 and for the first quarter as well, leading us towards this 20% margin by 2027, even though the top line does not need to be 5% to 7% in order to deliver this 12% to 1520% operating margin by 2027.

The 3%, four % would be okay. Anything that’s above will help us either invest more in the business or deliver more earnings, which is choice depending on the opportunities that we have in front of us. And the way we look at Q1 right now is probably going to be closer to three than to four, but I feel totally fine with it as well because the team is reacting very nicely to all the market conditions that we are all living in, obviously, in the world currently. And we’re just getting started. One hundred and two years, and I’m preparing the companies not just for 2025, obviously, but for the years to come and hopefully for the next century as well as a company.

So let me jump a little bit more into it. First, the macro trends are maybe not the most inspiring trends for the world, but they are helping us, obviously, keep growing as a company because we can help solve some of them or most of them as well. Thinking about people, we’re going to be a third more people by 02/1950. We will need way more food, way more calories because people are shifting, obviously, so from non meat to meat diets around the world. Energy, we will need almost 50% more by 02/1950, and that’s going to change pretty quickly as well as with artificial intelligence, and I’ll come back to that as well in a second, which leads us to this water stress as well.

Today, the world is roughly at equilibrium where we use as much water as what nature can replenish through natural cycle of rain. And by 02/1930, we expect that gap to be 56%, which is not going to work, obviously, because water is not going to come from outer space. So we will need to reuse and recycle water in order to be able to keep growing as humanity, as businesses and the way we live, obviously. So we have the chance as well, sir, to be the number one in most of what we do in a very fragmented market, which is a good thing. It’s a good position to be.

But it’s important for us to compare ourselves to the very best companies out there, all the names that you’re familiar with as well and not so much to the competitors we have out there because this is not the benchmark I’m looking at. It’s much more the top companies out there in the world wherever they operate as well. And how do we deliver that value so to our customers for the ones a bit less familiar? Well, we bring chemistry expertise, technology, data science to our customers to help them deliver best in class performance. We serve millions of customers in 40 industries.

We know what best in class performance means and help them deliver that best in class performance anywhere around the world as quickly as we can. And that’s the promise that we make to our customers, and it’s really bringing all the strengths of the company anywhere around the world every day, every week, every month, whatever, is the frequency that we need to be there. We will be there for our customers. And we power a lot of what we do for our customers with unique innovation. Our pipeline of innovation keeps growing.

For us, it’s the peak annual sales in five years. That’s the way we define our pipeline. Vitality index is very strong in the company, roughly 30%, which means 30% of our sales are coming from products that we have launched in the last five years. That’s one definition. It’s our definition.

But I like a lot, so the evolution of our pipeline and the vitality as well that it’s bringing up to our business, which is so essential, obviously, so for us to keep growing. And when I think as well about the way we innovate, for a very long time was more incremental innovation, successful, doing so renovating products, programs, offering that we are providing to our customers for a very long time. And we’ve been shifting our focus on innovation that we have half on renovation and half on breakthrough innovation, as you can see, as well on that chart. So helping data centers operate without water or helping microelectronics producers, so called fabs, and I’ll come back to that as well, so to produce more chips with much less water as well. That can be true in a dish room as well in a restaurant because it’s where most of the water is being used as well.

And as I’ve mentioned, salt, pest elimination is a great business for us. And interestingly enough, we have millions of famous mousetraps around the world that we need to go and check very regularly. 95% of them are absolutely empty. It was totally useless to go there, but you don’t know it in advance. Well, we have developed devices, the very best mousetrap, as well, in order to know in advance what’s in there, where is it.

And we can save, obviously, huge time, which is a good thing in terms of operational efficiency for our team, but at the same time, making sure that our customers, the best brands out there, never have or never see as well any activity in their stores or in their production sites. We connect not only those devices, but all the systems that we manage around the world for our customers. We have 100,000 systems remote monitored today. One of the largest clouds as well in the world is Ecolab three d, and we keep growing as well on this one. It’s not only to manage operations, to optimize operations, but with it, we know what’s the performance of every site in every company, in every industry as well around the world, which is a great insight to learn from the best ones how the other ones can get better as well at it.

The way we measure as well the value we’re generating for our customers is called total value delivered, and it’s in three pillars. It depends, obviously, on the industry that we’re serving, but it’s always first a business outcome. It can be an uptime in a data center. Second, it’s the operational cost performance per hour, per data, per burger, whatever that is. And third is the environmental impact in water, energy, waste, especially that you can see on our website because it’s in real time, that we know those numbers and we make sure that we always have the alignment with the customer, that what we’ve saved is really aligned between the two parties and we agree where do we want to go.

And we get to share out of that value that we are delivering to our customers in value pricing, which is why pricing is a strong part of our top line proposition as a company. If you take one example and I’ll share a few so with you, in a lodging property, which is a hotel, obviously, in normal language, well, we start with the dish machine in our restaurant. We move to the laundry room. We touch the housekeeping, the AC, the water management, the pest elimination, the food safety program. We do the audit for guest satisfaction, for brand compliance and so on.

So that’s the way we grow within one property. And then the next step is to do it around the world. We called it the customers, circle the globe in the past. We call it the one e coli proposition today, which is basically providing all services of our company to the main brands of the world out there, not just in one location like that hotel I just mentioned, but in every location around the world to help them get all their properties reach the performance of the best operating one that they have around the world, which is helping us as well drive penetration. We serve 152,000,000,000 market.

$55,000,000,000 is within customers that we already serve today. So we can multiply by four the size of the company by having our current customer use all our services and deliver diverse in class performance while doing so as well. At the same time, so we’re running great businesses that keep getting better, but we’re also in the business of building new businesses, and we’ve done that for a long time. I mentioned Pest Elimination, a great franchise that we started twenty years ago. We went into Water in 2011.

We’ve built a few other businesses as well. I’d like to share with you as well in a second, like Global High-tech, that’s data centers and fabs. It’s life sciences, the pharma industry and especially in bioscience and Ecolab digital, which is an interesting proposition that we’ve done for a very long time for our customers for free and progressively making it the tech way, which ultimately, sir, you pay for the value that you get. I’d like to start with Global Hi tech. If you take a little bit of zoomed out review here, we will need 1,000 new data centers in the next three to five years.

It’s moving very quick. At the same time, 70 fabs, microelectronics producing plants as well in the next five years. One fab requires as much water as the drinking needs of 17,000,000 people, one. And the second largest in the world has thirty three and seven under construction right now. So you can imagine the challenge that, that’s generating as well.

Fabs and data centers in the next five years will require the power of the whole of India and the drinking needs equivalent of The United States. That’s all on top of all the numbers I showed before. That’s the equivalent of 50 new nuclear plants in the next five years. Just to put that in perspective, that’s a really hard one. We won’t be able to build that quick.

So the best way is to improve the performance from a water and energy perspective, both for fabs and for data centers. For us, it’s leading, obviously, in a very big market opportunity. If I think about the data centers, we’ve been shifting our technology. 95% of data centers today are basically big holes with computers in it that are air conditioned. And that’s the way you cool the computers.

That’s shifting now progressively towards this direct to chip technology, which is basically bringing a cold liquid on top of the thousands and millions of chips that you have in the data center. This is a total different technology. We are the leading expert in cooling technology. We’re the leading expert in fluid management. And we know how to manage those operations.

It’s newest technology. We’re helping the tech companies develop the new solutions and put tech in place as well in the newest data centers around the world. And it’s pretty important for them because of what I mentioned before. When you use less water, well, you can produce more data. And when you use less water, it means you need less energy as well.

So you can reuse that energy in order to power even more the data center as well. For those companies, this is essential. It’s a small part of their spend. It’s a huge impact on what they’re trying to accomplish, which is processing more data, obviously. In microelectronics, the so called fabs, really interesting challenge here I shared with you.

So how much water is required to power those fabs? Well, we’re shifting completely the way we’re managing water in those fabs where all the water that’s been used, it’s a whole water process, the production of a microprocessor, because you need to cut the silicium cylinder, you need to polish it, you need to print it, and there’s a bunch of steps as well in between. It’s all done in water, with water, and water needs to be ultra pure. Today, all the water is going through the process, ending up in a wastewater plant and then ending up in a river. And silicium is a heavy metal, which is a little bit problematic.

So you have a quantity issue. You have a quality issue. So what we’re doing for the fabs is basically using and recycling water at every step of the process that wastewater becomes something of the past and not something of the future. We have 25 people in Pyeontak, for instance, in Korea helping do exactly that as we speak in order to make sure that they can produce more in ways that are using less water, especially. Shifting gears on Life Sciences.

We started that business in 2017 by bringing our capabilities in Food and Beverage and in health care, making sure that we could help the pharma company produce safer drugs, more qualitative drugs at the lower total cost. We’ve added as well to it Purolite in 2021, which is an ultrafiltration technology, resin based, protein based, in order to purify biotech products, in order to make sure that they are at the highest level of quality, produced in the highest sterile environment in a clean room as well, very similar to what we do in food and beverage plants or in hospitals as well, but brought together for a very different industry. Really happy that we did it in 2017, that we kept investing as well over the year. It’s an industry that has gone through a transition after the pandemic, but now it’s getting much better again. And it’s a large market, a growth market in a place where there are very few players, and we are very well positioned to capture that growth going forward.

So in a pharma plant, we, as mentioned, make sure that the clean rooms are very sterile, that the environment is as clean as it can be, that the product that’s being produced is also as safe as it can be as well. It’s always the same spirit where we start with one application, we add a lot of applications around it, it’s a penetration game, and ultimately making sure that the overall promise is being delivered. And last but not least, eColab Digital for thirty years, we’ve been using Connected Chemistry, which we invented in 1991. Well, we’ve been doing that for customers for free forever, and that has changed a few years back. That’s why I’ve decided as well that after this first quarter, investors will see what’s the revenue that we’re generating out of Ecolab Digital.

And what’s Ecolab Digital? It’s hardware, devices like your phone, if you think about something closer to you. It’s software subscription and it’s consumption. And it’s a few hundred million today growing very nicely at a very high margin as you can imagine because there is now raw materials obviously in that. So a very promising story.

To bring us to a close, two things. First, we’ve always focused on helping customers reduce impact on people most importantly, what we do for our customers, which is thousand or a million times more impactful than what we do in our own operation as a company. And the commitments that we’ve made externally as well, what we do for customers, One, to take one example, I made a commitment in 2015 that we will help save enough water for the drinking needs of 1,000,000,000 people, and we are perfectly on track to get there. So by 02/1930, that leads to energy savings as well, and it leads to a lot of other things as well that we are tracking on a very regular basis. And our report is coming out, so our growth and impact report, I think, in June, which you will see.

So how we’ve been progressing as well in ’twenty four, which has been a very good story because that’s the way we help our customers do better, make more money and for us, obviously, do even better. Last but not least, I like a lot our financial position, like JPMorgan would be saying. So we have Fortress balance sheet. I’m not going to steal that name, but I feel pretty good about it because we have a great business with great margins. We have great cash flow generation between 90100% of cash flow conversion as well, which is something we’ve been doing for many, many years.

Our balance sheet, we have a 1.7 leverage ratio in 2024. So in a very strong place to whether whatever is coming at us, but most importantly, so to invest in the businesses that have promising growth ahead of them or to do acquisitions as we’ve done a lot as well over time. And obviously, the question on capital allocation, we’ve been very boring steady like that on what our priorities are. It’s always going to be dividend in line with earnings. It’s always going to be second investing in the business and last but not least, so buyback when there is something left.

And it’s been the case for a very long time, the last ten years. We returned close to $11,000,000,000 to shareholders, half in buyback, half in dividends, and that’s going to continue. That’s been the case in the best years. That’s been the case in the more challenging year as well that we might have gone through. So at the end, I feel really good about where the company is, where we’re going.

We have a great promise for customers that need it more than ever. Great opportunities, very good market position as well. We have the means of our ambitions, both in capabilities and in financial resources. And we have the best team in the industry as well that’s going to deliver no matter what for our customers and for our shareholders on a quarter by quarter basis as we’ve done as well in the past. So welcome.

Comments or questions?

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks very much, Christophe. Maybe the place to start is you’re confident over your longer term margin goals. And at the beginning of the presentation, you said we can hit these. It says 5% to 7% sales growth, but we can do this even if the sales growth is a little bit less.

Does your confidence come from greater pricing visibility as you look at Ecolab’s businesses going forward? And where does that confidence come from in your pricing, if that’s the case?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Great question, Jeff. And it’s the important question, obviously, here. So the first element is the fact that we’ve been delivering very nice margin growth over the past few years because I can talk about all the plans that we’re going to execute in the years to come. Well, okay, we’re still going to talk about what’s on paper, and it’s a bit of an argument of opinions. The past few years, we’ve had a very good development of our margins.

And the path for the next few years is going to be the same drivers. The first one, yes, is going to be partly the top line. The value price is an important one because it goes straight to the bottom line, as we know as well. And when we talk about price, so for us, it’s a share of the improvement in the performance of our customers that we’re making as well. And this is something that is very sticky.

As you know, pricing has never gone negative in our company. In the worst of times, it always went up, which is a good indication as well, like thirty years back. It’s a long story. It’s also all our new businesses, the one I mentioned in my presentation, being High-tech, Life Science, Digital, all higher margins than the average of the company, even the existing businesses like Institutional. Institutional is at 22% today.

It’s way higher than that in North America. It’s lower than that outside North America. And we’re progressing very nicely outside North America towards the performance of North America. It’s never going to be exactly the same because we don’t have the same critical mass as in large country in here. So that’s another example.

And last but not least, it’s innovation. Innovation, there is zero, but like zero innovation that we bring on the market that’s below the gross margin average of the business that we’re in as well at the same time. And last but not least, there is the one eCola cost performance, which is not my first priority. So in terms of operating performance, we’ve said SG and A are going to improve 20 basis points a year, net of investment as well. So this is not first, this is last.

So that’s the way we’ve delivered it in the past few years, and that’s the way we’re going to deliver it in the next few years.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: When you think about your major businesses, the institutional business has very high margin. The industrial business is good too, though not as high. Why is that? Why is the institutional business more profitable than the industrial business? And over time, are the larger opportunities in institutional because of its pricing characteristics?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: So those two end markets, and it’s groups of end markets, obviously, as you know. So in industrial, what we call water today, it’s a lot of different end markets. It can be primary metals or power generation like data centers and fabs. They don’t have the same margins as we know and the same on the institutional and specialty side as well at the same time. So very different end markets, so for sure.

And the two stories are pretty different. As mentioned before, so INS, you said it, in North America is north of the 22%, which is the average, so for INS globally. And we started in Europe at zero ten years ago. And now it’s close to the company’s average as well. So we’ve demonstrated that we can get to north of 20% in institutional and specialty.

And in industrial, it’s much more of a one e collab approach here, which is really helping customer get this best in class performance that I shared before, helping enterprises to get all their units to the best performing one. That requires a much higher penetration of what we do for them at a much lower cost because we dare anyway adding services to help them get better performance. In institutional, we have higher penetration of our solution than what we have in industrial. Well, the fact that, balls are going to go up are going to help them improve their margin performance, but there will always be a slight difference between I and S businesses and water industrial businesses. The P and L looks very different as well in terms of gross margin and service that we need to provide.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: So when you’re confident that you’ll hit your 20% margin target, what you’re thinking is with the kind of pricing capabilities we have and some volume growth, we can do it.

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Yes. Yes. And it’s not the end of the story. It’s not that 20% that we’re going to stop, we’re going to cruise and I’m going to end up on a beach. That’s not my plan.

I’m not the beach guy, so to begin with. But it’s going to think, how do we get the company to 23% to 25% and beyond? We have businesses that are close to 30% already today. So we know how to get there. And that’s the beauty of our model.

It’s not to do things we’ve never done. It’s to learn from other businesses, from other industries, from other geographies, how to improve as well across the world and across businesses, which is a pretty cool thing we say in the company. There’s always the best idea, the best solution within the company, somewhere in one business, somewhere around the world. We always need to know where is it and then scale it around the world.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: I think Ecolab says that its raw material inflation in 2025 will be up low single digits. But if you look at phosphate prices, they’re not really moving up. Caustic soda has come down quite a lot. Chlorine has sort of moved a little bit lower. Polyethylene is not moving.

Raw material inflation better than a low single digit growth? Or raw material inflation better than a low single digit growth or your stock?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Absolutely. And I’ve been pretty clear as well on that. I expect that the market is going to be low single. Our impact, what we call delivered product cost, our true P and L impact after all the activities done by our procurement team, our supply chain teams, all our smart people, as you call them, will be a positive story. It will turn into a slight tailwind.

The market itself is more a slight headwind, and you add to the improvement within the company, and it turns into a slight tailwind.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: Maybe a last question. When it comes to the data centers, are you agnostic as to which cooling technologies they use? That is, is Ecolab vulnerable to particular cooling technologies being developed? Or you can work with the technologies that are on the market?

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: We have been developed those technologies with the tech companies, with the processes, designers, I want to name them starting with an N, because they know that they will need ways to keep those microprocessors cool in order to use more power to process more data. For us, it’s not a water approach, it’s a cooling approach. And we’re helping develop those new technologies. As mentioned before, the direct to chip technology is something that’s very early in its development. It’s not a proven technology.

It’s a used technology where we learn a lot as well so with the operators. And we have great capabilities to have not just on the direct to chip, but also on the CDU, the Coolant Distribution Unit, which is very close technology that what we use in water, three d T, for cleaning in place in food and beverage plants is the same technology that we can leverage there to really monitor how is the fluid doing, what are the risks of corrosion, what are the risks of scaling, what are the risks of falling, what are the risks of leak as well. We can monitor that, no one else can. And the last step, which is the cooling of the coolant on top of the building. So agnostic, yes, but an active actor of developing those technologies for data centers.

The fact that we’re early on that journey is a very good story because we can position ourselves exactly where the train is going, and I feel really good about the future of that business. Okay.

Jeff Zekauskas, Analyst, JPMorgan: Thank you for your presentation, Chris.

Christophe Beck, CEO, Ecolab: Thank you so much, Jeff. Always a pleasure. Thank you, everyone. Thank you very much.

How to Win Over Gen Z Consumers Restaurants must remain consistent to be magnetic and create a loyal customer base.","Research firm dcdx recently released The Magnetic 100: Restaurants report, which took a look at the brands that Gen Z is talking about most. In order to make this list, a restaurant chain’s customers need to be doing more than spending money – they need to be truly engaged with the brand.

“Magnetism can be measured through how much and how often consumers talk about a brand online and this is all organic, so it’s not skewed by big marketing or influencer budgets,” dcdx director of strategy Mara Stolzenbach told Nation’s Restaurant News.

“Analyzing this type of user-generated content allows us to understand what’s resonating with customers and how they think about a brand.”

The report looked at 100 brands and rated them from “weak” to “magnetic” by analyzing their brand momentum, TikTok followers and segment. Metrics were then derived from popularity and consistency.

Here’s the top 10 most magnetic brands, per the report:

McDonald’s

Wingstop

Starbucks

Chipotle

Taco Bell

Crumbl Cookies

Raising Cane’s

KFC

Chick-fil-A

Subway

Let’s take a closer look at the top five brands and how they made the list.

McDonald’s

Generating 1 billion engagements on its own, McDonald’s claims the top spot on the list as the most magnetic brand, with a score of 89.38. The chain’s popularity goes beyond its food and in fact, much of its engagement has nothing to do with food.

According to Nation’s Restaurant News, memes about drive-thru order mishaps, behind-the-scenes content and viral clarinet performances mimicking air fryers all contributed to it taking the number one spot.

Wingstop

Next on the list, with a score of 87.5, is a chicken-wing chain that has gained popularity among Gen Z through “Mukbang” videos – live-streams that feature a person eating a large amount of food. According to NRN, Mukbang content dominated themes driving conversations for many of the top brands.

Starbucks

After losing popularity last year, Starbucks is back near the top thanks to a return to its roots and limited-time offerings. The coffee chain scored an 87.13 on the magnetism list, with consumers sharing seasonal drink ordering tips and pictures of their personalized cup messages.

That small change of encouraging employees to write personal messages on cups with Sharpies paid off, under the leadership of new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol.

Chipotle

All press is good press, as Chipotle found out. Criticism over Chipotle’s prices and portion sizes became its biggest content driver over the past year. Customers of the brand started sharing ways to maximize orders and get the best deal, which actually played a key role in the brand attaining a score of 86.84.

Taco Bell

Rounding out the top five on the report’s rankings was the time-tested Mexican chain. Over 40% of Taco Bell’s engagement features storyteller content, with customers sharing life experiences – like gender reveals – with Baja Blasts.

Of the restaurants in the report, the top five brands – along with the number six brand, Crumbl Cookies – drove more than half of the conversation in the restaurant category, with nearly 4 billion engagements, according to an article by Fast Company.

How to Win Over Gen Z Consumers

Restaurants must remain consistent to be magnetic and create a loyal customer base.

“For brands that want to increase their magnetism, restaurants have to overcome a higher threshold of consistent consumer affection,” dcdx CEO Andrew Roth told NRN.

“If consistent love is harder to achieve in the restaurant space, then establishing loyalty demands creating an experience for consumers that sticks with them long after their meal is over.”

Bloomberg reported the company’s Budweiser Brewing Co APAC Ltd unit was looking to make cost cuts of 15% this year by trimming thousands from its headcount, on top of a 16% workforce reduction of 25,000 employees last year.

However, the company was swift to refute the report. “The news report about thousands of job cuts planned for Asia in 2025 is not true,” ABInBev spokesperson told Reuters. “We will continue our long-term investment in China.”

BUD China Sales Falter

ABInBev, which owns premium brands such as Stella Artois and Corona, is facing challenges in its Asia-Pacific business amid weakness in China which is dampening the positive uplift elsewhere. Sales volumes in China fell 19% in the Fiscal fourth quarter, with the contraction accelerating from a 14.2% fall in Q3. The brewer said it is being affected by softness in the Chinese market as customers switched products amid low consumer sentiment. In contrast, the company saw high single-digit growth in South Korea.

Globally beer demand slackened, led by China and Argentina, with total volumes declining by 1.9% in Q4, driven by a 2.1% drop in beer volumes, while non-beer volumes were down by 1.1%. Excluding China and Argentina volumes globally grew by 0.9% across the 2024 Fiscal year but overall performance was “significantly constrained” by weakness in these two countries, the company said, resulting in a total volume decline of 1.4%.

U.S. Market Recovers

But gains from its Michelob Ultra and Busch Light brands that helped drive a return to U.S. sales growth in the third quarter continued as it gained market share again in Q4.

Two years ago, the company laid off 350 employees, about 2% of its corporate staff, in the U.S. amid faltering sales of Bud Light after conservative boycotts over the company’s partnership with influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The backlash is thought to have cost the brewer up to $1.4 billion in lost sales. In January 2024, the company told Bloomberg it had laid off an unspecified number of workers in its U.S. sales division.

Is BUD a Good Stock to Buy?

Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy rating on BUD stock based on four analysts offering 12-month price targets in the last three months. The average BUD price target of $69.60 suggests 11% upside.

ID23,McDonald’s,2025-03-13 12:36:35+00:00,PRovoke Media,"Michael Gonda of McDonald's on E.coli, DEI and an Eventful Year - PRovoke Media",Paul Holmes,,,,,https://www.provokemedia.com/latest/article/michael-gonda-of-mcdonald%27s-on-e.coli-dei-and-an-eventful-year,"Michael Gonda: I'm still trying to figure that out, too, so maybe we can sort it out together.
Did you know that next week we're launching a national campaign that is all about being a crew person at McDonald's?
Now we're a franchise brand, 95% of McDonald's restaurants are not owned by the corporation.
E. coli and the New Crisis Playbook PH: That leads us right up to the E. coli crisis.
And that's really hard to do when you're working with, about 800,000 people in the country who wear a McDonald's uniform.","Five key takeaways:

The “chief impact officer” role was created to streamline government relations, communications, philanthropy and sustainability, community engagement—moving with more speed and delivering greater accountability.

The company was able to respond quicky to the E.coli crisis precisely because it was not siloed, and functions like government relations and communications were able to work together.

The connection and collaboration with the head of supply chain began long before the crisis, and was critical to the company’s crisis response.

When crisis strikes a brand like McDonald’s “we have to address the emotions, not just the facts.”

“We were promoting the power of diversity in our employee ranks, in our franchisee body, in our suppliers, well before the acronym was coined. And I believe that our leadership in that will continue well after any announcement that we made.”

McDonald's needs to attend to many, many, many people of different ideologies and different beliefs, so the company “does terribly in the culture wars.”

Paul Holmes: Michael Gonda is the chief impact officer at McDonald’s and he has very kindly agreed to sit here with me and discuss the last 12 months at McDonald's, which I think it's fair to say were pretty eventful. I want to start by talking a little bit about your role. Your title is chief impact officer. What does that mean?

Michael Gonda: I'm still trying to figure that out, too, so maybe we can sort it out together. It feels very much like a title for now. We started an impact function about three years ago and the recognition was that government relations, communications, philanthropy and sustainability, community engagement, those were spread out across the company.

An example of what happened is our Archways to Opportunity Scholarship Program. We wanted to make sure the world knew about that. We wanted to make sure the program was staying modern and meeting the needs of young people today, that there was one team that could go and tell that story. And the reality is we were spread out across like four or five different departments. And that made it hard for our CEO and then our business leaders to find a single point of accountability.

So we formed the impact team. I'm about three years into my role, and I think last year was testament to this, it's worked pretty well. It's enabled us to work with more precision and more speed than we previously did.

PH: And what's the relationship between the impact function and the communications function? Obviously, there are areas of overlap and convergence.

MG: When we first started, there was a sense of why are we all in the tent together? For those who started in government relations, they saw themselves as hardened professionals who were lobbyists by trade. Why am I in a weekly meeting with communications? So different disciplines may not always see themselves working together.

An insight early on when I started, when I asked the GR team, what do you do for the brand? What is your contribution to the business? “Well, the first half of the year, we're in session and we are trying to identify opportunities or threats to the brand. And the rest of the year, we are building a reputation.”

Great. Did you know that next week we're launching a national campaign that is all about being a crew person at McDonald's? We call it One in Eight, because one in eight Americans have worked at McDonald's. And the answer was no. I was like, isn't that annoying? I mean, your job is to drive reputation for this company, and you have no idea that this suite of tools could be at your disposal? And I think as we found more and more examples like that, there has been a much closer collaboration across disciplines that started by saying, why are we all in the room together? Why are we doing annual plan together?

PH: It does make me wonder how many companies haven't figured out sort of how to bring those disciplines together for maximum effect. But I think maybe the better way to understand what it is that you do and what it is you bring to the company is for us to talk about some of the events from last year at McDonald's, because it felt like from the beginning of the year to the end, your name was being caught up in or associated with a whole plethora of important political, social, economic issues, which is inevitable when you're as ubiquitous as McDonald's obviously is.

Inflation, and the ""$18 Big Mac""

I wanted to start at the beginning of the year, and inflation, and the fact that McDonald’s has always been associated with affordable dining, so it was becoming an issue for you. So tell me a little bit about how that issue started to affect the company and how you formulated a response.

MG: Early in the year, it became clear that we were starting to lose a really important cohort that makes up about 20 to 30% of our daily visits, individuals from households that have income of $45,000 or less. The challenge that cohort was dealing with, not exclusive to them, but the pain they were facing was acutely present and visible with that cohort, and they stopped showing up. It was clear to us that our pricing was a barrier to getting people into our restaurants.

Now we're a franchise brand, 95% of McDonald's restaurants are not owned by the corporation. That means we don't set prices. We can recommend prices as part of national advertising, but we can't say everyone around the world or everyone around the country should sell chicken nuggets for this one price. So when you're seeing data that says a really important cohort is not showing up, the first thing you have to do is to convince your operators, in this case our franchisees, that we needed to launch a national program, a value menu, and we called it a $5 Meal Deal.

Now, we knew that probably in like January, February. But that meal didn't become available to Americans until May. And in that time, you started to see headlines about people not having money to go out. You saw headlines about an $18 Big Mac. But we knew this program was going to launch.

The second thing is we had to correct some misinformation. We became a bit of a political football. Anyone on the left that wanted to find an example of corporate greed would say, there's your $18 Big Mac, discount the fact that that was coming from a franchise restaurant in a singular location so not necessarily representative of national prices. On the right, this was all the failures of Bidenomics manifesting. We knew this program was going to launch, but faith and trust in the brand was just slowly eroding and coverage was getting worse and worse.

PH: Can I ask you a quick sort of interruption question? How do you measure faith and trust in the brand, and is it close enough to real time that you can make decisions?

MG: It depends. We're going to get to E. coli in a moment. You could see degradation in sales and degradation in trust, and volume of coverage, and there's a really clear line across all of them. This was probably less of a clear correlation. It wasn't like on one day something happened or the day of a headline about Big Macs and all of a sudden people stopped coming out. So you had to try to pick different pieces of data to put the story together.

And what we ultimately decided is we were going to get more front-footed about the myths and the facts about our pricing strategy. The president from McDonald's USA authored a letter that said we hear you. Prices have gotten out of control and we are going to do something about it. We went point by point on the misinformation we were seeing.

I was interested to see many people in our industry say that is a terrible idea. It's defensive, it's picking a fight. I disagree. I think when you know you're about to do something, it's really important to clarify the misinformation and say something clearly and succinctly. And we wanted to take some of the anxiety out of the conversation, and I think it actually helped consumers who were worried, even if the $18 Big Mac isn't showing up in my local store, is it coming next week?

We were able to say that that was not the case. In fact, a $5 meal deal is coming next week.

The Candidates Both Worked at McDonald's?

PH: That was, from my perspective, the first of many times that I saw McDonald's in the headlines associated with, tangential to a crisis that was clearly an American crisis. The next incident that registered with me was the controversy that sprang up around Kamala Harris's resume and the fact that McDonald's hadn't been on there, but then she mentioned that she'd worked in McDonald's in her youth.

Now, full disclosure, my first job was as a busboy in a pub in Lancaster, England, and I have never once mentioned that on a resume or a job application. But in this case, it became a source of controversy. There was an accusation that it was fabricated. There didn't seem to be any proof one way or another. And again, McDonald's was dragged into the story.

MG: So I mentioned that a source of real pride for us it that one in eight Americans have worked at McDonald's. So then when you see and hear the vice president of the United States talking with pride about her experience and what that enabled her to go on and do and the confidence that gave her. For many of us in the building and I think across the country, we felt pride.

As practitioners, as communicators, we felt excited because we were trying to get that story out there for a while.

Now, we also serve 90% of the population every year and it's no secret to anyone here that we live in a very polarized environment. So if we are seen as picking any side, we know that we are very likely going to be offending a significant number of our customers. I think that makes our brand a little bit different. I've worked in other brands where we took much clearer and more specific political views because of who our customers were and what they wanted to see from the brand.

McDonald's is different. And McDonald's needs to attend to many, many, many people of different ideologies and different beliefs. I got inundated with emails with different suggestions and ways we could capitalize on the vice president's inclusion and none of that felt authentic or right for the brand.

It was something that was part of her story and we didn't want to step in and we also didn't have the ability, which we ultimately said, to get into the question of whether the vice president worked there or not, just because of how long ago that was and I don't know if you have colleagues at your pub, do they still remember you?

PH: I don't really remember any of them.

MG: I worked at a liquor store at my college and I don't think any of my colleagues can attest to that. So that was something that we just wrestled with and we knew that by saying something we could have easily been seen to be trying to wade in and we just didn't want to get anywhere near that.

Our brand is a great brand. But it does terribly in the culture wars and this became a bit of a culture war.

PH: That leads to the next thing that I wanted to talk about because despite not wanting to get dragged into it you did eventually because one of your franchisees decided to invite Donald Trump to flip burgers for a photo op, which was clearly designed to troll Harris. How did that happen and how do you deal generally with those issues that you may have a corporate position that is strictly neutral, but you have thousands of franchisees around the country, some of whom presumably have very strong opinions one way or another, and have the latitude to act on those decisions?

MG: From April-ish to October, we did have a playbook and we shared it with all of our franchisees. It was nine specific points about keeping the brand safe in an election cycle. And part of that was not hosting political activity in a restaurant, because back to this point, if we serve 90% of the population. We are not a political brand. Political engagements in our restaurants just don't work well for us. It could be counterproductive.

We do regularly welcome and invite elected leaders to our restaurants. And that's really important, because we want people to know and see and understand what it means to run a McDonald's restaurant, what it means to work in a McDonald's restaurant, what it means to frequent a McDonald's restaurant. So opening our doors to everyone is important, it's a core value of ours.

There was a playbook, probably not relevant for this situation. We got a call the week before this visit letting us know that a franchisee had been approached by local law enforcement asking for the president to be able to come and visit. And as anyone can imagine, you kind of get these things through like a text message or an email. You're like, wait, are we talking about visiting a specific location in Pennsylvania? It's like, yeah, we think so.

Closing our door to an elected leader or presidential candidate for a major party, that felt like the wrong thing to do when we have been clear about allowing elected leaders previously to come into our restaurants. And we'd have to start explaining why we were adjudicating on this specific instance. So we're going to support the franchisee in facilitating this visit.

The question then becomes, how do you do it? And how do you explain to people what's going on? We decided that we were not going to talk a lot in advance. It got out, the location of the restaurant on Wednesday. The visit was on Sunday. It was Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, five longest days of my life, as we're trying to figure out just all of the different movements and steps that would that this would entail.

The one thing that was really important to me is that when we spoke we spoke clearly and decisively about why we did this or why this happened and what it means for the brand, which is that McDonald's is deeply important to two very important people. And to make clear to our employees and other stakeholders that this was not a political event that we had gone and secured, but a decision made by an independent business owner.

The reception to the line that we are not red, not blue, but golden, blew me away. I think that chord was people wanting to see the brand try to rise above the political fray. So I hope we did it in this situation, but it was definitely a tightrope.

PH: It does speak to the difficulty, if not impossibility, of staying out of politics, though. The needle is so fine. Threading it is a big challenge.

MG: I totally agree. I think it would have definitely been seen as a political statement had we tried to stop it. We also made sure that the Harris campaign knew that our franchisees were eager to have the vice president at our restaurants as well. I think it is hard to be neutral. You have to work really hard at trying to be even handed. That was certainly what we worked on.

E. coli and the New Crisis Playbook

PH: That leads us right up to the E. coli crisis. Last year set a record for the number and severity of food recalls across the US and this was perhaps the most high profile, not because it was the most serious necessarily, but because it was McDonald's.

Tell me a little bit about how that crisis came onto your radar and how quickly and assertively you were able to respond to it. Because when I talked to people for our crisis review earlier this year, there was a feeling that you'd sort of not only followed the playbook, but updated it for a real-time social media age.

MG: It’s humbling to hear that. It was the minute we landed in Vegas for a franchisee meeting that it was clear that there was a food safety incident, and when you work at a restaurant company or any food company that is the number one fear you have every day. It's emotional for people who work at the company, it's personal, and it becomes scary. You're hearing reports of hospitalizations and illness.

I want to go back to the first question you asked about impact, because I think our ability to respond had a lot to do with how we were organized. We weren't siloed across GR, across communications, we were able to really work together and together right at the beginning. That became very important.

The second thing is our leadership team had spent a lot of time in the two years before that on developing trust amongst the various different parties. So my connection and collaboration with our head of supply chain didn't have to begin on the 21st of October. If it did, I think we would have been toast. Similarly with the head of the US business, there was trust and he understood and knew the role that each of us could play.

So there was a lot of work that went in to us being able to respond effectively as a whole company, as a system.

We got the call from CDC. The way this works is they say we're picking up “signals” and they're getting clusters. Those signals are reports of a specific type of illness and then in a specific geography. And they start interviewing people and saying what have you eaten? And the first few, that list is really long. Then they start to get like four or five common foods and the question is have you had a quarter pounder? And they called us and said, we're confident that there is enough connections here that you need to take action.

What I'm proud of is that there was no debate in the company about whether we should just look at one ingredient and try to contain this. We ended up pulling proactively the quarter pounder in the affected area. I think we went above and beyond right out of the gate. That was so important to maintaining trust with CDC and other health authorities.

PH: Just to kind of circle back to one of the themes of this discussion, management was able to unite around the company's values and principles that you had discussed in the past. What about franchisees? Was there any pushback or reluctance in the franchisee community?

MG: Short answer, no. But the approach needed to be discussed. And we were in a meeting with a thousand franchisees in Las Vegas as this was all happening. So me, the head of our supply chain, the US president, went on stage and said, all right, you're about to get notification in the next few minutes that we'll be recalling quarter pounders in about 900 restaurants.

And what we all aligned on, company and franchisees, are three phases to managing this. I'll be honest with you, we made them up right on the spot. Phase one was rapid response, and that was we were going to do everything we could to demonstrate to public health authorities that our singular focus was on public health. The second phase would be around resumption of selling the product. And the third phase would be repairing any reputational impact.

What we were concerned about, is people might start confusing what phase we were in. If we started in phase one by saying we're the safest food brand in the world, we have never had a food safety incident, that would be a lot like an airline saying right after an incident, this is the first time this happened.

So we wanted to really own it and take responsibility in phase one and not try to be defensive.

Phase two, we would get product back on, and phase three, we would start to rebuild and regain trust that we definitely lost as a result of this food safety incident. So I think the debate with the franchisees was just explaining to them that we would go out and tell our story, but we weren't going to do that in the initial response.

PH: It must be difficult to have patience. We've talked about this now twice, that you know what your plan is, you have a strategy, just as the $5 deal evolved, But in what is a spectacularly real-time crisis, in which people start to second guess companies 10 minutes into an event rather than 10 days or 10 weeks, it must be incredibly difficult to have that discipline and to hold the line as a crisis is evolving?

MG: I mean, one of the best parts of my job is the fact that I work at a franchise business because I get to interact with small business owners all across the country. That said, when something like this happens, it's personal. It is their personal livelihood this is impacting. So it adds a different level of emotion. And it's on us, it's on me to be able to address that reality, make sure that people know that I am acutely aware of what they are going through, and that we've got a plan that can get them through it.

I mean, there's crisis playbook. I've developed them in my time with agencies for other companies, and they're helpful, but every situation is unique to the time that you're in, the environment you're in, the brand that you're working for. And we had to take a very contemporary approach to trying to get our story out there as quickly as we could.

PH: The other thing that impressed me was how fast, articulate, and on message the non-communications people involved in this were. The two voices that stood out were your head of supply chain and your North American CEO, who were recording videos, providing updates, speaking with both empathy and authority. How much of that was something that you had prepared for and how much of it was just two people in the leadership team really rising to the challenge?

MG: I think there's an intuitive sense for everyone at the company that our brand holds a very special place, not to be too reverent about it, but it is an important brand. So when something happens that is disruptive, disappointing, we have to address the emotions, not just the facts.

And that gets done through individuals getting in front of a camera, saying, one, that we own it; two, that it's safe, that we know that we've gotten all contaminated product out of our supply chain, and three, we are going to work with every single person in public health authorities, the federal level, the state level, to make sure that this can't happen again.

I think you need someone, a voice to convey that. So that didn't take a lot of too much hand wringing to select Joe Erlinger, president of our US business, and Cesar Pena, our head of supply chain, to take the lead. It wasn't like, what do you mean we need to go do this? It was more like, OK, when? And the when began immediately. We flew back to Chicago from Vegas and Joe was on the Today Show within about six hours.

PH: Again, from my perspective as an outsider, the turnaround from there's a recall to we're confident that we can bring this product back was really short. Did that create its own challenge that people would say, well, that got fixed suspiciously quickly. How did you deal with bringing the product back?

MG: We tried to bring reporters along on the journey with us. The first day we held a briefing call, and we had like 300 people join the call. And we did that four times throughout the first week. What we tried to explain to them was one, we don't think this is about any sort of lapse in cooking procedures, otherwise you would have seen a much more widespread problem. We knew it was pretty contained, and we tried to really explain that to reporters and make sure they understood, along with health officials, why we were confident that we'd isolated it.

By the time we got to resumption, they weren't questioning whether that was prudent or putting profit over people.

Customers, we needed to make sure that when they walked into a restaurant and they had a question, they got answers to it. And that's really hard to do when you're working with, about 800,000 people in the country who wear a McDonald's uniform. To train 800,000 people on messages is hard.

PH: Let me ask you a question about that, because you talk about reporters, and I wonder the extent to which the media landscape that you deal with in a crisis has changed. So in times of crisis, is it in fact still the mainstream legacy media that have the biggest impact on trust and credibility? Or did you also involve alternative media, independent media, even influences in that process?

MG: I think it's an and, so it wasn't one over the other, but when you're dealing with food safety issues, I think reporters, traditional media, still carry a lot of weight and water. What we talked about in the company, is we need to see them as performing a public service. We had franchisees ask us what they should do when reporters come to their restaurants and set up live shots. And our answer was, thank them and offer them coffee. They're there to try to educate the public on what is safe and what is not.

I think this is true for other industries, aviation and others, traditional media is very important. It's not to diminish alternative media and influencers, but I don't think I'm fully there yet to say you don't need to prioritize traditional media.

The Ireland-headquartered business took back control and distribution of its cider portfolio, which included Magners and Bulmers, from Budweiser supplier AB InBev last year and said it has “exciting plans” for its brands.

The positive outlook came as C&C Group posted a trading update for the 12 months ended 28 February 2024.

It said group revenues were expected to be in line with last year, reflecting growth in its Matthew Clark Bibendum distribution business. This was due to disposing of its non-core soft drinks business in Ireland and its strategic exit from low-margin contract brewing volume, set against softer British cider sales during the summer trading period.

Acknowledging the additional pressures of the macroeconomic environment and last October’s UK Budget, the company said that despite these headwinds, it had made good financial progress and expected to report underlying earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of €76m-€78m (£64m-£65m).

This was modestly below C&C Group’s target due to softer trading in January and February, but reflected recovery versus the prior year’s earnings of €60m (£50m).

Furthermore, Matthew Clark Bibendum’s customer numbers grew 7% in the second half of the 2024 financial year.

The group expected 2026 financial year earnings to be marginally ahead of the current year, and aimed to deliver €100m (£84m) EBIT over the medium-term.

Chief executive Roger White, who joined C&C at the beginning of this year, said there was still “much work to be done to fully realise the potential across the group”, and added: “While the market backdrop remains challenging, we are continuing to support our customers, invest in the business and have some exciting plans to implement this year. I remain confident of the significant long-term opportunity within the business.”

The business is emerging from a turbulent period that saw it post a £96m loss in the year to 29 February 2024 after accounting errors discovered in its previous results.

Last year activist shareholder Engine Capital published a scathing open letter that branded the company a “perennial underperformer” and encouraged it to conduct a strategic review in preparation for a sale. The dispute was subsequently resolved, with the US private investor pledging to “work constructively together” with C&C.

The latest downsizing is part of the company’s plans to reduce operational costs by about 15% this year and comes after it cut 16% of some 25,000 employees last year, one of the people said.
“As we optimize our operations structure, we are dedicated to fostering innovation and building our workforce to drive our success,” a Budweiser APAC spokesperson said.

The latest downsizing is part of the company’s plans to reduce operational costs by about 15% this year and comes after it cut 16% of some 25,000 employees last year, one of the people said. This year’s staff reduction would mean thousands more employees will depart the company after 4,000 were already cut last year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.

China will bear the brunt of the reductions as it accounts for more than 80% of the group’s manpower.

The company has been steadily reducing its headcount over the past few years, with the staff size shrinking about 20% by the end of 2023 from more than 30,000 in 2017.

“As we optimize our operations structure, we are dedicated to fostering innovation and building our workforce to drive our success,” a Budweiser APAC spokesperson said. “For over four decades, we have invested in China, we are confident in its growth potential and remain focused on our strategic priorities.”

Budweiser APAC’s downsizing highlights the predicament of global brewers in the world’s second-largest economy, where consumers are reining in spending amid an economic slowdown and property market slump. The group, controlled by Anheuser-Busch InBev, posted a net loss of $16 million in the fourth quarter, missing analysts’ estimate of a $6.72 million profit. For last year as a whole, profit plunged 15% while revenue declined 9%.

Rival brewers are facing similar challenges. Both volume and revenue dropped for Carlsberg in China last year.

In an effort to drive a turnaround in China, Budweiser APAC has named Yanjun Cheng, a 29-year veteran of the company, to succeed Jan Craps who will step down in April after seven years.

Cheng will need to steer the company through multiple headwinds, including its declining image in the Chinese market. One of the group’s brands that was popular in Northeastern China was found to contain vomitoxin, which can cause short-term nausea, diarrhea and headaches, according to a report by Hong Kong’s Consumer Council last year.

The findings were highlighted by China’s official Xinhua News Agency, which also reported that Budweiser APAC repeatedly breached the country’s advertising laws. The group has been fined a combined 1.4 million yuan ($194,000) since May 2021 for the violations, according to the report.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/03/20250313070836_Budweiser.jpg,N,,2025-03-13 06:06:16.863357

To help speed up the process, Kempczinski, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said he’s making changes in leadership and operations in the company aimed at making McDonald’s move faster.

As part of the changes, Jill McDonald, who heads the company’s international division, has been tapped to be the chain’s first chief restaurant experience officer beginning May 1.

She will soon lead a team responsible for the company’s innovation, supply chains, and operations.

“I wanted one person who’s actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the restaurant general manager,” Kempczinski said to the Journal. He didn’t share what other changes would be made to speed up the burger making process.

(LEVI) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.54 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.50 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.61 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this teen clothing retailer would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of 4.35%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

American Eagle , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $1.6 billion for the quarter ended January 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.68 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

American Eagle shares have lost about 31.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -5.3%.

What's Next for American Eagle?

While American Eagle has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for American Eagle: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.31 on $1.16 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.79 on $5.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Apparel and Shoes is currently in the top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry, Levi Strauss (LEVI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended February 2025.

This jeans maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Levi Strauss' revenues are expected to be $1.54 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter.

Starbucks is testing potential designs for its coffee shops. | Rendering courtesy of Starbucks

Since he took over as CEO of Starbucks last year, Brian Niccol has unleashed a torrent of changes, many of them designed to return the company to its “third place” coffee-shop roots. Baristas are now writing names on cups. The company has a code of conduct. Customers get free coffee refills. Starbucks is cutting from the menu. It’s marketing all of it.

Yet as the chain works to bring Starbucks more fully back to those roots, it needs to look at the shops themselves.

Speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, Niccol said Starbucks has started testing new designs of its coffee shops. And then he offered some pretty big hints as to what those shops might look like.

“Imagine coffeehouses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating, power outlets and food displays,” he said. “Stores with separation between the café and mobile orders, featuring risers and dedicated pickup shelves at locations to create an intuitive handoff and anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater and enhances the connection between our baristas and customers.”

Details on the “coffeehouse of the future” aren’t yet available. But it’s a logical next step for a company working to balance the needs of its on-the-go customers who use mobile order on their way to work with those who want to stay a while. The company is looking to establish standards for shops that ensure each of them have a more welcoming, coffeeshop feel.

Niccol arrived to Starbucks with a clear sense of what ails the chain, that as it has worked to court more and more mobile and drive-thru customers, it has lost its sense of purpose and what originally led consumers to the chain—that coffee shop feel.

To be sure, Starbucks’ focus on mobile ordering and loyalty members helped the chain become an immense success. Average unit volumes in the U.S. grew by 35% between 2018 and 2023, before its sales dropped. Total system sales grew more than 50%, according to data from Restaurant Business sister company Technomic.

Yet there is a sense that the company went too far. Starbucks built a lot more drive-thrus. It introduced pickup stores without seating. One of them replaced a higher-end Reserve location in downtown Seattle. More broadly, the conflict between the company’s demand for more digital and drive-thru customers and those who want to just have a coffee at a coffee shop contributed to the chain’s weak sales last year.

“We have made mistakes on this one,” Niccol said. “We have to go back and fix it.”

At the same time, Starbucks needs those on-the-go digital customers to keep its sales. It did not become the world’s second-largest restaurant chain purely by focusing on people who spend a couple of hours inside its coffee shops.

Niccol said that requires a balance. But he’s also confident in the company’s ability to do that. “We have the ability to do both,” he said.

Niccol said the company is focused on “delivering great experiences,” whether customers come in and sit down with a ceramic mug of coffee, or they order ahead and the sequence on mobile orders is correct “so people show up when their drink shows up and vice versa.”

“I believe we have the ability to do it,” Niccol added. “We have to bring order to how we do it and support our partners with the right process, standards, equipment to ensure it happens every single time.”

Niccol also got a bit philosophical. The restaurant industry after the pandemic has focused a lot on that digital and drive-thru customer. But restaurants are fundamentally gathering spaces, places for community.

“That third place is probably more necessary than it ever has been,” Niccol said. “Without a doubt, whether you are a teenager, 8-year-old person, somebody in their 50s or 40s, what everybody likes to do is connect with people in their community, in a safe place over a cup of coffee. Hot or cold, Starbucks can play a role.”",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-03/background/Starbucks%20exterior%20rendering%20company%20copy.jpg?VersionId=RMePTiGLX0jFRbn5h5wojHRJbA6RFpyV,N,,2025-03-12 23:05:51.709323

Niccol mentioned that the company has recently minimized the use of discount-driven offers, simplified its menu, and revamped its marketing strategy to emphasize what makes Starbucks unique: the coffee it brews and the company it maintains. He indicated that initial responses suggest these changes have been beneficial for Starbucks’ partners, customers, and business operations.

While the immediate focus of the ""Back to Starbucks"" plan is on the U.S. business, Niccol stressed that Starbucks is a global company with significant opportunities for international growth. He mentioned that operations in many global markets serve as examples for U.S. coffeehouses, with dedicated partners serving customers daily.

Here are the important takeaways from today’s annual meeting of shareholders

Niccol opened the meeting by emphasizing key insights he’s experienced and heard from customers since joining Starbucks: a commitment to serving the world’s finest coffee, the impact of the company’s incredible green apron partners, and the enduring strength of the Starbucks brand.

“From bean to cup, it’s the people at Starbucks that make us special… The moment of connection between a customer and their barista can mean so much, especially in today’s fast-paced and sometimes isolating world. I’m proud to call them partners, and I’m proud of all they do. Together, it’s what make our brand enduring and iconic,” he said.

Six months after taking the helm as Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer, Niccol acknowledged the current challenges facing the company are real, but its core strengths and opportunities ahead offer great optimism.

“…we have a clear path forward. This path is grounded in reconnecting with who we are when we’re at our best. We call it “Back to Starbucks.” It’s about focusing on our brand truths and the role we play in the lives of our customers, and our partners and communities. It’s about getting those fundamentals right and then building and innovating from there,” he said.

To get “Back to Starbucks,” the company is focused on reintroducing Starbucks to the world, delivering the customer experience to win the morning and at peak, reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse, and ensuring Starbucks is the unrivaled best job in retail, recognizing that success starts and ends with Starbucks green apron partners.

“As a brand, we have reduced the frequency of discount-driven offers, taken steps to simplify our menu, and overhauled our marketing to remind people what sets us apart — the coffee we make, and the company we keep,” Niccol said. “Early reactions tell me these were the right steps for our partners, our customers, and the business.”

“As we take our next steps “Back to Starbucks,” we’ll continue to enhance the health of our store portfolio. We’re working hard to ensure our coffeehouses have the right vibe…we want to invite customers in, showcase our great coffee, provide a comfortable place to stay, and make them feel like their visit was time well spent.”

With the near-term focus of “Back to Starbucks” on the U.S. business, Starbucks is a global company with significant international opportunity.

“Our operations in many global markets also set an example for our U.S. coffeehouses, with outstanding partners serving customers every day. We have so much potential to keep growing around the world.”

Hobson followed Niccol with remarks of gratitude to Starbucks shareholders for her nearly 20 years of service on the board.

“The current board is stocked with a deep bench of world class business minds, and with Brian now firmly at the helm, I am confident Starbucks is in excellent hands. Together, Brian and the board will guide this company into the future…while remaining laser-focused on driving long-term value for all stakeholders,” Hobson said.

Throughout his remarks, Niccol highlighted his confidence in returning the business to growth. “We’re focused on our “Back to Starbucks” plan. We are moving quickly to execute, and I am pleased at the early reaction to changes we’ve made from both customers and partners. It makes me optimistic for our future.”

CVS confirmed to FOX Business that it will open at least a dozen smaller format locations in select communities across the country over the next year.
However, the company said it is still opening up traditional CVS Pharmacy locations, which contain a full front store and pharmacy.
In addition to the new small-format pharmacies, the company is planning to open nearly 30 CVS Pharmacy locations, including those inside Target stores, this year.
Leventhal believes the CVS’ new store formats could help the company become less reliant on front-of-store customer traffic.","CVS Pharmacy is expanding its footprint. But a major focus is on smaller store formats exclusively offering pharmacy services.

The shift to small-format stores comes as the industry works to rightsize and reduce costs in response to ongoing challenges, including intense competition and shifting consumer preferences.

CVS confirmed to FOX Business that it will open at least a dozen smaller format locations in select communities across the country over the next year.

The new pharmacies, which will average less than 5,000 square feet, will feature a full-service pharmacy with limited over-the-counter products available for purchase and will be designed to meet the community’s specific pharmacy needs.

WALGREENS TO GO PRIVATE IN $10B DEAL

""By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we’re continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patient and ensure the right geographic coverage,"" a CVS spokesperson told FOX Business.

However, the company said it is still opening up traditional CVS Pharmacy locations, which contain a full front store and pharmacy. In addition to the new small-format pharmacies, the company is planning to open nearly 30 CVS Pharmacy locations, including those inside Target stores, this year.

Emarketer senior analyst Rajiv Leventhal told FOX Business that the retail plus pharmacy business model has been difficult for companies like CVS and Walgreens to successfully operate as people increasingly turn to online channels for household items.

The growing number of closures at CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens in recent years highlights how the industry is attempting to right-size itself after rapidly expanding its footprint. CVS has shuttered hundreds of stores and laid off staff in order to re-prioritize its investments and adhere to the changing customer needs. Between 2022 and 2024, it closed 900 stores, and opened 100 new locations. It plans to close an additional 270 in 2025.

WHY NEIGHBORHOOD PHARMACIES ARE CLOSING

In 2023, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy and launched a store optimization plan, closing 154 locations. Then, in 2024, Walgreens announced plans to close at least 1,200 stores over the next three years in an effort to reduce costs and turn around its operations. Walgreens has not commented on whether this timeline will change now that the company is going private. Last week, Walgreens, once a $100 billion business, agreed to sell to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal valued at 10% of that, about $10 billion.

Leventhal expects this move to accelerate, and potentially increase, the number of store closures. He predicts that major companies like Walgreens and CVS will continue closing many of their stores while focusing more on pharmacy services in the locations they keep open.

""Consumers are prioritizing price, speed, and convenience above all. Drugstores locking up items to prevent theft further frustrates shoppers and causes many to abandon in-store purchases,"" Leventhal said. However, he underscored that CVS’ and Walgreens’ recent retail pharmacy struggles are much more about the front of the store than behind the pharmacy counter.

""Patients will always need their medications, and CVS and Walgreens rank first and second in US pharmacy size as measured by total prescription revenues,"" Leventhal added.

Leventhal believes the CVS’ new store formats could help the company become less reliant on front-of-store customer traffic. He also suggests this model could empower pharmacists to play a larger role in patients’ healthcare decisions.

""Doubling down on the steadier business—prescription and over-the-counter medications—is a savvy play,"" he said.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/03/1280/720/cvs-pharmacy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-03-12 16:05:26.639133

After nearly eight and a half decades of being America's favorite fast-food chain, McDonald's has been struggling with a slowdown in sales. This is partly due to growing competition, price increases caused by inflation, and changes in its DEI practices, which have caused persistent backlash and boycotts.

Nonetheless, McDonald's refuses to let all these setbacks hinder its decades-old business or allow its rivals to dethrone it from its highly coveted position.

McDonald's develops a multi-year strategy to accelerate growth

Since announcing its first Accelerating the Arches growth strategy in 2020, which focused on McDonald's (MCD) purpose, mission, values, growth pillars, and foundation of running its restaurants, it has seen immense improvements in its business.

According to the company, McDonald's has grown its digital footprint to over 175 million 90-day active users across 60 markets, generating around $30 billion in systemwide sales to loyalty members in 2024. The fast food chain has also expanded its restaurants faster and introduced global menu innovations worldwide.

However, with the ever-evolving market and consumer trends, maintaining the same growth strategy for multiple years seemed to no longer do it for McDonald's.

Quick-service restaurants have begun specializing in a single product as their main selling point to accelerate growth in record time. They focus on what they do best to dominate that specific market.

Some of McDonald's biggest rivals successfully executing this strategy include Chick-fil-A, which focuses on chicken-based menu items; Dutch Bros, which focuses on beverages; and In-N-Out Burger, which focuses on its burgers.

McDonald's introduces the launch of new specialized teams to compete with its biggest rivals

Unlike many of its rivals, McDonald's refuses to let increased competition dominate the market. Instead of blaming others, it has taken action to fight back against its fast-growing rivals.

On Mar. 11, McDonald's introduced the new Restaurant Experience Team, which brings together operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to execute new innovative ideas and optimize efficiency.

These newly founded teams were created to stand against McDonald's strongest competitors by keeping up with emerging trends, allowing it to stay ahead of the game and continue gaining further market share.

""There’s strong competition within the QSR industry, and success is determined by our ability to gain share. In many markets, McDonald’s is competing against specialists.

J&J also reported that it spent $145,381 on Duato’s use of personal aircraft and $102,779 on home security services last year.
In 2024, J&J generated significantly more sales than any company in the life sciences industry at $88.8 billion, which was a 4.3% increase year over year.
In 2023, J&J realized a 6.5% increase in revenue.
The graph shows that $100 invested in J&J back in 2019 would have been worth about $115 in 2024.","In his third year as the CEO of Johnson & Johnson, Joaquin Duato received an overall compensation package worth $24.3 million. It was a 14% decrease from his $28.4 million figure in 2023, when he was the world’s highest-paid Big Pharma chief executive.

The reduction is due largely to calculations surrounding changes in the CEO's pension value from year to year. While his estimated pension value grew by $6.2 million in 2023, the increase was $2.7 million in 2024, according (PDF) to a regulatory filing.

Duato, 62, also saw decreases in his bonus—from $4.4 million in 2023 to $4 million last year—and in his equity awards, which fell from $16 million to $15.7 million from year to year.

J&J also reported that it spent $145,381 on Duato’s use of personal aircraft and $102,779 on home security services last year.

In 2024, J&J generated significantly more sales than any company in the life sciences industry at $88.8 billion, which was a 4.3% increase year over year. In 2023, J&J realized a 6.5% increase in revenue.

Still, the company has continued to struggle in resolving its talc litigation—which is now in its third bankruptcy effort. In its proxy, J&J said that it “recorded an accounting charge of $5.1 billion related to talc matters in 2024.”

J&J added that it determined it was in the “best interest of the company and shareholders to exclude the $5.1 billion talc settlement charge” from its executive compensation considerations.

""The underlying events and decisions that resulted in the talc-related litigation charges occurred before company executives assumed their current roles,"" the company explained. ""Company executives have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the litigation on behalf of the company and shareholders.""

In addition, a graph charting shareholder returns for peer group companies shows J&J’s returns declining over the past two years while returns for J&J’s peer group companies have increased.

The graph shows that $100 invested in J&J back in 2019 would have been worth about $115 in 2024. But for an index of other large-cap pharma companies, the number was $155.

Duato took the helm at J&J at the start of 2022, succeeding Alex Gorsky, who guided the company for a decade. During his tenure, Gorsky twice collected more than $29 million in annual compensation. In his final year (2021), Gorsky was the highest-paid Big Pharma exec at $26.7 million.

Among other J&J execs, chief financial officer Joseph Wolk saw his compensation decline from $13.9 million to $12.6 million from 2023 to 2024.

Innovative medicines chief Jennifer Taubert received $11.2 million in total compensation last year, while R&D chief John Reed, M.D., Ph.D., collected a $9.3 million pay package.

The move comes as Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said that recent efforts to develop new sandwiches have taken too long. Kempczinski, who has led the QSR since 2019, told the Journal that McDonald’s strategic plans emphasize greater nimbleness, but that the company needs to deploy new products and technology to restaurants faster and improve coordination with stores.

Kempczinski said he hoped that a year from now, the new innovation structure will help McDonald’s win more market share, particularly in beef, chicken and coffee.

Under the new structure, Jill McDonald will become the restaurant’s first chief restaurant experience officer, effective May 1. McDonald currently heads the company’s international division that includes Europe, Canada and Australia.

According to the Journal, in the new role she will lead a team that works across operations, supply chain, franchising, development, design, delivery and the company’s innovation lab. The group will also include executives overseeing the chain’s beef, chicken and beverage businesses across the globe.

“I wanted one person who’s actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the restaurant general manager,” Kempczinski said.

McDonald will “oversee the global chief supply-chain officer, helping to ensure that restaurants have the right equipment and processes for handling new menu items.” Charlie Newberger, who currently helps run the company’s CosMc’s offshoot, will lead work on beverages and desserts.

Kempczinski, previously an executive at Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo, told the Journal that adopting a mindset similar to a consumer packaged-food company can help McDonald’s move faster. Having executives focused solely on beverages, for example, can determine where McDonald’s might need to introduce new products, he said.

McDonald's takes years to introduce new burgers, its CEO says, and he wants to change that.

The chain's chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, said he wants to speed up the process of introducing new burgers and improving existing signature burgers. He made these comments in an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on Tuesday.

Kempczinski says he's switching things up in leadership and operations to make the company move faster. Part of that involves changing the job scopes of his leadership team to roll out new technology and products to its restaurants faster.

Jill McDonald, who heads the company's international division, has been tapped to be the chain's first chief restaurant experience officer starting May 1. McDonald is a retail veteran, having held top roles at Marks and Spencer and Costa Coffee.

She'll lead the team responsible for the company's innovation, supply chains, and operations.

""I wanted one person who's actually looking at all these tech things through the eyes of the restaurant general manager,"" Kempczinski said to the Journal.

He did not elaborate on how else he would speed up the burger development process. Representatives for McDonald's did not respond to a query from Business Insider on the topic, sent outside regular business hours.

In the interview, Kempczinski also hinted at a more extensive drinks menu. He said he would get executives to focus exclusively on beverage development.

He said this would help the company find a way to keep customers in store and buying their drinks rather than going to competitors.

""We just need to make sure that our menu offering doesn't give somebody a reason why they come to us for their food and they maybe go to the place next door to go get the beverage,"" Kempczinski said.

Kempczinski's comments come as the chain posted stagnant financial results in 2024. The chain's global comparable sales declined 0.1% in 2024. It reported a full-year revenue of $25.92 billion.

When markets closed on Tuesday, McDonald's stock traded at $306.8. It has risen about 4% in the past year.

The fast food industry is facing a wave of cost-conscious consumers in the US who are put off by rising fast food product prices. Some are opting to eat at home.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz embarked on a significant expansion project at its manufacturing facility in Garland, Texas, USA.
In 2022, Kraft Heinz also expanded its global operations by acquiring an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH.
In 2024, Kraft Heinz reported progress in its transformation journey, emphasising innovation in flavour, snacking and easy meals.
Additionally, Kraft Heinz expanded the use of its condiments beyond traditional pairings, targeting foods like burritos and tacos.","COVID-19 profoundly impacted global manufacturing, disrupting supply chains, changing the landscape of consumer demand and prompting operational shifts to comply with social distancing guidelines.

We saw the US auto industry experience a notable downturn, with car sales as of yet not returning to 2019 levels.

In Germany, almost 250,000 manufacturing jobs were lost as industries invested heavily in automation.

For Kraft Heinz, the pandemic presented opportunities and challenges.

It mandated social distancing guidelines and pursued key protocols to reduce the spread of the disease, whilst working to strategically adapt to dramatic changes in demand.

With the shift to a 'stay at home' economy and the rise of consumer panic buying in preparation for lockdowns, the manufacturer experienced an unprecedented surge in demand for products like Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Heinz Ketchup, Maxwell House Coffee and Oscar Mayer hot dogs.

To meet this demand, Kraft Heinz adapted and enhanced its resiliency.

All US factories operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week to produce the aforementioned products- an unprecedented level of operation, far greater than typical seasonal demand.

This was possible due to Kraft Heinz's workforce, who showed up ensure a steady food supply during the crisis- employee attendance rates at the manufacturer's factories were among the best in recent years.

The result was that factories like Kraft Heinz's Iowa plant, responsible for producing Oscar Mayer cold cuts, achieved record outputs during the pandemic.

Kraft Heinz has since built on this growth by enhancing its production capabilities and modernising its manufacturing and distribution centres.

This expansion, growing since 2020, is also a reflection of Kraft Heinz's strategic adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies like automation and AI.

Here are just a few examples of how Kraft Heinz has successfully grown since the pandemic.

In 2021 Manufacturing Digital reported on Kraft Heinz's £140 million ( US$189m) investment in its Kitt Green plant near Wigan, UK, Europe's largest food manufacturing facility.

Last year this factory - in a project pursued in collaboration with Carlton Power - became a green hydrogen project, enabling Kraft Heinz to fuel over 50% of the site using hydrogen.

This project is anticipated to finish in 2026.

Kraft Heinz's 2021 investment was the company's most substantial investment in an existing manufacturing site outside the United States in over two decades.

The Kitt Green facility produces approximately 1.3 billion cans of food annually, including iconic products like Heinz Beanz, soups and pasta, with 94% consumed within the UK.

The investment aimed to modernise the site's manufacturing capabilities over four years, focusing on three key areas:

Repatriating sauce production: Bringing the manufacturing of Heinz sauces such as ketchup, mayonnaise and salad cream back to the UK to enhance European capacity.

Upgrading machinery: Implementing state-of-the-art equipment to improve efficiency and product quality.

Enhancing sustainability: Aligning with environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) commitments by reducing the use of non-renewable resources and lowering the facility's carbon footprint.

This modernisation was expected to created 50 new full-time positions and provide upskilling opportunities for existing staff.

The initiative underscored Kraft Heinz's confidence in the UK's post-Brexit economy and its commitment to supporting local manufacturing, inspiring further expansion abroad.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz embarked on a significant expansion project at its manufacturing facility in Garland, Texas, USA.

This initiative involved a capital investment of US$143m, aimed at modernising and upgrading the plant's production capabilities. #

The expansion plans included the addition of two to three new production lines and the modernisation of existing ones.

This development was projected to create approximately 200 new jobs, increasing the facility's workforce to around 1,500 employees.

The project was scheduled to span three years, commencing in 2022 and concluding in 2026.

Kraft Heinz also began a €70 million (US$82.6m) expansion of its manufacturing site in Alfaro, La Rioja, Spain in 2021.

This investment increased the factory's capacity by 50%, enhancing its position as one of the company's most efficient facilities in Europe.

The expansion included the addition of a state-of-the-art processing plant and was expected to generate 39 new permanent jobs in the region.

The Alfaro plant produces a range of Heinz sauces for both local and European markets and processes approximately 25,000 tonnes of locally grown tomatoes annually for the company's Orlando brand.

In 2022, Kraft Heinz also expanded its global operations by acquiring an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH.

Established in 2014, Just Spices is a direct-to-consumer company offering over 170 products, including spice blends, salad dressings and organic options.

Approximately 70% of its sales are online, with the remainder through retailers in Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland.

This acquisition aligned with Kraft Heinz's strategy to enhance its direct-to-consumer capabilities and strengthen its presence in the taste elevation market, enabling the company to greater diversify.

In July 2023, Kraft Heinz announced a substantial investment exceeding US$400m to construct a 775,000 square-foot automated distribution centre in DeKalb, Illinois.

This facility was designed to enhance supply chain efficiencies and expedite product distribution to retail and foodservice customers across North America.

Equipped with state-of-the-art automation technology and national railway access, the centre handles more than 60% of the company's foodservice business and approximately 30% of all dry goods.

The project created more than 150 jobs in the region and aligns with Kraft Heinz's environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) goals by implementing sustainable technologies to minimise environmental impact.

In May 2024, Kraft Heinz Canada and Highbury Canco extended their partnership agreement for another four years, ensuring continued production at the Leamington, Ontario facility until the end of 2027.

This extension marked the third consecutive renewal of their collaboration, underscoring the importance of the Leamington plant in Kraft Heinz's operations.

The 2.1-million-square-foot facility employs over 600 Canadians and produces popular products such as Heinz beans, Heinz tomato juice and Classico pasta sauce.

The estimated retail value of products to be produced at this facility over the next four years exceeds US$1bn.

In 2024, Kraft Heinz reported progress in its transformation journey, emphasising innovation in flavour, snacking and easy meals.

The manufacturer introduced new ketchup flavours, including a spicy variant in the US and a pickle-infused option for a tangy taste.

Additionally, Kraft Heinz expanded the use of its condiments beyond traditional pairings, targeting foods like burritos and tacos.

In the easy meals segment, the company launched Heinz Curry Beanz, which generated 60% incrementality and attracted new customers to the category.

Convenience was further enhanced with Heinz Beans snap-pots for microwave use and frozen Kraft Mac & Cheese options.

These initiatives aimed to meet modern consumer demands and strengthen Kraft Heinz's market position.

In addition to producing a range of Heinz sauces for local and European consumption, the Alfaro plant processes around 25,000 tons of locally grown tomatoes each year for the company’s market-leading Orlando brand.

Spain is a key production centre for Heinz in Europe and boosting capability in the region brings the company closer to its ambition to lead the future of food.

This journey not only highlights Kraft Heinz's successful manufacturing strategy of continual expansion and diversification, but also how critical their response was during the pandemic.

SocGen CEO pledges cost cuts to boost efficiency

Société Générale chief executive Slawomir Krupa has pledged to slash costs at the French bank, declaring that “nothing is sacred” as he seeks to improve efficiency and reduce its high cost base.

In an interview with the Financial Times published on Tuesday, Krupa described SocGen as having “lower levels of efficiency” than its peers and an “overspend” problem that needed to be addressed.

At the end of 2024, the bank’s cost-to-income ratio stood at 69 per cent, one of the highest among major European lenders, though it had fallen by five percentage points compared with the previous year. SocGen has previously said it was targeting a cost-to-income ratio of below 60 per cent by 2026.

As part of his restructuring plans launched in September 2023, Krupa has overseen job cuts and the disposal of non-core businesses in an effort to strengthen capital reserves. He said that IT spending could be further reduced and that decreasing the bank’s dependence on external consultants could further lower its cost base.

Krupa told the FT that the bank had incurred “colossal” restructuring costs, amounting to €613mn last year, but noted these were “disappearing progressively”.

His initial strategy was met with scepticism from investors, but confidence has since improved, with SocGen’s share price climbing over 70 per cent in the past year.

Net-Zero Banking Alliance members to vote on abandoning 1.5C pledge

The Net-Zero Banking Alliance is set to ask its members, which include HSBC and Barclays, to vote on whether to abandon a commitment to align their $54tn in assets with the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C.

The vote, reported by the Financial Times on Tuesday, comes as the NZBA seeks to retain members following a wave of exits by major US banks.

Since the election of Donald Trump as US president, 14 leading US banks, including Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan, have withdrawn from the group, arguing they cannot decarbonise their lending and investment portfolios at a pace faster than the broader economy.

The NZBA is now contending with similar warnings from Europe. The FT previously reported that a coalition of leading European banks has threatened to exit unless the group relaxes its rules.

Under the revised proposal, members would pledge to align their activities with the less stringent target of keeping global warming “well below 2C” while making efforts to limit it to 1.5C.

US recession risk now at 40%, warns JPMorgan economist

JPMorgan’s chief economist, Bruce Kasman, warned on Wednesday that the risk of a US recession has risen to 40 per cent from 30 per cent at the start of the year, citing political uncertainty and trade policies as potential threats to the country’s appeal as an investment destination.

“Where we stand now is with a heightened concern about the US economy,” Kasman said in comments reported by Reuters.

JPMorgan currently projects US GDP growth of 2 per cent in 2025. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have both lowered their US growth forecasts to 1.7 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively.

Kasman warned that if President Donald Trump’s proposed reciprocal tariffs, set to take effect in April, are fully implemented, the risk of a US recession could rise to 50 per cent or higher.

“If we would continue down this road of what would be more disruptive, business-unfriendly policies, I think the risks on that recession front would go up,” he said.

ICBC launches $11bn tech fund to boost China’s private sector

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China announced on Wednesday that it has launched an Rmb80bn ($11bn) technology and innovation fund to support the country’s private economy.

The fund will focus on “hard technology” sectors such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing, rather than “soft” technology like internet services, according to a statement from the state-owned bank.

ICBC chair Liao Lin said the bank would “thoroughly implement directives from central leadership” by turning supportive policies into concrete actions for private enterprises.

He said that the fund is designed as “patient capital”, prioritising long-term investment over short-term gains.

The announcement follows China’s annual parliamentary meeting last week, where policymakers set their key priorities for 2025.

This month, Wellvana paid an undisclosed sum to buy CVS Health's Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO operations in a transaction that also made the Aetna parent company a minority shareholder in Wellvana.

Under the Medicare Shared Savings Program, providers form groups of ACOs and take on risk for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. These partnerships often contract with companies such Wellvana, which can pocket savings they help generate.

Wellvana already works with providers assuming risk under the fee-for-service Medicare ACO Realizing Equity, Access and Community Health, or ACO REACH, model and contracts with Medicare Advantage insurers such as Humana and Centene.

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Why did you make the Medicare Shared Savings Program deal?

We've been going very deep in supporting practices and providing a lot of tech-enabled services. That could be scheduling, value-based care, education and medical management for patients, whereas CVS built scale and has a lighter-touch model. These models make a great marriage and give providers flexibility. Not all providers are going to want the same type of service or the same level of service.

Scale also brings predictability. Predictability enables us to invest more in our provider relationships. It allows us to invest in medical management, invest in documentation, and invest in services and education.

The combined company has about $12.5 billion in medical spending under management and we have approximately 1 million patient lives associated with that medical spend. We have 500 accountable care organization clients. Those clients are a combination of large hospitals, primary care providers or independent physician practices. We now have 300-plus team members and brought about 150 CVS employees into the company through the acquisition.

Are you eyeing additional acquisitions?

We certainly want to continue to partner with additional health systems, primary care and independent providers, and also Medicare Advantage payers. As we look at our network, there is a significant opportunity to expand within our existing provider partners into Medicare Advantage.

What is your outlook for Medicare Advantage under President Donald Trump?

We're bullish long-term. If you look at the growth within the program over the past decade, it's hard to deny the value proposition that patients are seeing in the program. We expect it to continue to grow.

Patients need to have optionality. We're pretty diversified between traditional Medicare programs, like ACO REACH or Medicare Shared Savings Program, and the Medicare Advantage side. That diversification is important. We want our business to look like the panel of our providers.

Regardless of the administration, we do think the Medicare Advantage industry has good tailwinds.

ACO REACH is scheduled to sunset in 2026. How do you feel about its future?

We're optimistic about the program. Medicare set a goal for 100% of patients to be tied to value by 2030. ACO REACH is a key part of that. It's up to 2.5 million lives in the program. It's a pretty significant scale in a pretty short period.

Whether the ACO REACH program becomes permanent, or whether there are higher levels of risk incorporated into the Medicare Shared Savings Program, we feel optimistic that higher levels of risk in traditional Medicare will continue to happen.

Do you assume risk for pharmacy and supplemental benefit costs in your contracts with Medicare Advantage insurers?

We do not take risk on Part D prescription drug benefits today. We're not taking pharmaceutical risk unless it's hitting under Part B for provider-infused drugs, which is only a small percentage of pharmaceutical costs. We do assume risk today on supplemental benefits. It's something that we will continue to evaluate and see if that makes sense for us.

We used to take risk in pharmacy. But with the changes in the Inflation Reduction Act and the uncertainty associated with that in terms of the cost, that is something that we moved away from.",https://s3-prod.modernhealthcare.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/Kyle-Wailes-Wellvana-0325.png,N,,2025-03-12 11:06:15.958597

Recognizing this, a global conglomerate with many lines of business wanted to improve the efficiency of its supply chain and warehouses.

The challenge involved assessing and optimizing the value of the company’s stock in warehouses around the world. The goal is to avoid losses by shipping the highest value items from its warehouses first, but unexpected changes in demand often led to mismatched stock levels.

If stock levels increased, the result was the value of inventory went down because of the surplus. A discount offer on a selling price may incentivize market demand but it lowers the earnings on every item sold. The company wanted to improve detection and forecast changes to market demand to mitigate impacts to its inventory value.

Enabling an optimal supply chain

Maintaining optimal stock value in the longer term requires demand forecasting, warehouse optimization, and cost reduction. The company chose to partner with Capgemini and Google Cloud to implement these capabilities because of their extensive experience with supply chain transformations.

Working with Capgemini and Google Cloud, the company used a data-driven stock quantity-centered approach to better understand the market and consumer demand. It chose a specific isolated market to prototype and test the solution, to create the right template before global deployment. The two elements now working to prevent value loss in the warehouses are:

A generative AI-based chatbot. Built on Google Vertex AI, the Large Language Model (LLM) agent understands user intent, generates database queries on the fly, and interactively provides answers in text, diagrams, graphics, tables, and figures.

A forecast engine. This generated sales and demand forecasts based on historical data for future projects. Typically, the projections covered 30, 60, or 90 days or could stretch to a full year. Improved demand forecast reduces the unexpected mismatch of stock and market requirements, so the company can now be proactive in responding to market conditions.

Maximizing margins, lowering costs

With its two-part solution, the conglomerate has the information to more effectively predict customer demand and make supply chain decisions. Analyzing historical demand patterns and market indicators to generate forecasts helps optimize stock, sales management, and supply strategies. In turn, warehouse optimization means getting the most out of inventory levels to prevent stock value loss and improves overall supply chain efficiency while ensuring resources are more effectively allocated and utilized.

Shortening the period between analytical requests and responses gives the company improved real-time insights into the market and a better picture of current demand. This advanced demand forecasting helps the company avoid loss of stock value and determines how to get the most value from its existing inventory levels, all supporting supply chain efficiency.

Positive Points

Kuros Biosciences Ltd (CSBTF, Financial) achieved a remarkable 136% top-line growth in MagnetOs sales, showcasing strong performance across various teams.

The company has expanded its regulatory clearances in both spine and extremities, allowing entry into new markets and increasing the global addressable market.

A strategic agreement with Medtronic has been established, setting the stage for future growth and providing significant market leverage.

Kuros Biosciences Ltd (CSBTF) reported a profitable business with no debt and a $9 million EBITDA, indicating strong financial health.

The company has successfully expanded its international presence, now operating in over 20 countries, which enhances its global footprint.

Negative Points

Despite strong growth, the revenue from Europe remains low at about 1%, highlighting a need for further market penetration outside the US.

The company faces challenges in the extremities market, with a focus on building clinical evidence before aggressively pursuing revenue growth.

There is a delay in expected milestone payments from the Checkmate asset, pushing potential pre-commercial milestones to 2031-2032.

Kuros Biosciences Ltd (CSBTF) is investing heavily in infrastructure and extremities, which may eat into EBITDA margins in the short term.

The ongoing head-to-head trials against DBX and cell-based allografts will not have readouts until 2026-2027, delaying potential market impact.

Q & A Highlights

Q: What are the key assumptions behind Kuros Biosciences' 2025 growth target of at least 60%?

A: Chris Fair, CEO, explained that the growth is driven by the strategic agreement with Medtronic, which has opened over 100 opportunities. The timeline from opportunity to impact is typically four to six months. International expansion and methodical growth in the extremities market are also key factors. The partnership with Medtronic will help accelerate growth in the extremities market by providing quicker access to surgeons.

Q: How is the partnership with Medtronic progressing, and what impact does it have on revenue?

A: Chris Fair stated that Medtronic is a tremendous partner, drawn to Kuros by their clinical evidence. The partnership is in early stages, with opportunities being presented regularly. While specific revenue contributions from Medtronic are not disclosed, the goal is to grow together, leveraging Medtronic's market share to benefit both parties.

Q: What is the strategy for penetrating the foot and ankle market, and how quickly can Kuros achieve significant market share?

A: Chris Fair mentioned that Kuros can grow the extremities business faster than the spine business due to existing hospital registrations. The focus is on building clinical evidence and establishing relationships with key opinion leaders. The second phase, involving greater market penetration, is expected in the second half of the year.

Q: What are the expectations for profitability in 2025, and how will it develop?

A: Daniel Geiger, CFO, indicated that Kuros is in a growth phase, investing in infrastructure and the extremities market. The aim is to at least match the 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9%, with potential gradual improvements. Key factors include maintaining a 90% gross margin and optimizing sales and marketing expenses.

Q: Why is Kuros switching its reporting currency from CHF to USD?

A: Daniel Geiger explained that USD is the primary currency for internal budgeting and performance measurement, as most revenues are generated in USD. The switch also aligns with the expanded institutional investor base and facilitates communication with international investors. There are no current plans for a US listing.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000WYP.png?5,N,,2025-03-12 06:06:51.510843

Privia Health Q4 2024 Earnings Call: Key Takeaways & Outlook for 2025

How does Privia Health make money?

Privia’s model is pretty interesting. It works across all payors and all payment models (fee for service, MSSP, capitation). In 2024 you can see Privia shied away from full risk (capitation) given MA headwinds and unfavorable environment.

Privia management echoed as much on their 4th quarter earnings call: Privia is after delivering the most value to its primary stakeholders: physicians (and by extension, patients) – and Privia wants to maximize its ability to provide value to those physicians, similar to most other firms in the enablement/MSO space.

So, Privia can benefit both from (1) a high utilization environment through FFS revenue and (2) markets or conditions where it’s appropriate to take risk and expand that book of business.

“We continue to expect headwinds in Medicare Advantage over the next few years, given pressures from elevated utilization trends, phase-in of V28 through 2026 and changes in star scores among other factors. However, the diversification of previous value-based care contracts gives us confidence in our ability to build scale and profitability across the business despite challenges in any one particular program…Ultimately, our goal is consistent and sustainable earnings growth for all medical groups and shareholders year after year.” – Parth Mehrotra

In 2024, Privia Health closed out the year on a strong note, exceeding the high end of all guidance metrics and setting the stage for continued growth in 2025. Privia signed above the high end of its implemented providers (a key economic signal for Privia’s overall business) range – 4,789 in total.

Privia’s current footprint includes 14 states and 1,200 care locations:

2. Revenue Growth and Payer Mix: Diversification Mitigates Medicare Advantage Pressures

Capitated revenue book showed a 2% positive contribution margin, though the Privia team still wants to be pretty conservative around committing fully to downside risk as mentioned. Value-based care diversification across commercial and government contracts provided resilience against sector-wide headwinds. Privia also noted it’s not expecting any sort of bump in growth from its shared savings book of business in 2025 based on ongoing pressures in MA.

This quote on propensity for Privia to take risk is one Parth Mehrotra reiterates often, and it’s a great way to look at value-based care as a whole and every stakeholder having ‘skin in the game’ – over and over, Privia mentions their preference for shared risk being the right approach to value-based care:

“…you have to distinguish between the willingness to take risk and the ability to take risk. We’ve always had the ability to take risk. We do so at the highest level in MSSP as you know. We do capitation in MA with a small book. I don’t think providers wake up every day saying we want to do full risk. I think there’s a lot of noise in the space by entities that jumped into full risk. And I think it’s a misconception that to perform well in value-based care, to perform well in MA, you necessarily need to take full risk. We’ve always said we prefer models where the payer has skin in the game, an entity like Privia that’s enabling has skin in the game and the doctors have skin in the game or the medical groups and the risk entities have skin in the game. And we share it upside and down, and I think that keeps everybody honest.”

5. 2025 Outlook and Guidance: Hitting the Singles and Doubles, Compounding the Biz

Privia continues down the path of solid year over year growth in a capital efficient model. Management expects to reach 5,200+ providers in 2025, around a 10% increase during the year.

In 2025, Privia will continue to hit on core execution, which is pure and simple as the following:

“…first, provider growth to increase density and scale in existing and new markets; second, attribution growth and performance in value-based arrangements; and third, operational improvements and efficiencies that impact the bottom line.” – David Mountcastle

Privia’s operating model in mature markets is also proving out, as the firm expects margin expansion and significant (19%) adjusted EBITDA growth stemming from operating leverage in its most mature markets. It’s also significant from the perspective that Privia seems to be focusing on building out existing density in current markets, and seemingly no short term plans to enter new markets according to commentary around what’s included in its guidance.

I should note Privia has a decent amount of cash on the balance sheet and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it put to use. Management was coy around M&A but we already saw another big deal happen between CVS and Wellvana this week (more on this in the near future) so blood is in the water.

“We’ve said previously, we’re looking at medical groups, risk entities, MSO entities. Given our model, I think we can be very flexible.”

Another interesting point from the analyst Q&A centered around ACO REACH, whether the program receives an extension, and how that might affect Privia’s ability to recruit more provider groups if there’s any fallout there. Privia noted it prefers to say in MSSP, thinks it’s a better model, and that any potential convergence happening between the two would validate that position.

Final Thoughts: A Resilient Growth Story

Privia Health demonstrated another year of strong execution, marked by provider growth, financial discipline, and strategic diversification. While Medicare Advantage remains a challenge across the industry, Privia’s balanced mix of commercial and government contracts provides a uniquely flexible model in the market, which is why Privia has been relatively successful compared to its other VBC peers post-IPO. They’re also going to continue to shy away from capitation and will be careful with taking on full risk. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Privia is disciplined with its approach to growth and is focused on compounding the business by hitting singles and doubles.",https://hospitalogy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/Privia-2024-Waterfall.png,N,,2025-03-12 01:04:39.950623

GyG announced a 27% increase in revenue, attributing the growth to new store locations meeting increased demand.

Despite a slight drop in average basket size for Crust and Grill’d, the gains per customer outweighed the loss in individual transaction size. GyG and Crust have plans to expand further, with GyG planning to open 30 new stores and Crust planning 12 new locations in 2025. Grill’d opened 16 new locations in 2024 but has not announced specific store plans for 2025.

Fonto's Moments in QSR data, which tracks market share and competitive advantages within the QSR category, highlights these trends. More than 85,000 Australians share their daily financial transaction data with Fonto, which is used to understand buyer behaviour over time. Fonto also surveys fast food customers shortly after purchases to gain insights into consumer behaviour.

Ben Dixon, CEO of Fonto, commented on the shifting dynamics in the fast-food sector: ""We are seeing customers embracing alternatives, especially ones that promote fresher ingredients, even in the fast food space. Where Domino’s has recently faced challenges in product quality, Crust continues to bring customers back, spending more. Where consumers are looking for fresher, higher quality burger alternative, Grill’d is taking share and loyalty away from the larger chains. GyG’s overall brand promise as healthier fast food is also clearly working, with their sales and profit up across the board.""",http://www.mi-3.com.au/sites/default/files/2025-03/6276d168-9ed2-4626-bd56-7eeeaae4c2ad.jpeg,N,,2025-03-12 01:05:17.847716

Cardinal Health executive pay

Cardinal Health reported nearly $25.7 million in total compensation for Hollar in its most recent disclosure, up 37 percent from the $18.8 million he made the year before, which was his first as CEO.

Hollar’s pay for fiscal 2024 (ended June 30, 2024) included a $1.43 million salary, $20.6 million in stock awards and a $3.1 million bonus. He also received $463,532 in other compensation, most of which was $438,175 worth of personal use of corporate aircraft.

Cardinal Health median worker pay and CEO pay ratio

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires publicly traded companies like Cardinal Health to calculate the gap between CEO compensation and pay for its median employee.

Cardinal Health reported the pay of its median worker at $56,119, down 19% from the $69,024 figure the company reported in each of the previous three years.

That means that Hollar’s compensation was 457 times greater than what Cardinal Health’s median employee received, the company said, up from 269 the year before.

As in recent years, Cardinal Health said that median worker was a full-time employee in the U.S., but did not provide a job title. At other medtech companies that offer more details about their median workers than required by the SEC pay disclosure rules, those median medtech workers often hold technical roles such as device design or engineering.

The fast food giant is reorganizing its operations to speed up product launches, focusing on “winning” in three key areas: beef, chicken, and beverages.

“We could be moving faster,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a LinkedIn (MSFT) post. He added that this involves working in a “more horizontal way.”

Kempczinski explained that the new structure will help McDonald’s implement big ideas across essential functions like operations, supply chain, and restaurant design. By breaking down traditional silos and creating specialized departments, McDonald’s hopes to respond faster to market trends and customer demands.

Part of this shift includes the appointment of a new Restaurant Experience Officer. Jill McDonald, currently in charge of the company’s international division in Europe, Canada, and Australia, will take on the inaugural role. Kempczinski emphasized the need for a single “touchpoint” for all of these tech-driven efforts.

Perhaps most strategically, the team will establish three global category leads for beef, chicken and beverages. This approach challenges category leaders like Yum! Brands-owned (YUM) KFC, which dominates the chicken market.

With consumer confidence dipping and fast food prices pushing customers away, McDonald’s new strategy could be the bump it needs to regain its competitive edge. Kempczinski, who previously worked at Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Pepsi Co. (PEP), believes adopting a consumer-packaged goods mindset will help McDonald’s pick up the pace.

However, this won’t be an easy task. McDonald’s case still faces challenges, including recovering from an E. coli outbreak in Oct. 2024 that hurt foot traffic.

Several restaurant chains, such as Domino’s and Papa John’s, have lowered their financial forecasts, citing cautious spending due to inflation and geopolitical uncertainty – largely tied to President Donald Trump’s looming tariffs.

As McDonald’s works to regain market share, its latest moves could inspire other chains to follow suit. Recent wins, like the return of the Shamrock Shake and Egg McMuffin deal, have been well-received by budget-conscious consumers.

For the first quarter of 2025, the company reported $1.68 billion in revenue at a 25.1% operating margin (2).

The company’s revenue was spread across the world with 40% coming from the Americas, 27% from Europe, and 33% from the Asia-Pacific region. The company’s finances were also divided between its various divisions. The Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group (LDG), which provides a wide portfolio of technology platforms and solutions to serve Agilent customers' value chain, such as therapeutic production and the development of critical cancer diagnostics, reported $647 million in revenue, a 4% increase in reported growth (2,3). This exceeded expectations on high-single digit (HSD) growth performance in liquid chromatography (LC) and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS), likely due to positive reception to the company’s newly released LC platform.

Applied Markets Group (AMG), which primarily focuses on the food, environmental, and advanced materials markets, among others, accrued $338 million in revenue; while this is a 4% decrease in reported growth, the company claims this division “[delivered] better than expected revenue versus a very challenging Q1’24 comparison, impacted by the timing of Lunar New Year,” and strong future growth remains expected (2,3). Finally, the Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG) brought in $696 million in revenue with a 1% increase in reported growth, bearing solid mid-single digit growth in providing services and HSD growth in contract revenue.

Padraig McDonnell, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Agilent, said the company exceeded expectations for core revenue growth and earnings per second (EPS) (1). The company has been working on multiple strategies for growth, including strategic price setting, improving digital ecosystem, and identifying procurement opportunities.

“We have made meaningful improvements to our website, upgrading the user experience on our e-commerce platform by making it easier to find and purchase the products our customers need, helping topline growth. In Q1, our progress continued with digital orders growing high single digits,” McDonnell said. “Our procurement teams have challenged our historical approach and are identifying significant cost-savings opportunities in many of Agilent’s functions.”

Regionally, performance in the Americas grew 3%, Europe 2%, and Asia outside of China grew 2%, all of which were slightly ahead of expectations. While revenue in China declined 4%. Gross margin was 54.7% in the quarter, with operating margins of 25.1%. Altogether, Q1 EPS were $1.31, ahead of expectations and up 2% from Q1 2024. In addition to the discussions on their financial bearings for Q1 2025, Agilent also released documents revealing their financial information from this quarter (5).

The company will be guiding to revenue of $1.61–1.65 billion, approximately an increase of 2.5 to 5.0 percent growth on a core basis and an increase of 2.4 to 4.9% growth on a reported basis (1). Second-quarter non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) EPS are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing a growth range of 2.5–4.9% (5).

McDonnell also highlighted the company’s recognition as a member of the Global Lighthouse Networks. The World Economic Forum named the companies’ factories in Shanghai, China, and Penang, Malaysia, as part of the networks (6). This recognizes the company’s work in scaling artificial intelligence (AI), 3D printing, robotics, big-data analytics, and industrial internet of things (IIoT). According to the initial press release, Agilent remains the sole analytical and clinical laboratory technology company worldwide to be recognized by the Forum.

“In less than nine months, we’ve made incredible changes that are improving our customers’ productivity in an era when the pace of science is faster than ever… the outcome we’re enabling is faster decision-making so that we can accelerate innovation and create differentiated growth,” McDonnell said. “What we are doing at Agilent is turning a good company into a great one. We are committed to continuous improvement and adapting to changing market dynamics.”

In 2023, Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 because it was drowning in debt, facing tumultuous revenue declines, and trying to pay off multiple opioid settlements. A year later, it emerged from bankruptcy after being acquired by a new owner and becoming a private company.

Going private seems to be a trend among popular pharmaceutical retail chains.

Recently, it was revealed that Walgreens (WBA) , one of CVS's biggest rivals, has agreed to be acquired by Sycamore Partners for around $10 billion. This deal would take the pharmaceutical chain off the public market and make it private amid ongoing struggles similar to Rite Aid.

CVS falls victim to the pharmacy decline

For decades, CVS (CVS) was the go-to convenience store where customers could buy over-the-counter medicine, obtain prescriptions, purchase food staples and snacks, get cosmetics and skincare essentials, and even find last-minute gifts and souvenirs, all in one location.

However, like its rivals, CVS has also fallen victim to the trend of dwindling traditional pharmacies. It has been facing some tough times over the last few years, with front-store sales declining, shoplifting rising, and multiple opioid lawsuits.

In 2021, CVS announced it would close approximately 800 stores over the next three years, with an additional 270 locations this year due to changing consumer behaviors.

Not only have multiple closures been executed, but thousands of the drugstore chain's employees have been laid off. Last year, CVS announced plans to cut nearly 3,000 jobs to reduce costs by $2 billion and increase technology investments.

CVS announces the opening of a dozen smaller locations nationwide

After closing thousands of locations, CVS announced it will open 12 new smaller-format stores across the U.S. over the next year. These locations will focus solely on pharmaceutical products such as medicine and first aid care to better meet the community's specific needs.

This new concept will eliminate CVS's front-store business, as the company has struggled with that sector over the last few quarters.

According to CVS's full-year fiscal 2024 earnings report, comparable front-store sales decreased by 2.1% compared to the same period last year, and total front-store revenues were down by 4.2%.

The new locations will also be smaller, averaging less than 5,000 square feet, less than half the size of a regular CVS store. Smaller-format stores have become incredibly popular in retail because they provide higher profits for less investment.

The retailer has been making some significant changes recently as it desperately tries to improve sales performance.

It's cited losses for over 11 fiscal quarters in a row, with its stock value decreasing by more than 50 percent.

Newly-appointed CEO Ashley Buchanan has been making several moves to right the ship.

One of those efforts includes an amendment to Kohl's Cash and coupons, a highly popular aspect of the shopping experience that it offers.

Customers frequently use the coupons and Kohl's Cash to get deals on merchandise, but have encountered a lot of exclusions and restrictions on products to get the discounts.

The most exclusions Kohl's has ever had on coupons was the highest it's ever been last year, according to what Buchanan explained to investors in a recent earnings call.

EXCLUDE NO MORE

Buchanan promised to eliminate most of the exclusions moving forward, as it was turning away valued shoppers.

""Over the years, our list of excluded brands on our coupon has grown too large with the percent of sales that are excluded from coupons reaching an all-time high in 2024,"" he said.

""This has created confusion and frustration with our loyalist customers.""

""We are in the process of reversing some of these exclusions to simplify the experience and allow our customers to shop with our promotional coupons more consistently,"" Buchanan added.

The CEO also said there would be ""more clarity in our price and value messages,"" and that it would be amplified to ""resonate"" with customers.

""Our goal is to offer quality products at great prices across our entire portfolio, so our customers can more clearly see the value they're getting with their purchase.""

FAILED APPROACH

A shift toward Kohl's roots began in January after attempts from former CEO Tom Kingsbury over the past year didn't get the results Kohl's was looking for.

Kingsbury wanted to attract a younger consumer base with Babies R Us and Sephora locations located within stores.

Some experts like Jean-Pierre Dubé, a research associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research, noted that the ambitious goal left behind longtime Kohl's customers.

""Kingsbury disconnected from their core customer and failed to connect with the younger generation that he was presumably going after,"" Dubé told Fox affiliate WFFT recently.

Dubé added that Kohl's ""hardcore"" shoppers likely felt ""betrayed.""

EXPERT'S WARNING

Michelle Greenwald, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, also told the outlet that Kohl's would need to make attractive offers to customers in 2025 to keep them from going elsewhere.

It seems that Buchanan's strategy is in line with this.

""Once customers leave, they find other alternatives that they're happy with,"" Greenwald warned.

""It's not like they're necessarily going to come back.""

""A lot of it, they're going to just lose forever,"" she added.

Kohl's is also still closing at least 27 ""underperforming"" locations in 15 states.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/ch-kohls-policy-disruption-off-platform.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-11 14:06:32.081563

The company on Tuesday announced a cross-functional Restaurant Experience Team to move faster in bringing vision and ideas to execution. Jill McDonald, currently president of International Operated Markets, will serve as chief restaurant experience officer, effective May 1.

As part of this move, McDonald’s also set up dedicated category teams focused on beef, chicken, and beverage/desserts. Charlie Newburger, VP of marketing strategy and new business ventures, will head the beverage/desserts team. Leaders of the beef and chicken groups will be announced at a later date, the company said.

“The thinking behind this is, so many of our categories, we’re competing against specialists,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a video. “We’re competing against somebody, like a KFC, for example, who is single-mindedly devoted to winning in chicken. So this category team now allows to actually have that same level of focus on, do we have what we need, the winning strategies to win in chicken, to win in beverages, to win in beef?”

McDonald’s has spent the past several years highlighting its chicken opportunity. The brand will bring back Snack Wraps later this year and launch a new chicken strip offering. It also plans to bring back the Chicken Big Mac as an LTO. McDonald’s believes it can add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026. Globally, its signature McCrispy sandwich—a $1 billion brand—is sold in over 70 markets and will be available in nearly all markets by the end of this year. During an investor call in July 2024, Kempczinski said chicken sales were on par with beef sales. He noted the burger chain has a “significant opportunity for growth in chicken” and that its category is twice the size of beef globally and growing at a faster rate.

Additionally, McDonald’s believes in the crafted beverage craze so much that it opened the drink-forward CosMc’s to test iterations and judge customer demand. After debuting in Bolingbrook, Illinois, in December 2023, the prototype added six locations in Texas. The plan is to close three larger second-generation restaurants and open two smaller digital-focused formats in the Lone Star State later in 2025. The menu features a variety of energy drinks, refreshing, non-caffeinated beverages, signature brews, and classic brews. The food menu has two sandwiches and multiple snacking options, like hash brown bites and mini doughnuts.

The McDonald’s Restaurant Experience Team will feature voices from supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs. The chain will also use the team to serve as the coordinator for in-restaurant technologies and help GMs determine how to efficiently use them to improve unit economics.

The Restaurant Experience Team is a direct descendant of the Customer Experience Team formed in 2021, which was tasked with interconnecting marketing, menu, and digital.

“It’s just going to make us even better. It’s going to allow us to have an even bigger impact for our customers, an even bigger impact for our restaurant crew, for our franchisees,” Kempczinski said. “So I’m excited about it because it just means all the ideas and the vision that we’re coming up with, we’re going to see it in the restaurants even faster.”",https://www.qsrmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mcdonalds.jpg,N,,2025-03-12 00:04:34.810795

Kohl's Corp. sales declined 9.4% during the pivotal fourth quarter of 2024 and overall sales were down 7.2% for the year, the retailer said Tuesday.

The fourth quarter, which includes the holiday season, is a critical time for the Menomonee Falls-based company, which reported a profit of $48 million. That compares to a $186 million profit during the 2023 fourth quarter − a 74.2% decline.

In 2024, Kohl's made a profit of $109 million for 2024. That compares to $317 million in 2023 − a 65.6% decline.

For 2025, the company expects a net decrease in sales for the year between 5% to 7% compared to last year.

To save money, the Kohl's board reduced the level of dividend paid to shareholders. In previous quarters, the company regularly paid 50 cents a share to shareholders, but this quarter the company is paying 12.5 cents per share.

New Kohl's CEO Ashley Buchanan, made his first public remarks to analysts and investors. Buchanan said there's opportunity for the company to return to growth but there are some areas to improve.

""A lot of the issues really were self-inflicted over many years of decisions,” Buchanan said. “We have a very loyal customer. When I toured stores, I heard how much they love Kohl’s. And what I realized was we’re kind of making it harder for them to love us.”

Buchanan said changes will take time before the benefits could be realized.

Rough start to 2025

Kohl's started 2025 with cutting 27 stores across 15 states and then followed it up with eliminating roughly 10% of its positions at its headquarters in Menomonee Falls.

The sales decrease continues the company's slide for roughly two years.

In that time, Kohl's has made a number of moves such as adding Babies 'R' Us, expanding women's dresses, moving juniors department near the front, expand gifting, and bringing back jewelry.

And yet no formula has boosted the company's financial results.

Buchanan is the third CEO to lead the company in four years.

Before him was Tom Kingsbury, who led the company from 2023 to mid-January. Before Kingsbury was Michelle Gass, who led the company from 2018 until she left in 2022 to be CEO of Levi Strauss and Co.

“Last month, Starbucks said it would begin to ‘optimize’ menu offerings, resulting in a 30% reduction in both beverage and food items by the end of the fiscal year,” according to USA Today. “Starting March 4, a selection of ""less popular"" beverages, including several Frappuccino blended beverages, will be removed from the menu.”

Starbucks unveiled that for spring it will ""bring back the beloved Lavender beverages.""

In addition to menu and policy changes, Starbucks CEO Brian Nichol messaged employees on Monday that the company has made the ""hard decision” to eliminate 1,100 current support partner roles and several hundred additional open and unfilled positions.

The layoffs do not affect baristas or in-store teams and comes as part of a restructuring the CEO previously announced in January, according to ABC News.

""We are simplifying our structure, removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams,"" Niccol wrote, according to Axios. ""Our intent is to operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration.”

More foods and beverages are expected to be removed from the Starbucks menu in the coming months, according to The Hill.

Media Inquiries David Bishop, Partner, Brick Meets Click 847-722-2732, david.bishop@brickmeetsclick.com","Barrington, Ill. – March 11, 2025 – The U.S. Online Grocery segment jumped 31% versus last year, ending February 2025 with $10.3 billion in monthly sales, and more than 80 million households placed one or more eGrocery orders during the month, a record high, according to the Brick Meets Click Grocery Shopper Survey fielded January 30-31, 2025, and sponsored by Mercatus.

February marked the seventh straight period where monthly sales exceeded $9.5 billion and the ninth consecutive period with positive year-over-year sales growth, starting shortly after deeply discounted offers on annual membership and subscriptions began being promoted.

“We are a little more than a half year into eGrocery’s current growth curve, fueled by aggressive offers to lock in customers for at least 12 months,” said David Bishop, partner at Brick Meets Click.

“So far, the response from U.S. households reveals a sizable amount of latent demand that has been unlocked by offering discounts designed to help customers save more money on online grocery orders.”

Delivery continued to post extremely strong results for February 2025, growing more than 45% versus a year ago and registering $4.5 billion in sales. A surge in monthly active users (MAUs) was the predominant growth factor, driven mainly by the rapid expansion of users in the 60+ age group and a YOY rebound in penetration with 18 to 29-year-olds.

Strong gains in order frequency and average order values (AOVs) also contributed to this robust performance, enabling Delivery to finish the month with nearly 44% of eGrocery’s total sales.

Pickup reported very strong gains for February 2025, climbing 19% versus last year, to approximately $4.1 billion in sales. Pickup’s MAU base and order frequency rate both grew YOY, but the primary driver of sales growth was a higher AOV; however, Pickup’s AOV, MAU base, and order frequency all increased at slightly slower paces than Delivery’s.

Despite the monthly sales gain, Pickup’s share of total eGrocery sales fell 400 bps versus last year, closing February 2025 with just over 39%.

Ship-to-Home sales jumped nearly 29% versus the prior year as this method posted almost $1.8 billion in sales. Like Delivery, Ship-to-Home’s YOY gains were driven by a surge in MAUs, which may have been fueled partly by the current in-store environment where various categories are merchandised behind locked plexiglass doors to prevent theft.

While Ship-to-Home order frequency and AOV also climbed versus last year, the gains were more muted than those for Delivery. Overall, Ship-to-Home essentially maintained its 17% share position, ceding just 30 bps of share compared to a year ago.

Building on the strong results for each receiving segment, Supermarket and Mass retailers also had a positive February. Both posted year-over-year gains across the three core drivers of top-line sales: MAUs, order frequency, and AOV.

In addition, the Grocery (which includes Supermarkets and Hard Discounters) and Mass formats reported improvements in repeat intent rates related to Delivery and Pickup services with Grocery closing most of its gap with Mass.

In fact, the likelihood of reusing the same Grocery or Mass service again within the next month finished just 7% below the pre-COVID rate in February, setting a new post-COVID high that surpasses the record set in January 2025.

“Regional grocers are converting first-time shoppers into more loyal customers as evidenced by the rising repeat intent rates, but so is Walmart” said Mark Fairhurst, Chief Growth Marketing Officer, Mercatus.

“While deep discounts have driven a lot of trial, making a good first impression is essential to longer-term success. That means providing a more seamless shopping experience by pairing relevant personalized offers, order fulfilment, and sought-after loyalty rewards to encourage customers to shop online again.”

Given eGrocery’s explosive sales growth of 31% compared to overall grocery spending, which rose less than 5% versus February 2024, online’s share of total grocery spending finished at almost 18%, jumping 370 bps versus last year.

About this consumer research

The Brick Meets Click Grocery Shopping Survey is an ongoing independent research initiative created and conducted by the team at Brick Meets Click and sponsored by Mercatus.

Brick Meets Click conducted the most recent survey on February 28-29, 2025, with 1,698 adults, 18 years and older, who participated in the household’s grocery shopping, and a similar survey in February 2024 (n=1,755). Results are adjusted based on internet usage among U.S. adults to account for the non-response bias associated with online surveys. Responses are geographically representative of the U.S. and weighted by age to reflect the national population of adults, 18 years and older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The three receiving methods for online grocery orders are defined as follows:

Delivery includes orders received from a first- or third-party provider like Instacart, Shipt or the retailer’s own employees.

Pickup includes orders that are received by customers either inside or outside a store or at a designated location/locker.

Ship-to-Home includes orders that are received via common or contract carriers like FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc.

McDonald’s latest organizational change goes directly after more specialized fast-food competitors, particularly those in the chicken and beverage categories.

The fast-food giant on Tuesday announced the creation of a new Restaurant Experience Team, an evolution from the company’s customer experience team it created three years ago. The team includes people from operations, supply chain, restaurant design, franchising, delivery and technology.

But it also creates three new global teams focusing on three primary menu categories: beef, chicken and beverages and desserts.

The idea behind those teams is for the company to be more competitive with the growing number of “specialist” concepts with which McDonald’s competes. “We’re competing against somebody like a KFC, which is single-mindedly devoted to winning in chicken,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a video announcing the change. “So this category team now allows us to have that same level of focus.”

McDonald’s has long been known for its burgers, of course. But the chain is going after two key markets right now, chicken and beverages. The company is working on several chicken items, including chicken tenders and Snack Wraps. And it plans to bring back the Chicken Big Mac as a limited-time offer.

It has also pushed into beverages with its CosMc’s concept, though those menu items could potentially be folded into McDonald’s restaurants.

Both of those markets are increasingly competitive. Numerous chicken-focused brands—including what is arguably McDonald’s top competitor, Chick-fil-A—are growing rapidly and taking share in the restaurant market. Beverages, meanwhile, are also growing, thanks to the incursion of drive-thru-focused chains like Dutch Bros and 7 Brew.

That said, it’s not just specialists pushing into these areas. Taco Bell, the country’s fourth-largest chain, itself last week said it plans to push more into chicken and beverages—notably with its Live Mas Café in-restaurant beverage concept.

But Kempczinski also said that the team can help coordinate various ideas, initiatives and technologies to support restaurant general managers. “I look at this as being able to take technology now and think about how we actually use all of this to improve our unit economics,” he said.

He also said that the team is about speeding McDonald’s decision-making. Technology and innovation are being added to the chain’s restaurants every day, and the company believes the new team will be able to take this innovation to the restaurants more quickly.

“It just felt to me, we could be moving faster,” Kempczinski said. “And being able to move faster meant that we needed to be working in a more horizontal way and moving faster on the implementation.”",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-03/background/McDonald%27s%20company%201.jpg?VersionId=grO.9pELJmHwElSglfkxG5BYkegoH7dO,N,,2025-03-11 17:06:28.924321

Victory Chingluh, a subsidiary of Taiwan’s Ching Luh Group, has been downsizing since January, laying off 2000 workers at its facility in Cikupa District.

The company, which manufactures for brands such as Adidas, FootJoy, Mizuno, Nike, and Reebok, also operates factories in China and Vietnam.

According to Tangerang Regency Manpower Department official Desyanti, the company attributed the decision to “soaring operational costs and plummeting market demand”.

Nike’s evolving retail strategy may be a contributing factor. In 2023, the company announced plans to cut up to US$2 billion in costs over three years to “fuel future growth, accelerate innovation at scale, and drive long-term profitability”. Part of this strategy includes streamlining product assortment, increasing automation, and restructuring its organisation.

Meanwhile, Adis Dimension Footwear, Nike’s long-time manufacturing partner in Indonesia, laid off 1500 employees last year in cost-cutting efforts at its factory in Balaraja District.

Desyanti said that while operational expenses and weak demand drove last year’s layoffs, the company has no plans for additional cuts.

Septo Kalnadi, head of the Banten Manpower and Transmigration Agency, explained that these layoffs reflect a broader industry slowdown rather than wage concerns.

“There will be more layoffs next year,” said Kalnadi. “Every day, there was always some company asking for permission for layoffs.”

Last year, Tangerang businesses collectively laid off 12,000 workers.

The company’s CFO, Mark Kaye, outlined strategic initiatives focusing on Medicare and Medicaid performance, commercial growth, and acquisitions. While reaffirming optimistic membership growth expectations, the company also acknowledged challenges related to cost management and regulatory impacts.

Key Takeaways

Elevance anticipates high single-digit growth in individual Medicare Advantage (MA) and double-digit growth in group MA by 2025.

The acquisition of CareBridge is aimed at expanding home-based services and enhancing care for chronic members.

Medicaid strategies include securing better state rates and driving operational efficiencies through digital solutions.

The commercial sector is set for margin improvement, supported by increased membership and integrated offerings.

Potential changes in federal workforce dynamics are not expected to materially impact earnings due to the cost-plus contract structure.

Financial Results

Elevance expects over 60% of its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the first half of the year, with more than 50% in the first quarter.

Medicare margins are stable but remain below the long-term target range, with elevated costs anticipated in 2025.

Specialty pharmacy costs, notably in oncology and autoimmune categories, are expected to remain high.

Operational Updates

In Medicare, Elevance is on track with its membership targets, despite not retaining a segment of D-SNP membership due to a planned footprint change.

Medicaid efforts are focused on aligning state rates with current cost trends and improving member experiences through digital innovations.

The commercial business is seeing continued margin improvement, driven by increased membership and integrated medical and pharmacy offerings.

Future Outlook

Elevance is closely monitoring the ACA market, preparing for potential changes in subsidy structures and pricing options for 2026.

The acquisition of CareBridge is expected to significantly enhance Elevance’s capabilities in home and community-based services, particularly for high-risk members.

The company remains committed to disciplined cost management and strategic growth initiatives to deliver value to its members and shareholders.

Q&A Highlights

Mark Kaye emphasized that the outlook for Medicare Advantage membership remains consistent with previous guidance.

The company is advocating for Medicaid rates that reflect the current cost environment while enhancing operational efficiencies.

Full transcript - Barclays 27th Annual Global Healthcare Conference:

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Hi, good morning and welcome to the twenty seventh Annual Barclays Global Healthcare Conference. My name is Andrew Mok. I’m the Facilities and Managed Care Analyst here at Barclays. And I’m pleased to be joined on stage with Mark Kaye, CFO of Elevance and Nathan Rich, VP of Investor Relations. Welcome to the conference.

Let’s start with Medicare enrollment. The latest CMS data shows your total Medicare membership is tracking 35,000 or about 1.5% above the high end of your Medicare Advantage guidance, which you reiterated through an eight ks late afternoon yesterday. Can you help us square the February data with your reiterated guidance, Mark?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thank you very much for the question, Andrew. And I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you this morning and to Barclays for hosting. I look very much look forward to our conversation. Let me start by emphasizing that our outlook for 2025 Medicare Advantage membership remains unchanged from our fourth quarter earnings call. In the eight ks that we released yesterday, we reaffirmed our MA membership expectations, which includes high single digit growth in individual MA and then planned double digit growth in the group MA stemming from an expansion of existing customer relationships in 2025.

To a specific question, while the CMS February CMS enrollment files accurately reflect our membership, there are a few important factors that we want investors to consider and which inform our full year outlook. First, effective March 1, we will not retain a cohort of our D SNP membership related to a known footprint change in one of our Medicaid states. I do want to be clear that this outcome was expected and factored into our full year membership financial guidance. Also consistent with our fourth quarter earnings call messaging, we expect minimal membership growth over the balance of the year as we maintain our marketing adjustments taken during AEP to optimize our member mix and improve retention. And so taken together, the expected footprint change and lower in year growth provide confidence in our full year guide of 2,200,000 to 2,250,000 Medicare Advantage members.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Okay. So we’re 35,000 above right now. You’re saying there’s a contract change coming. So that should reduce you about 30,000 or so, and there’s no expected growth for the balance of the year.

So should we be thinking about the upper end or the high end of the range at this point?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: I think I would be comfortable just to say the range of 2.2 to 2.25. Thanks, Andrew.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. So given some of the growth in the retail membership this year, how does year one new member profitability compare to continuing membership? And what are you expecting for this year’s new member cohort specifically?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Generally, first year Medicare Advantage members tend to operate at a slightly negative margin, though this can vary by product and benefit type. And that’s why we were pleased to realize strong growth in our HMO products this year, which have more coordinated care and predictable cost patterns than PPO plans. In addition, the high levels of retention that we saw for 2025 is another important factor in our outlook, as we are better able to improve access to affordable care for members that remain with us.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. And then from a margin perspective, I think you’re expecting fairly stable margins year over year. There seems to be a few moving pieces with the pricing benefit design, membership growth, core utilization and even the STARS headwind. Can you share with us where Medicare margins landed at the end of twenty twenty four? And maybe walk us through the puts and takes to bridge to stable Medicare margins for 2025?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: I’m happy to spend some time to walk through the drivers here. So to start, our Medicare margins in 2024 were in line with our expectations. And as we’ve previously stated, we were below our long term target range. Coming into last year, we created a stable foundation through targeted geographic exits and proactive benefit design changes. And these actions, in addition to disciplined cost management, help offset some of the funding challenges, elevated cost trends, as well as pressure from the year two midnight rule.

For 2025, our guidance anticipates costs are going to remain elevated, but manageable, Strong retention, disciplined cost management and improved recognition of member acuity following elevated utilization trends in recent years support our outlook for margin stability. Additionally, as I mentioned just a moment ago, we were pleased with our composition of membership from both a product and a geographic standpoint. And finally, while it remains early in the year, we feel good about our positioning in Medicare having seen a couple of months of results.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Understood. And then maybe your comments around 2025 EPS cadence and seasonality imply a steeper ramp to 4Q MLR, which you attributed to both business mix and changes from the IRA. I think PDP and MAPD members in total maybe account for 10% to 15% of total risk membership. Can you help us better understand the expected Part D MLR cadence baked into guidance and how the proportionally small membership base is driving such a strong change in MLR seasonality?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thanks, Andrew. Let me first take a minute to address our expectations on earnings seasonality. As we stated on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect over 60% of adjusted EPS to occur in the first half of the year with more than 50% of that to be realized in the first quarter. So with that in mind, as I look at where FactSet consensus stands today, analyst EPS estimates in the first quarter look to be about $1 light compared to our expectations. And this is simply a function of seasonality.

It does not change our earnings expectations for the full year. There are several factors contributing to this more pronounced seasonality. To start, we expect the first quarter MLR to benefit from a favorable calendar with the number of workdays lower than last year. And this is the effect of pulling forward earnings into the first quarter. Second is the impact of the Part D benefit design changes related to the IRA, which will have a meaningful impact on the earnings cadence in Medicare.

And this is going to result in seasonality for Part D being more like our medical benefits business than in past year past years. And then finally, a shift in member mix, namely lower Medicaid membership, higher ACA growth, they’re going to drive more pronounced earnings seasonality again in the first quarter of this year.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: We’ve also seen a severe flu season this year. Do you have any sense of whether that would meaningfully impact 1Q MLR at this point?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes. We began the year anticipating an influenza and other influenza like illness season in line with the pre COVID trends, which is somewhat higher than what we experienced during the pandemic era. Incidence rates for these illnesses have actually been running a little bit above even those prudent expectations, which has generated a modest increase in costs so far. Importantly, the acuity of the activity we’ve seen has been consistent with our expectations. And so while there’s still a couple of weeks left in the quarter, there’s always the possibility for a late season respiratory virus activity.

We believe our pricing continues to provide adequate prudence to address the elevated costs we’ve seen so far, and that allows us to be comfortable with the guidance that we’ve given so far.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. So taken all in, reiterating guidance, Q1 EPS consensus is about a dollar light and that reflects the impact of flu as well. Perfect. Understood. So shifting to Medicaid, can you share how composite Medicaid rates developed for oneone renewals and comment maybe how they’re tracking for the upcoming renewal cycle around fourone and sevenone?

Yes, of course. So, January,

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: expectations and reflect early progress towards bringing rates back to a level that will prospectively cover cost trend. We also have early insight into April rates, which is similarly in line with our expectations, though April is a smaller cohort for us. On July renewals, which cover about a third of our membership base, it’s still purely to comment. We’ll get a better picture in the coming months as draft rates are shared. And overall, I would say that the rates we secured thus far have been broadly consistent with our initial expectations, though there is still important work ahead.

We remain in constructive ongoing discussions with our state partners to further align prospective rates with elevated cost trends as we continue to that we continue to observe in our Medicaid portfolio.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. And it feels like most of the margin recovery in Medicaid does come from better state rates, which is somewhat passive. Can you help us understand maybe some of the actionable items you can take to items that are in your control to drive better cost outcomes and management?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: We are certainly advocating for rates that fully reflect today’s cost environment, while also driving operational efficiencies that deliver better health outcomes for our members and more value for our state partners. We feel well positioned to consistently rank in the top tier of cost management and quality performance within the markets that we serve. One of the ways that we’re actually innovating in this area is through the rollout of the digital solutions that enhance the member experience and improve outcomes. And just to give you one example here, today we’re using technology to identify members with care gaps and chronic risk factors. Our care management teams then perform proactive outreach to provide early intervention and to guide the member in accessing the care they need.

And in addition, our targeted digital interactions actually helped save members over one point five million hours in 2024 through higher quality provider search functionality and a streamlined call center experience.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. Let’s move on to commercial. Several of your peers in the stop loss business called out pressure throughout the back half of the year and even more so in the fourth quarter, but stop loss didn’t seem to be a source of fourth quarter pressure for Elevance. Can you take a step back and give us some more color around what you saw with respect to commercial and stop loss trends and your experience there and why you might have had some differentiated trends?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thanks for the question. Your observation is spot on. We did not experience the same stop loss pressure seen by others in the fourth quarter and we’re pleased with our overall stop loss performance in 2024. There are several key differences worth noting. First, we primarily sell a bundled stop loss coverage as an ancillary product for self insured groups seeking additional protection against overall claim costs.

Second, only a very small portion of our portfolio is dedicated to specific claims liability coverage for fully insured clients, and that’s an area that others have highlighted as a source of pressure. And then finally, it’s worth just keeping in mind that our total stop loss portfolio is relatively small percentage of our total premiums. And so I’ll simply close by saying, taken a thoughtful and strategic approach to our stop loss business. We have a leadership team with a deep expertise and experience in this area and it’s something we feel quite comfortable with.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. And then pricing aside, specialty pharmacy has been an area of accelerating trend across the broader healthcare industry. What are you seeing with respect to this trend and which book of business

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: And these trends are most And these trends are most pronounced in categories like oncology, autoimmune, dermatologic, placing really upward pressure on overall costs. If I look forward to 2025, we’ve modeled specialty pharmacy or specialty trends to remain elevated. And in particular, we’ve been prudent in assessing how Part D benefit design changes might incentivize different member and provider behavior. And for example, lower cost sharing could drive higher utilization. We’ve also been monitoring the pipeline of new products and expanded indications.

And importantly, we’ve baked these dynamics into our pricing and guidance for 2025. When it comes to approaching specialty pharmacy pricing, we focus on the whole person care rather than just merely unit cost. And through our CalonRx asset, we integrate medical and pharmacy data and utilize predictive analytics to enable more comprehensive management of by expanding value based arrangements, improving care coordination among providers, we aim to deliver total or aim to deliver the lowest net total cost, while still ensuring sort of timely high quality care for our members. And really all of that helps us address today’s cost pressures without losing sight of the clinical outcomes that our members need.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Right. And just given the number of specialty drugs that have increased and the label expansions that we’ve seen, is it more difficult to kind of predict the utilization today than maybe it was five years ago?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: I think I would say we’re managing specialty trend pressure through disciplined pricing and analytics approach. What also helps us here is the integrated pharmacy management, the active support of or active development of new and innovative solutions. And that really allows us to remain confident in the way that we price some of those new solutions and products that come to market.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. And then taking a step back, you’ve done a nice job improving commercial margins over the last few years. What’s the trajectory of commercial margins from here? And where do you see the opportunities to expand margins further?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes, we’re very pleased with the trajectory of our commercial margin recovery over the last two years. Looking ahead to 2025, we do expect to realize continued improvement, albeit at a more modest pace compared to 2023 and 2024 as repricing initiatives we have executed are materially complete. Long term, we expect earnings growth from our commercial business to be driven by increased membership bolstered by the geographic expansion of our individual ACA products and improved group retention. We also expect earnings growth to come from increased penetration of our integrated medical and pharmacy offering and our innovative affordability and digital solutions such as our suite of patient advocacy products. And finally, I’d say, we remain committed to a prudent approach to pricing that delivers consistent performance and supports membership growth that’s all embedded in our long term earnings growth algorithm.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. And there’s been a lot of headlines around DOGE’s efforts to reduce the federal workforce. You have a large federal employee benefits program that represents about 1,600,000 members or $15,000,000,000 in revenue. How are you thinking about the potential changes to that business? And is there anything explicitly considered for 2025?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: That’s a great question. At this stage, any outcome from Doge’s efforts to reduce the federal workforce remain highly uncertain, just given the various legal and regulatory hurdles that are still unfolding. In our latest outlook, we factored in a slight dip in federal employee program membership, but we don’t foresee a material earnings impact since our contract with the federal government is structured on a cost plus basis. Additionally, the geographies where we offer coverage to federal employees significantly overlap with our other lines of business. So we are well positioned to provide affordable coverage to members affected by these potential changes.

And then last comment I’d maybe make here, Andrew, it’s important to note that we serve both active employees and retirees within our federal employee business and would not expect the retiree population to be impacted by these actions.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. You’re also seeing solid growth in the individual ACA market this year despite some new program integrity measures. Can you share what your experience has been so far with respect to February effectuated enrollment, how that came in and how you expect intra year attrition to play out? Yes.

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: And then of course, let me start by saying that we’ve been really pleased with our growth in the individual ACA market over the past several years. We’re encouraged by the results of the open enrollment period for 2025. But to your question, through February member effectuation rates, which represent the proportion of members who have paid their premium have tracked a little bit lighter than we initially expected. And this is likely reflective of the higher percentage of passive renewals this year, as we have seen members, especially those who have enrolled with us during or following redetermination from Medicaid, reevaluate their coverage during this grace period. This dynamic impacts a small portion of our membership base.

We’ve adjusted our membership outlook appropriately and that is reflected in the eight ks last night. So I would say overall, we still feel pretty good about this underlying business. We have appropriately balanced the growth in this market with prudent pricing expectations for 2025.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: When you say a little bit lighter, is that a reflection of just kind of the member premiums paid or do you think that’s more driven by some of the newer measures around failure to reconcile, things of that nature that are driving effectuated enrollment lower?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: There are likely several interacting and complicating attributes that drive this. The net result of that is that we’re seeing slightly lighter effectuation rates than what we expected. We definitely attribute this to those members who have enrolled with us following the redetermination from Medicaid and there are obviously several factors driving that.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Do you have full visibility into the failure to reconcile at this point?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: We have enough visibility for us internally to look through some dynamics. That would be a great Q1 earnings call question.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Understood. Sticking with the ACA, we’d love to hear how you’re thinking about the potential membership attrition and the impact to the risk pool if Congress allows enhanced subsidies to expire at the end of the year?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes. We continue to closely monitor developments in Washington and we remain fully committed to the ACA marketplace. It’s not only an attractive and complementary business for us, but also represents significant long term growth opportunities. This is a particularly relevant as we expand our WellPoint branded plans beyond our 14 blue states. And that’s a key step towards fulfilling our member commitment or our commitment to being a lifetime trusted health partner at every stage of our member’s journey.

With that in mind, the availability of enhanced subsidies has driven increased enrollment over the past few years and extension of those enhanced subsidies would limit potential disruption to individuals and families seeking a continuation of affordable healthcare coverage. Congressional members on both sides of the aisle have expressed support for extending the ACA subsidies and policymakers have a range of options, including full extension, partial or modified extension or even phasing out of the enhanced subsidies. Regarding the risk pool, if the enhanced subsidies do expire, we would expect a reduction in enrollment that would naturally shift the pool’s overall risk profile. And we’ll account for that in our 2026 pricing, drawing upon our broad ACA pricing experience. And then last comment I’ll make here, the ACA risk adjustment program also does provide meaningful stability by transferring funds to carriers and managing higher risk populations.

And so this should help mitigate some of the hypothetical disruption that could occur from any changes in the market.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Are you preparing two sets of pricing at this point, one with the subsidies, one without the subsidies?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: We are definitely thinking through several pricing options, which I imagine will include more than one submission.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Got it. Maybe let’s move on to Carillon. You recently closed on the acquisition of CareBridge late last year, which represents a significant expansion into the home. Can you walk us through the strategic rationale for this deal and any expected contributions to earnings over the next few years?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Yes, absolutely. So in the fourth quarter, we successfully closed on the acquisition of CareBridge. And for those who don’t know, CareBridge is a rapidly growing value based care company that specializes in managing a home and community based services, HCBS, for both the Medicaid and dual eligible population. Key Bridge’s innovative model aligns to Keylon’s whole health approach, which strengthens our ability to serve chronic and complex members, and that’s going to help us further scale our home business within Keylon. Specifically, we see CareBridge serving a scalable or serving as a scalable platform to broaden our home based rich and this includes extending services beyond the HCBS population to high risk Medicaid and dual eligible members, while also expanding into geographies to better support Elavant Health home and community based beneficiaries.

So in short, you can think about the acquisition of Cambridge as enabling us to expand post acute care delivered in the home, build at home elements into specialty care management products already offered by Keyalon services like oncology and then drive improved health plan performance through enhanced member outcomes and reduce costs for LTSS and the D SIP members. So, summarize, we view the acquisition as being strongly aligned with our strategic objectives. It opens up significant white space for growth through the introduction of new capabilities and expansion into key Medicaid and dual eligible markets.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Would you like to get even bigger in the home? And is there a strategic preference for Medicaid first or Medicare first home providers?

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Being in the home is one of the four key pillars that we think of within that Keyalon services being among sort of advanced primary care, specialty care, behavioral health and then the home based care is an important avenue for us for continued growth and it integrates very well, allowing us to scale some of the services that we already offer. So clearly a very important acquisition for us.

Andrew Mok, Facilities and Managed Care Analyst, Barclays: Great. Well, we’re just about up on time here. So thank you so much, Mark, for the fireside today and enjoy the rest of the conference.

Mark Kaye, CFO, Elevance: Thank you very much, Andrew.

Since 2020, more than 18,000 fashion stores have closed in Spain, a trend that reflects the shift of consumers toward digital commerce.","The fashion industry has experienced times of constant change in recent decades. Brands that once dominated the market now face new challenges due to shifts in consumer preferences. This time, it's H&M that has made a drastic shift in its strategy, and its situation in Spain reflects the difficulties of the textile sector.

The fast fashion sector is witnessing significant transformations. H&M, one of the major competitors of Inditex, has begun to close stores massively in our country, a decision that surprises many. This measure is part of a series of adjustments following a drop in its financial results, marking the beginning of a new era for the brand in Spain.

Came to Dethrone Zara and Is Now Closing Its Stores

H&M had established itself as a rival to Inditex, but the latest financial data from the Swedish firm make it clear that the situation has changed. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a significant loss of about 258 million euros, which represented a 30% drop in its profits. This plunge in earnings forced H&M to review its market strategies and close several of its stores.

In Spain, the impact has been considerable, as it accounts for 17% of the brand's global closures, highlighting the magnitude of the crisis. Cities like Elche, Orihuela, and Torrevieja have witnessed the closure of stores that, in many cases, affected dozens of employees. These closures are not new for the brand, as in 2021 it was also forced to close major establishments in Madrid, such as those on Gran Vía and Conde Peñalver.

Factors That Have Led to H&M's Decline

The crisis it faces is due to a combination of factors that have affected the entire industry; the change in consumption habits is one of the main issues. The pandemic accelerated the shift to e-commerce, a transition that many brands, including H&M, did not manage with the same agility as their competitors.

Additionally, the increase in production costs and inflation have severely hit the brand's finances. This has combined with competition from new players like Shein and Temu, which have challenged traditional brands with extremely low prices and online business models.

Although H&M has attempted to improve its offerings through new technologies, such as smart fitting rooms and self-checkout kiosks, the competition in the sector is fierce. E-commerce and second-hand fashion continue to gain ground, forcing major brands to rethink their business model.

The closure of H&M stores is not an isolated case but part of a broader landscape. Since 2020, more than 18,000 fashion stores have closed in Spain, a trend that reflects the shift of consumers toward digital commerce. Although spending on fashion increased by 4.89% in 2023, the rise of online shopping and the increase in sustainable alternatives have made physical stores lose relevance.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-stradivarius-zara-cierre-tiendas_1200_800.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 13:07:29.115165

The company, known for its colourful plastic building bricks, said it is increasing investment in online play including building its own development team. It has tripled its number of software engineers since 2022 and launched a successful tie-up with the online game Fortnite.

Niels Christiansen, the chief executive of the Danish toymaker, said the group was trying to create more “hybrid” digital and physical experiences as nine- to 12-year-olds were spending more time online.

“They tend to grow up a bit earlier and orient themselves towards social media,” he said.

Christiansen said the trend was also behind Lego’s tie-ups last year with the sports-related brands Formula One and Nike, which are expected to release the first products this year and hinted there would be more similar tie-ups on the way. “It is so important for us that we are present with exciting experiences and exactly this type of topics and passion points,” he said.

“We are seeing a shift and are trying to be right on it and even leading that shift so we stay super relevant.”

Christiansen said the new investment in digital was a “multi-year journey” and he could not give details of the games now in development. The company has already launched some Lego-branded games using external partners as well as the recent tie-up with Fortnite.

Lego said sales rose by 13% to 74.3bn Danish kroner (£8.4bn), even as the wider toy market slid back by 1%. The group’s Technic and City sets, as well as Harry Potter- and Star Wars-themed games, sold well. Operating profits rose by 10% to 18.7bn kroner despite increased investment in new factories, including in the US and Vietnam.

Christiansen said there were no plans to bring forward the opening of a new factory in Virginia despite the threat of US tariffs on goods being imported from Mexico, where the majority of Lego’s kits for North America are made.

He said the company had experienced “a lot of volatility” in recent years including the effects of the pandemic and increased energy costs. It was unclear if US import tariffs would turn out to be long term or temporary measures so the company’s tactic was “don’t panic”, he added.

“I don’t lie awake at night because of tariffs for Mexico. I would lie awake if I didn’t feel we are sustaining relevance of the product and brand,” he said.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db2bc299da8ed99aada8c2eb2d34b77b750912d7/244_0_3596_2160/master/3596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=343b903874c9f063a7751579a5b9a699,N,,2025-03-11 10:04:49.320652

In a statement, AMSA expressed its disappointment at the outcome, stating that despite engaging with stakeholders and government bodies, no viable options were found to avoid the wind-down. “Regrettably, despite our best efforts, the parties involved have not been able to find timely solutions required to defer the wind down of the longs business,” read the statement.

The closure of the plant is expected to have a significant impact on the local community, with many businesses relying on the plant for steel supplies. AMSA’s chief executive officer, Kobus Verster, highlighted the concerns that led to the decision, including the scrap Price Preference System and export tax on scrap, port and rail efficiency, the lapsing of provisional safeguards on Hot Rolled Coil, their application for a negotiated pricing agreement with Eskom not being supported, and a looming electricity tariff hike set to go into effect on 1 April.

Verster said the Vereeniging and Newcastle mills, which indirectly support more than 100,000 jobs, supply between 350,000 tons and 400,000 tons of steel products that can’t currently be manufactured by any other companies in South Africa.

Verster expressed his disappointment at the outcome, stating that the decision would have a significant negative impact on the economy, jobs, and the local community. “AMSA is deeply disappointed that our efforts over the last year have not translated into a sustainable solution, resulting in a significant negative impact on the economy, the loss of approximately 3,500 direct and indirect jobs, and a detrimental impact on the local community in Newcastle.”

Pietermaritzburg and Midlans Chamber of Business CEO Melanie Veness echoed these sentiments, stating that the closure would have a huge negative impact on workers and communities. “This is big, from a job perspective but also a sustainability of companies point of view.”

With more than 2,000 of the expected job cuts coming from Newcastle alone, many in the community are concerned about the future. Newcastle businessman Marius Pretorius said there is uncertainty about where to go from here. “Nobody can tell us when, what, and how,” he said.",https://tabloidmedia.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AMSA-officially-announce-winding-down-of-business-in-Newcastle-1A-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 09:05:51.017064

We’re going to need all forms of generation- renewables, gas, and nuclear.” NextEra, which dabbles in everything from transmission to upstream oil and gas pipelines, contracted about 12 gigawatts (GW) of renewables last year.
The uniquely diverse energy conglomerate also operates the largest gas-fired generation facility in the United States and is the seventh-largest nuclear operator in the world.
Over the last five years, the United States has installed about 175 GW of renewables, 13 GW of gas, and 3 GW of nuclear, Ketchum shared.
NextEra’s CEO expects the United States’ first new reactor will fire up sometime in 2031 or 2032, and the first small modular designs to appear in 2035 or later.","(Houston, TX) – Driven by data center development and mass electrification across industries, the current pace of electric demand growth in the United States is unlike anything NextEra Energy president and chief executive officer John Ketchum has ever seen.

“We’re expecting a six-fold increase in power demand over the next 20 years compared to what we saw over the prior 20,” he revealed to a packed room of energy and finance experts at CERAWeek by S&P Global in Houston, Texas, Monday morning.

To meet that demand, Ketchum insists renewable generation needs to be part of the equation, contrasting significantly from sentiments U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright expressed earlier in the day.

“We firmly believe in order to do it, we’re going to have to be able to come up with all-of-the-above energy solutions,” Ketchum quipped. “There’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. We’re going to need all forms of generation- renewables, gas, and nuclear.”

NextEra, which dabbles in everything from transmission to upstream oil and gas pipelines, contracted about 12 gigawatts (GW) of renewables last year. The uniquely diverse energy conglomerate also operates the largest gas-fired generation facility in the United States and is the seventh-largest nuclear operator in the world.

“We get to see it all, and we understand how important this is to our customers,” Ketchum offered.

“The demand is here right now,” he added. “We have to have the generation available to meet that demand. Otherwise, we’re going to have a huge power affordability crisis in this country, with utility bills going through the roof.”

Skyrocketing bills, Ketchum worries, might trigger utility commissions to intervene and demand specific types and timing of generation. That scenario wouldn’t be much fun for anyone, inspiring nearly two dozen Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives to send a letter today asking the Senate not to interfere with the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA’s) clean energy tax credits and threatening to oppose the current budget bill if their request is not met. Its authors and NextEra’s CEO agree that the tax credits and transferability provisions are essential to managing new electric load cost-effectively.

Ketchum, who also serves as chairman of NextEra Energy’s subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, told CERAWeek attendees that he sees an incredible growth opportunity to put America first under the Trump administration. His company’s capital investment plans speak to that sentiment, exceeding $120 billion over the next four years, easily making NextEra one of the top infrastructure investors in the United States.

“We are fully behind with this administration,” Ketchum confirmed. “We just need to make sure we (meet demand growth) in a smart way that keeps the bill low, because if we have affordability issues, it’s going to be really tough to meet all that demand that we see coming.”

Timing is Everything

Keeping electricity prices manageable will depend on the strategic deployment of new generation sources to meet demand. Over the last five years, the United States has installed about 175 GW of renewables, 13 GW of gas, and 3 GW of nuclear, Ketchum shared. NextEra is happy to build any and everything, but the company’s CEO notes there’s a timing difference concerning when varying generation solutions can be brought to market and associated cost discrepancies.

He would know, as no entity has built more gas-fired generation in the U.S. over the last two decades than NextEra has. The company’s last completed facility, a commercial plant in Fort Lauderdale, was brought online in 2022 at the cost of $785 per kilowatt (kW).

“If we wanted to build that same gas-fired combined cycle unit today? $2400 per kW,” estimated Ketchum at CERAWeek. He assessed the cost of gas fire generation to have more than tripled over the last few years, crediting supply constraints (amidst increased demand) and significant qualified labor shortages.

“To get your hands on a gas turbine and to actually get it built across the market, you’re really looking at 2030, or later,” Ketchum confessed.

Plus, lots of the trained workforce that knew how to build gas-fired facilities is gone, having either retired or moved onto other things. Ketchum notes the limited labor available is spread thin, too, building out data centers, constructing LNG terminals, tinkering at chemical companies, and more.

“We have a real shortage of labor supply in this country,” Ketchum reiterated.

The bridge to new nuclear looks to be even longer than the wait time for a gas turbine. NextEra’s CEO expects the United States’ first new reactor will fire up sometime in 2031 or 2032, and the first small modular designs to appear in 2035 or later.

That leaves wind, solar, and batteries, renewable energy workhorses whose contributions have been explicitly minimized by the current administration, including by former fossil fuel executive Wright.

“Renewables are ready to go right now because they’ve been up and running,” Ketchum told the room.

“Don’t get my comments wrong,” he implored. “We are going to need it all.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gerke-Workspace-2040-x-1360-px-15-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 13:07:34.424134

The jobs have been cut gradually since 2023, when the company had a workforce of 11,000 in the Netherlands, the paper said.
“We have not seen any investment in the Netherlands, only cuts and the disposal of units,” said spokesman Patrick Meerts.
Philips’ 2024 annual report shows that the workforce in the Netherlands has gone down by 2,336 over the past two years.
Philips had a workforce of 220,000 25 years ago, of whom 40,000 were in the Netherlands.","An ongoing reorganisation at medical technology company Philips has led to the loss of 2,600 jobs in the Netherlands, 700 more than expected, the Financieele Dagblad reported on Tuesday. The unions expect even more jobs to go, given the reorganisation is set to continue until the end of this year.

The jobs have been cut gradually since 2023, when the company had a workforce of 11,000 in the Netherlands, the paper said. Philips had previously stated it would reduce its Dutch workforce by 1,900.

Unions say they fear further job losses, particularly given that the company announced last month it aims to cut spending by a further $500 million. The company has now posted a loss for three consecutive years.

The FNV trade union said it fears the company is in the process of withdrawing from the Netherlands altogether. “We have not seen any investment in the Netherlands, only cuts and the disposal of units,” said spokesman Patrick Meerts. “We are concerned.”

Philips said in a reaction that the Netherlands will remain the company’s “beating heart”. However, it said, the relatively large number of job losses in the Netherlands is due to a new, more decentralised way of working.

“We are giving more responsibility to the business units,” the spokesman said. Most business units, the FD reported, are based abroad.

Philips’ 2024 annual report shows that the workforce in the Netherlands has gone down by 2,336 over the past two years. That total includes some 400 jobs in Drachten after the company shifted some production to Indonesia and China. Other jobs have been cut at its central research lab, formally Natlab.

A further 250 jobs have gone already this year, following cuts at two separate units and the sale of a small subsidiary, the FD said.

The Spring-based tech giant will reduce its workforce by roughly 5 percent by a combination of layoffs and normal turnover over the next 18 months.

The workforce reduction program, approved by HPE’s board on Thursday according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, aims to address operational challenges and inventory issues that have affected the company’s performance.

“We could have executed better,” admitted CEO Antonio Neri during the conference call with analysts. Neri specifically highlighted problems within HPE’s server unit, pointing to a rapid shift in market demand toward the newest graphics processing units (GPUs), which has left the company burdened with excessive inventory of older models.

HPE Announces Global Layoffs, Impacting Houston Workforce

The layoffs will impact HPE’s global workforce of more than 60,000 employees, though it is unclear how many of them will be lost in the Houston region, where the company has approximately 2,000 employees.

HPE has offices in both Spring, where it has its headquarters at the City Place campus and Houston, based on its 2024 annual report.

HPE moved its corporate offices from San Jose, California, to Spring in 2020, opening up a huge footprint in the city. The reorganization is one of dramatic transformation for one of the largest employers in the area.

The company estimates to achieve approximately $350 million in cost savings in the reductions and similar savings in the future to the end of fiscal year 2027. The reduction plan will be phased in and will be fully effective by the fiscal year 2026.

Chief Financial Officer Marie Myers, during the earnings call, indicated that she has some apprehensions about additional threats to the company, namely mentioning the potential of new tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports in the next year.

The cuts are set to take place at a time when Neri is one of Houston’s better-compensated executives. His 2023 total compensation package was more than $20 million, ranking him ninth among regional executives, the Houston Chronicle reported.

HPE Restructures, Cuts Jobs

HPE also became an independent company in 2015 when the former Hewlett-Packard was divided into two. Although the personal computer and printer business was acquired by HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise concentrated on enterprise technology solutions and products like servers, data storage infrastructure, networking equipment, IT infrastructure management software, and consulting.

The restructuring is a continued reorganization within the tech sector as businesses cope with shifting market conditions, supply chain challenges, and economic headwinds.

For HPE, the layoffs are an attempt to rationalize operations and boost profitability amidst these sector-wide challenges.

Local business leaders are monitoring for possible impacts on the Spring and Houston economies because HPE has become a significant corporate presence after relocating its headquarters to Texas.

There has been no statement from community leaders regarding the announcement or potential relief for impacted employees.

CVS faces less competition — for now — with the pharmacy side of its business. Without a convenience store attached, CVS can cut back on many of its workers who would otherwise be stocking shelves or watching for shoplifters, a problem that’s also driven the company to abandon its food aisles.

The smaller-format stores are reportedly ""designed to meet the community's specific pharmacy needs,"" a CVS spokesperson told CNN.

“By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we’re continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patients and ensure the right geographic coverage,” they said.

Nell Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, told CNN that the move would make it cheaper for CVS to operate its stores, but cautioned that online prescription fillers were becoming more popular and that CVS will soon have more competitors nipping at its customer base.

The move likely won't be popular with consumers. A 2023 Acosta Group study found that U.S. consumers use the convenience stores attached to drugstores to shop for everyday items as much as they use the pharmacy services.

It also found that consumers typically prefer a quick run to a drugstore when they need to grab an item. A reported 64 percent of respondents said they preferred shopping for their pharmacy and medical needs at a drugstore over going to a mass retailer, a grocery store, or using an online service. Nearly 60 percent said drugstores, of the four, provided the easiest and most convenient shopping experience.",https://static.the-independent.com/2024/02/05/21/Puerto_Rico-CVS_Sale_90929.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-03-11 06:04:28.623744

Martha Stewart and other celebs star in JC Penney's recent ads.

One of America’s oldest retailers is heading into another new chapter, with JC Penney merging with SPARC Group, a company known for scooping up struggling retail brands. The new portfolio is coming together in Catalyst Brands, a $9 billion organization, with Marc Rosen, head of JC Penney, stepping in as CEO.

Marisa Thalberg, who had been CMO at Penney on a consulting basis, has been named chief customer and marketing officer of Catalyst Brands.

Michelle Wlazlo, formerly JCPenney's chief merchandising and supply chain officer, has been promoted to brand CEO of JCPenney.

Founded in 1902, Penney has been struggling for years and filed for bankruptcy in 2020, an early casualty of COVID-19. It emerged from bankruptcy with the help of Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management — the nation's largest mall owners — buying the ailing retailer for $1.75 billion.

The combined Catalyst Brands organization is a joint venture formed in an all-equity transaction between JCPenney and SPARC Group, with shareholders that include Simon Property Group, Brookfield Corporation, Authentic Brands Group and Shein.

The deal involves additional moving pieces: Catalyst Brands has sold the U.S. operations of Reebok and is exploring a sale for Forever 21.

Before joining JC Penney in 2021, Rosen had been president of Levi Strauss Americas and had key roles at Walmart.

Wlazlo will report to Rosen, as will Natalie Levy, brand CEO of Aéropostale, Lucky Brand and Nautica. Ken Ohashi continues leading Brooks Brothers and adds responsibility for Eddie Bauer.

“The word ‘catalyst’ reflects our drive to accelerate innovation and energy and amplify the impact of this powerhouse portfolio,” Rosen says in the announcement. “Together, we bring scale, expertise and broad appeal to customers across America.”

While Penney’s has made plenty of progress in its recent comeback, department stores continue to lose share, as consumers prefer online and specialty options. In recent years, Kohl’s, JC Penney’s closest rival, has also seen sales wither.

Placer.ai, which tracks store traffic, says that visits to JC Penney have been improving overall. Visits during the fourth quarter fell 3%, a marked improvement from the first quarter decline of 9.2%.

The outlook comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has repeatedly exhorted the industry to ""Drill, baby, drill,"" to maximize oil and gas production and reduce consumer energy costs.
Still, oil prices have fallen this year and many producers remain focused on capital discipline over uninhibited drilling.
""There's a dislocation between the rig count and production, just driven by the efficiencies of more modern rigs, as well as then the production efficiencies,"" he said.

Still, oil prices have fallen this year and many producers remain focused on capital discipline over uninhibited drilling.

Capital spending by oil and gas companies will be limited by the wave of consolidation that swept the industry in recent years, Simonelli said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek conference by S&P Global in Houston.

""There's a dislocation between the rig count and production, just driven by the efficiencies of more modern rigs, as well as then the production efficiencies,"" he said.

U.S. crude oil futures have eased to less than $67 a barrel in recent weeks, raising fears that the producers might pull back on drilling. Some companies, including Chevron and rival SLB, have announced plans to restructure and lay off staff.

Baker Hughes does not expect to restructure or reduce its workforce currently, Simonelli said.

Large producers have not yet indicated any changes to their capital spending plans despite easing oil prices, Simonelli said. Smaller producers will react quicker to price inflections, he added.

The estimated loss from the wildfires in January, which killed more than two dozen people and destroyed or damaged more than 16,000 structures, follows an announcement by Germany's Munich Re that it faced about 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in claims from the fires.

Hannover Re, another German reinsurer, forecast claims of 700 million euros while French insurer AXA estimated a pre-tax impact of about 100 million euros.

""We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to those affected by the California fires earlier this year. Although we are still assessing the full impact, we do not expect this to be a capital event,"" Burkhard Keese, Lloyd's chief financial officer, said in a statement.

Lloyd's said the estimated losses were not included in its results for 2024, which it released on Monday in a set of preliminary numbers before its final full-year results are published on March 20.

Keese described 2024 as an ""excellent underwriting year"" for Lloyd's as gross written premiums rose 6.5% on a year-on-year basis to 55.5 billion pounds, thanks primarily to growth in its property and reinsurance divisions.

However, underwriting profit dropped to 5.3 billion pounds, 10% lower than the 5.9 billion pounds it reported for 2023.

Lloyd's said its combined ratio rose to 86.9%, up from 84% in the previous year. The combined ratio is an industry measure, with a reading below 100% meaning earnings from premiums are higher than the amount paid out in claims.

Lloyd's is a commercial insurance and reinsurance market, with more than 50 member companies.

Speetzen's compensation was a little more than Polaris (NYSE: PII) paid him the previous year, according to a filing from Friday. The top executive of the Medina-based maker of snowmobiles and ATVs received most of his pay package in the form of stock and option awards, the filing said. Speetzen's base salary of $1.2 million in 2024 was about the same as it was the year before.

The annual total compensation for a median Polaris employee in 2024 was a little less than $46,000, up from $43,000 the year before. That translates to a CEO-to-employee pay ratio of about 197:1. Polaris said it employed more than 16,000 people on a full-time, part-time or temporary basis in its filing.

2024 was a bumpy year for Polaris. Sales shrank in all three of the company's chief segments (on-road, off-road and marine) as the manufacturer slashed production output to avoid leaving dealers with unwanted inventory. Sales overall fell 20% to $7.17 billion in 2024.

High interest rates, inflation and lower demand from from dealers and consumers contributed to a slower 2024 than originally expected.

“2024 presented significant challenges across the powersports industry, leading to a prolonged down cycle,” Speetzen told analysts on Polaris' earnings call in January

Polaris is expecting sales to decline another 1% to 4% in 2025, which would put full-year revenue between $6.89 billion and $7.1 billion.

Proposed tariffs have caused another question for Polaris. The company announced earlier this month that it may implement a surcharge on some goods sold in the U.S. if the Trump administration's announce tariffs on Mexican imports continue. Two days after the tariffs initially went into effect, President Donald Trump delayed them for a month, but it's not clear whether the White House will make further changes.

In recent years, several fast-fashion companies have popped up in order to give H&M and Zara a run for their money.
Although fast fashion has been around for decades, we have now begun to see the harmful effects that it has on our planet.","There is certainly nothing wrong with wanting to stay up to date with current fashion trends and the latest styles. However, there is an environmental issue when they rely on the practice of fast fashion.

What's happening?

For clothing companies such as H&M, fast fashion isn't anything new. The desire to constantly evolve and develop rapidly changing clothing collections has been around since the 1980s. Spanish company Zara was among the original pioneers of the fast-fashion movement, paving the way for many other companies to follow suit.

As a direct competitor of Zara, H&M has strived for years to become the leader of the fast-fashion industry. In a recent interview with Reuters, H&M CEO Daniel Erver unveiled the company's bold new strategy in order to compete with Zara and its parent company, Inditex.

""Just competing on lowest price will not cut it for us; we need to step up and raise the bar,"" Erver said, noting a need to produce higher quality clothes that are trendy more quickly. In recent years, several fast-fashion companies have popped up in order to give H&M and Zara a run for their money. In many cases, these companies are able to sell merchandise at a more drastic discount.

However, while the company outlined plans to expand and make clothes ""more trendy"" while speeding up the production process, H&M did not reveal the logistics behind the amount of resources and labor that would be required to make that happen.

Why is the rise of fast fashion important?

Although fast fashion has been around for decades, we have now begun to see the harmful effects that it has on our planet. The UN Environment Programme estimates that fashion production contributes to up to 8% of all pollution on this planet.

Additionally, textile waste is another impactful consequence of the fast-fashion movement. With the fast-moving nature of fast fashion, massive quantities of unsold and out-of-date clothing are often found in our landfills. As a core principle of fast fashion, having the ability to discard an article of clothing when a new style or collection comes out contributes to excessive waste.

As more companies adjust their focus on the fast-fashion industry, the high rate of pollution and textile waste may continue to climb in the next few years. Polluting gases being released from human activity have directly influenced the increasing global temperature.

What's being done about the increasing popularity of fast fashion?

There are plenty of easy-to-do options that you can choose in order to minimize the impact of the fast-fashion industry. Here is a guide to help spot greenwashing and learn of companies that practice ethical business practices. It's also important to support brands and companies that produce eco-friendly products and invest in high-quality clothing over fast fashion, which will ultimately save you money in the long run.

You can also skip the fast-fashion trend and turn to shopping at thrift shops for your next wardrobe change. Not only can you help cut down on textile waste, but you can save some cash as well.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fast-fashionimage-recEb8vCFBQXLiHuj-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-11 01:07:35.587956

In other recent news, Elevance Health reported fourth-quarter results for fiscal year 2024 that aligned with consensus expectations, posting adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.84 and revenues of $45.0 billion. Bernstein analysts responded by raising Elevance’s stock price target to $511, citing a stable outlook and maintaining an Outperform rating. Meanwhile, JPMorgan adjusted its financial outlook for Elevance, lowering the price target to $479 due to a mixed view of the company’s future performance, although it still maintains an Overweight rating. The firm’s analysis pointed to challenges in Elevance’s Medicaid segment but noted potential improvements in margins from state rate updates.

Additionally, Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed an Overweight rating with a price target of $485, highlighting Elevance’s exposure to Medicaid policies and its significant revenue from Medicaid expansion lives. The firm noted that changes in Medicaid funding could impact Elevance’s financial stability. In broader industry news, the healthcare sector, including Elevance Health, experienced a downturn following a Department of Justice investigation into UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: )’s Medicare billing practices. This development has raised concerns about potential regulatory scrutiny affecting other companies involved in Medicare Advantage plans.

On a positive note, healthcare stocks, including Elevance Health, saw an increase following President Trump’s supportive comments on social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which investors perceived as favorable for the stability of these programs.

Antonio Neri, chief executive officer of the Spring-based company, made the announcement during an earnings call presentation last week. He said the cuts are part of a greater cost reduction plan aimed at reducing expenses by $350 million by 2027.

“Looking ahead, we see additional opportunities to take incremental corporate cost actions to further strengthen our financial profile,” Neri said. “We plan to reduce our employee base 5 percent over the next 12 to 18 months through the reduction of approximately 2,500 positions and expected attrition.”

Hewlett Packard employs more than 60,000 employees worldwide, including around 2,000 in the Houston area. It wasn’t immediately clear on Monday how the major workforce reduction would affect Houston-based employees.

“Doing so will better align our cost structure to our business mix and long-term strategy,” Neri said. “These are not easy decisions to make as they directly affect the life of our team members. We will treat all those transitions with the highest level of care and compassion.”

Hewlett Packard’s stock shares dipped 19% in extended trading last week, but the company’s revenue overall rose 17% from the prior year, coming in at $7.85 billion in the quarter ending Jan. 31.

ID3,Albertsons,2025-03-10 19:55:09+00:00,CoStar,Circle K owner considers selling 2000 US stores as part of potential 7-Eleven deal - CoStar,Andy Peters,,,,,https://www.costar.com/article/1972436854/circle-k-owner-considers-selling-2000-us-stores-as-part-of-potential-7-eleven-deal,"The parent company of 7-Eleven said Alimentation Couche-Tard agreed to consider divesting about 2,000 Circle K stores in the United States to address potential antitrust concerns that could torpedo a merger of the companies.
Couche-Tard last year offered US$47 billion to acquire Seven & I, owner of 7-Eleven, the world’s largest convenience store chain.
In the shareholder letter, Seven & I raised the specter of Kroger’s failed US$24.6 billion bid to acquire rival supermarket chain Albertsons.
Couche-Tard operates about 7,100 stores in the U.S. and 2,100 stores in Canada under the Circle K name and other brands.
“This would provide some insight into the prospects of success along terms that had a reasonable likelihood of satisfying U.S. antitrust regulators and court challenge,” Seven & I said.","The parent company of 7-Eleven said Alimentation Couche-Tard agreed to consider divesting about 2,000 Circle K stores in the United States to address potential antitrust concerns that could torpedo a merger of the companies.

Seven & I Holdings said in a letter sent to shareholders Monday that it won’t agree to a sale to Couche-Tard unless the Canadian company takes steps related to potential antitrust issues. Couche-Tard last year offered US$47 billion to acquire Seven & I, owner of 7-Eleven, the world’s largest convenience store chain. Seven & I formed a special committee from its board of directors to consider the offer.

In the shareholder letter, Seven & I raised the specter of Kroger’s failed US$24.6 billion bid to acquire rival supermarket chain Albertsons. A federal judge in December blocked what would have been the largest supermarket merger in U.S. history, citing antitrust concerns.

“The cautionary tale of the Albertsons-Kroger transaction clearly demonstrates the risks of consumer-facing retailers looking to divest thousands of stores without a buyer that is market-tested and well positioned to preserve the competitive landscape,” Tokyo-based Seven & I said in the letter.

“We will not blindly enter a transaction with no clear path to closing that could leave our company in a value destructive limbo for multiple years,” Seven & I said.

Seven & I had 13,145 convenience store locations under 7-Eleven, Speedway and other brands in the U.S. and Canada as of September 2024, according to the company's investor presentation from last week. Couche-Tard operates about 7,100 stores in the U.S. and 2,100 stores in Canada under the Circle K name and other brands.

Seven & I proposed three options for Couche-Tard to consider. One would be to divest all its stores in the U.S., including Circle K and other brands, “in a ‘clean sweep,’ taking U.S. antitrust risk off the table,” Seven & I said in the shareholder letter.

The second option would be for Couche-Tard to sign a definitive agreement to sell its stores “as a condition precedent to the signing of a definitive merger agreement” with Seven & I.

In the third option, Couche-Tard and Seven & I could “immediately map out the viability of a divestiture process” without waiting for a definitive agreement to sell stores. The option would include “defining operational, management and financial characteristics of the group of stores to be sold and identifying potential buyers.""

“This would provide some insight into the prospects of success along terms that had a reasonable likelihood of satisfying U.S. antitrust regulators and court challenge,” Seven & I said.

Couche-Tard has agreed to consider the third option, and the companies’ financial advisers have begun talks to discuss the matter, Seven & I said. Seven & I did not identify the financial advisers. Couche-Tard, based in Laval, Quebec, did not respond to CoStar News' request for comment.

Last week, Seven & I took another step to address potential concerns about the Couche-Tard bid when it named former Walmart executive Stephen Dacus as CEO, the first American to hold the position. Dacus will spearhead an effort to spin off Seven & I’s convenience store business through an initial public offering. Dacus will replace Ryuichi Isaka, who is stepping down in May.

Seven & I also said last week that it agreed to sell its superstore operations and other non-7-Eleven businesses to Bain Capital for US$5.4 billion.

Since receiving the unsolicited bid from Couche-Tard last year, Seven & I explored a potential buyout from the company’s founding Ito family but failed to secure necessary financing.

According to the latest data from Statista, Mixue Bingcheng has over 45,000 locations worldwide, while McDonald's lags behind with 41,800.

Mixue Bingcheng: The Company That Started from a Small Business

Founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao, Mixue Bingcheng began as an ice cream and cold drinks business, with the idea of offering its products at extremely low prices. Although its presence is mainly limited to China, the chain has also managed to expand to other Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

Its affordable pricing strategy, with products like ice cream and tea for less than a dollar, has been key to its rapid expansion. Despite not having a presence in Europe or the United States, Mixue Bingcheng has managed to position itself as the fast-food company with the most locations in the world. Its business model, based on the franchise system, has allowed for unprecedented growth.

The Secret of Its Success

99% of Mixue Bingcheng's establishments are operated by franchisees. This has allowed the chain to expand rapidly without having to bear all the direct costs of each new location. Additionally, the main source of income for Mixue Bingcheng comes from the sale of products, equipment, and packaging to its franchisees.

Despite being the chain with the most restaurants in the world, the company still doesn't surpass other major beverage brands like Starbucks or Tim Hortons in terms of revenue. However, its growth has been remarkable. In the first nine months of 2024, Mixue Bingcheng reported a 42% increase in net profits, reaching 460M euros.

The Challenge for McDonald's and Its Decline in Sales

McDonald's has gone from having a net profit of 2.04 billion dollars in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 2.02 billion in the same period of 2024. Additionally, the chain has faced problems after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) linked an E. coli outbreak to its Quarter Pounder burgers.

Meanwhile, Mixue Bingcheng continues its global expansion. Without having a significant presence in markets like Europe or the United States, it seems to have a promising future thanks to its business model and affordable prices.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-exterior-burger-king-mcdonalds-mixue-bingcheng-desenfocado_1200_800.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 14:04:48.844429

CVS Health is choosing not to add many retail products to these locations due to falling sales in that sector. However, some products relevant to its pharmacy operations, such as over-the-counter drugs, will still be available at the mini stores.

CVS Health’s decision to focus on its pharmacy operations makes sense as they account for 80% of its sales. Considering the high value of real estate space, it makes sense to maintain a strong pharmacy presence while limiting retail operations. Especially as CVS is going through a period of struggle that has it shuttering many of its stores.

What This Means for CVS Stock

CVS Health focusing more on pharmacy than retail sales could be a boon to the company’s stock. Current economic conditions have hampered pharmacy chains with rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) recently announcing a deal to go private after years of struggles.

Today’s stock movement has CVS shares up 0.56%. That builds on its 50.46% increase year-to-date and helps erase its 8.16% decrease over the last year. Walgreens going private has been a strong catalyst for CVS stock this year as it will remove one of its rivals from public trading.

Is CVS Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Turning to Wall Street, the analysts’ consensus rating for CVS Health is Strong Buy based on 17 Buy and three Hold ratings over the last three months. With that comes an average price target of $71.83, a high of $81, and a low of $51.

Growth has slowed especially sharply in financial services and consumer-facing industries. However, at least some of the upturn in the goods producing sector reflected the front-running of tariffs, hinting that the revival may prove short-lived. Much will depend on the degree to which business confidence can prove resilient in the face of growing geopolitical and economic uncertainty.

Slower services growth offsets manufacturing improvement

S&P Global Market Intelligence's PMI surveys indicated that the gap in performance between the global services and manufacturing sectors narrowed in February. While manufacturing growth hit the fastest for eight months, services growth waned to a 14-month low. Both rates of expansion were nonetheless only modest. The resulting composite PMI - a GDP-weighted average of the two sectors - fell to its lowest since December 2023, indicating weakened global output growth for a second successive month, as the deteriorating service sector performance overshadowed the upturn in the goods-producing sector.

Healthcare leads upturn as consumer-facing companies and financial services report slowdowns

Looking in more detail, by broad industry the fastest growth was recorded for healthcare, followed by financial services, albeit the latter now down to a 14-month low.

Growth rates meanwhile also slowed for consumer goods and services after solid starts to the year. Companies reported concerns over the pace of consumer spending in the months ahead, as well as concerns over inflation and interest rates, with many forecasters anticipating higher rates of both - notably in the US - than previously anticipated.

The worst performing broad sector, however, was industrials, where output failed to grow for the first time in 14 months, while basic materials also broadly stalled.

In more detail, the fastest growing sector was pharmaceuticals & biotech, with 'other' (non-banking) financials and insurance also faring especially well. Conversely, metals & mining firms led the global contraction for a third straight month, followed by autos & parts manufacturing, which saw output fall for an eighth straight month.

Transportation notably reported a first fall in activity for 14 months. Timber & paper products also fell into decline, as did beverages. However, with five sectors moving out of expansion - notably including machinery & equipment making and construction materials - the total number of sectors in contraction eased from eight to six between January and February.

Tariff impact

A key surprise in the sector data was therefore the improvement in some of these manufacturing sectors, which at face value, appeared at odds with the growing concern over impact of trade protectionism. New orders for machinery and equipment, for example, rose in February for the first time since last June. Orders for construction materials likewise rose for a second month and at the fastest rate for two years.

These two sectors of particular interest as they act as bellwethers of business investment spending, either on kit or premises. This seems odd, given that the survey also showed business confidence sliding in February to one of the lowest seen over the past two years amid increasingly elevated levels of uncertainty. Such an environment is not usually conducive to rising investment spending.

There was instead evidence from the anecdotal information collected on the PMI questionnaires that these manufacturing improvements were often linked to the front-loading of production and sales ahead of tariffs. If so, this upturn could prove short lived. Since these data were collected, the US has announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, upped tariffs from mainland China by 10% (taking these to 20%), and raised the prospect of more tariffs to come, notably on the EU. China and Canada have already responded with various measures against US goods and services.

With February's PMI data having been collected at a time when the US had postponed the implementation of additional tariffs, March's PMI data will therefore come under particular scrutiny to gauge the extent to which these newly applied protectionist measures may be dampening business activity and sentiment.

In 2020, the group agreed to acquire Kraft Heinz Co.’s natural cheese business for $3.2 billion.

All of that will leave the company well-positioned when tariffs come into force.","“We will adapt to the reality,” he said in an interview at the company’s office in Chicago. “Imported butter is already very expensive. People that can afford it, they will continue to buy it, because they want it to be a part of their fridge.”

President Donald Trump said the US will impose tariffs on agriculture products imported into the country starting on April 2. While he has slapped duties on inbound shipments of steel and aluminum, a measure targeted at the European Union, he is yet to announced broader levies on the bloc.

Lactalis, which said imported products account for just 1% of its American business, has been expanding in the US in recent years. In 2020, the group agreed to acquire Kraft Heinz Co.’s natural cheese business for $3.2 billion. In September, it reached an agreement to buy General Mills Inc.’s US yogurt business, which includes the popular Yoplait brand, a deal the company expects to receive regulatory approval for later this year.

In California, Lactalis has announced a $55 million expansion of a production facility that makes Président Feta cheese. The group is also growing the Chicago office it acquired with the Kraft deal — it now has 240 employees in the Windy City, up from just 90 in 2021, and recently rented an additional 13,000 square feet of space in the trendy neighborhood of the West Loop.

Lactalis last month opened a dedicated 200,000-square foot distribution center in Belvidere, Illinois. Owned and operated by Midwest Refrigerated Services, the center will receive products from 10 Lactalis production sites in the US and several co-manufacturing facilities, as well as imports from Europe.

Cheese Reserves

While some companies rushed to stockpile European butter in the US ahead of tariffs, Lactalis said its Président product requires regular importing to ensure freshness. That’s key to its appeal to American consumers.

When it comes to Parmigiano Reggiano cheese from Italy, Lactalis is well prepared. The company built a stockpile in the US, in part because of strong availability at its Italian unit. Concerns about port strikes in the US last year also meant Lactalis brought more of the product in. All of that will leave the company well-positioned when tariffs come into force.

Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, a type of Parmesan, is easier to store because it has a longer shelf life. Italian exports of Parmesan and Grana Padano cheese to the US surged 10% from January to November 2024, according to Italian dairy industry market analysis group CLAL.

Lactalis, which also owns brands like Stonyfield Organic and Siggi’s yogurt and Black Diamond cheese in the US, is also worried about the impact tariffs could have on American farmers. On Friday, Trump proposed a tariff on Canadian dairy that could come soon.

Benchmark Class III milk futures fell almost 16% this year after gaining 29% in 2024.

What This Means for CVS Stock CVS Health focusing more on pharmacy than retail sales could be a boon to the company’s stock.","CVS Health (CVS) is ditching retail sales to focus on pharmacy operations at 12 new locations opening in 2025. These new CVS stores will offer an incredibly limited amount of retail products to consumers while still running a full pharmacy. To achieve this, the company is focused on opening stores roughly half the size of its typical locations.

CVS Health is choosing not to add many retail products to these locations due to falling sales in that sector. However, some products relevant to its pharmacy operations, such as over-the-counter drugs, will still be available at the mini stores.

CVS Health’s decision to focus on its pharmacy operations makes sense as they account for 80% of its sales. Considering the high value of real estate space, it makes sense to maintain a strong pharmacy presence while limiting retail operations. Especially as CVS is going through a period of struggle that has it shuttering many of its stores.

What This Means for CVS Stock

CVS Health focusing more on pharmacy than retail sales could be a boon to the company’s stock. Current economic conditions have hampered pharmacy chains with rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) recently announcing a deal to go private after years of struggles.

Today’s stock movement has CVS shares up 0.56%. That builds on its 50.46% increase year-to-date and helps erase its 8.16% decrease over the last year. Walgreens going private has been a strong catalyst for CVS stock this year as it will remove one of its rivals from public trading.

Is CVS Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Turning to Wall Street, the analysts’ consensus rating for CVS Health is Strong Buy based on 17 Buy and three Hold ratings over the last three months. With that comes an average price target of $71.83, a high of $81, and a low of $51. This represents a potential 7.71% upside for CVS stock.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cvstock-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 13:08:54.042821

The company—which employs about 2,000 people in the Houston area— announced it would reduce operating costs by cutting about 5 percent of its workforce through layoffs and attrition over the next 18 months.

The CEO of the software giant confirmed the job cuts during the company's first-quarter earnings call on Friday. The workforce reduction program was approved by the board Thursday, according to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company has locations in Spring, where its City Place headquarters campus is located, and Houston, according to its 2024 annual report. In 2020, the company moved its headquarters from San Jose, California to Spring. Hewlett Packard employs more than 60,000 people around the world.

It is not known how many employees in the Houston area would be affected by the job cuts.

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise expects to save around $350 million in costs relating to the cuts, followed by savings of around the same amount by fiscal year 2027. The plan calls for the cuts to take effect through fiscal year 2026.

CEO Antonio Neri, on a conference call with analysts on Friday, said, ""We could have executed better."" He pointed to issues within HPE's server unit, explaining that there has been a rapid shift in demand for the newest graphics processing units that has left the company with a higher-than-normal inventory of older units.

The CEO is reportedly one of Houston's most highly paid executives, according to the Houston Chronicle. In 2023, his total compensation package was reported at more than $20 million, placing him ninth in the region.

The company's CFO, Marie Myers, said on the conference that the impact of the new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada is also of concern for the upcoming year.

In other recent news, Genmab announced that Johnson & Johnson will not proceed with a worldwide license for HexaBody-CD38, despite Genmab’s ongoing evaluation of the drug’s clinical data.
Genmab has scheduled its annual general meeting, as disclosed in a recent filing, with further details to be announced.","Copenhagen-based biotech firm Genmab A/S disclosed today that Johnson & Johnson will not advance the HexaBody-CD38 program, as detailed in a recent SEC filing. The announcement was made in a Form 6-K report, which is incorporated by reference into Genmab’s registration statements.

HexaBody-CD38, a proprietary Genmab technology, was under evaluation by Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, for potential therapeutic applications. The decision not to proceed with the program comes directly from Janssen, although specific reasons behind the decision were not disclosed in the filing.

Genmab’s Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Anthony Pagano, signed the report dated today, affirming the company’s compliance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Form 6-K report is a routine disclosure that publicly traded foreign companies must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), providing updates on material corporate events.

The 6-K filing also indicates that Genmab, which specializes in the field of pharmaceutical preparations, will continue to file annual reports under Form 20-F, adhering to the regulatory standards set forth by the SEC.

Investors and stakeholders of Genmab A/S, which trades under the ticker symbol (NASDAQ: ), may be attentive to the implications of this development on the company’s product pipeline and strategic partnerships. According to InvestingPro analysis, the company appears undervalued based on its Fair Value calculations, with four analysts recently revising their earnings estimates upward for the upcoming period. As the company has multiple ongoing projects and collaborations, the discontinuation of the HexaBody-CD38 program represents a single aspect of its broader research and development efforts, which have generated impressive revenue growth of 30.7% over the last twelve months.

The report is available for public review and serves as an official document that ensures transparency in the operations of foreign companies listed on U.S. exchanges. It is important to note that all the information in this article is based on the statements made in the press release and the SEC filing by Genmab A/S.

In other recent news, Genmab announced that Johnson & Johnson will not proceed with a worldwide license for HexaBody-CD38, despite Genmab’s ongoing evaluation of the drug’s clinical data. This decision follows a clinical proof-of-concept study that showed a 55% overall response rate for HexaBody-CD38, which was slightly higher than the 52% for DARZALEX FASPRO®. Genmab’s CEO emphasized the potential of their HexaBody platform and highlighted the strength of their other late-stage assets. Separately, Genmab reported recent managerial share transactions and filed the details with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that ensures transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements.

Additionally, Genmab granted restricted stock units and warrants to its management and employees, aligning their interests with shareholders. The company also increased its share capital following the exercise of employee warrants, a common practice to motivate staff by providing them an ownership stake. Genmab has scheduled its annual general meeting, as disclosed in a recent filing, with further details to be announced. These developments reflect Genmab’s ongoing efforts in corporate governance and employee incentives.

Fernandez laid out a bold vision for the company, highlighting brand building, strategic marketing, and an innovative approach to commerce that targets the evolving desires of consumers, particularly in premium and luxury segments.

Fernandez emphasized the importance of transforming Unilever into a ""world-class company in terms of brand creation and in market execution."" He acknowledged the solid foundation laid by his predecessor but asserted that his track record is a better fit for leading Unilever through the next phase of transformation.

On Brand Building and Strategic Marketing

Central to Fernandez's strategy is the ambition to build a ""marketing and sales machine"" within Unilever, with a decisive pivot towards ""premiumization"". ""I am really committed to big serious revolution in our superior functionality, aesthetics, sensorials of our brands,"" he explained.

This shift aims to create what Fernandez describes as ""desire at scale,"" a concept he has championed from his tenure in the beauty industry.

The CEO also spoke leveraging influencers and social-first advertising to enhance brand equity and consumer engagement. ""Creating marketing activity systems in which others can speak for your brand is very, very important,"" Fernandez noted.

He plans to employ influencers extensively, aiming to have a presence that resonates deeply with local markets across the globe.

His approach includes a significant increase in digital content creation and influencer partnerships. ""There are 19,000 zip codes in India. There are 5,764 municipalities in Brazil. I want one influencer in each of them,"" he emphasized.

This strategy is part of a broader move to increase brand and marketing investments, which have risen from 13% to over 15% of sales in recent years.

Quick Commerce and Luxury Markets

Fernandez also addressed the rise of quick commerce, particularly in emerging markets like India, where he foresees this channel expanding significantly. ""We expect quick commerce to be 10-15% [of sales] in the next three, four years,"" he predicted.

This approach is tailored to meet the demands of discerning luxury consumers who value convenience and exclusivity.

Moreover, Fernandez sees significant opportunities in emerging markets such as India and the US, which he identifies as future geographical anchors for Unilever. ""In the long run, as I mentioned, make US and India a key, two key anchors of our portfolio. Make our brands, make our best brand travel fast,"" he explained.

He stressed the importance of adapting to rapid changes in consumer preferences and channel dynamics, especially in markets like China and Indonesia.

She said the company closed 12 traditional big-box format stores in the U.S. and opened two new stores.
This year, Barry said the company plans to close five to 10 stores and open “a few” smaller format stores.","Dive Brief:

Best Buy’s fourth-quarter revenue fell 4.7% year over year to $13.9 billion, while comparable sales rose 0.5%, the company reported Tuesday. Domestic revenue fell 5% to $12.7 billion.

The company saw operating income decline 61.3% from the year-ago period to $217 million and net income fall about 75% to $117 million.

Although Best Buy’s Q4 performance beat analyst and company expectations, the first quarter and fiscal year are uncertain as tariffs are likely to drive up prices for consumer electronics, CEO Corie Barry said during a Tuesday earnings call.

Dive Insight:

On March 3, President Donald Trump ordered 20% tariffs on products from China. The next day, 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico took effect, although the duties have since been delayed until April 2 for imports covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

“The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical, and complex,” Barry said according to a call transcript. “China and Mexico remain the No. 1 and No. 2 sources for products we sell, respectively. While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.”

Best Buy issued guidance for the upcoming fiscal year that forecasts revenue ranging from $41.4 billion to $42.2 billion and comparable sales ranging from flat to 2%. But the company said its latest fiscal outlook doesn’t reflect the effects of recently enacted tariffs because there’s still uncertainty about the details and the response it will draw from U.S. consumers and international trading partners.

However, Barry said based on the company’s analysis, if the 10% tariffs on products from China that began last month remained in effect for the rest of this year, comp sales would be negatively impacted.

Barry said the company is continuing to refine its physical footprint. She said the company closed 12 traditional big-box format stores in the U.S. and opened two new stores. This year, Barry said the company plans to close five to 10 stores and open “a few” smaller format stores.

The company plans to continue its rollout of dedicated spaces to showcase new tech. Barry also said that the company’s three-tiered membership and loyalty program currently has nearly 8 million paid members — up from 7 million last year — and about 100 million overall across all tiers.

Still, Best Buy faces rising competition from other big-box stores like Walmart or Lowe’s encroaching on its territory, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in emailed comments. While Best Buy is on the right track by working to make its stores destination spaces, Saunders said the retailer should better communicate the value of its digital shopping offering.

Looking ahead, he said the company’s guidance for Q1, which anticipates negative comps with growth possible for the following quarters suggests that Best Buy’s decline may be bottoming out. “As a brand, Best Buy is well regarded,” Saunders said. “It is also trusted. So, in our view, there is a very solid base from which to build.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/b3dHsu5FExLVDADZnReQW7KE4Ow672ufUNQtiC_4zpM/g:nowe:84:244/c:1178:665/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMjQzNC5qcGVn.webp,N,,2025-03-10 13:08:47.764776

The company—one of the global leaders in property and liability insurance for businesses—came close to that target. In 2024, AXA’s revenue from written premiums totaled R$1.9 billion, nearly 12% higher than the previous year.

“Our plan now is to move from a still small position to a stronger one in a country with a solid population base and strong fundamentals,” AXA CEO Thomas Buberl said in an interview with Valor.

During his visit to Brazil in February, Mr. Buberl outlined three key pillars for the company’s local expansion: increasing its market share in the corporate segment, developing products that support the green transition—“in which Brazil plays a very important role”—and promoting social inclusion by offering insurance solutions for consumers who have yet to access this type of protection.

For now, AXA does not plan to enter the health insurance segment, one of its key global businesses. When asked about the possibility of expanding into this area in Brazil, Mr. Buberl said he does not yet have a definitive answer.

“We are probably one of the strongest health insurers internationally, so we always explore opportunities to bring that expertise to other countries. However, in Brazil, the health insurance market is very consolidated. If we were to enter this segment, we would need to find a way to differentiate ourselves from already established companies, which likely would not be easy.”

Beyond market expansion and insurance penetration in Brazil, AXA is closely monitoring the impact of climate change on the country. According to Mr. Buberl, the level of risk associated with climate events in Brazil is likely higher today, given recent disasters such as the April 2024 floods in Rio Grande do Sul.

The catastrophe in southern Brazil was one of the most significant events for the local insurance industry, comparable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which lasted over two years. Total insurance claims related to the floods reached R$6.08 billion, according to data from CNseg, the country’s insurance industry federation. For comparison, the pandemic resulted in R$7 billion in claims across the market.

“With climate events becoming more frequent worldwide, addressing these risks means investing in damage prevention as well,” Mr. Buberl said. “Consider two hurricanes in the United States—Katrina (2005) and Irma (2017). Both followed similar paths, but costs declined significantly over those 12 years because prevention measures improved.”

Regarding the wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year, he noted that concrete buildings survived, while wooden structures burned completely. “It’s heartbreaking to see people suffer, especially knowing that some of these losses could have been prevented,” he said.

Mr. Buberl emphasized that one of insurers’ key roles is ensuring cities remain “insurable”, which is only possible with preventive measures. “If we help our clients prevent the next disaster, we create a positive impact.”

In 2024, AXA’s global revenue, including written premiums and other income, grew 8% to €110 billion. Net profit rose 11% to €7.9 billion.

New York (CNN) — CVS is looking to grow itself by shrinking.

The pharmacy chain is opening around a dozen stores this year that are about the half the size of its traditional layout and have only a pharmacy — ditching the front-end of the store that traditionally has sold snacks, greeting cards and other consumer staples.

The smaller stores are one aspect of CVS’ turnaround plans, which have also included more than 1,000 store closures and thousands of layoffs, as the chain looks to adjust in an industry currently undergoing an upheaval.

Drug store chains have become ubiquitous and overexpanded. They’ve also become synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability.

A smaller format store will have a full-service pharmacy as well as some some over-the-counter products, a CVS spokesperson said, adding that they “will be designed to meet the community’s specific pharmacy needs.”

“By taking a customized approach to our footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve, we’re continuing to strategically realign our pharmacy footprint to better support patient and ensure the right geographic coverage,” a CVS spokesperson told CNN.

Focusing solely on the pharmacy signals to Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData Retail, that CVS has “done very little to defend revenue” of the front-end of its stores.

“It will certainly be cheaper to operate smaller stores focusing on essentials, but it’s not a complete solution for CVS as many more digital players are entering the prescription space and there’s growing competition from chains like Walmart,” he told CNN.

Changes are not only affecting CVS. Last week, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a deal ending its century as a publicly traded company and sold itself a private equity firm in a $24 billion deal. Rite Aid, another rival, also exited bankruptcy last year and has shuttered hundreds of stores.

Declaring itself “the world’s largest advertising group” (by net revenue), Publicis Groupe kicked off Adland’s earnings season today -- reporting fourth-quarter organic net revenue growth of 6.3%. For full-year 2024 organic growth (which excludes M&A and currency impact) was 5.8%.

Full-year net revenue totaled 13.97 billion euros ($14.4 billion) -- up 6.6% -- and Q4 net revenue was nearly 3.9 billion euros ($4 billion), up 8.9%.

The Groupe’s operating profit margin for the full year was just over 18%.

Company shares were up about 2% on the Paris exchange Tuesday morning after it released its earnings report.

As for 2025, the company indicated that it was “confident” that it would achieve full-year organic growth of between 4% and 5%.

The low end of the projection (4%) would be achieved in current market conditions. At the top end, the Groupe said it could deliver 5% if the macroeconomic environment improves, which would result in less cuts in traditional advertising and a resumption of client spend on digital business transformation projects.

In Q1 2025, the Groupe expects to deliver organic growth within the full year range.

Arthur Sadoun, chairman and CEO of Publicis Groupe stated: “Thanks to a very strong Q4, Publicis became the largest advertising company in the world in 2024. We are ending the year in the number one position across the board, growing three times faster than our holding company peers, and five times faster than the IT consultancies.""

“We delivered industry-high financial ratios while stepping up the pace of our investments in AI and talent. Once again, we topped the charts in new business rankings. But even more importantly, we are accelerating on our status as a Category of One thanks to our unmatched 1st-party data capabilities, our connected media ecosystem, our creative firepower, and our 25,000 engineers, brought together through the Power of One. This makes us confident in significantly outperforming the industry in 2025 for the 6th year in a row.”

The claim to being the top holding company will not be official until the other major firms report their results.

Omnicom reports later today, and WPP is expected to report later in the month.

But even Publicis has acknowledged that if the Omnicom-IPG merger goes through later this year, that entity will become the world’s largest ad group, albeit with plenty of growth opportunity for Publicis.

Key Points

- Starbucks is the largest coffee chain in the world, boasting over 40,500 stores globally, both company-operated and licensed, where coffee and food are sold.

- Over the past year, Starbucks has been in a mini-crisis with declining same-store sales, caused by less foot traffic and aggressive expansion, ignoring the core customer satisfaction

- With the appointment of Brian Niccol as a CEO, the company plans to revitalize the operations with more advertising, simple menu options, store renovations and further digitalization

- There are certain challenges and risks, but Starbucks has the capability to limit the effects

- At the current price, the company is not exactly cheap, but the path to improvement in operations is clear, which will bring some upside potential

Company Overview

TradingKey - Starbucks Corporation is the leading roaster and retailer of specialty coffee globally. In addition to fresh, freshly brewed coffees, Starbucks’ offerings include many complimentary food items and a selection of premium teas and other beverages, sold mainly through the company’s retail stores.

Source: SEC Filings, TradingKey

Starbucks currently has a network of over 40,000 stores – both company operated and licensed:

Company-Owned Stores: Starbucks' company-owned segment represents most of the company's revenue and includes all its stores worldwide. These are owned and managed directly by Starbucks. The company handles all aspects of operations, including staffing, inventory and store management. Revenue from company-operated stores is recognized when the sale occurs. This includes sales of beverages, food and other products directly to customers in the stores.

Licensed Stores: These are owned and operated by independent licensees. Starbucks provides the branding, products and operational guidelines, but the day-to-day management is handled by the licensee. The revenue here is generated through royalties, initial non-refundable fees and sales of products and equipment to the licensees.

A small amount of Starbucks-branded products such as packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and other retail locations.

Within Starbucks stores, beverages are the main product, with over 60% of the total revenue. Food is the second highest revenue source with nearly 20% and the rest is from selling beverage-related ingredients, server ware and ready-to-drink beverages.

Source: SEC Filings, TradingKey

Despite its global outreach, Starbucks revenue is significantly concentrated in the US market, which represents 75% of the top line. China, another important market, represents less than 10%.

Source: SEC Filings, TradingKey

In the US, Starbucks market share has been between 64%-66% in terms of revenue and around 54%-55% in terms of stores. The higher revenue market share compared to the store market share implies that Starbucks is positioning itself as a rather high-end brand.

Recent challenges

Despite stable store growth in recent years, Starbucks' revenue has sharply decelerated to zero or slightly negative growth. This implies sales per store have taken a significant hit, likely due to lower traffic and eroded brand value.

Source: SEC Filings, TradingKey

There are a few reasons behind this sluggish performance:

Customer Experience Issues: Starbucks struggled with maintaining a consistent customer experience, which affected customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Increased Competition: In the U.S., Starbucks competes with players like Dunkin' Donuts and McCafé. In China, intensified competition from local brands like Luckin Coffee has impacted its market share and sales.

Rapid Expansion: Compared to other food chains, Starbucks' store growth has been relatively faster. Often, overly rapid expansion leads to quality control issues and brand value dilution.

High Expectations from the New CEO

In September 2024, Brian Niccol joined Starbucks as CEO, a move seen as quite significant. Niccol was previously the CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill. During his six-year tenure at the Mexican fast-food chain, he doubled the revenue and increased the profit sevenfold, with Chipotle's share price rising eightfold during that period.

Starbucks shares rose 25% on the day of the announcement, reflecting the high expectations investors have for Niccol. He introduced the ""Back to Starbucks"" plan, which focuses on simplifying operations, reducing menu complexity and improving efficiency and overall employee satisfaction.

Workforce Changes: As part of the restructuring, Starbucks laid off 1,100 workers and closed several unfilled positions to streamline operations and save on G&A expenses.

Less discounts but more TV promotions: Promotions have significantly reduced and the savings have been re-invested in national promotions/TV ads that are seen to have a higher return over time.

Menu simplification: The company discussed a 30% reduction in menu size for both beverage and food in order to cut the lower sales/higher waste items that add unnecessary complexity to the system. This will improve the speed and consistency with variety and customization at scale.

Investment in stores: This includes a well-stocked lobby and a grab-and-go section, as well as equipment such as seating and lighting. The expected capex for 2025 is around $2.8-3.0 billion, just a slight increase from 2024. If the majority of the capex is a maintenance capex, the assumed budget per store will be in the range of $100,000, a sufficient amount for this kind of renovation work.

Digital Innovation: Emphasizing on enhancing Starbucks' digital capabilities, including expanding mobile ordering and delivery service.

Risks and Mitigants

Coffee Prices Concern: The current spot price of coffee is at an all-time high of $400, well above the 10-year average of $150. Starbucks has coverage in place for the coming years, but in the past 5-6 years, the company has moved away from fully hedging the raw material price to avoid the collateral needed for such contracts.

Currently, green coffee represents 10-15% of the cost of goods sold, which is 3-4% of revenue. This means that a realized 100% increase in landed coffee prices could be offset by a 3-4% increase in menu pricing.

Competition: In recent years we have seen an increase in competition but somehow, the market share of Starbucks has remained rather stable, despite all the strategic missteps. With the number of new improvements, there is a high chance of seeing market share gains in the coming quarters.

Source: JP Morgan

Consumption Headwinds: An increasing number of companies have recently reported a slowdown in consumption, which could imminently affect Starbucks. However, there are several reasons to believe the negative impact may not be as severe:1) Even though Starbucks is a premium brand, the ticket size is relatively small compared to bigger-ticket items like clothing, cars and real estate. This implies that consumers may not immediately forgo buying coffee; 2 Starbucks' target customers are people with relatively higher education and earning power. This social group is likely to be less severely affected during economic downturns. 3) Starbucks has a robust loyalty program that helps retain customers long-term.

Outlook and Valuation

We expect the store count growth to decelerate from mid-single to low single digits, as management focuses on improving existing stores. Revenue per store will start to see positive growth in 2026, implying a high-single-digit increase in total revenue from 2026 onwards.

In terms of profitability, Starbucks has lower margins than other large chains, primarily because it operates a significant number of directly operated stores, unlike its peers that mostly use a franchising model. Starbucks' margin for 2024 dipped to 15%, but we expect a recovery in 2026 and 2027.

Source: Bloomberg Intelligence

With this number in mind, the expected earnings per share for 2026 is around $4.00. Currently, the company is traded at 26x 2026 PE ratio, which is within the historical average for the stock.",,N,,2025-03-10 11:08:10.881629

Both companies, which have been embroiled in legal disputes following the halted merger attempt, announced new CEOs within days of each other.

Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s long-standing chairman and CEO, resigned following an internal investigation into his personal conduct. While the company insists that his departure is unrelated to financial performance or operations, it comes at a critical time when Kroger is facing labor disputes and challenges in its acquisition of Albertsons. His replacement, Ronald Sargent, has served on Kroger’s board for nearly two decades and brings a background from Staples, where he oversaw retail operations and corporate strategy.

Meanwhile, Albertsons’ CEO Vivek Sankaran announced his retirement, making way for Susan Morris, a veteran of the company with deep roots in its operations. Her appointment signals continuity, but her leadership will be crucial as Albertsons navigates its legal fight with Kroger.

The timing of these leadership changes—just months after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) blocked the merger—suggests more than coincidence. Some industry analysts speculate that both companies are repositioning themselves for another attempt at consolidation, potentially adjusting their leadership to gain regulatory approval or redefine their strategies in the face of increasing competition from Walmart and Amazon. Others believe the leadership changes reflect deeper internal challenges, from labor disputes to operational inefficiencies, that require fresh perspectives at the helm.

Whether this marks the beginning of a renewed merger push or merely a parallel shift in leadership remains to be seen.

Non-GAAP operating profit growth is expected between negative 10% and 0%.
In its first quarter fiscal 2025 results, HPE reported revenue of $7.9bn, marking a 16% increase from the previous year.
The operating profit margin for servers stood at 8.1%, compared to 11.4% in the prior year period.
The operating profit margin for Hybrid Cloud improved significantly to 7%, up from 4% in the previous year.","Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has announced a decision to cut its workforce by approximately 2,500 roles following weaker-than-expected results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. CEO Antonio Neri communicated that around 3,000 employees might leave the organisation, with an additional 500 expected to exit through natural attrition, as reported by Bloomberg.

The announcement comes in the wake of a significant 19% decline in HPE’s stock value during extended trading sessions. This downturn occurred after the company presented a more cautious outlook during its earnings call. “We took actions in the quarter to streamline costs, which helped us offset other impacts to profitability,” said Myers. “We continue to align our strategy and execution with long-term growth trends that will fuel our performance.”

HPE is implementing a cost-cutting initiative aimed at reducing structural operating costs while focusing on profitable growth. This plan will be executed through fiscal year 2026 and aims to achieve gross savings of around $350m by fiscal year 2027 via workforce reductions. To realise these savings, the edge-to-cloud company anticipates incurring cash charges of $350m over two years, with roughly $250m expected in fiscal year 2025, and the remaining $100m in fiscal year 2026.

Despite a surge in demand driven by AI technologies, high expenses associated with AI components have led to lower profit margins for HPE than anticipated. Additionally, HPE faced surplus inventory following Nvidia’s switch to Blackwell GPUs, leading to significant discounts on older servers.

Looking ahead, HPE projects fiscal 2025 revenue growth between 7% and 11%, while forecasting GAAP operating profit growth ranging from negative 24% to negative 9%. Non-GAAP operating profit growth is expected between negative 10% and 0%. The company also estimates GAAP diluted net earnings per share (EPS) between $1.15 and $1.35, with non-GAAP diluted net EPS projected between $1.7 and $1.9. For fiscal year 2025, HPE anticipates generating approximately $1bn in free cash flow.

The challenges are not limited to HPE, as its parent company, HP, has also undergone workforce reductions, recently cutting around 2,000 positions.

In its first quarter fiscal 2025 results, HPE reported revenue of $7.9bn, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. The operating profit margin for servers stood at 8.1%, compared to 11.4% in the prior year period. There was a notable increase in the company’s server revenue, which reached $4.3bn. This figure represents a 29% rise from the same period last year.

Regulatory challenges with Juniper Networks acquisition

HPE’s Intelligent Edge segment experienced a downturn, with revenue declining to $1.1bn, marking a 5% decrease compared to the previous year. The operating profit margin for this segment was 27.4%, down from 29.4% a year earlier. Conversely, Hybrid Cloud revenue saw growth, increasing to $1.4bn, which is a 10% rise from the prior-year period in actual dollars and an 11% increase when accounting for currency variations. The operating profit margin for Hybrid Cloud improved significantly to 7%, up from 4% in the previous year.

Meanwhile, HPE continues to encounter regulatory obstacles concerning its planned acquisition of Juniper Networks for $14bn. Although the European Union has approved the deal, antitrust authorities in both the UK and US have cited competition concerns. In late January, the US Department of Justice filed a legal challenge seeking to block the merger, arguing it would concentrate market power significantly. In response, HPE and Juniper intend to dispute these claims in court, with proceedings set to begin on 9 July 2025. The companies maintain that the merger would enhance competition and strengthen the US networking infrastructure by offering more innovation and choices for customers.",https://www.techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/03/shutterstock_1472085176.webp,N,,2025-03-10 08:03:39.656533
ID11,CVS Health,2025-03-10 07:41:22+00:00,Forbes,"As Walgreens Preps For New Owner, CVS Health Tries Smaller Drugstores",,,,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2025/03/09/as-walgreens-preps-for-new-owner-cvs-health-tries-smaller-drugstores/,"CVS Health is rolling out new and smaller pharmacy formats amid hundreds of drugstore closures across the industry and investor pressure to boost profits.
CVS this year will rollout “smaller format” locations in at least a dozen locations, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend.
“We plan to open a dozen or more smaller format CVS Pharmacy locations in select communities nationally over the next year,” CVS confirmed Sunday in a statement.

CVS this year will rollout “smaller format” locations in at least a dozen locations, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend. This comes as CVS’ main rival Walgreens Boots Alliance works on a financial turnaround, closes hundreds of stores and prepares for private ownership after Walgreens last week announced a $10 billion sale to Sycamore Partners.

“We plan to open a dozen or more smaller format CVS Pharmacy locations in select communities nationally over the next year,” CVS confirmed Sunday in a statement. “The new pharmacies will be introduced in select neighborhoods to help bridge gaps in care and make it easier for patients to access medications, immunizations, and other pharmacist-provided health care services.”

New and smaller formats are not new for either CVS or Walgreens, which was opening “small stores” in 2019.

But the push for new sizes and formats has taken on more urgency because both companies have large amounts of debt and face escalating pressure from flat or falling sales of general merchandise in the front of their stores.

Meanwhile, both companies own or lease real estate and don’t need as much space in their stores as more Americans shop online and traditional drugstores like CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens face more pressure from the likes of Amazon as well as developments in technology and prescription distribution that give patients less need to physically come into a store.

CVS has already been reformatting stores they have closed to include a traditional pharmacy as well as a senior center that includes medical care providers, social workers and community activities operated by Oak Street Health, which CVS paid $10 billion for two years ago.

CVS says the smaller drugstore format is in keeping with a “customized approach” to its “footprint that is focused on the specific needs of the communities we serve” and to “better support patient and ensure the right geographic coverage.”

CVS closed 900 stores between 2022 and 2024 and plans to close another 270 this year. Meanwhile, Walgreens is in the process of closing 1,200 of its 8,500 stores in the U.S. over three years. And just last year, Rite Aid emerged from federal bankruptcy protection as a more regional drugstore chain operating in 16 states after shedding more than 500 stores during the bankruptcy proceedings.

Still, CVS said closing stores doesn’t mean exiting markets and 85% Americans still live within 10 miles of its retail pharmacies. The company has also been opening pharmacies including 100 stores between 2022 and 2024 and has “plans to open nearly 30 CVS Pharmacy locations, including those inside Target stores, in 2025, in addition to the new small-format pharmacies,” the company said.

“We plan to open a dozen or more smaller format CVS Pharmacy locations in select communities nationally over the next year,” CVS said in its statement. “The new pharmacies will be introduced in select neighborhoods to help bridge gaps in care and make it easier for patients to access medications, immunizations, and other pharmacist-provided health care services. Each location will average less than 5,000 square feet, will feature a full-service pharmacy with limited over-the-counter products available for purchase and will be designed to meet the community’s specific pharmacy needs.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67ce48e7a5d45c2e8028f2f0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-03-10 06:02:14.652076

2025 RTIH INNOVATION AWARDS Supply chain technology will be a key focus area at the 2025 RTIH Innovation Awards.","Starbucks is saddled with Stone Age supply chain technology, according to Brittain Ladd, a consultant and former Amazon executive.

In a LinkedIn post, he said that he had spent the last week communicating, off the record, with current and former executives, directors and managers from Starbucks, specifically, the individuals responsible for the supply chain part of the business.

He commented: ""I approached the discussions with a preconceived notion: Starbucks former CEOs; Howard Schultz, Kevin Johnson, and Laxman Narasimhan, all failed to invest the necessary capital to design and equip Starbucks with the optimal supply chain.”

“Based on the discussions, I was right. I place the blame for the Stone Age supply chain primarily at the feet of Schultz. Johnson had minimal understanding of the importance of supply chain technology, and Narasimhan was out of his depth the minute he became CEO.""

Over the years, former Chief Supply Chain Officers, VPs and SVPs, had clearly outlined the gaps in Starbucks supply chain related to technology and the sub optimised logistics network, Ladd observed. ""On multiple occasions, funding was promised to close the gaps only to be withdrawn. This forced the supply chain organisation to have to keep Starbucks mediocre supply chain operating without the right software tools, logistics facilities, and budget.""

Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol is making the right moves, Ladd believes. However, he has to do more than proclaim that it takes too long to get products to the stores, and that the stores run out of inventory too frequently. In short, he must invest in the supply chain

Starbucks should replace its antiquated supply chain software with best-in-class tech with a focus on DeepSeek AI, Manus, and Solvoyo. The company is using software from o9 Solutions. ""Why are Starbucks locations still running out of products so frequently? Is it the platform or is Starbucks not using the platform correctly? It’s inexcusable that it can’t keep products stocked in their stores,"" Ladd said.

He added: ""I strongly suggest that Brian Niccol meet with Leo Laranjieria of MIT, to discuss the supply chain that Starbucks must have to meet customer demand and eliminate stores running out of inventory. Dr. Laranjeira should be hired as an advisor reporting directly to Niccol.""

""The fastest way to grow and increase revenue is by selling more food (real food. Not the garbage they’re currently selling). Niccol should contact Marc Lore of Wonder and discuss a partnership. Regardless of the food being sold, it has to be in-stock when customers place an order.""

Ladd concluded: ""I applaud what Niccol is doing. However, without a significant investment in technology, network optimisation, and better inventory optimisation, the supply chain will remain broken. The purpose of a supply chain is to do one thing - enable growth. Don’t make the same mistakes that the other CEOs made, Brian. Invest in the supply chain.""

2025 RTIH INNOVATION AWARDS

Supply chain technology will be a key focus area at the 2025 RTIH Innovation Awards.

The awards. which will open for entries in March, celebrate global tech innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world.

Our 2024 hall of fame entrants were revealed during an event which took place at RIBA’s 66 Portland Place HQ in Central London on 21st November, and consisted of a drinks reception, three course meal, and awards ceremony presided over by comedian Lucy Porter.

In his welcome speech, Scott Thompson, Founder and Editor, RTIH, said: “The event is now into its sixth year and what a journey it has been. The awards started life as an online only affair during the Covid outbreak, before launching as a small scale in real life event and growing year on year to the point where we’re now selling out this fine, historic venue.”

He added: “Congratulations to all of our finalists. Many submissions did not make it through to the final stage, and getting to this point is no mean feat. Checkout-free stores, automated supply chains, immersive experiences, on-demand delivery, next generation loyalty offerings, inclusive retail, green technology. We’ve got all the cool stuff covered this evening.”

“But just importantly we’ve got lots of great examples of companies taking innovative tech and making it usable in everyday operations - resulting in more efficiency and profitability in all areas.”

Congratulations to our 2024 winners, and a big thank you to our sponsors, judging panel, the legend that is Lucy Porter, and all those who attended November's gathering.

Positive Points

Anadolu Efes (IS: ) Biracilik ve Malt Sanayi AS (IST:AEFES) achieved a consolidated volume growth of 0.9% in 2024, strengthening its market leadership.

The company maintained a healthy net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.6 times, indicating strong financial management.

Beer operations showed strong momentum with a 9.9% growth in the last quarter and 8.4% for the full year 2024.

The company proposed a dividend of TRY1.27 per share, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder value.

Anadolu Efes Biracilik ve Malt Sanayi AS (IST:AEFES) successfully expanded its product portfolio, including new launches in Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Moldova.

Negative Points

The operating environment remained challenging, with high inflation and geopolitical issues impacting performance.

Soft drinks operations faced a decline in volume by 2.2% for the full year 2024.

Net income was negatively impacted by higher deferred tax expenses and lower monetary gains compared to the previous year.

The company faced capacity constraints and a highly competitive environment in Russia.

Free cash flow declined due to higher CapEx in CCI and increased interest expenses.

Q & A Highlights Q: What is the current situation in Russia?

A: A decree was published transferring the operations of the AB InBev Efes JV company in Russia to the temporary external management of a Russian company, GK Wister. Since then, there have been no significant updates beyond the official announcements. The group’s management determined that as of December 31, 2024, control of the operations was effectively held by the group under TFRS 10, and the relevant subsidiaries continued to be consolidated in the financial statements. Different assessments may be made if the current conditions persist in 2025.

Q: What has happened to the cash and what is the cash level at Russia, and what is the share of Russia in total EBITDA?

A: The total share of Russia within Anadolu Efes’ assets is 21%, and net revenue is 22%. For the beer group, both figures are 54%.

Q: Could you provide any color on your expectations for Turkey’s growth and margins?

A: Despite challenges, Turkey maintained strong momentum in 2024. The year 2025 started well, but there was a slight slowdown after price increases in February. However, a great momentum is expected after Ramadan during the summer vacation period.

Q: What steps are being taken to address low pressure on free cash flow?

A: The company is focusing on strategic initiatives to expand into new markets, enhance operational efficiency, and optimize resource allocation. Efforts include reaching new consumer segments, investing in high-growth potential products, and expanding market reach in CIS countries. Cost efficiency measures and cash flow enhancements are prioritized, excluding Russia, by increasing funding flows from international operations.

Q: How much are you expecting to spend in capital expenditures in the group excluding Russia in 2025?

A: The group excluding Russia is expected to spend a high single-digit percentage of revenue on capital expenditures, with most of it allocated to maintenance, and a portion related to capacity expansion.

Q: What is the current situation in Ukraine volume-wise?

A: Despite an initial industrial slowdown, Ukraine’s volume growth has outpaced the market. The primary aim is for Ukraine to be self-sufficient, covering its day-to-day costs through generated revenue without additional investment. In 2024, the company became the fastest-growing player in the market.

Q: Was Russian EBITDA margin higher than the beer group average in 2024?

A: No, Russia’s EBITDA margin was lower than the beer group average.

Q: How much cash is held in the Netherlands, and what’s the minimum level you would like to have there?

A: Around 50 million, slightly more, is held in the Netherlands, which is a level the company feels comfortable with.

A decades-old McDonald's menu has been unearthed, revealing long-lost items that many believe should make a swift comeback. The vintage McDonald's menu was found on the wall of a branch back in 1993 and captured by a Daily Mirror photographer.

The image was rediscovered in the Mirrorpix photographic archives. In Liverpool, the first McDonald's restaurant in the city opened its doors on Lord Street in November 1985.

To put things into perspective, in 1993 when the photo of the menu was taken, the Premier League had just started and Jurassic Park was out in cinemas. The first high-speed train made its journey through the Channel Tunnel which wouldn't open to the public until the following year, and Jodie Comer was born. Now, let's talk about the prices on the menu.

Of course, inflation and the ongoing cost of living crisis has played a significant role but it's still quite something to see a Big Mac on the menu for £1.79 while a Quarter Pounder with cheese was a mere £1.81.

There's no doubt a 1990s McDonald's milkshake seemed to take more effort to suck up through a straw - but back then you could buy a large triple thick milkshake for just £1.14 but if you wanted to take it away, it was only 97p.

Previously McDonald's offered three sizes of french fries: large for £1.05, medium at 84p, and regular costing only 57p. But what's stands out from the 1993 menu are the items that have since disappeared from the McDonald's menu.

Take, for instance, the English strawberry trifle, which was described as ""A fresh cream trifle with rich strawberry fruit jelly and sponge on a layer of dairy cream custard with rosettes of fresh cream."" The exact year McDonald's removed the trifle from their offerings is uncertain, but one online commenter recalled enjoying a 'surprisingly tasty' one at an airport back in 1993.

Another gem from the past that fans would love to see make a comeback is the McDonald's Big Breakfast. This meal included a buttered English muffin, hash brown, sausage patty, and scrambled eggs, all for a mere £1.29.

The 1993 menu described the Big Breakfast as: ""Two eggs scrambled in butter served with a pure pork sausage patty together with a toasted buttered English muffin and a delicious portion of deep fried has brown potatoes.""",https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/article24001129.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_LG_MEN_23996421_McDonalds_menu_1993_blur.jpg,N,,2025-03-09 20:00:36.720637

The Congress govt claims to have provided job opportunities to 42,000 youth in its two-year tenure.
Even the state govt used to utilise this amount for the payment of salaries and pensions.","Shimla: As Himachal Pradesh chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu is set to present the Congress govt's third budget on March 17 as finance minister, his competence will be judged better from resource mobilisation measures to steer the hill state out of the mounting debt.

With politics of freebies over the decades, limited revenue resources, increasing dependence on the central govt for financial needs, and shrinking flexibility to come up with policies to address the state's unique needs in the federal system, the cash-strapped state's debt has continued to surge from Rs 47,906 crore in 2018 to Rs 86,589 crore in the 2024 fiscal year. It is projected to touch Rs 1 lakh crore in 2025-26 fiscal. Himachal Pradesh's per capita debt now stands at Rs 1.17 lakh, the highest in the country after Arunachal Pradesh, another hill state in the north-east.

Sukhu-led govt's claims of adopting ""fiscal prudence"" measures notwithstanding, the ""Sukh Ki Sarkar"" has been unable to disburse the social security pension for the last five months to various categories, including the elderly, widows, and specially abled. The state govt, which claims to be moving ahead with the motto of ""vyavastha parivartan"" (institutional change) to make the state self-reliant by 2027, caught national headlines when 2.42 lakh govt employees waited until Sept 5 and 1.89 lakh retirees until Sept 10 last year for their Aug salary and pension, respectively. The fiscal situation continues to be grim as nearly 8,500 pensioners of the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) waited for their Jan pension until the third week of Feb this year. Various pensioners' associations continue to protest against the state govt, demanding the release of their pending arrears of the last pay commission, 11% dearness relief, and reimbursement of medical bills. At the same time, the Centre has been blaming the Himachal govt for not timely providing its share in various schemes, resulting in delays in development projects.

Major Challenges

Though, like many other states, BJP as well as Congress govts in Himachal have also been indulging in understating fiscal deficits, exploiting loopholes in the accounting system by delaying payments, they have faced major hurdles in mopping up revenue figures fudged in the budget document. Therefore, it is to be seen whether chief minister Sukhu intends to make corrections this time in the balance sheet and also reduce the total outlay of the budget for the next fiscal year.

Another significant challenge for Himachal continues to be the substantial proportion of contingent liabilities, including natural calamities, and fiscal imprudence during such events resulting in a growing debt-to-gross state domestic product (GSDP) ratio. One such example is the state govt's special relief package of Rs 4,500 crore to affected families of the monsoon disaster in 2023. The state still awaits Rs 9,042 crore from the Centre as per the post-disaster need assessment (PDNA).

Also, 14 different kinds of subsidies are being provided to the people in Himachal since the previous BJP govt was in power. The state govt has to bear the burden of around Rs 2,200 crore on account of power subsidy to beneficiaries in the financial year 2024-25. Further, out of the Rs 58,444 crore budget for the current fiscal year 2024-25, the state govt would spend Rs 33,463 crore on its committed liabilities — including salaries, pensions, and loan interest — and this comes to 79% of the state's estimated revenue receipts. The state govt disburses Rs 1,200 crore as monthly salary to its 2.42 lakh employees and Rs 800 crore as a pension to 1.89 lakh retirees every month. Therefore, the state is left with much less amount for its capital expenditure and development activities. With the increase in life expectancy, the number of pensioners is bound to increase, putting an additional burden on the state exchequer.

Moreover, blaming the previous BJP govt for the fiscal mess is not going to help the incumbent Congress govt since the Sukhu govt has entered its third year. Now the electorates want solutions and fulfilment of pre-poll promises, including Rs 1,500 per month to women and one lakh jobs per year to youth, which needs provision in the budget. The Congress govt claims to have provided job opportunities to 42,000 youth in its two-year tenure.

Dependency on Market Borrowing

The Congress govt has taken Rs 30,080 crore as loan in the past over two years, up to March this year, and out of this, Rs 18,054 crore (60%) has been spent on servicing loans and interest of the previous borrowings. As the Congress govt implemented its poll promise of restoring the old pension scheme (OPS) to 1.36 lakh govt employees, the central govt reduced its borrowing limit by Rs 1,600 crore, and around Rs 9,000 crore under the new pension scheme (NPS) is still held up with the Centre. To add to the hill state's woes, the post-devolution revenue deficit grant (RDG) by the central govt has been continuously decreasing from Rs 10,300 crore in 2021-22, and the state is projected to receive Rs 3,257 crore in the 2025-26 fiscal year. Even the state govt used to utilise this amount for the payment of salaries and pensions.

A Chinese bubble tea and ice cream chain called Mixue Bingcheng has officially beaten out McDonald's as the largest restaurant chain in the world with 45,000 restaurants compared to McDonald's 41,800 according to Statista via Chowhound.

The fast food chain that surpassed McDonald's is based in Asia and known for its soft-serve ice cream cones costing 15 cents and beverages between 30 cents to $1.20.

Of the chain's 45,000's locations, not one of them is in the United States and 90% of them are in China.

Other locations include Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia.

The company was founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao and started out selling shaved ice along with cold beverages.

“Let people around the world eat well and drink well for just two American dollars,” Hongchao told Chinese state media about how he runs his business.

More than 99% of the Mixue Bingcheng stores are franchised leaving most of its revenue to come from selling food equipment, materials and packaging to its franchises.

The move aims to provide 'better experiences for its customers and workers', citing issues such as broken machines and incorrect orders. McDonald's Chief Technology Officer Brian Rice has been insistent on the benefits of the new AI-powered tools, highlighting the stressful work environment, and the volume of orders for customers.

""Our restaurants, frankly, can be very stressful. We have customers at the counter, we have customers at our drive-through, couriers coming in for delivery, delivery at curbside. That's a lot to deal with for our crew,"" Rice said in an interview. ""Technology solutions will alleviate the stress.""

One of the defining characteristics of McDonalds is efficiency - and the brand has been experimenting with new technology and workflows since its inception. By 2023, the company opened its first automated restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, and last year, they began testing for AI-powered drive-throughs. While McDonald's frames these innovations as ways to improve efficiency and customer experience, they are a business. With a slow Q1 and an aggressive goal to grow its customer base from 175 million to 250 million by 2027, there's no doubt that these overhauls will fundamentally change the role of human workers in its restaurants.

Which highlights a broader issue - not just for McDonald's 2 million employees, but the fast-food industry as a whole. The World Economic Forum estimates AI and automation could displace up to 92 million jobs globally by 2030, with retail and food service among the most affected. Robotics and intelligence systems have also been introduced for major brands, including Taco Bell, Chick-fil-A and Wendy's.

While it will take time before we see the effects on staffing, one thing is clear-innovation won't come without a cost.",https://static.tweaktown.com/news/1/0/103774_20250309135912_mcdonalds-claims-43-000-restaurant-ai-overhaul-is-to-alleviate-stress-for-employees_full.png,N,,2025-03-08 23:54:39.080096

Liverpool have learned exactly how much they generated from their partnership with Nike during the 2023/24 season following UEFA’s latest European Club Finance and Investment Landscape study.

The figures, published this week, confirm that the Merseyside club brought in a substantial £122.8 million from their collaboration with the American sportswear giant. This sum places Liverpool joint-fourth among European clubs for kit and merchandising revenue, alongside Manchester United.

Only Real Madrid (£164.8m), Bayern Munich (£143.8m), and Barcelona (£143.8m) outperformed Liverpool in this regard.

This represents a £9.7 million increase on their 2022/23 figures, when the club earned £113.1 million from their Nike arrangement, according to UEFA’s previous reports.

Nike Deal Nears End as Adidas Return Expected

Liverpool’s current agreement with Nike, which began in 2020, is widely expected to conclude on 30 June 2025. Multiple reports indicate that German manufacturer Adidas is poised to take over from 1 July 2025, marking a return to a brand that previously supplied the club’s kits from 1985 to 1996 and 2006 to 2012.

The anticipated Adidas partnership is reportedly a five-year agreement running until 2030, though neither the club nor the brand have publicly confirmed the terms.

Rather than relying on a fixed annual sum, Liverpool’s deal with Nike was built around royalty-based earnings, ensuring the club profited significantly from global kit and merchandise sales. This model has allowed the club to see exponential revenue growth, culminating in the latest figures that place them among Europe’s top earners in this space.

Despite the strong commercial performance, Liverpool recorded a £57 million pre-tax loss in 2023/24. The increase in earnings from Nike and other commercial ventures was not enough to counterbalance rising costs across the club’s operations.

These financial pressures stem primarily from higher wages for players and staff, as well as escalating operational expenses, which have led to an overall financial shortfall despite revenue growth.

As Liverpool prepare for what appears to be a new chapter with Adidas, the club’s ability to optimise future earnings while managing rising expenditures will be key to maintaining long-term financial stabilily",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/P8AMtfarCnZ.E5mScOsG5g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MzM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/anfield_index_166/7e21b3caf1098e45e2f5ecfba19ee974,N,,2025-03-09 06:04:09.784990

According to Wendy's earnings report for the full year of 2024, global restaurant sales grew 3.1% compared to last year, with its U.S. market increasing by 2.2% and its International market up 9%.

Prioritizing restaurant expansion in its international markets isn't a new idea for Wendy's. In 2023, the fast food chain built more locations abroad than in the last few years and reduced the number of restaurants domestically.

In 2024, Wendy's ended with 5,933 restaurants across the U.S., a 1.6% decline from the year prior. Internationally, it ended with 1,307 restaurants, representing an 8% unit increase.

""The Wendy's brand has tremendous strength, and we will unlock its full potential, scaling our system to match the power of our brand,"" said Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner during the company's Investor Day.

Wendy's plans to increase sales by targeting specific demographics

Providing high-quality food and better offerings is one of Wendy's main strategies to achieve its global sales goal. The fast food chain wants to target this point by focusing on three main demographics: families, the Hispanic community, and Gen Zers.

Wendy's (WEN) aims to capture these main audiences by collaborating with various brands and fostering innovation by launching new menu items.

During its Investor Day, Wendy's revealed that it had already been working on a partnership with Takis, which will come out later this year. It also confirmed that new Frosty flavors are in the making, with innovative additions such as mix-ins and swirls. These new Frosty additions are very similar to those of the McDonald's (MCD) McFlurry, one of Wendy's strongest rivals.

""I'm excited about our upcoming innovation and collaborations that will build on our high-quality menu with fresh ingredients as we continue to elevate our customer focus, putting the customer at the center of everything we do. Our relentless pursuit of excellence in our food and our restaurants will position Wendy's for long-term success as we win across our global markets,"" said Tanner.

Wendy's wants to open more restaurants abroad to grow internationally

Although Wendy's is a well-known restaurant in the U.S., its brand is not as recognizable in the international markets as its rivals. Therefore, fast food chain wants to expand its brand awareness by opening 70% of the projected 1,000 new restaurants aboard, propelling international growth.

Two years ago, Wendy's released a new restaurant design that featured new technology like ordering kiosks and AI-powered drive-thru boards. It also reduced the size of its usual restaurants to less than a quarter acre, lowering the required energy to run those units by 10%.

By the end of 2024, the fast food chain built nearly 300 restaurants with the new design, which made operations more efficient and increased profitability. The changes made to Wendy's new restaurant design will allow it to build more restaurants for less money, making doubling its units a more reachable goal.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.49 EPS, expectations were $0.4969.

Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to the First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of the conference. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Paul Glaser, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Good afternoon. I am Paul Glaser, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

Paul Glaser: I would like to welcome you to our fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Marie Myers, HPE’s Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call concludes. We have posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying the release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage. Elements of the financial information referenced on this call are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our business as we see them today. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements.

We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2025. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Please refer to HPE’s filings with the SEC for a discussion of these risks. For financial information, we have expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today’s earnings release on our website for details.

Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency. Finally, Antonio and Marie will reference our earnings presentation in their prepared comments. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.

Antonio Neri: Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I share my comments on our Q1 performance, I would like to start by addressing the recent decision of the Department of Justice to file a lawsuit seeking to block a proposed acquisition of Jourdan Networks. The DOJ’s analysis of the market is fundamentally flawed. We strongly believe this transaction will positively change the dynamics in the networking market by enhancing competition. HPE and Juniper remain fully committed to the transaction, which we expect will deliver at least $450 million in gross annual run rate synergies to shareholders within three years of the deal closing. The court has set a trial date of July 9th. We believe we have a compelling case and expect to be able to close the transaction before the end of fiscal 2025.

Q&A Session

As you know, the US administration enacted tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, with increased tariffs on imports from China, beginning March 4th. In anticipation of this decision, we have been evaluating numerous scenarios and mitigation strategies since December to assess the potential net impact. We intend to leverage our global supply chain to mitigate aspects of the expected impact with pricing adjustments also expected. Pending further announcement from the US administration, our outlook for the balance of the year reflects our best estimate of the net impact from this tariff policy. Marie will provide more details shortly. Turning to our Q1 performance, we delivered against our commitments for the quarter, including achieving strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth.

However, we could have executed better. While our Q1 operating profit outlook anticipated increased pressure on our server operating margins, three factors impacted our profitability more than expected. Near the end of the quarter, we saw that our traditional server pricing did not adequately account for the evaluation of our inventory, which resulted in incremental server margin pressure. Higher discounts due to aggressive pricing competition in the market compounded this issue. And finally, our server margins were further pressured by the higher than normal AI inventory caused by the rapid transition of demand to next-generation GPUs and related components. We have already implemented aggressive actions to address these issues and are already seeing the positive effects of doing so.

However, we do expect to see continued pressure over the next one to two quarters before we realize the full benefit of these measures, including an expected higher AI revenue conversion. Looking ahead, we see additional opportunities to take incremental corporate cost actions to further strengthen our financial profile. We plan to reduce our employee base by 5% over the next twelve to eighteen months through the reduction of approximately 2,500 positions and expected attrition. Doing so will better align our cost structure to our business mix and long-term strategy. These are not easy decisions to make, as they directly affect the lives of our team members. We will treat all those transitions with the highest level of care and compassion. I will touch on a few highlights from the quarter, and Marie will go through each segment in greater financial detail.

At the company level, we delivered revenue and diluted net earnings per share consistent with our outlook. Q1 revenue growth of 17%, a near record, was in line with our mid-teens growth expectations. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year top-line growth, driven by our server business, which grew revenue 30% year-over-year and hybrid cloud. Non-GAAP operating profit dollars in the quarter were flat year-over-year. That resulted in non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of 49 cents, consistent with our Q1 outlook range. We are pleased by the performance of Intelligent Edge, which recorded 2% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, the third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for the segment. With the market continuing its positive path to recovery, we delivered double-digit year-over-year orders growth across all key geographies and key products, including campus switching.

During the quarter, HP Aruba networking attracted new large enterprise customers, underscoring the confidence our customers have in our strategy, portfolio, and roadmap. Hybrid cloud grew 11% year-over-year, although down sequentially following an exceptional Q4. The growth shows our storage and greener cloud product strategies are working. Demand for our Aletra storage NP was up triple digits year-over-year and now represents greater than 50% of our IP block product orders. GreenLake remains a key differentiator enabling HP to capture new enterprise hybrid cloud and AI workloads and data. We finished Q1 with more than 41,000 enterprises using HP GreenLake Cloud, and AIR surpassed $2 billion for the first time, up 46% year-over-year. In AI, we continue to see strong demand from model builders and service providers.

We booked $1.6 billion in new AI system orders in the quarter, bringing our cumulative AI system orders to $8.3 billion. The Blackwell GPU generation of products represented approximately 70% of our new order intake in Q1. We exited the quarter with $3.1 billion in AI systems backlog, up 29% quarter-over-quarter. Our pipeline remains multiples of our backlog. On the revenue front, we delivered $900 million in AI systems revenue in Q1. As we have said before, the AI systems business tends to be lumpy, as large deals take time to convert. We expect significantly higher AI revenue conversion in the second half of 2025, driven by the transition to Blackwell GPUs. We are proud to have achieved a new milestone three weeks ago when we announced the shipment of our first NVIDIA GV200 systems.

In the enterprise AI market, we saw an accelerated adoption of a variety of AI models, including agentic AI approaches in specific market verticals and workflows. In Q1, our enterprise AI orders increased 40% year-over-year, driven by higher conversion from the proof of concept phase. An example is KDDI, who, in partnership with HPE, designed and implemented a platform which will be used both internally and externally to develop, train, and tune Japanese generative AI models for domain-specific use cases. Our enterprise AI pipeline continued to grow with customers continuing to validate their use cases on our private cloud AI solution, powered by GreenLake Cloud. We see broad and increased interest from sovereign customers globally. Sovereign customers are deploying both AI systems for the development of sovereign generative AI large language models and supercomputing systems for simulation and modeling using AI.

Recently, the Leibniz Supercomputer Center at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities selected HP to build their new supercomputer called Blue Lion. It features HP innovations, including our industry-first 100% fanless direct liquid cooling infrastructure, with our slingshot networking fabric. Lastly, HP and Accenture are collaborating on a new agent AI solution for procurement, powered by Accenture AI Refinery, with our private cloud AI offering. This new solution will be deployed across HPE’s category and sourcing strategies, spend management, strategic relationship analysis, and contract obligation management. Shifting to the innovation front, I am proud of our new and differentiated products and services we continue to bring to market to fuel the success of our customers and the growth of our business.

For example, in Intelligent Edge, we announced new vertical solutions for retailers to accelerate security-first AI-driven networks. These solutions provide intelligent edge processing for IoT data in real-time, improving security, operational efficiencies, and customer experiences for retailers. In hybrid cloud, last November, we introduced a new KVM-based HPE VM essential software offering. Hybrid cloud orchestration and on-premises infrastructure virtualizations are tremendous growth opportunities for HPE. Our new VM essentials enable customers to deploy a more cost-effective virtualization solution than VMware, with full hybrid cloud orchestration. Since its launch, we have had hundreds of customers in trials demonstrating strong market interest and excitement.

We are in the process of integrating our VM essentials into our private cloud offerings. We also continue to offer it as a standalone software on HPE and multi-vendor infrastructure. In storage, we are very pleased with our triple-digit year-over-year orders growth in our Aletra MP portfolio. This validates our strategy to provide customers with a disaggregated data infrastructure subscription-based hybrid cloud-native services. Aletra MP now offers block and fast object supporting a variety of data workloads, including AI. This reduces customers’ need for multiple purchases and management. And finally, in our server business, two weeks ago, we launched a new ProLiant Gen 12 server platform with our next generation of Hilo quantum-resistant security enclave and direct liquid cooling support.

This latest generation offers the most sustainable and secure cost per computing core performance. One Gen 12 server can replace up to 26 Gen 9 servers and up to 14 Gen 10 servers. This reduces power consumption by at least 65%. In closing, in Q1, we saw continued strong demand across the portfolio, driven by our new impressive innovations and customers’ continued enthusiasm for our offerings. However, we could have executed better, particularly in our server segment. HPE has a proven execution track record, and we are committed to doing what is needed. We have already taken steps to improve our execution performance, and we expect our efforts will contribute to improvements in the back half of fiscal year 2025. We have made great strides at HPE in accelerating our strategy and aligning our product portfolio to market inflection points and customer needs.

We will continue to make bold moves to enhance our portfolio and attract new customers in ways that accelerate value for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Marie, who will provide more details on the quarter.

Marie Myers: Thank you, Antonio, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we saw increased demand for service, storage, and networking products. Our revenue grew 17% compared to last year, marking the fourth straight quarter of accelerated revenue growth. We met our outlook, achieving double-digit growth in server and hybrid cloud. Intelligent Edge also performed better than we expected and is set to grow further in this quarter. We reported non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of 49 cents, aligning with our outlook, showing strong profitability in hybrid cloud and Intelligent Edge. However, we faced some challenges in the service segment, which we are addressing. Here’s a closer look at the details of the quarter.

Our first quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year, but down 7% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting typical seasonality and lower AI systems revenue. Annual recurring revenue was $2.1 billion, up 46% year-over-year, driven by AI and Intelligent Edge. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.4%, down 680 basis points year-over-year and 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was impacted by a higher mix of server revenue and lower contribution from Intelligent Edge. And we faced challenges in server that pressured margin, both year-over-year and sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 9.9%, down 160 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially, primarily due to headwinds in gross margin.

Operating margin partially benefited from a 9% decrease in non-GAAP operating expenses, reflecting lower variable compensation and continued cost discipline. In my first year as CFO, we implemented cost-saving measures by targeting discretionary spending, reducing non-GAAP operating expenses from 24% in fiscal 2023 to 22% of revenue in fiscal 2024. In Q1, these actions lowered operating expenses to a record low of 19% of revenue. This year, we aim to target more structural cost savings. Free cash flow was negative $877 million, in line with normal seasonal patterns. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was 44 cents, above guidance of 31 cents to 36 cents due to a gain recognized on the sale of a communications technology group or CTG, and lower than expected Juniper-related costs.

Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of 49 cents was within our guided range of 47 cents to 52 cents. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $57 million in net costs primarily related to stock-based compensation expense, H3C divestiture-related severance costs, acquisition, disposition, and other charges, and amortization of intangible assets, primarily offset by the gain recognized on the sale of CTG. Now let’s break down the segment results. Server revenue was $4.3 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Revenue fell sequentially primarily due to the timing of AI systems deals. In traditional compute, our Gen 11 value proposition resonated with customers, contributing to year-over-year AUP growth. Gen 11 accounts for the majority of our traditional compute sales, and we expect to begin shipping the new Gen 12 portfolio later this year.

In AI systems, we signed $1.6 billion in net orders and added enterprise and sovereign customers. Although most demand is still from model builders, we recognized roughly $900 million of revenue, up from about $400 million last year, but down sequentially as expected due to chip availability and customer readiness. We expect these factors will continue to affect our AI systems business. Server operating margin was well below expectations at 8.1%. While our guidance of 10 to 11 assumed impact from the GPU transition and competitive pricing, market pressures were greater than expected, and execution issues further impacted operating margin. We have made improvements and taken additional steps to reduce costs, expecting server operating margin to be around 10% by Q4.

Let me provide further details. In traditional compute, we faced challenges in pricing strategies and discounting. We now have a more rigorous discount framework with increased deal mix scrutiny. These changes will take time to impact our P&L as we work through our backlog. In addition, we expect pricing adjustments may negatively impact top-line growth in the near term. In AI, our margins were affected by the transition to new GPUs and managing older GPU inventory. We believe this is an industry-wide challenge that will improve as supply and demand align. We have implemented actions to reduce inventory. Now onto Intelligent Edge, which exceeded our expectations and is ready for growth in Q2. Revenue was $1.1 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter, ahead of guidance of flattish growth.

Revenue was down 4% year-over-year as we move past post-pandemic related backlog. We saw double-digit year-over-year growth in Sassy and data center switching with notable order growth for wireless LAN and campus switching. Despite some pressure from weaker federal spending, we grew orders double digits year-over-year in all major regions. We expect the business to return to year-over-year growth in Q2 given order trends and normalized channel inventory. Operating margin was 27.4%, down 200 basis points year-over-year, but up 300 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to higher revenue and cost controls. Moving to hybrid cloud, we saw broad-based strength growing revenue 11% year-over-year to $1.4 billion in line with our guidance. Sequentially, the business declined 12%.

Our HPE Electra MP platform is ramping nicely, adding over 150 new logos this quarter. HPE Electro MP’s higher deferred revenue will benefit the long-term P&L but impacts near-term growth and margin. The transition to Electra MP pulls through more owned IP, which benefits profit. HPE private cloud AI continues to attract customers with fast deployment and competitive ROI. We continue to grow our pipeline with opportunities spanning regions and sectors. During the quarter, we received orders for small, medium, and large configurations, with use cases varying from inferencing and fine-tuning to manufacturing and life sciences. Hybrid cloud operating margin was 7%, up 300 basis points year-over-year primarily due to cost controls but down 80 basis points sequentially.

Lastly, financial services. Our financial services business generated $873 million of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Financing volumes decreased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion after a record high last quarter. Our Q1 loss ratio was 0.6%, and return on equity totaled 16.4%. Operating margin was solid at 9.4%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Moving to cash flow and capital allocation. Reflecting normal seasonality, we consumed $390 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, and free cash flow was an outflow of $877 million. Inventory totaled $8.6 billion at the end of the period, up $767 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily to support AI systems orders signed during the quarter.

We are focused on reducing inventory levels to normal ranges. Q1 cash conversion cycle was positive five days, up 17 days from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in the days of inventories to support purchases for AI systems, partially offset by an increase in days payable due to the timing of vendor payments. We returned $171 million through dividends and $52 million via share repurchases to common shareholders, respectively. Overall, the quarter was within our guidance. But given the performance in server, we took immediate actions to limit hiring, travel, and discretionary expenses. We also decided to take further actions in the form of workforce reductions and attrition management to better align our cost structure with the current business needs.

This tough decision will help streamline our organization, improve productivity, and speed up decision-making. We will support affected team members with resources and assistance during this transition. We expect to achieve at least $350 million in gross savings by fiscal 2027, with about 20% of the savings achieved by the end of this year. The timing of reductions will vary by geography. Total cash charges will be around $350 million through fiscal 2026. These savings are in addition to the synergies we will realize after closing the Juniper acquisition. Before I get into the details of our guidance, let me first provide some context. Recent tariff announcements have created uncertainty for our industry, primarily affecting our server business.

We are working on plans to mitigate this impact through supply chain measures and pricing actions. Through these efforts, we expect to mitigate to a significant degree the impact on the second half of the year and to a lesser extent the impact on Q2 as it takes time to implement mitigations. The guidance we are providing today reflects our best estimate of the impacts of the March 4th tariffs and our mitigation plans. Also, because we now expect to close Juniper by the end of this fiscal year, we will provide full-year standalone guidance. For fiscal 2025, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 11% with revenue weighted towards the second half. We estimate currency impacts of around 150 basis points. By segment, we expect Intelligent Edge will grow sequentially through the year equating to year-over-year growth in the mid-single digits.

For hybrid cloud, revenue is expected to grow in the high single digits. For server, we anticipate revenue will slow to low double-digit growth with AI systems revenue ramping meaningfully in the back half. In addition, we expect to see more pronounced service seasonality in Q3 given the expected timing of AI. Our outlook assumes non-GAAP gross margin will be below 30% for the full year, with quarterly rates impacted by the timing of AI systems deals. We expect full-year non-GAAP operating margin of around 9% at the midpoint, but we expect to exit the year approaching normal ranges. By segment, we expect hybrid cloud operating margin in the mid to high single digits and Intelligent Edge to remain in the mid-20% range. Server is expected to improve in the back half, exiting the year with operating margin around 10%.

We expect OINE will be a net expense of approximately $15 million. We are guiding GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.15 and $1.35, and a non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.70 and $1.90, weighted to the second half. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook assumes Q4 will account for a higher percentage of our annual non-GAAP net earnings compared to recent periods. We expect free cash flow will be approximately $1 billion, including operating profit of roughly $3 billion at the midpoint, negative working capital, and the restructuring charges related to the cost savings we announced today. For Q2, we expect revenue will be between $7.2 billion and $7.6 billion. This range includes a return to year-over-year growth in Intelligent Edge with operating margin in the mid-20% range.

For hybrid cloud, we expect revenue will be down slightly sequentially with operating margin in the mid-single digits reflecting seasonality. For server, we forecast a sequential decline in the mid to high single digits, including a modest decline in AI systems revenue. Q2 will be the trough for server operating margin, in the mid-single digits due to both the timing of tariff implementation and the corrective actions we are taking in the business. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between 8 cents and 14 cents, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between 28 cents and 34 cents. Lower earnings combined with investments in our AI business will be a headwind to Q2 free cash flow resulting in abnormal seasonality. As such, we expect Q2 will be our weakest cash generation quarter during 2025.

In summary, we are confident in our measures to improve our server business. In 2025, we will focus on rightsizing our cost structure while leveraging AI technologies to enhance our processes, aiming to make HPE more agile and positioned for the long term. We remain a leader in innovation, encouraged by the strong demand for products like HPE, Electro MP, and private cloud AI. The networking market is recovering, and our business is performing well. We look forward to closing the Juniper acquisition later this year. With that, I’ll open the floor for questions.

Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.

Marie Myers: Great. Thanks. Appreciate the question. Marie, it sounds like you anticipated some of the

Meta Marshall: raising pressure kind of on the GPU market when you gave the original 10 to 11% fifty basis point shortfall. You know, how much of that was CPU versus kind of pricing inventory additional pricing and inventory on GPU. Thank you. Yeah. Hi, Meta. And thanks for your question. I think you were referring to Q1, so I’m going to answer you in terms of the Q1 actuals. So as you know in our original guide, we actually had 10 to 11% per server, and that did actually include some of the pressures that Antonio mentioned in his prepared remarks in terms of the AI GPU transitions. However, the magnitude of that impact was greater than we expected. And what I would say was unanticipated was the pricing challenges that we experienced in traditional compute. That was not in our Q1 guide. So, hopefully, that gives you some context there, Meta.

Operator: Your next question. Thank you. And your next question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just just kind of building on, you know, Meta’s question there.

Operator: Know, when we when we look at the gross margin profile of your AI

Antonio Neri: server revenue and and and thinking about the monetization of the backlog as we as we move forward, I’m curious of how you know, how that’s changed or how your views have kinda structurally changed over the course of the last three months and whether or not the gross margin pressure you might be seeing, is there any kind of inventory charges or write downs that are more transitory in the model and just any context on how margin profile looks thinking about the hopper going to the Blackwell product cycle would be helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Aaron. This is Antonio. So when I think about the AI market again and the AI market, high margin in that context, I see three segments. Right? So you talk about the service provider, builders.

They lead with time to market with the latest technologies. And that’s why in Q1, we saw a quite significant amount of Blackwell. In fact, I think I said 70% of the mix of the $1.6 billion was Blackwell. When you go to the other two segments, the sovereign and the enterprise AI, that’s not the case. They go with a combination of prior technologies and maybe new technologies in the software, an enterprise market, definitely, it’s n minus one or even minus two. For that matter. And so that’s why that inventory in the AI that was higher than normal is because now it will take a little bit longer for us to basically transition that inventory as we go through the other two segment consumption while the service providers and the model builders will shift much more quickly into the, the latest technologies.

And that working capital, because in the end, it’s all working capital. Pressure is not so much the margin pressure of what you sold when, is what compounded the issue in Q1. And it will take, like we said, one or two quarters to that backlog. The $3.1 billion into revenue plus new orders are coming in, and then return the traditional server business to the, what I would call, more normal operating margins because that was mostly impacted by the the, what I call the, higher discounted and that one time thing, we would call it the value of our inventory itself.

Marie Myers: K. Thank you, Aaron.

Aaron Rakers: Next question, please.

Operator: And your next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thanks for the question. Your guidance implies over $2 billion year on year growth in revenue. But at the midpoint, almost a $150 million year on year decline in operating profit dollars. So can you just help us think through how much of operating profit dollar headwind you are baking in explicitly from your from your tariff assumptions and if you could bridge that

Marie Myers: you Similarly, for free cash flow on a year on year basis where you’re you’re going from north of $2 billion to $1 billion. How much of that is is tariffs versus competitive pricing versus inventory, that’d be helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Hey, Wamsi. Good afternoon. And maybe I’ll take the second part of your question first in terms of cash itself. So for the full year guide, as you know, we, in my prepared remarks, are I mentioned at least a billion. The way to think about cash flow is you you take out net earnings at the midpoint of one eighty. The biggest driver is really work capital and then also the announcement that we made around the cost efficiency program. So they’re the two biggest drivers that sort of influence cash flow from a year on year basis.

And then, obviously, the tariff impact flows straight into the the earnings at the midpoint. In terms of tariffs, Wamsi, how to answer that? What we’ve got in the guide is actually seven cents for the year, and that gets you to the midpoint of the one eighty on the guide. I would add, though, the way to think about tariffs is we’re working you know, we’ve worked obviously on mitigation effects, but it does take time to see those mitigation effects take place. So as a result, literally four cents of that seven cents is actually going to be in Q2 and it’s also in the server business, which is where we see the greatest extent of that server sorry, of the tariff impact. So tariffs seven cents in a year, but the the sort of, like, the hottest part of the tariff sort of impact is really going to be borne in Q2.

Paul Glaser: Very good. Thank you, Wamsi. Next question, please.

Operator: And your next question today will come from Tim Long with Barclays.

Tim Long: Thank you. Sorry to keep beating the AI server horse here. But maybe, Antonio, just on the strategy side,

Antonio Neri: just curious. You know, it seems like from the outside, a year year and a half two years ago, some of your peers were really chasing model builders, lower gross margin business, and you guys seemed much more focused on you know, super compute and areas that had better margin to it. It it seems like that strategy has changed and now HPE is more willing to get into some of these lower margin businesses like the GV200 NPL72 I imagine very low gross margin. What’s what’s with the am I right in that strategy change and in the future should we expect that you know, chasing the model builder business may never get better on a gross margin? Basis, so that might be something that’s more challenging to continue to compete in if we’re gonna be talking single digit gross margins for that?

Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. So no, our strategy has not changed. You know, if you look at the Q1 performance on our server operating margins, it was not particularly driven by the AI gross margins or operating margins in many ways. Of the pricing of the deals. We participate in service provider where we believe through scale and other, you know, mixes that we drive in the in that deal, whether it’s services, manufacturing, the like, we we can make the math work to ultimately deliver that overall 10% server margin combined with the rest of the server business. What what was different in Q1 for us was, again, the higher than anticipated discounting on the traditional server business, and the fact that unfortunately, this is on us. You know? It’s been bad news, good news in many ways.

Right? Is that the the cost that we saw in our valuation of the inventory was not completely factored on pricing for traditional servers. Compounded by the higher than anticipated discounting. And then, obviously, the GPU transition on the working capital that Marie just described. Which obviously had an impact on the AI margin, but not because know, the pricing was off or anything. So in many ways, I’m confident, obviously, we have put the right actions in place. The cost issue has been taken care. We found out the near end of the the Q1. So I’m personally very disappointed about that. It’s on us. It’s on me. And we feel we we have the corrective actions in place. But, you know, our focus is really on the mix of the three segments. Clearly, a huge focus on enterprise AI, as I said in my remarks, 40% year over year orders growth.

We have a great platform. There, we drive additional services. Particular on the maintenance and the the GreenLake subscription. On that, and then the balance on sovereign between. Generative AI and supercomputing, which is very good for us, and then in the service provider where it makes sense, and so for me, is is is that’s the approach. Again, in Q1, we had this unique set of situations that we know we’re gonna fix. And that’s why at the end of Q4, we’re gonna basically drive to the normalized, what I call, 10% overall server margin in the full

Tim Long: Thank you, Tim. Next question please.

Operator: And your next question today will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Simon Leopold: Thank you very much. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your customer mix and how it how it might be changing. And to be transparent. I’m wondering are you targeting more of the the cloud builders right now and is that affecting some of the the assumptions? So you’re in a more aggressive space, or are we seeing issues where perhaps your federal market, which I assume is very profitable, is is weaker in the mix. So trying to get a little bit of unpacking particularly around compute around what’s going on in the verticals that might be affecting margin. Thank you.

Antonio Neri: Well, thank you, Simon. No. I mean, I don’t think this is new news. But in the service provider model builders, we obviously target those who value the value of our intellectual property. Now, obviously, direct liquid cooling is 100% fanless. Is what we shipped three weeks ago. For the first time and and that takes a lot of work. From the company side, but as well on the manufacturing side. But that’s a market that’s super concentrated. Mean, when you think about it, the mobile builders maybe you can count it with a finger of two hands, maybe less. And then on the service provider, it’s probably fifteen to twenties that make a difference. Right? And that’s why you need to find a balanced approach. I’m particularly targeting the tens of thousands of enterprise customers that now are now adopting a variety of AI models and more agented approaches.

And while the value of the order transaction is much lower, obviously, comes with a complete different margin profile. And what I’m pleased is that we now see the acceleration of that and a significant pipeline. And our channel motion is actually an advantage for us. So you may end up you know, obviously, everybody think about what’s gonna happen with the CapEx deployment in one segment of the market. That may be, you know, slowed down at some point. I don’t know. But right now, it feels solid. And then a growth on the enterprise, which will benefit our mix between the segments. And in between, the serve the sovereign, right, you know, when you think about a sovereign, when it comes down to supercomputers, I think we win three out of four. Very easily.

And then on top of that, you add now this generative AI and, you know, like, universities of Bristol or Japan ASC, or many others that are coming through the pipeline, and that’s where we find the balance for the server business. And in the meantime, drive the refresh in the traditional compute you know, which has been very solid. In fact, we had again double digit year over year orders Ralph? And all ultimately now with Gen 12, we have another great platform transition the installed base. Lower cost

Marie Myers: Four

Antonio Neri: with more sustainability with 65% energy reduction. Thank you, Simon. Next question please.

Operator: Your next question today will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess Antonio, Marie, if I look at the fiscal 2025 guide that you folks are giving out right now, it implies that you know, revenue growth will be close to double digits, nine and a half, ten percent in the back half of the year. At the same time, I think you’re implying about a dollar EPS in the back half. So that would I think, mathematically, get to about a 250 basis points step up in operating margins in H2 versus the Q2 levels. Can you spend some time on what’s giving you the confidence that a, revenues will actually snap up this way, and then b, if the revenues are really gonna snap up with AI servers, how do you get that sort of operating margin expansion in the back half of the year?

Marie Myers: Yeah. So good afternoon. Let me take that one there. I mean, it’s so first of all, on terms of the back half, you’re correct. We are very weighted in terms of both revenue and profitability in the back half, and it’s not that dissimilar to fiscal 2024. Couple of things to bear in mind, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do see the timing of AI systems sort of moving into the back half as well. So that will drive some of the revenue to point you you just raised. And then secondly, I would say this in terms as you think about profitability. And the fact that I think we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect our server business to exit a year in around about the 10% range as well. The factors underpinning that are obviously three sort of critical areas.

One, the actions that Antonio referred to around server execution, you’ll see those impacts. Obviously, they cross in Q2, and they will continue to flow through the P&L in Q3 and Q4. Secondly, we would have had time to mitigate tariffs, so that’s another contributor as well. And then third, we will see the impact of the cost efficiency program. So it’s really those three drivers that will sort of influence profitability. And then finally, like I said, just reiterating, just the timing of AI systems, which really know, those deals as we’ve said in the past are very lumpy, and they sort of obviously can drive a a a sort of different seasonality in terms of your quarterly revenue. So bear all that in mind when you think about the guide, but essentially Q4 is really going to account for a higher percentage of our full year earnings compared to what you’ve seen in terms of some of our recent years.

Antonio Neri: I will add only one more thing to what Marie said. It’s the fact that our network business, will continue its recovery. Right? Again, we talk about three consecutive quarters of sequential growth. Supported by now double digits. Double digits orders growth. On a year over year basis. So this was the last quarter, technically. That we lapped the higher compares and then from here on, right, we expect it to be in the mid single digits revenue growth for the balance of the year. So that’s why, you know and that obviously comes with the completely different profile. And as you know, in Q1, we delivered 27% operative margins. And and and that’s a big opportunity for us. And that’s why we are also committed to the Juniper deal because the combination of two will accelerate the profit recovery later when the deal close you know, in the back in the back of probably Q4, and then, obviously, in 2026.

Paul Glaser: Thank you for the question, Amit.

Operator: And your next question today will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Antonio,

Antonio Neri: you’re talking about the mitigation efforts that you’re doing in relation to the tariffs. I was curious how should I think about the sort of focus relative to supply chain flexibility versus pricing to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Which one is sort of the bigger focus you are going into the back half? And particularly when it comes to pricing, how are you thinking about sort of the level of conference and taking pricing, particularly when you’re mentioning certain markets where discounting is more aggressive than you thought and how should we think about those sort of level of visibility or confidence into getting those pricing actions done without really impacting demand? Thank you. Yeah. So first of all, we have a a very holistic and global supply chain, which allows us to mitigate some of the impact of the tariffs.

We build products around the globe close to the customer. Because, obviously, we need to be close to them to meet the turnaround times that they require. But we’re able to shift productions from one side to the other side. Because of our flexibility that we have. Separately, you know, on the on the pricing side, no question. We will, you know, adjust pricing accordingly. While we continue to drive the working capital down. Per the comments Marie made, and therefore create more flexibility in our pricing as we manage discounting more tightly. What I don’t know and, you know, this is best guess for everyone. What the overall tariffs increases and how that materialize in the end in the market will do to demand you know, maybe in the second half of the year.

But we are confident in our revenue guide. That we provided, which I think one of your colleagues spot on, you know, the nine and a half at the midpoint which is very high for us, right, in the very, very high single digit perhaps even double digits. And and we feel good about that. It could impact maybe some aspects, but overall, that range is very comfortable for us. This point in time.

Paul Glaser: Thank you, Samik. Next question, please.

Operator: And your next question today will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Marie, I thought I heard you say on the call the cost structure restructuring savings or in addition to the Juniper savings, so does that mean I I couldn’t hear you clearly, but does that mean the savings that you’re announcing today

David Vogt: impact more of the server storage side of the business? And not Aruba and Intelligent Edge. Just trying to get a sense for how that layers in over the next couple of years. And if that’s the case, is the four twenty five or four fifty that you mentioned regarding Juniper all from the Juniper side of the from the transaction if it closes? Thanks. Yes, David. Hey. Good afternoon. It’s Marie. So just to clarify,

Marie Myers: yes. So first of all, the Juniper at least four fifty, is completely tied to Juniper as a standalone. And then in terms of the $350 million of gross annual run rate savings that we announced today, that actually ties to our current organization, our current company. So as I mentioned, you know, we expect to, you know, achieve these numbers over the course of twenty five and twenty six, and this is really much more focused around what I would describe as cost efficiency. And I think we mentioned in terms of eliminating around about 2,500 jobs inside the company as it is today. So think about them as sort of two separate initiatives and two separate plans.

Antonio Neri: You know, I I mean, this is very simple. We have the plan to close the transaction. At the end of Q1. It is very disappointed that, the DOJ decide to file a lawsuit. But if we had the plan also to announce we felt was the opportunity to go forward to take incremental cost out. If you take the two programs together, it’s at least $800 million. But we have not closed the Juniper transaction. Therefore, we have to wait for that. And we are committed to deliver at least $450 million once the transaction closes. In the meantime, we are moving forward with the $350 million that Marie talked about it. And, and that’s why, you know, I think it’s the right time to do so. Also, in the context what the market is expecting and what happening with tariff and the like.

And also what happened to us in Q1, which we feel confident we will address. But think about the whole thing. It can be sizable. But in the meantime, we’re addressing the stand alone because that’s who we are.

Paul Glaser: Very good. Thank you, David. Next question, please.

Operator: And your next question today will come from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs.

Mike Ng: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. Tony, I just wanted to ask about the the AI systems orders momentum throughout

Antonio Neri: the quarter. You know, the $1.6 billion implies a little bit of a slowdown in December and January after

Mike Ng: the $1 billion plus order in November. You know, has the demand environment for AI systems changed? You know, what have you seen during the quarter? And then

Marie Myers: you know, in in a couple months since. And if if I could just ask Maria a quick follow-up on free cash flow. Anything other than the $250 million of cash restructuring, restructuring that impacts the the outlook, I just wanted to see if there was anything unusual there. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Michael. I think you’re correct. I mean, obviously, we we were we started strong the quarter. And then obviously vacations and the like. But remember, this is a lumpy business. Right? You may have strong spurs of demand you know, happening one month and then perhaps not so much the next month. On aggregate, right, when you think about it, we we booked, $8.3 billion that was up double digits, and we’ve doubled it. Quarter over quarter.

I think that’s the message. Right? So our AI systems net orders in the quarter were twice as big as the Q4. That said, you know, what I’m particularly proud is the fact that the AI enterprise is strong. And that to me is a testament on our customers are deploying the solutions, particularly in inferencing. And the inferencing is where all the value gets realized. And the pipeline remains some multiples. On every segment of the AI, whether it’s sovereign, enterprise AI, or model builders and service providers.

Marie Myers: And just to clarify on the cash flow, the number four actually, for twenty five, the four hundred million, two hundred and fifty, which comes from the cost efficiency program that we just announced, and we also have some carryover from prior period restructuring programs. So that’s what gets you to four hundred in terms of the cash flow that I did earlier.

Paul Glaser: Thank you, Mike. Next question please.

Operator: And your next question today will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Matt Niknam: Hey, thanks so much for squeezing me in. I’m wondering, has the macro backdrop in and specifically around tariff uncertainty, has that had any impact on customer purchasing or demand to date and just in a similar vein, are you baking in any incremental softness from US Fed as a result of some of the DOJ initiatives? You.

Antonio Neri: Yeah. Thank you. No. So far, no. In fact, as we we we we said in our prepared remarks, we have double digits order growth. In all our business units. That’s true for networking. That was true for servers. That was true for AI systems. That was true for storage. It was actually triple digits. And now the electric grid represent more than 50% of the mix. So demand was very, very strong. We don’t see yet the full impact of the tariffs in the market. I think case will take another month or two. On the federal side, it depends on which agency you’re working with. So far, not a significant slowdown, but remember, the HP company provide core. CoreTech Infrastructure. For the Department of Defense and Department of Energy and many agencies that that that provide national security of sorts. And therefore, you know, that has not in c? But we’ll see what happen next. Hard to predict at this point in time. K. Thank you, Matt.

Paul Glaser: We are ready for our last question.

Operator: And your last question today will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.

Ananda Baruah: Hey. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon. And, Tony, just a quick question on getting the I server mix. As you guys are thinking about it. For for fiscal twenty five. And I guess, really, what I’m what I’m what I’m interested in is any context on how much of what you’re looking at in the in the backlog pipeline. Would go into GreenLake, versus the revenues in the traditional sales set and then any any sense of how your mix might change from, SPs and and model builders relative to enterprise and sovereigns. And that’s it for me. Thanks.

Antonio Neri: Yeah. Thank you. You know, when I think about enterprise AI, there is a big component that goes through the GreenLake because it is a subscription of the software to the GreenLake platform. All that software that we coengineer with NVIDIA. So that’s what we call NVIDIA Computing by HPE. It’s actually a subscription into the GreenLake platform with a CapEx on the infrastructure attached to it. Think about it that way. While the growth is very nice, and you saw the 40% growth in orders, it actually takes time to see it. Right? And now remember, we have now $2 billion plus in AIR that you will be adding to it as we grow that installed base. But on the service providers, or the model builders, have been in at least in the last couple of quarters, all CapEx purchases.

And, therefore, there is no GreenLake flex offer associated at this point in time with that one. So that’s why it’s more CapEx on one. Over time, you have a CapEx plus a subscription on the other one.

Ananda Baruah: Okay.

Antonio Neri: Well, I think we are at the end of the the the call. Thank you for joining the call. Again, I will leave you with this. Number one, is we delivered a solid quarter. But we could have executed better. I’m really proud of the demand we’ve seen that tells me the innovation and the strategy is right. But, ultimately, we could have executed better in the server operating margin side where a couple of things were under our control, and, obviously, we are committed to go fix that. Confident to return to the normalized EPS by Q4 and the 10% server margin at the exit Q4. And then, you know, we took aggressive action on incremental cost that we can take out now. And, also, we factor the tariff impact now. So you have one complete view of what fiscal year 2025 looks like.

And last but not least, we are totally committed to the Juniper deal. We believe we have a very strong case and we expect to close that transaction in the second half of 2025. And the good news, at least, there is a trial date now set for July 9th. And we believe we have a compelling case to to get the favorable ruling. Thank you for your time today, and hope to talk to you.",https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/23150312/HPE-insidermonkey-1695495790609.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 22:02:48.464923

But on Tuesday Qualcomm announced that it planned to keep its chip design and manufacturing operations together, concluding that its current structure puts it in the best position to make profitable products in the long term.
The year-on-year revenue decline accelerated to 18 percent for the three months to Sept. 27, although the drop in net profit slowed slightly, to 44 percent, Qualcomm reported on Nov. 4.

But in July the company reported lackluster results for the three months to June 28, with a 14 percent year-on-year decline in revenue and 47 percent drop in net profit.

CEO Steve Mollenkopf said then that he planned on “right-sizing” the company’s cost structure — a phrase that turned out to mean laying off more than one employee in seven. He also engaged external advisors to review the company’s corporate structure and look at whether splitting the company up would increase its value.

But on Tuesday Qualcomm announced that it planned to keep its chip design and manufacturing operations together, concluding that its current structure puts it in the best position to make profitable products in the long term.

Mollenkopf faces a tough time turning that existing corporate structure around, as revenue and profit have continued to fall since he began the review. The year-on-year revenue decline accelerated to 18 percent for the three months to Sept. 27, although the drop in net profit slowed slightly, to 44 percent, Qualcomm reported on Nov. 4.

Looking ahead to the next quarter, Qualcomm warns that the revenue decline could accelerate further, with a year-on-year drop of between 15 percent and 27 percent, although it expects the fall in profit to slow to 23 percent or less, thanks in part to its cost-cutting program.

Qualcomm’s rejection of a corporate split comes after Hewlett-Packard agreed to break up Dave and Bill’s legacy, splitting a few weeks ago into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. The day that breakup happened, shareholders did see an increase in value, with the 1.6 percent drop in HPE’s share price more than offset by the 13 percent jump in that of HP, defying the conventional wisdom that PCs and printers are on the way out.

Qualcomm, though, defended its existing structure on Tuesday, saying that it benefits twice from its in-house research and development operations, which create new technologies it can license as well as allowing it to improve the products it sells.

The components for smartphones and for the Internet of Things that Qualcomm designs are licensed to other companies for incorporation in their own chipsets. That business model is common in the chip industry — Qualcomm licenses the processor cores it uses in its designs from ARM, which does not make chips itself.

Qualcomm, though, does makes its own chips, competing with some of its customers. That approach allows it to push its own technologies in the smartphone industry, encouraging other chipmakers to adopt and license them, it said.

In its latest earnings report, the firm said that its revenue climbed 16 per cent from last year, however, CEO Antonio Neri stated that their performance could have been better. The executive said that the firm had an abundance of AI servers in stock as it was shifting to the newer models which use Nvidia’s latest chips, while its traditional servers were sold at discounted prices, in turn, impacting profits.

The firm deals in manufacturing equipment for data centers such as servers that store and manage huge amounts of data. Disappointed with its outlook, investors expressed their dismay and the stock price of the firm plunged 19 per cent on Thursday, the report noted. In its outlook, the company said that it expects to make less profits than analysts’ hoped for in 2025.

Higher Costs, Profitability Issues, And More: Hewlett Packard's Obstacles

The report further said that the company is slashing these jobs in hopes of saving money. The layoffs are expected to impact nearly 5 per cent of the overall workforce. As of October 2024, the company employed 61,000 individuals.

It further intends to lower expenses by $350 million by 2027. Additionally, other problems such as reducing prices for its older products impacting profitability and a legal tussle with the US government have made things harder for the company.

Although concerns of price hikes are high, Trump has introduced an ""affordability czar"" to cut the cost of groceries, cars, and houses.","THE top bosses of retail giants such as Walmart, Target, and Best Buy have warned consumers about potential price hikes in the near future.

Some say the cost of grocery staples and electronics may rise under new tariffs proposed by the Trump administration.

Retail experts are warning that shoppers may see the impacts of President Donald Trump’s trade war on store price tags.

The president implemented a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian imports as well as an additional 10% levy on China, raising trade sanctions on some Chinese products to as high as 45%.

Some fear that the costs will fall on the shoulders of American consumers, raising the prices of produce, electronics, vehicles, toys, and more that are imported to the US.

Top executives of big box chains have spoken out in the wake of Trump's tariff rollout, reaffirming concerns over potential price hikes.

For example, Target CEO Brian Cornell revealed that the cost of fruit and vegetables could skyrocket within days, as the chain receives a high volume of imports from Mexico.

“Those are categories where we’ll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,” he told CNBC.

“If there’s a 25% tariff, those prices will go up.""

Fresh produce such as strawberries, avocados, and bananas may be among the products impacted, the Target CEO said.

Best Buy CEO Corie Barry also warned consumers about potential cost increases under the new tariffs on China and Mexico on a Tuesday earnings call.

She noted that these were Best Buy's top two supply chain sources, sourcing around 55% of its products from China and 20% from Mexico.

“Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex,” said the CEO.

“We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.”

Walmart executives have also sparked fear and uncertainty over potential price hikes.

Roughly two-thirds of the retail giant's products are made in the US, but chief financial officer John David Rainey told CNBC that Walmart was “not going to be completely immune” from the changing trade conditions.

“We’ve lived in a tariff environment for the last seven or eight years, and we’ll do what we know how to do,” he said.

“We’ll work with suppliers. We’ll lean into our private brand. We’ll shift supply where necessary to try to take advantage of lower costs that we can then pass on to consumers.”

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon revoiced the CFO's claims, noting that while the chain ""can't predict what will happen in the future,"" it could manage it ""really well.""

TROUBLE BREWING

However, the President has been faced with a slew of economic challenges.

Ongoing inflation has continued to squeeze consumers' wallets alongside global events and disruptions such as the war in Ukraine.

Bird flu has also been a continuing problem, resulting in an egg crisis alongside shortages of other staple groceries like coffee and chocolate.

The significant job cuts may be painful but are necessary to streamline Adidas’ operations, the CEO said.
Suggesting that Adidas was poised for near double-digit revenue growth this year, the CEO gestured toward the fact that Adidas could potentially continue taking market share away from a still-struggling Nike.","Adidas appears to have eyes on Nike’s market share as the former sees its fortunes in relatively sunny territory while the latter company continues a prolonged effort to enact a major turnaround. Part of Adidas’ plan was to liquidate all of its existing Yeezy stock — the famous 2013 collaboration with rapper Kanye West that eventually turned sour in 2022, as Us Weekly profiled. It also intends to axe about 500 roles at its Herzogenaurach, Germany, headquarters in a bid to streamline operations toward profitability.

According to Retail Dive, Adidas has now sold every single pair of Yeezys it had in inventory, revealing as much during a March 5 earnings report. Yeezy products accounted for around $705 million in revenue and about $216.5 million in profits for the black-and-white brand over the course of 2024. And even though Adidas CFO Harm Ohlmeyer said there is “not one Yeezy shoe left in our inventory,” the loss of Kanye West’s footwear line is expected to cause growth to stall somewhat throughout 2025.

On the other hand, CEO Bjørn Gulden outlined plans to terminate 500 “obsolete” jobs at the Adidas HQ in favor of attempting a localization effort, bringing more local and regional operational blueprints to the fore as opposed to a formerly top-down directorial approach.

“You don’t need rules for everything when you trust people,” Gulden said, suggesting that too much red tape and other bureaucratic business practices are harming the company’s potential. The significant job cuts may be painful but are necessary to streamline Adidas’ operations, the CEO said.

“You don’t win the popularity prize when you do that, right — and you shouldn’t. But it is necessary,” Gulden added.

Adidas Has a ‘Clear Ambition To Be No. 1’ Everywhere Except North America, but Wants Nike’s Spot

Per TipRanks, Adidas signaled intent to take on its largest and most prominent competitor, Nike, by stating a “clear ambition of being No. 1,” during the most recent earnings review.

That sentiment was echoed by Gulden in no uncertain terms. Suggesting that Adidas was poised for near double-digit revenue growth this year, the CEO gestured toward the fact that Adidas could potentially continue taking market share away from a still-struggling Nike.

“You’re all aware that the big competitor is struggling,” Gulden said during the call. “And you’re also aware that the world is very volatile — and a volatile world where the biggest one is struggling is of course an advantage for someone who wants to change their model.”

TipRanks made the case for Adidas’ climbing popularity versus Nike, beginning with the foundation of an expectation of 10% sales growth for Adidas this year. And while that figure is down slightly from 12% last year, it still points toward continued strength for the footwear and athleticwear company. Adidas projects $2 billion in operating profit in 2025, up from $1.4 billion in 2024 — however, even the $2 billion sum falls short of analyst expectations of $2.3 billion.

Nevertheless, Nike’s share of the global sportwear market fell to 14.1% in 2024 against 15.2% in 2023, while Adidas improved its share from 8.2% in 2023 to 8.9% last year, gaining significant ground and closing the gap.

And while Adidas has perhaps conceded that it won’t be the top contender in the segment concerning U.S. sales, it does plan to aggressively pursue expansion into the American market, building up creative centers in Portland and Los Angeles in tune with its new localization strategy.

“We don’t need to be No. 1 in America because that’s an illusion — the competitors are so much stronger — but we can definitely grow and become much, much stronger in the U.S. than we have historically been,” Gulden said.",https://retailwire.com/wp-content/uploads/Adidas-Launches-Large-Scale-Bribery-Probe-in-China.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 21:00:19.544671

Brian Niccol, the new leader of the company, urged his employees to be more accountable and take ownership of decisions amid mass layoffs.

The CEO said in an internal memo: ""We’re not effective on how things get to the store, and we’re not effective in making decisions and then holding each other accountable to those decisions.

""This is why we had to make the changes that we had to make.

""We gotta untangle a few things right now. But you know what? It’s all things that we can untangle.""

Starbucks has been working to simplify operations and increase sales, including firing some 1,100 support staff roles and closing hundreds of other unfilled positions.

The company received severe backlash after wait times for coffees blew out to over 40 minutes.

New CEO Brian Niccol joined the chain in September after aiding Chipotle's exponential growth and transformation.

When Niccol stepped into his role, he vowed to reinstate the chain's welcoming coffeehouse charm that made the brand what it is today.

He wrote in an open letter: ""Our stores have always been more than a place to get a drink.

""They’ve been a gathering space, a community center where conversations are sparked, friendships form, and everyone is greeted by a welcoming barista.

""Many of our customers still experience this magic every day, but in some places - especially in the US - we aren’t always delivering,"" he continued.

Niccol blamed factors such as the ""overwhelming"" and ""overly complex"" menu at Starbucks, which features hundreds of items.

The company is in the process of rolling out major changes as part of its ""Back to Starbucks"" initiative, including a 30 per cent cut to the menu.

Although the significant menu reduction has caused quite a stir among fans, the coffee chain shared it has good reason for the cuts.

As part ofStarbucks' goal to bring the chain back to its roots, thecoffee giant plans to reduce its menu by ""roughly 30 per cent in both beverages and food"".

Although the exact menu items being cut have yet to be announced, the news sparked fear among fans that their favorite beverages would be axed.

However, a Starbucks spokesperson told The U.S. Sun that the changes would be positive for coffee fanatics.

""We've been focused on simplifying our menu to position partners for success, improve consistency, drive customer satisfaction and enhance our economics,"" said the spokesperson.

By reducing its menu, Starbucks will be able to focus on ensuring that the products customers ""value most"" are available and of high quality, according to the spokesperson.

Customers will also see new and exciting menu options thanks to the cuts, which will position Starbucks to serve ""better"" menu offerings and ""lead the market with breakthrough beverage and food innovation.""

The company will also rely on its baristas for inspiration, as it did last year with its lineup of lavender beverages last spring.

SIX BIG CHANGES

Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" plan includes several initiatives, such as the expectation for baristas to handwrite patrons' names on to-go cups.

The hand scribbled names and messages, set to replace the printed labels, are intended to bring a personalized touch to Starbucks.

Another of Niccol's goals is to bring back the chain's ""for here"" rule.

Beginning January 27, customers who order a drink “for here” will be served in a coffee mug, glass, or clean personal cup brought from home.

Both of these were common practice before Starbucks became a rather hectic retailer that emphasized mobile orders and automation.

Another of the new policies is free refills for the ""for here"" beverages.

During customers' visits, they can sit and enjoy free refills of hot and iced brewed coffee and tea for their in-store drinks.

Another highly anticipated change was the return of the self-serve condiment bar, including creamer, milk, and a variety of sweeteners.

The Starbucks CEO has also rolled out a new code of conduct, requiring fans to make a purchase to use the restrooms and hang out in the cafes and patios.

This comes seven years after the chain instituted its open-door rule.

The policy reversal is intended to reduce crowds, freeing up tables for paying customers seeking a calm environment and a bathroom not constantly occupied.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/starbucks.jpg?1738134106&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-08 08:02:10.907580

Like Walmart, Best Buy (BBY+4.06%) is learning from the competition by taking a page out of Amazon’s playbook.

Best Buy plans to launch a new U.S.-based marketplace later this year, CEO Corie Barry said during the company’s March 4 earnings call. The move aims to expand the company’s “profitability stream opportunities,” she added.

[Continue reading below] The new marketplace will allow external sellers to list products on Best Buy’s platform, expanding the retailer’s online inventory without “needing to own the inventory,” Barry explained.

The strategy mirrors the approach both Amazon (AMZN-3.68%) and Walmart (WMT-1.40%) have taken, where third-party sellers drive traffic and create valuable advertising revenue opportunities.

Barry sees this as a key step in Best Buy’s growth, emphasizing that the company’s “trusted” position in consumer electronics gives it a strong foundation to build a competitive and differentiated marketplace. The platform will offer customers a wider selection of products and new categories.

Best Buy is taking lessons learned from its Canadian operations, where a similar marketplace has been running since 2016. But there are some key differences in the U.S. version. In Canada, items purchased through the marketplace must be returned by mail, but the U.S. platform will allow returns at physical stores. Mirakl, the tech company that powers Best Buy’s Canadian marketplace, will also support the U.S. version.

The U.S. marketplace will focus more on new products, rather than refurbished items Best Buy already sells on its site. Additionally, Best Buy plans to offer multiple versions of the same product, giving customers more options. Over time, a fulfillment service will be added for sellers, another strategy pulled from Amazon and Walmart’s playbooks.

Despite concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs, Best Buy is moving forward with its growth strategy and boasts nearly 100 million loyalty program members. While Amazon may be struggling with physical retail, its delivery infrastructure is unmatched. In 2024, it delivered over 9 billion items the same day or the next-day.

However, Best Buy is among the companies warning tariffs will likely force it to raise prices. Although it imports only 2% to 3% of its products directly, vendors are likely to pass the increased costs onto retailers, “making price hikes for American consumers highly likely,” Barry said.

“At the end of the day, consumers will see impacts across many of the things they’re buying,” she added.

Barry also warned that if the 10% tariffs on China remain in place for one year, it could negatively impact the company’s comparable sales by about a percentage point.",https://southfloridareporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BestBuy.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 04:00:39.055643

HPE expects its second-quarter revenue to be between $7.2 billion and $7.6 billion. According to Reuters, analysts had expected Q2 FY25 revenue of $7.93 billion. Its profit forecast also fell short of expectations.

HPE CEO Antonio Neri said the company plans to adjust product prices and leverage its global supply chain to minimize the impact of imposed and potential tariffs. During a post-earnings call with analysts, Neri assured that HPE's forecast accounts for the estimated effects of US tariff policies.",https://media.assettype.com/outlookbusiness/2024-12-10/yu29qp8p/Web-Images-28.jpg?w=1200&amp;ar=40%3A21&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true&amp;mode=crop&amp;enlarge=true&amp;overlay=false&amp;overlay_position=bottom&amp;overlay_width=100,N,,2025-03-08 03:01:15.768465

These healthcare giants, especially CVS and UHG, continue to show the benefits of their strategies to become full-stack healthcare platforms. All four payers reported some degree of intercompany eliminations, an accounting process to ensure revenues are not double counted, enabling them to keep a higher share of the premium dollars within the parent company. UHG reported $151 billion in intercompany eliminations, more than half of what Optum, UHG’s non-insurance arm, reported in consolidated revenues. Despite the high revenues, payers were not immune to industry headwinds. All four grew their consolidated revenue last year, but all reported higher medical cost ratios and lower operating margins in 2024 compared with 2023, an outcome largely attributed to higher utilization among MA beneficiaries. Ancillary business lines are bolstering bottom-line numbers for each of the payers, but persisting uncertainty around potential health insurance reform could hamper their growth.

The lower profitability is due largely to issues in HPE’s closely watched server unit, chief executive officer Antonio Neri said.
Discounting during sales, higher-than-realised costs and a buildup of older-generation semiconductors will dent profit in the coming quarters, he said.
The issues in the server unit leading to lower profits were present in both traditional and AI equipment, Neri said.
The weak outlook suggests problems at the company may go beyond tariffs and weak margins on AI systems, wrote Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.","SHARES of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) fell the most since 2020 after it said profit in the coming year would be hurt by tariffs, weak margins on server sales and execution issues. The company also said it would eliminate about 3,000 jobs.

Earnings, excluding some items, will be US$1.70 to US$1.90 per share in the fiscal year ending in October 2025, HPE said on Thursday (Mar 6). Analysts, on average, estimated US$2.12 a share.

HPE’s stock dropped as much as 16 per cent after markets opened in New York on Friday, its biggest intraday decline since March 2020. The shares closed on Thursday at US$17.96, down 16 per cent so far this year.

The lower profitability is due largely to issues in HPE’s closely watched server unit, chief executive officer Antonio Neri said. Discounting during sales, higher-than-realised costs and a buildup of older-generation semiconductors will dent profit in the coming quarters, he said. Tariffs will also weigh on the profitability outlook.

The company is working through these problems, which included “execution performance”, Neri said. Part of that will be a reduction of about 3,000 roles – 2,500 of which will come through job cuts and the rest through attrition, he said. HPE employed 61,000 people as at the end of October. The workforce reduction will cost HPE about US$350 million over the next two years, the company said, although it estimates annual savings of the same amount by fiscal 2027.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has fuelled a wave of demand for powerful servers from hardware makers such as HPE, Dell Technologies, and Super Micro Computer. Still, this business line has been a double-edged sword due to lower margins because of the need to fill those servers with expensive AI chips from Nvidia and others.

The issues in the server unit leading to lower profits were present in both traditional and AI equipment, Neri said.

The weak outlook suggests problems at the company may go beyond tariffs and weak margins on AI systems, wrote Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The company’s cost actions, including job cuts, suggest meaningful inefficiencies.”

Tariffs also weighed on the profit guidance issued last week by computer and printer maker HP, which said it would cut as many as 2,000 jobs.

In the fiscal first quarter, which ended Jan 31, HPE’s AI Systems revenue was about US$900 million, down from US$1.5 billion in the previous quarter, the company said in a presentation. Quarterly orders of these systems surged to US$1.6 billion. Neri said there was a jump in orders by enterprises, a customer category generally expected by analysts to provide higher margins.

HPE reported total quarterly sales increased 16 per cent to US$7.85 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated US$7.81 billion. Server revenue was US$4.3 billion, also just ahead of estimates.

In the current quarter ending in April, sales will be US$7.2 billion to US$7.6 billion, compared with an average projection of US$7.94 billion.

Adjusted gross margins in the quarter slipped nearly seven percentage points from the prior year to 29.4 per cent, short of the 31.3 per cent anticipated by analysts. Profit, excluding some items, was 49 US cents per share, just shy of estimates.

Last month, the US Justice Department sued to block HPE’s US$14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks, arguing the tie-up would harm competition in the market for enterprise wireless equipment.

Neri said the company remains “very committed” to the transaction and expects to close the deal by the end of the fiscal year. A trial date for the antitrust lawsuit has been set for July, HPE said. BLOOMBERG",,N,,2025-03-07 19:58:37.440237

What We Thought of Costco Wholesale’s Earnings

We plan to raise our fair value estimate for Costco Wholesale COST by a high-single-digit percentage after the warehouse club behemoth posted strong fiscal 2025 second-quarter results.

The increase stems from a couple of key factors. First, we expect to raise our forecast for companywide comparable sales growth in fiscal 2025 to about 7% from 6%. Second, we plan to bring our operating margin forecast closer to 5% by 2034 (the end of our explicit forecast period), up from our current 4.5% estimate, as the firm’s relative scale advantage should translate into a gross margin benefit over time.

Despite our favorable view of Costco’s competitive position and the planned uptick to our fair value, shares look very overvalued, trading at about 55 times our estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings. We surmise that the market is extrapolating Costco’s growth trajectory over the previous five years (companywide comparable sales growth averaged 9% in 2020-24) well into the future. In contrast, we expect comp growth to settle into a mid-single-digit trajectory in the long term as its stout presence in the United States and Canada matures.

Companywide comparable sales expanded 9% (excluding gas and currency impacts), underpinned by about 6% growth in customer traffic and a 3% gain in average ticket. Internationally, sales grew by 10.0%, while comparable sales in the US expanded 8.6%. Notably, domestic growth comfortably outpaced the results from competing retailers under our coverage.

Costco’s enviable top-line trajectory reinforces its wide moat rating, as shoppers increasingly gravitate to the firm’s attractive price points and compelling treasure hunt experience. An operating margin of 3.6% expanded by 10 basis points, primarily due to a modest improvement in gross margin and favorable operating leverage.",https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/y4Cm9hU7a140sl0ZuYdKlJUvMeo=/1800x1013/smart/filters:no_upscale()/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/JCKNLFDONNBPJIGZDEMQKIJTF4.png,N,,2025-03-07 21:59:28.610156

The deal, with a transaction valued at 23.7 billion dollars, will ultimately take WBA private, removing the company’s listing from the Nasdaq Stock Market.
If approved, WBA shareholders are to receive a total consideration of 11.45 dollars per share in cash at the closing of the transaction, expected to come in the fourth quarter of 2025.
WBA will continue to operate under Walgreens, Boots and its portfolio of consumer brands, while further retaining its Chicago headquarters.
Wentworth continued: “While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company.","Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the parent company of British pharmaceutical chain Boots, has come to a definitive agreement to be acquired by a subsidiary associated with private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The deal, with a transaction valued at 23.7 billion dollars, will ultimately take WBA private, removing the company’s listing from the Nasdaq Stock Market.

The agreement was unanimously approved by WBA’s board of directors, however, its shareholders will also be called on to vote on the matter. Other customary closing conditions will also apply. If approved, WBA shareholders are to receive a total consideration of 11.45 dollars per share in cash at the closing of the transaction, expected to come in the fourth quarter of 2025.

With the deal, however, WBA has now entered into a 35-day ‘go-shop’ period, allowing for the company to receive, evaluate and enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals. WBA noted that there was no assurance that a superior proposal will be forthcoming, and it does not intend to disclose developments in this respect.

In a release, WBA’s chief executive officer, Tim Wentworth, said the agreement aligned with the company’s efforts to deliver “more effective, convenient and affordable” healthcare as “we navigate the challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape”. It all comes as part of an ongoing turnaround strategy at WBA, ongoing since 2023 and introduced as a means to create value for customers and shareholders.

Sycamore to aid in WBA’s ongoing turnaround strategy

This had at first seemed to take shape in a potential sale of Boots, which had already undergone a retail overhaul and a shelved IPO plan, yet whose ownership proceedings had remained largely under wraps. Various media reports towards the end of 2024 had suggested that Sycamore was among the leading interested parties eyeing the beauty and healthcare giant.

Now, with WBA as a whole to possibly come under its wing, Sycamore, which has previously invested in brands like Ann Taylor, Loft and Express, can put to use its expertise in initiating turnaround strategies to help better position the firm in the retail and health market. WBA will continue to operate under Walgreens, Boots and its portfolio of consumer brands, while further retaining its Chicago headquarters.

Wentworth continued: “While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company. Sycamore will provide us with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds. The WBA Board considered all these factors in evaluating this transaction, and we believe this agreement provides shareholders premium cash value, with the ability to benefit from additional value creation going forward from monetisation of the VillageMD businesses.”",https://r.fashionunited.com/xok1wlVgvktt-p6rMWh8KASTgll5hF4D-stMgCHJ6S4/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjUvMDMvMDcvYm9vdHMtc3RvcmUtZnJvbnQtNnpkYWZ5dmotMjAyNC0wMS0yNC0zcnJuaWpiaC0yMDI0LTAzLTAxLWpscHRsY3U3LTIwMjUtMDMtMDcuanBlZw.jpeg,N,,2025-03-08 05:01:19.783619

Buy, sell, or hold Nu Holdings stock?
Investors shouldn't sell their stakes right now, but don't go backing up the truck and load up on a bunch of Nu Holdings stock at these prices.","Expectations tend to play an outsized role when it comes to quarterly earnings. And missed expectations are likely what affected Nu Holdings' (NU -0.42%) stock price after its Q4 release.

The financial technology (fintech) company operating as a neobank in Latin America posted strong Q4 revenue growth (again) but saw shares fall due to the high expectations Wall Street developed going into the report. As of this writing, share prices are down 32% from all-time highs set in mid-November 2024 and down 22% since the report's Feb. 20 release. That drop comes even though Nu is expanding rapidly in its home market of Brazil along with other large Latin American countries such as Mexico and Colombia (Nu Holdings now has over 114 million customers using its digital banking platform).

Given the missed expectations over the latest earnings report, some investors looking into the stock have to be asking: Is Nu Holdings stock a buy, sell, or hold right now? Let's take a closer look at the Latin American fintech giant to see if an answer presents itself.

More fast growth in Brazil

Nu Bank (its customer-facing name) has become a mainstay in Brazil. It has around 100 million customers in this market alone, or more than half the country's adult population. Despite its huge market share, its financials continue to compound at an aggressive pace. Deposits in the country now sit at $23.1 billion (calculated in U.S. dollars), growing 11% year over year.

As Nu Bank builds out its relationship with existing customers, it is able to offer more and more products for them. In turn, this leads to more revenue growth. Revenue in Brazil hit $9.5 billion in 2024 and has grown at a 79% annual rate since 2018. Customers can now invest, get personal loans, obtain insurance policies, and open credit cards through the Nu Bank platform. Nu Bank has become a key personal finance tool in Brazil and keeps growing its relationship with the population.

Through more scale, Nu Bank has been able to grow its earnings at a rapid pace. In 2022, Nu Holdings posted negative net income. In 2024, net income was just under $2 billion. As the business achieves more operating leverage (especially in new markets outside Brazil), we should see earnings grow even faster than overall revenue. Not a bad place to be as a business.

Emerging expansions into Mexico and Colombia

Likely due to Mexico and Colombia's large market size, Nu Bank decided to expand there first after establishing itself in Brazil. Argentina was most likely left off the list due to its hyperinflation concerns, even though it is a larger market. As of Q4 2024, Mexico surpassed 10 million customers, and Colombia passed 2.5 million customers. While much smaller than the Brazilian segment, these countries are growing quickly for Nu Bank and have a long runway to reinvest and acquire new digital customers.

Revenue is exploding higher in the Mexican segment, essentially going from $0 to $650 million annually in less than five years -- an impressive feat that proves the Nu Bank platform can succeed outside of the Brazil market. Colombia is much smaller at $161 million in annual revenue.

Combined, these two countries are not relevant to Nu Holdings consolidated financials today. What investors should focus on is not how these two countries impact the business in 2024, but how they will affect the business by 2030. Nu Holdings showed how successful its fintech playbook works in Brazil, which supports the assumption it will work in these two countries as well. Investors should also expect Nu Holdings to launch in more Latin and South American markets.

Buy, sell, or hold Nu Holdings stock?

Nu Holdings generated $2 billion in net earnings in 2024. As of this writing, the stock trades at a market cap of $50 billion, resulting in a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 25. This might look cheap when compared to the S&P 500 average P/E of 29, especially considering how fast Nu Holdings is growing its revenue. But financial stocks and banks rarely trade at this high a ratio. P/Es in the financial sector usually hover around the 10-15 range. A lot of Nu Holdings earnings are from lending. Making loans is cyclical, and earnings can fall if the markets it operates in fall into a recession.

Given the information presented above, I can see merit in arguments that Nu Holdings is a screaming buy, but I can also see why some suggest it is an easy sell. For that reason, I think the stock is a simple hold for investors today. Investors shouldn't sell their stakes right now, but don't go backing up the truck and load up on a bunch of Nu Holdings stock at these prices. It doesn't come without some level of risk, especially given the uncertainties in the economy at the moment.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:40:46.086268

ID37,UPS,2025-03-07 19:09:14+00:00,Supply Chain Dive,"UPS rolls out fuel surcharge hikes, processing fee changes",,,,,,https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/ups-fuel-surcharge-processing-fee-increases/741921/,"UPS is increasing its fuel surcharge calculations and changing some other fees, the carrier announced on its website.
Those averages determine the surcharge rate for fuel on ground and air services.
The increase builds upon the frequent fuel surcharge hikes UPS, along with FedEx, levied in 2024.
""Fuel surcharge increases impact every customer differently,"" Kenneth Moyer, partner and VP of supply chain strategies at LJM Group, said in an email to Supply Chain Dive.
The late payment fee will jump from 8% to 9.9% of the total past due invoice balance.","UPS is increasing its fuel surcharge calculations and changing some other fees, the carrier announced on its website. Experts warn the moves will put further pressure on shippers' delivery costs.

On Monday, the company will bump up its fuel surcharge calculations by 50 basis points for its ground, air and SurePost services in the U.S.

UPS adjusts its index-based fuel surcharges weekly based on the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s average on-highway diesel fuel price and the U.S. Gulf Coast jet fuel price average. Those averages determine the surcharge rate for fuel on ground and air services. Rival FedEx handles fuel surcharges the same way.

As an example of the increase's impact, if the diesel fuel index's price per gallon is $3.20, a UPS Ground or SurePost shipment will see a 17.75% markup rather than a 17.25% fee under previous calculations.

The increase builds upon the frequent fuel surcharge hikes UPS, along with FedEx, levied in 2024. Those adjustments drove the average net fuel cost for ground parcel shipments up 4.7% from Q3 to Q4, even with a decline in on-highway diesel prices, according to the TD Cowen/AFS Freight Index.

""Fuel surcharge increases impact every customer differently,"" Kenneth Moyer, partner and VP of supply chain strategies at LJM Group, said in an email to Supply Chain Dive. ""Keeping track of what it means for your business allows you to implement mitigating strategies like consolidating shipments and optimizing package dimensions and weight.""

More fee changes from UPS are coming on March 31 ""to modernize invoices and payment options for customers,"" according to the carrier's website. Those adjustments are:

A $5 fee for each printed UPS invoice copy sent to shippers or other payors.

A $25 charge per payment made by check or wire transfer. The fee won't apply to Automated Clearing House payments.

The late payment fee will jump from 8% to 9.9% of the total past due invoice balance.

UPS also plans to end its 2% surcharge for invoices paid by credit card on May 18. In its place, the company will add a 2% payment processing fee for each invoice.

Shippers should automate payments so late fees don't pile up and switch to e-invoicing and Automated Clearing House payments to avoid added charges, said Bridget Colmenares, Transportation Insight's senior director of strategic sales, on LinkedIn.

The wave of surcharge changes come amid a highly competitive parcel delivery market that is still battling soft demand. UPS and FedEx are attempting to increase their per-package revenues with added fees while attracting customers with discounted base rates.

""One reason UPS may have earmarked these payment fees for increase versus shipping rates is the blind-spot they generally inhabit for most shippers when comparing carriers,"" LJM Group's Moyer said. ""Shippers understandably tend to focus primarily on shipping charges and generally don’t give these ancillary fees the attention they may merit.""

While FedEx hasn't announced similar fee adjustments yet, Moyer said he wouldn't be surprised if it happens in the near future.

""Because UPS announced these changes first, it gives FedEx the political cover they need to be able to match it while citing UPS as the impetus for the change,"" he said.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:42:38.766986

Rodney McMullen, a Kroger vet who started as store clerk in 1978, resigned after “a board investigation of his personal conduct” found his actions didn’t align with the company’s business ethics policy, the company said. Kroger noted his actions didn’t involve other Kroger employees. McMullen lost over $11 million in unvested stock and options as a result, per the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Kroger’s would-be business partner Albertsons, too, announced its CEO’s departure on the same day as McMullen’s resignation. Vivek Sankaran, the chain’s leader since 2019, will leave on May 1 as part of a planned retirement, after which COO Susan Morris will assume his role. The executive moves come after the grocery chains’ ill-fated attempt to merge, which ended in termination, and ultimately a lawsuit, last year.

Kroger appointed lead director Ronald Sargent as its interim CEO as it searches for McMullen’s replacement. Days after the announcement, Sargent, alongside interim CFO Todd Foley, led the company’s fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings.

The call didn’t shed additional light on the circumstances surrounding McMullen’s resignation, and Sargent noted it’s considering internal and external candidates for the role. Sargent said Kroger’s board “updates our specs for CEO every year,” due to the changing nature of the grocery business.

During the call, Foley told investors he anticipates inflation of 1.5%–2.5% this year, not including the impact of tariffs, which he downplayed. Tariffs will likely hit its fresh product business, but not take a notable toll, though its merchandising team has been “proactive” in sourcing goods from countries affected by the tariffs.

As Kroger looks for further “margin enhancement initiatives” its Our Brands private selection has been a highlight, with 90% of customers buying these products last year. It launched 900 products last year, and growth outpaced national brands, Foley said, as “all customer cohorts are looking for value.” The company has been conducting “category deep-dives” to identify opportunities for additional innovation, finding areas of “substitutability or replaceability relative to national brands,” he said.

The company, which notched 2.4% sales growth in Q4, forecasted 2% to 3% sales growth for full year 2025.",,N,,2025-03-07 15:56:33.077816

Companies with strong female representation in executive roles and boardrooms have consistently outperformed predominantly male-led ones in terms of revenue growth, innovation and shareholder value.

The role of women in leadership has grown significantly over the years despite the challenges in achieving gender parity in corporate leadership. In the United States, women account for approximately 8.2% of CEO roles within S&P 500 companies. Similarly, women represent about 10.4% of leadership positions in Fortune 500 companies, with a record 52 female CEOs leading businesses on the list.

While betting on an individual company is certainly a good option, investors can also play this space with lower risk and higher diversification benefits in a basket form. Currently, there are a few ETFs like SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF SHE, Impact Shares YWCA Women’s Empowerment ETF WOMN, Hypatia Women CEO ETF WCEO, Fidelity Women's Leadership ETF FDWM and BNY Mellon Women's Opportunities ETF BKWO that offer broad exposure to women-led companies.

Multiple studies highlight the economic benefits of gender diversity in the corporate world. According to a McKinsey & Company report, companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to achieve above-average profitability compared to those in the bottom quartile. Research from MSCI shows that firms with at least three women on the board experienced a 10% higher return on equity than those with all-male boards. This suggests that gender-diverse leadership teams may be more effective in driving company growth and shareholder value.

The presence of female leaders fosters better decision-making, broader market insights and stronger risk management — factors that contribute to long-term financial performance (read: Trade War Fears Surge: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Watch Out For).

Various studies suggest that companies with more women in leadership roles have better risk management capabilities. Women's leadership styles can often be more cautious and inclusive, leading to more thorough risk assessment and management strategies. Women bring in different life experiences and viewpoints, contributing significantly to the diversity.

Further, women control a large portion of consumer spending and, thus, can offer invaluable insights into market trends, customer needs and product development. Companies with female leaders are often more familiar with market demands.

He will succeed the retiring Foley, who has been interim CFO since February 2024, when Kroger CFO Gary Millerchip left to join Costco Wholesale Corp. as CFO.","CINCINNATI — The Kroger Co. capped off fiscal 2024 with a mixed performance and finds itself early in fiscal 2025 with an interim chief executive officer at the helm after the exit of chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen earlier this week.

Cincinnati-based Kroger announced March 3 that McMullen had resigned following an investigation finding that he engaged in personal conduct that, while unrelated to the business, violated the company’s ethics policy. Lead board director Ronald Sargent was named as chairman and interim CEO and Mark Sutton as the new lead director.

With Kroger for over four decades, McMullen had served as CEO since 2014 and as chairman since 2015 — including during the planned $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons Cos. that underwent a more than two-year regulatory review before the transaction was blocked by courts and both companies terminated the deal in December 2024.

“I will be serving as the interim CEO as we search for a leader for our next phase of growth,” Sargent told analysts in a March 6 conference call on fiscal 2024 results. “The board has formed a search committee and has engaged a nationally recognized search firm. We look forward to updating you as we have more information. As a board member, I know Kroger’s strong leadership team well, and they support a unique culture that powers the company’s long-term success. We care for people and we love food, the most important elements of successful grocery retail.”

Because of the pending CEO search, Kroger has postponed its investor day planned for April and will update investors when the event has been rescheduled, Sargent said.

In response to an analyst question on the CEO search, Sargent said Kroger is currently updating its CEO selection criteria, a process the company does annually as part of succession planning.

“We are going to be looking at both internal candidates as well as external candidates,” he said. “But most importantly, we’re focused on identifying the right leader to drive progress growth and enhance shareholder value. I am proud to serve in this role for as long as needed, but I am absolutely confident that our board will select the right next CEO, whether from inside the company or outside.”

Merger costs impact bottom line

For fiscal 2024, Kroger saw net income rise to $2.67 billion, equal to $3.67 per share on the common stock, from $2.16 billion, or $2.96 per share, in fiscal 2023, which had 53 weeks. Excluding $581 million in adjustment items — primarily costs from the terminated merger with Albertsons — 2024 net earnings were $3.25 billion, or $4.47 per share, compared with $3.34 billion, or $4.56 per share, for 2023, not counting the 53rd week. Kroger’s 2024 adjusted earnings per share were a penny above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.46.

Fourth-quarter net income declined to $634 million, or 90¢ per share, from $736 million, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were $800 million, or $1.14 per share, versus $835 million, or $1.34 per share, in the prior-year period, excluding the extra week. Analysts, on average, had forecast adjusted EPS of $1.11.

Kroger tallied top-line growth for the year and final quarter ended Feb. 1. Fiscal 2024 net sales totaled $147.12 billion, down 1.9% from $150.03 billion a year ago but up 1.8% excluding fuel sales, specialty pharmacy sales and, in 2023, $2.7 billion from the 53rd week. The company sold its Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business in October 2024, which generated $2 billion for the fiscal year versus $3.2 billion for all of 2023.

Net sales in the 2024 fourth quarter were $31.08 billion, down 7.4% year over year from $37.06 billion. Excluding sales from fuel, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and the prior year’s extra week, net sales climbed 2.6%, Kroger noted.

Identical sales excluding fuel and adjustment items grew 1.5% for fiscal 2024, compared with a 0.9% uptick in 2023. The result reflected a lift in the fourth quarter, when identical sales rose 2.4% from a year-ago dip of 0.8%.

Digital sales (excluding the extra week) climbed 10% to more than $13 billion in fiscal 2024, including an 11% gain in the fourth quarter, when delivery sales rose 18%, driven by Kroger’s Ocado-automated customer fulfillment centers.

Kroger also expanded its Our Brands private label lineup in 2024. The supermarket giant launched more than 900 products, including 370 fresh items, such as the new Field & Vine berry brand, and meal bundles under the Simple Truth better-for-you brand. Health and wellness sales (including pharmacy) were strong as well, fueled by GLP-1 drugs and 11% growth in vaccinations, the company said.

As of mid-day trading on March 6, Kroger’s stock price was up 2% to $63.80 per common share.

“Today, Kroger operates from a position of strength,” Sargent said. “We delivered strong financial results in 2024 and have positive momentum in our business. We’re confident in our plans for 2025 and our commitment to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. I will be especially focused on executing with speed and confidence, keeping our team working toward the priorities that create long-term growth. We’re delivering on our go-to-market strategy, providing families across America with fresh and affordable food.

“In my retail career, I understood that an outstanding customer experience comes from best-in-class store conditions, friendly associates and great products at low prices. That’s who Kroger is today, and that’s who we will be tomorrow.”

2025 outlook includes more store expansion

Looking ahead, Kroger projected fiscal 2025 identical sales growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted net diluted EPS of $4.60 to $4.80, within Wall Street’s forecast range of $4.58 to $4.88 before the earnings report.

“In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect identical sales without fuel to be consistent throughout the year, building slightly as the year progresses, as we continue to improve our volumes,” Todd Foley, interim chief financial officer, said in the call. “We expect first-quarter adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be similar to last year, and we expect Q2 through Q4 to be consistently above each quarter compared to the same periods last year.”

Foley said inflation rose throughout 2024 and was in line with Kroger’s expectations.

“As we look ahead to 2025, we expect inflation to be 1.5% to 2.5%, which does not include the effects from tariffs announced earlier this week,” he said. “External factors continue to pressure certain fresh commodities, including eggs. Notably, the avian flu resulted in an inflation of approximately 70% during the quarter. Inflationary pressures are not new to our business, and we’re confident in our ability to navigate any inflationary environment. We will remain focused on keeping prices low for our customers.”

David Kennerley, CFO of PepsiCo Europe, is slated to take the reins as Kroger’s new CFO on April 3. He will succeed the retiring Foley, who has been interim CFO since February 2024, when Kroger CFO Gary Millerchip left to join Costco Wholesale Corp. as CFO.

“David is joining us from PepsiCo Europe and brings broad and extensive financial experience,” Sargent said. “We are confident that David’s expertise and leadership will help us to continue to deliver on our strategic and financial priorities.”

Both Foley and Sargent cited store expansion as a key growth driver in 2024 and for 2025.

“In 2024, we announced plans to significantly increase our investment in major storing projects, including new stores to accelerate sales growth and improve share while supporting our long-term growth model,” Foley said. “We delivered on that commitment in 2024, completing 29 major storing projects focused in higher-growth geographies that have a track record for generating strong cash flows and returns. We expect to complete 30 major storing projects in 2025. We also expect new stores to continue to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth model and would expect new store openings to accelerate beyond 2025.”",,N,,2025-03-07 15:56:39.198425

The pharma giant is bringing a depression drug prospect into the fold via the $14 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies announced in January.
J&J expects to complete the Intra-Cellular acquisition later this year.","A depression drug candidate that’s a key part of Johnson & Johnson’s neuroscience strategy has failed a Phase 3 clinical trial, the latest dose of disappointing news for an emerging class of medicines addressing a novel target hoped to overcome limitations of currently available antidepressants.

J&J is discontinuing the Phase 3 test of its drug, aticaprant, in major depressive disorder “due to insufficient efficacy in the target patient population,” the company said after Thursday’s market close. The pharmaceutical giant said this drug was safe and well-tolerated by patients, and no new safety signals were identified. No other details about the trial results were disclosed.

The open-label clinical trial’s targeted enrollment was 840 adults ages 18 to 74. Participants received aticaprant once daily as an adjunct to depression drugs they were already taking. Efficacy goals for the 54-week study include measuring the percentage of patients with suicidal thoughts or behaviors and as well as the change in score over time according to a scale used to assess depression symptoms.

The trial also measured for weight gain and sexual dysfunction, adverse effects that are common with currently available depression medications and lead many patients to stop taking them. Aticaprant was hoped to avoid or at least reduce these side effects. Better efficacy and improved safety and tolerability would be key advantages over the current slate of antidepressants. Analysts had projected aticaprant would become a blockbuster product.

J&J said analysis of the failed study is underway and more details will be presented at a future medical meeting. But even though this Phase 3 trial is ending, J&J isn’t giving up on aticaprant. Based on the potential of the drug’s mechanism, the company said it will explore future development opportunities in other areas of high unmet need.

Aticaprant is a small molecule designed to target and block kappa opioid receptors, an approach intended to modulate pathways that regulate mood and behavior. It’s the same target hit by Neumora Therapeutics’ lead drug candidate, navacaprant. In January, Neumora reported this daily pill did not beat a placebo on the main efficacy goal of a Phase 3 clinical trial.

Earlier this week, Neumora said it will end the failed Phase 3 study, one of three late-stage tests for navacaprant. But the company also said it will apply learnings from the failed test to the two other Phase 3 studies, which have been paused for now. Changes include optimizing site selection and enhancing medical monitoring to ensure appropriate patients are enrolled. Neumora plans to resume the two studies later this month; preliminary data are expected in 2026. Neumora also stopped a Phase 2 test of navacaprant in bipolar depression in order to devote its resources to its major depressive disorder clinical research.

As for J&J, the company’s neuroscience portfolio includes the blockbuster schizophrenia drug Invega and the nasal spray depression drug Spravato. The pharma giant is bringing a depression drug prospect into the fold via the $14 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies announced in January. Intra-Cellular’s main asset is Caplyta, which has approvals in schizophrenia and bipolar depression. The drug is currently under FDA review for major depressive disorder, an indication that could make the once-daily pill a blockbuster seller. J&J expects to complete the Intra-Cellular acquisition later this year.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses with insights into Zero Day Options.

In a recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on how day traders were trading the shares of Wall Street’s favorite AI GPU stock. He recalled a conversation that he had with Vlad Tenev, who’s the CEO of the most popular stock trading platform in the US. Cramer shared that the number of zero-day options that were actually being traded for the stock around the time of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release meant that the options, instead of the fundamentals, were driving the share price.

He also marveled at the fact that trading these options came with little risk. According to Cramer: “And what’s amazing is this it actually makes sense! I mean when I was with [Vlad Tenev], you don’t want, time degradations, you can actually put that bet on, this morning. And if it doesn’t work, doesn’t work.” He added: “There are many professionals who are using zero-day through Robinhood because they’ve got the most, they’ve got the cheapest market.”

The CNBC TV show host also commented on how the GPU company needed to “get away from this five clients syndrome.” He believes that if the firm’s only clients are going to be mega-cap technology giants then “We’re all gonna just keep saying, are they ordering? Are they ordering? If you have an order book that includes say, many countries, uh that’d be great.”

Cramer’s co-host David Faber asked him about his recent discussion with Trump advisor Peter Navarro, here’s what Cramer said:

“Okay, so it’s really interesting, really interesting to say that because the larger takeaway was missed. It was meant to be a stop to the Mag 7. It was meant to be, listen, we’re gonna protect you from the honey pot, that so many people, we wake up all the time and we see ‘oh, billion dollar fine by so and so’. . . so Peter thought that it would be welcomed by the tech companies because they’re the ones, they’ve been complaining about it endlessly, but it did not resonate like that. And I think that one of the part is because there was like, oh how about the copper tariff?”

Financial markets have weathered numerous storms throughout history, but certain scandals stand out for their sheer audacity and devastating impact. These events didn’t just destroy individual companies – they shattered investor confidence, triggered market crashes, and fundamentally changed how we regulate financial markets.

Here is a list of financial scandals that sent shockwaves through the global economy, each leaving an indelible mark on market history and reshaping the financial landscape forever.

Enron Corporation

The energy giant’s spectacular collapse in 2001 wiped out $74 billion in shareholder value and $2 billion in employee pension funds. Enron executives had created a complex web of off-balance-sheet entities to hide massive debts and inflate profits artificially.

The company’s stock plummeted from $90 to mere pennies in just months. This scandal led directly to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, fundamentally changing corporate accountability requirements.

Wirecard AG

The German payment processor’s $2.1 billion accounting fraud in 2020 rocked European markets and embarrassed financial regulators. Wirecard had claimed billions in cash balances that simply didn’t exist, while executives allegedly siphoned off company funds.

The company’s CEO was arrested while trying to enter the Philippines, and its COO remains a fugitive. This scandal triggered a complete overhaul of German financial regulation.

WorldCom

The telecommunications company’s $11 billion accounting fraud in 2002 dwarfed even Enron’s deception. WorldCom had been classifying ordinary operating costs as capital expenditures, artificially inflating its cash flow and profits.

The revelation sent its stock from $64 to just pennies, marking the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at that time. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and retirement savings overnight.

Madoff Investment Securities

Bernie Madoff’s $64.8 billion Ponzi scheme, exposed in 2008, stands as the largest financial fraud in history. For decades, Madoff had been paying existing investors with money from new investors while generating no actual returns.

The scheme’s collapse devastated thousands of investors, including many charities and foundations. This scandal led to major reforms in SEC oversight and whistleblower protection.

Tyco International

The industrial conglomerate’s 2002 scandal revealed systematic looting by top executives. CEO Dennis Kozlowski and CFO Mark Swartz had stolen $150 million while misappropriating $430 million more through unauthorized loans and fraudulent stock sales.

Their notorious excesses, including a $2 million birthday party in Sardinia and a $6,000 shower curtain, became symbols of corporate greed.

Galleon Group

The hedge fund’s insider trading scandal in 2009 exposed widespread corruption on Wall Street. Founder Raj Rajaratnam had built a network of corporate insiders who provided illegal tips about upcoming market-moving events.

The FBI’s use of wiretaps in the investigation marked a turning point in securities fraud prosecution. The scandal led to 70 convictions and revolutionized insider trading enforcement.

Parmalat

The Italian dairy giant’s 2003 collapse revealed an $18 billion accounting hole, earning it the nickname ‘Europe’s Enron’. Executives had created a complex network of offshore entities to hide losses while forging documents showing fake bank deposits.

The scandal devastated Italy’s economy and led to stricter European Union financial regulations. Over 135,000 investors lost their savings.

Barings Bank

The 233-year-old British bank collapsed in 1995 after trader Nick Leeson lost $1.3 billion through unauthorized speculation. Leeson had hidden mounting losses in a secret account while making increasingly desperate bets on Asian markets.

The bank’s failure sent shockwaves through the financial system and highlighted the dangers of insufficient trading oversight.

BCCI

The Bank of Credit and Commerce International’s 1991 collapse exposed a massive criminal enterprise masquerading as a legitimate bank. BCCI had engaged in money laundering, arms trafficking, and terrorist financing while bribing officials worldwide.

The bank’s failure cost investors $20 billion and led to major reforms in international banking regulation.

Olympus Corporation

The Japanese camera maker’s $1.7 billion accounting fraud came to light in 2011 when its CEO turned whistleblower. Executives had been hiding losses through complex takeover deals for over two decades.

The scandal highlighted the weaknesses in Japanese corporate governance and led to major reforms in accounting oversight and whistleblower protection.

Satyam Computer Services

The Indian IT company’s $1.5 billion fraud in 2009 nearly destroyed investor confidence in India’s tech sector. Chairman Ramalinga Raju had been falsifying revenues, margins, and cash balances for years.

The scandal prompted a complete overhaul of Indian corporate governance rules and auditing standards. The company’s clients included numerous Fortune 500 firms.

Société Générale

The French bank lost $7.2 billion in 2008 through unauthorized trades by Jerome Kerviel. The trader had exploited his knowledge of bank controls to place massive speculative bets while hiding the true exposure.

The scandal highlighted the risks of complex trading strategies and inadequate risk management systems. Kerviel claimed his superiors had tacitly encouraged his actions.

Stanford Financial Group

Allen Stanford’s $7 billion Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2009, devastating investors across the Americas. Stanford had sold fraudulent certificates of deposit through his offshore bank while bribing regulators and auditors.

The scheme’s international scope highlighted the challenges of cross-border financial regulation and enforcement.

Qwest Communications

The telecommunications company’s $2.5 billion accounting fraud was exposed in 2002. Executives had inflated revenue through fake capacity swaps with other telecoms while insider trading in company stock.

The scandal highlighted the widespread nature of telecom industry fraud during the dot-com era. Thousands of employees lost their retirement savings.

Sino-Forest Corporation

The Canadian-listed Chinese timber company’s $6 billion fraud unraveled in 2011. Executives had vastly overstated their forest holdings and timber revenues while operating a complex scheme to deceive auditors.

The scandal devastated investor confidence in Chinese companies listed on Western exchanges and led to stricter listing requirements.

Ahold

The Dutch supermarket giant’s $500 million accounting fraud in 2003 shocked European markets. Executives had inflated profits through improper consolidation of joint ventures and fake vendor rebates.

The scandal led to major reforms in European accounting standards and corporate governance requirements. The company’s U.S. subsidiary also faced serious irregularities.

Refco

The commodities broker’s $430 million fraud was exposed just months after its 2005 IPO. CEO Phillip Bennett had been hiding hundreds of millions in bad debts through a complex scheme of circular transactions.

The scandal highlighted the risks of rushing companies to market without adequate due diligence. Thousands of customers had their accounts frozen.

HealthSouth

The healthcare company’s $2.7 billion accounting fraud was revealed in 2003. Executives had systematically falsified financial statements to meet Wall Street expectations, creating fake assets and income.

The scandal highlighted the pressures of quarterly earnings targets and led to reforms in healthcare company accounting.

Waste Management

The garbage collection company’s $1.7 billion accounting fraud came to light in 1998. Executives had been inflating profits by extending depreciation schedules and capitalizing normal expenses.

The scandal led to major reforms in accounting rules and auditor independence requirements. The SEC imposed record penalties on the company’s auditors.

Adelphia Communications

The cable company’s $2.3 billion fraud in 2002 exposed systematic looting by the founding family. The Rigas family had used company funds for personal expenses while hiding billions in off-balance-sheet debt.

The scandal highlighted the risks of family-controlled public companies and led to stricter rules on related-party transactions.

Legacy of Deception

These scandals fundamentally changed how markets operate and are regulated. Each crisis exposed weaknesses in oversight, leading to new laws and regulations designed to prevent similar frauds.

Yet despite stronger safeguards, financial innovation continues to create new opportunities for deception. Today’s investors must remain vigilant, remembering that when returns seem too good to be true, they usually are.

Los Angeles, CA - A California state court jury found Starbucks liable on Wednesday for severe burns a Postmates driver suffered while picking up a drive-through order, and the full trial was webcast gavel-to-gavel by Courtroom View Network.

The jury found Starbucks entirely responsible for plaintiff Michael Garcia’s injuries, assigning him no liability in the first phase of the bifurcated trial after 40 minutes of deliberation and setting up a second phase to determine damages next week to compensate for burns to his thighs and genitals.

In a brief liability phase that only lasted two days, Garcia’s attorney Nick Rowley of Trial Lawyers for Justice told the Los Angeles County jury that the barista working the window failed to properly secure one of the hot drinks in the takeout container, however Starbucks unsuccessfully maintained the spill only occurred after Garcia had total physical control of the beverages.

Rowley delivered a “hands on” opening statement with Garcia seated directly next to him, at times interacting with Garcia to recreate the act of handing a tray of drinks through a car window.

Rowley told jurors Starbucks had a documented corporate policy that drinks must be fully secured in a tray, and he said surveillance video from inside the drive-through clearly showed one of the three cups not fully placed in the container.

He also rejected arguments from Starbucks that having an unrestrained dog in the car contributed to Garcia’s injuries, stressing it wasn’t in violation of any local ordinance and that it shouldn’t affect how a Starbucks employee does their job.

“This young man did nothing to cause this to happen,” Rowley insisted. “Nothing at all.”

Representing Starbucks, Stephen Pelletier of Price Pelletier LLP disputed Rowley’s characterizing of the surveillance video, instead telling jurors that an accident reconstruction expert determined Garcia was in full control of the drinks when they spilled.

He argued Garcia had made similar orders countless times before, knew he would be holding scalding hot beverages, and should have taken the same care that he supposedly used every time prior.

Pelletier defended the training Starbucks employees undergo, and he said their actions that day all complied with those standards.

“In this case, the handoff was successful and it must be evaluated from the point where the drinks are moved from the counter all the way to point where the drink spilled,” Pelletier explained.

The trial is taking place before Judge Frederick Shaller.

It remains Coca-Cola’s global marketing partner under the OpenX model, which includes media and creative. And while the media account in North America is in flux, those same sources say the region’s creative business is expected to stay put.

All of the involved parties — Coca-Cola, WPP/GroupM, Publicis and MediaSense, which is said to be helping Coca-Cola with its decision — declined comment for this story.

Still, according to one agency exec at another holding company, Publicis has been “heavily prospecting” Coca-Cola to win the business from WPP, which has endured some punishing losses over the last year, undergone an organizational shakeup at its media buying arm GroupM and tougher competition from rival holdcos.

The source said Publicis is most likely offering to reduce Coca-Cola’s cost for services.

Losing Coca-Cola would clearly add to those woes for WPP, but it would be mitigated to some degree by the fact that it has scooped up lucrative media accounts in North America including Johnson & Johnson’s U.S. and Canadian media in December.

Coca-Cola’s shift comes at a crucial point in WPP’s history. It reported like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs, an indicator of organic agency growth, decline 1% year-on-year. That drop was steeper than analysts expected, and made worse by a murky outlook for the year. So much so that WPP’s share price tumbled to a four-year low. One saving grace was GroupM, which did grow 2.7% in revenue in 2024, including 2.4% in Q4.

While the drug continues to look safe and well-tolerated, the program has shown “insufficient efficacy in the target patient population,” according to J&J.
Yet for a behemoth like J&J, aticaprant was just one of nearly 20 novel drug programs across its pipeline that it had said could eventually reach blockbuster status.
Brian Abrahams, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, suspects the discontinued J&J trials could erode “any residual hope” these drugs might be useful in depression.
Matteis downgraded his rating on Neumora stock to “Hold,” arguing the stock “becomes much harder to defend” following J&J’s decision.","Johnson & Johnson is terminating some research for an experimental drug that the company previously predicted could be a multibillion-dollar product.

In a statement released Thursday afternoon, J&J said it will stop developing the drug, called aticaprant, as an add-on therapy for patients with major depressive disorder. Over the past few years, a series of large, late-stage clinical trials tested aticaprant in adults who have hard-to-treat MDD and moderate-to-severe cases of a defining symptom of the disorder, anhedonia, which presents as a loss of interest or an inability to experience joy.

While the drug continues to look safe and well-tolerated, the program has shown “insufficient efficacy in the target patient population,” according to J&J. Aticaprant may still have potential, however, so the company plans to “explore future development opportunities” in other “areas of high unmet need.”

J&J says it remains committed to the neuroscience space, as evidenced by its recent agreement to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies — maker of the mind-stabilizing therapy Caplyta — for nearly $15 billion. The pharmaceutical giant noted, too, that it still expects its medicines division to hit a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. That division recorded $57 billion in sales last year, an increase of 4% from 2023.

For now, though, prospects appear dimmer for one of J&J’s more closely followed projects. David Risinger, an analyst at Leerink Partners, wrote in a note to clients that Wall Street has been penciling about $1 billion in annual sales from aticaprant by 2032.

J&J had outlined an even rosier forecast in late 2023, when it projected peak annual sales could fall anywhere between $1 billion and $5 billion.

The setback will almost certainly dent those estimates, and could make J&J’s goal of becoming the top neuroscience company by 2030 more difficult. Yet for a behemoth like J&J, aticaprant was just one of nearly 20 novel drug programs across its pipeline that it had said could eventually reach blockbuster status.

Perhaps that’s why J&J’s stock was little affected Friday, rising more than 1%. Meanwhile, shares of Neumora Therapeutics, a biotechnology startup working on a similar drug, were down close to 5%.

Neumora debuted in late 2021, armed with half a billion dollars in funding from some of the industry’s most prolific venture capital firms, including Arch Venture Partners and Polaris Partners, as well as Amgen. The biotech continued to raise money and, in the summer of 2023, raked in another $250 million by going public.

Neumora’s stock took a sharp dive early this year, though, when a late-stage study found its drug navacaprant to be no better than a placebo at treating moderate-to-severe MDD. J&J’s and Neumora’s are both designed to block “kappa opioid receptors,” a type of protein that regulates various parts of the nervous system. Research indicates these proteins affect mood, stress and pain perception.

Brian Abrahams, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, suspects the discontinued J&J trials could erode “any residual hope” these drugs might be useful in depression. It may also “cast further doubt” on the likelihood of success for Neumora’s ongoing studies.

Stifel analyst Paul Matteis echoed those sentiments, writing in a note to clients that the news is a “big blow” to the thesis around kappa opioid receptor drugs. Matteis downgraded his rating on Neumora stock to “Hold,” arguing the stock “becomes much harder to defend” following J&J’s decision.

Neumora shares are down more than 90% since the company’s initial public offering, and, as of late Friday morning, they traded at roughly $1.45 apiece.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:06:53.634186

Judge Valerie Caproni granted Nike motion for partial summary judgment on 4 March in its counterfeit dispute with StockX. The online reseller was found to have sold four pairs of counterfeit Nikes to company investigators and 33 pairs of counterfeit shoes to another customer.

The judge, however, denied Nike’s other claims in its motion including false advertising, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, false designation of origin and injury to business reputation. The outstanding claims are to be settled at trial, which will take place between 15 June 2025 and 15 November 2025.

Founded in 2016, StockX is an online marketplace and clothing reseller, primarily of sneakers.

The dispute dates back to 2022 when Nike accused StockX of infringing its trademarks through NFTs.

Responding to the decision in a statement, StockX said that it was “pleased that the court denied Nike’s claims related to false advertising and that the judge rejected Nike’s allegations of wilfulness as it relates to counterfeiting. “

It continued that the products in question “amount to a mere 0.0004% of the 17.8 million Nike sneakers StockX reviewed while this litigation was ongoing. Compare that to the more than $80m of suspected counterfeit sneakers alone that StickX has prevented form being sold on our platform since launching in 2016.”

It added: “It’s a shame that rather than work with us to fight fakes, Nike has instead opted to use its resources to pursue meritless, expensive litigation. We look forward to the opportunity to tell our story.”

The parties must meet no later than 14 March to decide trial dates and provide three mutually convenient dates for the trial between 15 June and 15 November.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:15:15.902467

Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm based in New York, is making the Walgreens acquisition with a related entity for a total transaction value that represents up to $23.7 billion, the companies announced.

Walgreens has about 12,500 retail locations across the U.S., Latin America and Europe. It also employs about 311,000 people across eight countries under the brands Walgreens, Boots, Duane Reade, No7 Beauty Company and Benavides.

“We are focused on making healthcare delivery more effective, convenient and affordable as we navigate the challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape,” said Tim Wentworth, Walgreens CEO, in a statement. “While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company.”

The deal also includes a “go-shop” period in which Walgreens has 35 days to evaluate and enter into negotiations with parties offering alternative proposals.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. ranks No. 14 overall in the Top 2000 Database. The database is Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of North America’s leading online retailers by their annual web sales.

Prior to the Sycamore Partners acquisition deal, Digital Commerce 360 projected Walgreens’ online sales will reach $10.38 billion in 2025. Walgreens is currently the largest retailer in the Top 2000’s Health & Beauty category.

Details about Walgreens going private

Walgreens’ board of directors, with two of them recused, unanimously approved the proposed acquisition by Sycamore Partners. The companies said they expect to close the acquisition deal — through which Walgreens would be going private — in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending regulatory approval. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition, as Sycamore Partners “has received fully committed financing for the transaction.”

As a result, Walgreens will still report its fiscal Q2 2025 earnings, filing its quarterly report April 8, 2025.

“This transaction reflects our confidence in WBA’s pharmacy-led model and essential role in driving better outcomes for patients, customers and communities,” said Stefan Kaluzny, managing director of Sycamore Partners, in the statement.

Walgreens shareholders will receive $11.45 per share when Sycamore Partners closes the acquisition deal. Shareholders will also receive up to $3 in cash per Walgreens share from the future monetization of the retailer’s debt and equity interests in VillageMD, which includes the Village Medical, Summit Health and CityMD businesses, the companies announced.

That $3 per share is non-transferable. Together with the cash consideration, it comprises the $11.45 in total consideration.

The cash consideration represents a 29% premium over Walgreens’ share price at closing on Dec. 9, 2024 ($8.85). Meanwhile, the total consideration represents a premium of up to 63% over that closing share value.

Dec. 9 is the day before the first media reports of the potential transaction, the companies said.

When Liverpool agreed their five-year contract with Nike in 2020, a comparatively low rate of £30 million was negotiated in a heavily incentivised deal.
In UEFA’s latest European Club Finance and Investment Landscape study, it was revealed that Liverpool in fact brought in £122.8 million from their deal with Nike last season.
Liverpool’s kit revenue was up £9.7 million from the previous campaign and £36.2 million more than they received five years ago during their previous deal with New Balance.
While an official announcement is yet to be made, Liverpool are understood to have agreed a new long-term deal with Adidas beginning this summer.","Liverpool’s kit deal with Nike was worth the fourth-most of any club in Europe in 2023/24, according to a UEFA study, and significantly higher than their base rate.

When Liverpool agreed their five-year contract with Nike in 2020, a comparatively low rate of £30 million was negotiated in a heavily incentivised deal.

The agreement included a percentage of sales for kits and other merchandise, with the club banking on their universal appeal in order to earn considerably more than that base rate.

In UEFA’s latest European Club Finance and Investment Landscape study, it was revealed that Liverpool in fact brought in £122.8 million from their deal with Nike last season.

That is the fourth-most in Europe, tied with Man United, with only Real Madrid (£164.8m), Bayern Munich (£143.8m) and Barcelona (£143.8m) ranked higher for kit and merchandising revenue.

It means Liverpool earned four times their base rate in 2023/24 and almost double that of Premier League champions Man City (£63.9m), whose earnings only rose by £1.4 million.

Arsenal (£100.9m), Tottenham (£80.8m) and Chelsea (£79.9m) made up the rest of the top five for the English top flight, with Galatasaray (£71.5m) and Paris Saint-Germain (£68.1m) also earning more than Man City.

Liverpool’s kit revenue was up £9.7 million from the previous campaign and £36.2 million more than they received five years ago during their previous deal with New Balance.

The club’s deal with Nike was worth 20 percent of their revenue in their most recent financial accounts, which is the highest in the Premier League.

Adidas could earn Liverpool even more

Interestingly, the two top-earning clubs across Europe when it comes to kit revenue were supplied by Adidas – who Liverpool will link up with from next season.

While an official announcement is yet to be made, Liverpool are understood to have agreed a new long-term deal with Adidas beginning this summer.

It has been reported that the contract with Adidas will be worth more than £60 million a year, while it also includes a percentage of revenue from kit and merchandise sales.

The ABA Retirement Funds Program will be the first adopter on the Voya Financial recordkeeping platform. Mercer Trust Company LLC serves as the investment fiduciary for the ABA Program.

Voya also intends to make IncomeWise available to additional eligible clients in the future, making Voya the second recordkeeper making IncomeWise available, after Fidelity Investments. IncomeWise and related custom target-date strategies now have more than $20 billion in committed assets.

“Working together with Voya is a significant step in making IncomeWise accessible to a broader audience of retirement savers, including plan sponsors and participants within the ABA Program,” said Brendan Curran, Head of US Retirement at State Street Global Advisors. “Americans face increasing complexity in retirement planning, and IncomeWise offers a flexible approach to help participants build confidence in their financial futures.”

IncomeWise blends the simplicity of traditional index-based target-date funds with the option for participants to activate income across part or all of their target-date fund balance. Through a simple two-step election process, participants can choose to activate two integrated income features: deferred annuity payments for lifelong security and automatic monthly withdrawals that provide a structured spend-down option. The combination offers both flexibility and longevity protection, helping participants create a retirement income strategy that aligns with their needs.

“We welcome the opportunity to support the ABA Program in providing its plan sponsors and participants with a growing set of tools to help improve future retirement outcomes,” said Ginger Brennan, head of ABA Retirement Funds Program and Multiple Employer Solutions at Voya Financial. “This is the next step in expanding the ABA Program’s Retiree Menu, which provides participants nearing or in retirement with custom investment options and education, by now providing solutions for those individuals wanting the assurances that come with guaranteed income.”

The adoption of IncomeWise further reflects the ABA Program’s focus on participant outcomes and retirement plan innovation.

State Street Global Advisors—the asset management business of State Street Corporation that is the world’s fourth-largest asset manager with $4.73 trillion under care—said the expansion aligns with its commitment to provide participants with innovative and flexible retirement solutions.

Soufflet Malt CEO Jorge Solis said, “This significant investment by Soufflet Malt, in partnership with our company, marks a monumental commitment to South Africa and is a venture we are immensely proud to be part of.
At the South Africa Investment Conference in April 2023, Heineken Beverages committed to investing R15.5 billion over five years to bolster its operations in South Africa.
According to TechSci Research report, South Africa Beer Market – By Region, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2030F - the South Africa Beer market stood at $3.6bn in 2024 and is anticipated to grow $5.31b nby 2030 with a CAGR 6.75% during forecast period.
Guillaume Couture, the President EMEA at Soufflet Malt, “Our collaboration with Heineken Beverages marks an exciting chapter for Soufflet Malt to further strengthen the South African malt supply chain.","Soufflet Malt, the world’s largest malt producer, will invest R2 billion (€100 million) to build a malting facility in South Africa under a new supply agreement with Heineken Beverages, signaling a deeper push into the region’s beverage and agricultural sectors.

The facility, set to supply malt for Heineken’s local operations, will be located adjacent to the brewer’s Sedibeng plant near Johannesburg and is slated for completion by mid-2027.

The investment underscores growing confidence in South Africa’s agribusiness potential amid a global surge in demand for beer and malt-based products.

Heineken Beverages, which oversees a portfolio including Heineken, Savanna, Windhoek, and Amarula following its 2023 acquisition of Distell, said in a statement on Friday that the plant will produce 100 000 tonnes of malt annually using advanced trigeneration and solar technology, cutting emissions by 50% compared to industry norms.

“This facility strengthens our supply chain resilience and aligns with our sustainability targets,” Heineken Beverages managing director Jordi Borrut said. “It’s a significant step in localising production and supporting South Africa’s economy.”

Economic Impact

The project will create 55 permanent jobs and bolster over 200 local barley farmers, with Soufflet Malt committing to source all barley domestically. The company, a unit of France’s InVivo Group, has spent years cultivating relationships with South African growers, offering training and commercial support to ensure premium barley output.

""To achieve this goal, Soufflet Malt has been working in the region for several years, building long-term partnerships with both commercial and developing farmers. Through training, mentoring, and commercial support, Soufflet Malt is helping them adopt agronomic best practices to grow high-quality, premium barley,"" Soufflet Malt said.

South Africa’s agricultural sector, a key economic driver, stands to benefit as global maltsters like Soufflet deepen their footprint.

South African agricultural exports rose 3% to a record $13.7 billion last year led by shipments of citrus fruit and grapes, a report released by the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa showed. Investments like this could further elevate its role in the global supply chain.

Soufflet Malt CEO Jorge Solis said, “This significant investment by Soufflet Malt, in partnership with our company, marks a monumental commitment to South Africa and is a venture we are immensely proud to be part of. Our company is deeply committed to the region, continuously enhancing our investment in the country. Our focus is on intensifying our support for local production, local sourcing, and job creation. This project is a clear testament to these objectives and aligns with our 'Brew a Better World' agenda, underpinned by sustainable practices and supporting the communities in which we operate.""

Corporate Context

Soufflet Malt, with 41 plants across 20 countries and an annual capacity of 3.7 million tonnes, dominates the $10bn global malt market. Its parent, InVivo, acquired the Soufflet Group in 2021 for €2.2bn, later expanding its lead by purchasing United Malt Group for A$1.5bn (R74bn) in 2023. The South Africa deal marks its latest move to secure supply chains for major clients like Heineken.

Heineken Beverages, meanwhile, emerged from a transformative $2.2bn acquisition of Distell and Namibia Breweries in April 2023, creating a regional powerhouse majority-owned by Heineken. The new malting plant dovetails with its strategy to localise inputs and reduce reliance on imports, a critical pivot as currency volatility and logistics costs challenge African markets.

Since 2023, Heineken Beverages has made significant investments in South Africa, reflecting its strategic focus on expanding operations, enhancing sustainability, and boosting the local economy.

At the South Africa Investment Conference in April 2023, Heineken Beverages committed to investing R15.5 billion over five years to bolster its operations in South Africa.

In March 2024, Heineken Beverages invested R2.3 billion to expand its returnable glass bottling program, shifting 65% of its beer portfolio, including the Heineken brand, to returnable bottles

Sustainability and Market Dynamics

The facility’s low-emission design - featuring conveyors to transfer malt directly to the brewery - reflects broader industry trends toward greener operations.

According to TechSci Research report, South Africa Beer Market – By Region, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2030F - the South Africa Beer market stood at $3.6bn in 2024 and is anticipated to grow $5.31b nby 2030 with a CAGR 6.75% during forecast period.

Guillaume Couture, the President EMEA at Soufflet Malt, “Our collaboration with Heineken Beverages marks an exciting chapter for Soufflet Malt to further strengthen the South African malt supply chain. We look forward to deepening our partnership with local farmers, fostering the development of sustainable barley farming across the country and contributing to the long-term prosperity of South Africa through this initiative.

Losing the U.S. media business would represent a blow to WPP, which in 2021 won the beverage giant’s creative, media, data and marketing technology business spanning more than 200 countries. The London-based ad giant formed a bespoke team called Open X to service the account, which includes some 200 brands from sodas such as Coke and Sprite to sports drinks, juices, coffee, tea and plant-based drinks.

Publicis was the runner-up in the 2021 review, which led to WPP taking 90% of Coke’s media and Dentsu handling the rest.

Coca-Cola, WPP and Publicis did not provide comment.

Coca-Cola spent an estimated $1.8 billion on U.S. advertising in 2023, up roughly 17% from 2022, according to Ad Age Datacenter. It ranked 28th on Ad Age’s Leading National Advertisers 2024. The brand had measured U.S. media spending of $409 million through the first nine months of 2024 and $621 million throughout 2023, per MediaRadar.

Should it hire Publicis, Coke would once again have media duties split among multiple holding companies while decoupling media and creative in the all-important U.S. market. When WPP was hired, Manolo Arroyo, Coca-Cola’s global chief marketing officer, emphasized creating an agency model that was “consumer-centric and silo-free,” noting that consumers “don’t separate the message from the medium.” At the time, he cited the global scale of WPP, but conceded that Publicis was strong in North America.

Coca-Cola has put a major emphasis on marketing efficiencies, including using AI, which was used to create a 2024 holiday campaign. During a presentation at the recent Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference, Chief Financial Officer John Murphy cited the campaign as a “great example of being able to drive at scale a creative solution that was very well received by our consumer set across the world, but produced much faster and at a much lower cost base and more of that is in the works,” according to a transcript.

Last month, Coca-Cola Co. reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, with global net revenue up 6% to $11.5 billion.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:07:37.210499

There are a ridiculous number of Mixue Ice Cream and Tea locations According to the Wall Street Journal, Mixue Ice Cream and Tea ended 2025 with 45,000 stores, which means it doubled its locations within the last three years.
As Reuters noted, most of its stores are run by franchisees, much like McDonald's (about 80% of McDonald's locations are owned by franchisees).
According to Fast Company, one of the more popular menu items at Mixue Ice Cream and Tea is the Super Boba Sundae, which includes vanilla ice cream, sweet caramel or brown sugar syrup, and boba topping, along with the Brown Sugar Bubble Tea and Lemon Black Tea.
As Fast Company describes him, he is ""pleasantly round, wears a red cape, and holds an ice cream cone on a stick like a scepter.""","Sure, there are more than 32,000 Starbucks locations in 80 countries, some 38,000 McDonald's locations in more than 100 countries, and more than 42,000 Subways sprinkled across the globe. But there's one fast food chain that has more locations than any other — and if you're from the United States, you've likely never even heard of it.

In early March, much of the Western world was introduced to Mixue Ice Cream and Tea (pronounced mee-schway), a fast food chain based in China that's also found across much of Asia and Australia. It gained attention thanks to its initial public offering (IPO), which the Wall Street Journal says helped it raise more than $400 million. Its stock closed 43% over its IPO price, making its valuation skyrocket to more than $10 billion. Here's what you need to know about the company making a splash in the fast food game.

There are a ridiculous number of Mixue Ice Cream and Tea locations

According to the Wall Street Journal, Mixue Ice Cream and Tea ended 2025 with 45,000 stores, which means it doubled its locations within the last three years. As Reuters noted, most of its stores are run by franchisees, much like McDonald's (about 80% of McDonald's locations are owned by franchisees). The company was founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao and his younger brother Zhang Hongfu as a simple and small ice shop in Zhengzhou, Henan province. Now, the two brothers have a combined net worth of $8.1 billion, Business Insider reported.

It serves incredible specialty drinks at reasonable prices

The source of the chain's substantial revenue can be attributed to a straightforward menu featuring milk tea, fruit beverages, ice cream, and coffee. As Business Insider notes, the menu offerings are generally quite economical, with the lowest-priced item — the Signature King Cone ice cream — going for just over $1 (SGD$1.50). Conversely, the most costly item is the cheese strawberry drink, which retails for $3 (SGD$4).

According to Fast Company, one of the more popular menu items at Mixue Ice Cream and Tea is the Super Boba Sundae, which includes vanilla ice cream, sweet caramel or brown sugar syrup, and boba topping, along with the Brown Sugar Bubble Tea and Lemon Black Tea. It's this variety and value, analysts say, that makes it so appealing to customers and, in turn, to investors.

Its mascot is widely beloved

The store may be most famous for its great deals, but its mascot comes in a close second. Known as the ""Snow King,"" the mascot is a snowman adorned with a crown. As Fast Company describes him, he is ""pleasantly round, wears a red cape, and holds an ice cream cone on a stick like a scepter."" He has become the store's definitive symbol, coming to life on social media and engaging with fans in real life.

If the billionaire and his allies can get more shareholders on side to control a majority, the motion will pass and new directors will be installed.
James (Jim) Grenon is a Canadian billionaire who made his money through private equity firm Tom Capital Management, which he founded in 1995.
That would, in turn, make it cheaper to take over for those seeking to take control of it for ideological reasons.
Yet the bizarre slide from the shareholder presentation suggests that the editorial direction of NZME is squarely in someone’s sights.","A couple of weeks ago NZME – a media company that counts the NZ Herald, Newstalk ZB, BusinessDesk, and a host of radio and entertainment brands among its holdings – held its annual results presentation for shareholders. The hour was dominated by news that its property portal OneRoof might be separated for sale. But there was a slide that seemed incongruous early on:

It called to mind the recent edict from the Washington Post’s owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, that the paper’s opinion department would focus on “personal liberties and free markets” – a seemingly anodyne statement that concealed a major reorientation. The “new tone for New Zealand” seemed bland, and the goals corporate platitudes – “helping New Zealand thrive”; “sharing stories of success”; “build positive momentum for all New Zealanders”. Yet they set alarm bells ringing among some observers.

Rightly so. Earlier this week news broke that James Grenon, a Canadian billionaire resident in New Zealand since 2012, had amassed a considerable shareholding in NZME. In a filing to markets operator NZX he noted “there is no current intention to make a takeover bid”, a position he maintains now. Yet on some level that all seems immaterial, as yesterday a second announcement came via the NZX that Grenon was seeking to remove all the current directors of NZME and install new ones.

The release went on to state that “Mr Grenon and JTG’s letter states that they have discussed in confidence these proposals with some of NZME’s largest shareholders, who hold approximately 37% of NZME’s shares.” Today that claim has risen to 47%, including Grenon’s shareholding of almost 10%. If the billionaire and his allies can get more shareholders on side to control a majority, the motion will pass and new directors will be installed. If that happens, they will have effective control of New Zealand’s most important newspaper, its largest radio audience and one of its two major business news sites. Essentially, the most important news infrastructure in New Zealand.

Listen to Duncan Greive’s The Fold podcast on Grenon’s move

Who is driving this? James (Jim) Grenon is a Canadian billionaire who made his money through private equity firm Tom Capital Management, which he founded in 1995. Grenon moved to New Zealand in 2012, and now lives in a $19.5m beachfront home in Takapuna on Auckland’s North Shore.

Grenon gained public attention in New Zealand over his connections to alternative news outlets New Zealand News Essentials (NZNE, a deliberate provocation to the company he now seeks to control) and The Centrist, which have been linked to alt-right influencer Chantelle Baker. Grenon was the sole director and shareholder of The Centrist until mid-2023, when the roles were transferred to another Canadian, Tameem Adam Abdul-majeed Barakat.

A senior NZME staff member said “we’re terrified”, as the NZX announcement swept the company. Coming after a deep cut into the editorial operation in favour of a talk-driven digital TV news channel, it adds to an air of immense instability at what had previously been a relatively calm part of the troubled news business.

What’s driving this? It’s a combination of factors. Grenon’s previous startup ventures, The Centrist and NZNE, are aggregation sites with a smattering of original content. They are largely preoccupied with a small handful of issues – trans rights, Treaty coverage and vaccine efficacy and injuries. They can be read as a critique of the news agenda of larger news organisations’ coverage of such areas, and in this way join a global perception that mainstream news organisations have either ducked or adopted an ideological slant around certain culture war fronts.

Grenon’s claim to have the support of 47% of the company’s shareholders has yet to be tested. A large majority are institutional investors, often holding shares on behalf of others, who are unlikely to believe that it’s worth taking over a major media company to adjust its editorial line. That’s where the One Roof angle comes in. Many investors see One Roof as effectively a tech company – similar to the majority Nine-held Domain, itself subject to an AU$2.7bn takeover offer – buried inside a legacy news company.

NZME would strongly reject that characterisation of its business, but the decision to explore options for One Roof suggests some shareholders buy the theory. Their support of Grenon’s bid might be more about realising that value. In a potential future transaction, they would gain valuable shares in a standalone One Roof, while NZME carried on, smaller and leaner, without the property portal. That would, in turn, make it cheaper to take over for those seeking to take control of it for ideological reasons.

Much of this is conjecture, is joining the dots. Grenon might yet prove a docile shareholder or board member. He might be just interested in unlocking One Roof’s value. Yet the bizarre slide from the shareholder presentation suggests that the editorial direction of NZME is squarely in someone’s sights. While this is not technically a hostile takeover of New Zealand’s most important news company, it certainly has a hostility about it in the desire to empty the board. There is plenty to emerge on this one – but it appears NZME is under attack. Who ultimately controls it, and what they do if they win, will become the most discussed topic NZ’s newsrooms in coming weeks.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:41:39.201295

Geographic Information System (GIS) technology is at the heart of how we deliver this support. It turns large geographic data sets into easily digestible insights and user-friendly graphic visualizations, allowing us to make informed decisions quickly in urgent situations. Combined with data on weather, wildfires, seismic activity and other third-party information, this system becomes a powerful tool for identifying people and CVS Health facilities potentially impacted by adverse events.

One way that weather-related incidents can have a clinical impact is the potential for interrupting access to prescription medications. Over six in ten adults in the U.S. take at least one prescription medication, and it is well-known that adherence to a medication plan is important to achieving the desired outcomes.

CVS Caremark® Mail Service Pharmacy and CVS Specialty® use GIS technology to ensure critical medications get where they need to on time — patients’ homes, providers’ offices, and our retail pharmacies — without weather interruptions. This is particularly important given that some medications, including many specialty medications, require refrigeration.

In 2024, during Hurricane Beryl, GIS technology allowed CVS Health to protect packages containing prescription medications across over 1,200 of the most impacted ZIP codes.

With help from GIS, we acted quickly during Hurricane Beryl, rapidly respond by transferring prescriptions from affected to unaffected pharmacies, deploying over 40 generators, mobilizing refrigerated trucks to preserve cold-chain medications and working with local organizations to deliver on-the-ground support to our customers.

During the record-breaking heatwaves of the summer of 2024, Aetna® used GIS technology to identify Medicare Advantage members facing extreme heat, enabling care managers to reach out and offer education and support.

We also use the same framework to support our colleagues. In a six-month period, our enterprise resiliency team captured more than 3,500 incident alerts with a high degree of accuracy using GIS technology, resulting in more than alert notifications to colleagues to warn them of potential emergencies. GIS technology has also helped us track the locations of the wildfires in Los Angeles, Ventura and San Diego counties in near real time, while enabling proactive outreach to the over 12,000 colleagues who lived in impacted areas.

The CVS Health app can help customers prepare for extreme weather conditions. Customers who use the CVS Health app can now receive push notifications to help prepare for poor air quality and snowstorms. Those who have opted in to receive notifications can click into the app for a curated list of products and content related to the weather. Learn more about the CVS Health app.

Weather and health are tied closely to one another. Building and enhancing our environmental resiliency infrastructure allows us to serve people when they need it most during adverse weather.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:06:15.016593

The CEO of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman says the decision by Canadian retailers to remove U.S. alcohol from shelves to protest President Donald Trump's trade policies is more damaging to the company’s finances than the actual tariffs.

In the spirit maker’s quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Lawson Whiting said blocking consumers from buying American-made products in Canada or other countries is a crushing blow for U.S. companies.

“That’s worse than a tariff because it’s literally taking your sales away completely, removing our products on the shelves,” Whiting told investors. “That’s a very disproportionate response to a 25% tariff.”

Whiting said while Canada only accounts for 1% of Brown-Forman’s sales, the company is more concerned about the potential impact of broader tariffs in the European Union. The CEO said the Kentucky-based alcohol maker is planning for the possibility of similar retaliatory measures by EU countries.

Morgan Stanley analyst Eric Serotta said in a note to investors that tariffs would pose unique challenges for Brown-Forman, with the effects likely to linger. He added that 55% of the liquor manufacturer’s sales come from outside the U.S., and bourbon laws require domestic production so it cannot be produced internationally.

Robert Moskow, an analyst with TD Cowen, expressed concern that other U.S. products could be at risk.

“Given the early response we've seen in Canada, we wouldn't be surprised if aggressive U.S. trade policy leads to consumer boycotts on other American brands beyond whiskey (Budweiser, Hershey, Heinz),” he told investors.

Earlier this week, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario — one of the biggest importers of American alcohol to Canada, representing 3,600 products — said in a statement it “ceased the purchase of all U.S. products.” The group is advising Canadians to purchase products manufactured in Canada.

The tariff situation is quickly evolving.

The White House on Thursday postponed the enactment of 25% tariffs imposed on some goods from Canada and Mexico for one month amid concerns about the potential economic fallout. But approximately 62% of products imported from Canada would continue to face tariffs because they do not comply with United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, the AP reported.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:06:56.006050

The civil lawsuits by the DOJ rest on the allegation that the pharmacy chains violated both the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and the False Claims Act (FCA).

The CSA states that narcotics can only be used for “a useful and legitimate medical purpose.” By filling prescriptions that were invalid, the pharmacies “made choices that caused these millions of violations of federal law,” the DOJ alleged in the Walgreens lawsuit. The FCA, for its part, states that entities cannot knowingly present a “false or fraudulent claim” for government payment—either due to “deliberate ignorance” or “reckless disregard” of the claim’s falsehood. The DOJ alleged that by requesting reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid for illegitimate prescriptions, the pharmacies broke the law. They unlawfully dispensed “massive quantities of opioids and other controlled substances to fuel its own profits at the expense of public health and safety,” the lawsuit against CVS stated.

To substantiate its claims, the government unsealed more than 800 pages associated with the civil complaints that included thousands of “false or fraudulent” prescriptions filed by the pharmacy giants between 2012 and 2024, including hundreds written by clinicians known to operate so-called “pill mills.”

In doing so, the pharmacies not only defrauded taxpayers under the FCA but also helped exacerbate the country’s ongoing fatal overdose crisis by routinely dispensing “extremely high doses and excessive quantities of potent opioids that fed dependence and addiction,” the DOJ alleged in its CVS complaint.

The assertion that pharmacies played a role in stoking the opioid epidemic is not new, according to Dorie Apollonio, PhD, MPP, a professor in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).

Pharmacists have an independent legal responsibility under federal law to properly fill prescriptions for controlled substances, but rather than being seen as the critical “backstop of appropriateness of the prescription,” Apollonio said, people tend to think of pharmacists as being limited to “‘lick, stick, count, and pour.’” From the beginning, opioid manufacturers “were not ignorant of the role of pharmacists” in selling their products, she added, and “made a lot of effort to try to convince pharmacists to fill prescriptions they might not have formerly believed that they should.”

The opioid manufacturing industry adopted tactics including offering pharmacists financial incentives and bonuses for filling more and more prescriptions, Apollonio said. But there were also more insidious strategies, like sponsoring continuing medical education sessions for Walgreens’ pharmacists that were led by drug company liaisons. This achieved the dual goal of helping the pharmacist understand the supposed need for high dosage levels and securing exclusive product promotion rights, including “‘guaranteed’ stocking of future products at specific key stores,” according to an email exchange between corporate leaders at Walgreens and opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma, which was cited in the study about improper opioid dispensing practices that Apollonio coauthored. (Purdue has separately paid out billions of dollars in settlements for its role in stoking the opioid epidemic, as have individual members of the Sackler family, who owned a controlling interest in Purdue.)

Academic scholars, such as Marie Chisholm-Burns, PharmD, PhD, MPH, and her former team at University of Tennessee’s Health Science Center College of Pharmacy, have previously pointed to pharmacists’ complicity with the pharmaceutical industry’s “widespread, aggressive marketing campaign advocating long-term use of opioids…which minimized the risks of addiction and overexaggerated benefits.”

Most notably, experts reference the American Pain Society’s 1995 guidelines for acute pain treatment, which encouraged physicians and pharmacists to provide “attentive analgesic care” to patients. The guidelines would later prompt the society’s campaign to treat pain as the “fifth vital sign.” By late 2000, toolkits like one authored by the Veterans Health Administration specifically identified pharmacists as “critical to the development of a reliable and comprehensive understanding of the patient’s pain and associated problems.”

The lawsuits against CVS and Walgreens are not the first for the pharmacy giants. In 2022, 2426 municipalities across all 50 states and 6 additional US territories reached a more than $4.2 billion settlement with CVS for its failure to properly monitor suspicious orders of opiates. Walgreens has made similar settlements, as has Walmart, which operates more than 5000 retail pharmacies.

In contrast to the federal lawsuits—which invoke federal legislation—the state complaints varied in accordance with differences in state legislation.

Many of the state lawsuits cited statutes aimed at preventing consumer fraud. For example, Rhode Island alleged that the pharmacies violated the state’s Deceptive Trade Practices Act by “deceiv[ing] and mislead[ing] prescribers into prescribing and consumers into seeking and taking medically unnecessary and…harmful quantities and strengths of opioids.” In Maryland, Walgreens violated the state’s Consumer Protection Act, for “falsely represent[ing] that the opioids it sold were safe and effective” and failing to undertake “adequate steps to ensure customer safety,” Attorney General Anthony Brown alleged.

Some complaints included additional charges, depending on the particular state law and applicability of additional legislation. For instance, the Rhode Island suit alleged that the pharmacies violated the state’s public nuisance law by “failing to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against diversion of opioids.” The Washington state suit also claimed that several pharmacies violated public nuisance law by contributing to the opiate crisis in a manner “unreasonable and harmful to the health of Washingtonians” that “interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life.”

The settlements have had some positive impact, largely by obtaining funds for state efforts to address the opioid crisis. These public health initiatives include providing youth education about the risks of opioid abuse, purchasing and distributing naloxone for overdose prevention, and establishing residential detoxification centers, according to an opioid settlement spending tracker maintained by the National Academy for State Health Policy.

The settlement money has also contributed to building out infrastructure for public health surveillance related to opioid misuse. For example, according to the Federation of State Medical Boards, every state now maintains a prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) designed to deter opioid abuse and diversion. However, as it stands, studies show that the breadth—and enforcement—of PDMPs varies considerably state-to-state in ways that can lead to unintended consequences, like inappropriately “dumping” patients who depend on long-term opioids for pain relief.

If the DOJ is successful in its lawsuits—what Peter Neronha, JD, attorney general of Rhode Island, calls an attempt to “get their pound of financial flesh”—the funds may serve to supplement these inconsistently effective efforts. Although Neronha said he was unsure how it could work, he suggested fashioning the settlements “in some way to reach Americans directly” as opposed to allowing that money to flow back to federal agencies without earmarking for specific or regional initiatives.

Scholars like Joshua Sharfstein, MD, and Sara Whaley, MPH, MSW, both at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, have raised other concerns related to ineffective use of opioid settlement money.

Often, funds are spent right away, “squandering the chance to invest in programs for the long-term,” or they are spent on ineffective or unproven programs, Sharfstein and a coauthor wrote in a 2020 article in JAMA. Similarly, they noted, authorities responsible for spending these funds frequently fail to develop systems that can evaluate on an ongoing basis whether the programs are actually working.

What the settlements do stand to provide is better public knowledge of pharmacies’ role in the crisis. A West Virginia lawsuit, for example, uncovered considerable flaws in CVS’s ability to effectively monitor suspicious orders: an algorithm purported to reduce human error in prescription surveillance was ultimately determined to render analyses that were “for the most part, irrelevant and pointless.”

As for Walgreens, recent litigation revealed that the pharmacy used an “honor system” rather than conducting regular audits of pharmacists’ prescribing patterns—even as there was a “general sense that Walgreens pharmacies may be lacking in some compliance areas.” The lawsuit further identified numerous examples in which patients died of overdoses shortly after filling their prescriptions at Walgreens—and whose autopsies noted intoxication with the very medications they’d been dispensed just a few days prior.

Depending on how federal lawyers choose to pursue the cases, a variety of documents—from emails to board minutes to memos—could further “shed light on what the business practices were” at US pharmacy giants, Neronha said. Those kinds of details could prompt new approaches to monitoring, regulation, enforcement, and future litigation. (The Opioid Industry Documents Archive, a collaboration between Johns Hopkins and UCSF, contains more than 22 million pages from 4 million internal corporate documents obtained in part through litigation.)

But transparency related to historic practices alongside a well-spent national financial settlement may not necessarily mean substantive, or durable, change in the opioid crisis when day-to-day operations of individual pharmacies are not standardized. For instance, research by Apollonio’s team suggests that such procedures as those surrounding “red flag” prescriptions vary immensely between stores, even when owned by the same parent chain.

Furthermore, states have had a limited ability to enact injunctions against harmful actions, beyond garnering financial payments for damages. Studies on other forms of litigation of large-scale public health concerns—including tobacco, asbestos, and lead paint—have likewise demonstrated that efforts to prohibit illegal and detrimental practices have historically taken a back seat to financial remuneration.

And, according to investigations by organizations like the Ohio Board of Pharmacy (OBP), the conditions that led to regularly filling problematic and dangerous prescriptions are deeply ingrained in large chain pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens.

In 2021, data published by the OBP found that 49% of more than 2900 CVS pharmacists across the state disagreed that they had “adequate time to complete [their] job in a safe and effective manner,” and 88% agreed that they “feel pressure” by their employer or supervisor to “meet standards or metrics that may interfere with safe patient care.” Insufficient staffing was also common at chain pharmacies and negatively affected patient care, according to nearly half of respondents.

“Company focus on metrics makes the current practice of pharmacy unsafe and results in high risk of errors,” one respondent wrote. “We are constantly expected to ‘do more’ with less.”

In February 2024, OBP took steps to address these patterns through a settlement with CVS that placed 8 of the pharmacy’s storefronts in the state on probation and, among other provisions, required the chain to address understaffing and reduce the use of quotas to incentivize pharmacist behavior.

Still, according to Cameron McNamee, OBP’s policy and communications director, these actions alone are not enough. The real question, he said, is whether the federal litigation can lead to widespread systematic changes at pharmacies, including changes that state agencies themselves lack the jurisdiction or authority to make.

“The pharmacists are the gatekeepers—they have the keys to the kingdom, and they’re that last stop for the patient,” McNamee said. “They have that obligation [to protect patients] under the law, but whether they follow it is a different story.”

As we enter March, the corporate world continues to gear up for the imminent 2025 peak season. Starbucks Corp’s AGM, scheduled for 12 March 2025, is a key meeting in the first half of the month where shareholders will vote on five shareholder proposals.

In this blog Minerva Analytics’ ESG Shareholder Analyst Daniel Kehoe examines Starbucks’ upcoming meeting and what shareholders can expect later this month.

Shareholders have filed five resolutions at Starbucks’ AGM this year, with three of them being ‘shadow proposals’ filed by anti-ESG organisations. This is in line with Minerva’s recent blog post on upcoming shareholder proposals which also identified anti-ESG proposals at Apple’s and Deere & Co’s AGMs.

The five proposals are:

Item 4: a request for an annual report on discrimination risks related to charitable giving filed by Bower Research (anti-ESG proponent)

Item 5: a request for the adoption of a policy requiring the board chair be independent filed by the New York State Common Retirement Fund and The Accountability Board

Item 6: a request for a report on human rights risks related to labor organizing filed by the National Legal and Policy Center (anti-ESG proponent)

Item 7: a request for disclosure on cage-free egg commitments in China and Japan filed by The Human Society

Item 8: a request for an annual emissions congruency report by the National Center for Public Policy Research (anti-ESG proponent)

As an example of a ‘shadow proposal’, which uses similar wording to a pro-ESG proposal but with a political and anti-ESG angle and supporting statement, item 6 takes the approach that Starbucks faces risks posed by antagonistic union organisers.

These could result in Starbucks capitulating to their demands, which may threaten the rights of many of the company’s employees and could diminish shareholder returns.

This stands in contrast to the successful shareholder proposal at Starbucks’ 2023 AGM which asked for an independent third-party assessment of the company’s adherence to its stated commitment to workers’ freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. The proposal received 51.35% votes in favour and was filed and voted on amidst backdrop of allegations that Starbucks interfered with US workers’ right to organise.

Starbucks’ AGM has seen the number of shareholder proposals, and ratio of their shareholder proposals shift towards anti-ESG proposals in recent years. A similar trend was identified at Apple Inc recently, where all four shareholder proposals voted on were filed by anti-ESG organisations.

The debate around ESG and shareholder proposals is taking place in a new political and regulatory environment this year.

With Donald Trump returning to office, we have already seen the new administration make changes in several areas, as his office has already terminated DEI-related policies in the Federal Government and withdrew from the Paris Agreement.

Additionally, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also changed its legal guidance on the shareholder proposal review process and under what conditions a company can exclude a shareholder proposal from consideration in its proxy statement.

The SEC has also moved to drop its climate disclosure requirements for companies and introduced new rules on filing Schedule 13D disclosures for investors who engage on ESG issues. Given the evolving political and regulatory landscape, coupled with the recent surge in anti-ESG activism, shareholder proposals are expected to remain a highly polarised and contentious issue throughout 2025

As Minerva continues to monitor these developments, it will be intriguing to observe how Starbucks and their shareholders respond to the proposals. Historically, anti-ESG shareholder proposals have tended to receive low levels of support

Be sure to check back soon for our next upcoming shareholder proposal blog, which will cover the second half of March. We will be looking at some key upcoming AGMs and proposals, including Walt Disney, A.P. Møller-Mærsk, and several major Nordic banks such as Danske Bank, Nordea Bank, Svenska Handelsbanken, and Swedbank.

Reasons Favoring Ecolab’s Growth

Strong Product Portfolio with Focus on R&D: Ecolab’s diverse product portfolio across water treatment, hygiene, life sciences, digital solutions, and pest elimination is a key competitive advantage reinforced by consistent R&D investments. The global water treatment systems market, valued at $38.56 billion in 2023, is projected to grow at an 8.1% CAGR through 2030, offering significant growth potential.

Ecolab's innovative products, like the 3D TRASAR AI Dishmachine Program and Ecolab 3D Cloud platform, leverage IoT and AI to optimize performance and resource efficiency. The company's ultra-purification portfolio, expanded through the Purolite acquisition, addresses rising demand in biopharmaceutical and gene therapy manufacturing. Management's commitment to innovation and CapEx-driven growth strategy positions Ecolab as a technological leader in high-margin, high-growth sectors.

Ecolab’s Global High Tech Business & Digital Platform: Ecolab’s Global High Tech business and Ecolab Digital Platform are two key high-growth, high-margin engines driving the company's transformation. The Global High Tech business, serving data centers and microelectronics industries, surpassed $300 million in annual sales with 20%+ operating margins, leveraging rising demand for liquid cooling systems amid AI-powered infrastructure growth.

Meanwhile, the Ecolab Digital Platform integrates IoT devices, AI software, and cloud analytics across 100,000+ customer systems, optimizing water usage, energy efficiency, and hygiene compliance while generating recurring revenue streams. Capturing over 120 billion data points in 2024, the platform enhances service productivity and margin expansion by enabling remote monitoring and predictive maintenance.

Strong Q4 Results: Ecolab’s solid fourth-quarter 2024 results buoy optimism. The company registered a robust year-over-year uptick in its top and bottom lines, along with solid performances across most of its segments. The expansion of both margins bodes well for the stock.

Per management, growth in the United States (ECL’s largest and most profitable region) continued to be strong, and growth across the rest of the world was also solid as the company was able to offset uneven macroeconomic trends. This looked promising for the stock. In the fourth quarter, ECL’s gross and operating margin expanded 135 and 141 basis points, respectively. This bodes well for the stock.

A Factor That May Offset ECL’s Gains

Macroeconomic Factors: Ecolab's operations across 170 countries expose it to geopolitical, economic, and currency-related risks. The company limited its Russian business to essential life-supporting operations amid the Ukraine conflict, impacting revenue and potentially scaling back further based on future developments. Past disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain challenges, inflation, and high interest rates have also pressured profitability. In 2025, currency translation is expected to reduce reported sales by 3% and adjusted EPS by 4%, posing a headwind that could disproportionately affect margins in lower-profit international markets despite improvements in core business performance.

Estimate Trend

Ecolab is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2025. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 18 cents north to $7.54 per share.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $3.7 billion, indicating a 1.4% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

Shares of the supermarket train rose 5% in early trading on the forecast that came amid uncertainties following an abrupt ousting of long-time chief executive Rodney McMullen earlier in the week, as well as escalating trade tensions.

CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram said, “The forecast was strong, in our view, especially given heightened uncertainties this year.”

Kroger has also been dealing with the termination of a two-year effort to buy rival Albertsons after courts blocked the $25 billion deal.

Albertsons subsequently sued Kroger, alleging breach of contract that led to the deal’s demise.

The Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocer has, however, been benefitting from capitalising on strong e-commerce demand by offering customers convenient curb side pick-up and faster order delivery.

This helped the company better compete with retailers Walmart, Target and Amazon.

It forecast growth in full-year identical sales, excluding fuel, in the range of 2% to 3%, compared with analysts’ average estimate of a 1.96% rise, according to data compiled by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).

It also projected 2025 adjusted earnings of $4.60 to $4.80 per share, compared with estimates of $4.79.

US big-box retailers – unlike Kroger – have taken a cautious stance, fearing weak economic data and uncertainty around consumer spending as trade wars spark concerns of a deceleration in the American economy.

Kroger’s pharmacy business has been a bright spot, boosted by sales for GLP-1 medications, used for both weight loss and managing chronic conditions such as diabetes.

In fact, officials said, CVS's departure may help mom-and-pop pharmacies and other operations like Valley Health Partners.
Those patients can also opt to fill prescriptions at any other CVS Pharmacy, or the pharmacy of their choice.
Boateng said customers may see a bit of difference in the setup of the Valley Health Partners pharmacy as opposed to a regular retail pharmacy.
“It's just huge, and our residents would really, really be in a bad spot if Valley Health Partners was not coming into the South Side,” Pintabone said.","EASTON, Pa. — South Side Easton will soon lose a CVS Pharmacy, but officials say a new federally qualified health center will help provide residents with access to prescriptions by this summer.

In a statement this week, an official from CVS confirmed its location at 620 Old Philadelphia Road will shutter its doors on April 16.

That raises concern among some Easton residents who have relied on the location to obtain their medications.

The announcement comes amidst thousands of closings for CVS pharmacies and health care clinics, which could significantly impact hundreds of thousands if not millions of customers.

But Easton City Councilman Frank Pintabone and Valley Health Partners reassured the community that the South Side soon will see the arrival of Valley Health Partners’ federally qualified health center look-alike.

It will offer prescription services and some retail, with an anticipated opening this summer.

In fact, officials said, CVS's departure may help mom-and-pop pharmacies and other operations like Valley Health Partners.

According to the statement issued by CVS Health Corporate Communications Manager Kara Page, current prescription at the South Side location will be transferred to the CVS at 1520 Northampton St. to ensure uninterrupted access to medication.

Those patients can also opt to fill prescriptions at any other CVS Pharmacy, or the pharmacy of their choice.

'They do have a pharmacy'

Employees at the South Side location have been offered comparable roles within the company, Page’s message states.

""Store closure decisions are based on several factors, including population shifts, consumer buying patterns, store and pharmacy density, pharmacy care access, and community health needs,"" Page’s statement reads.

""We’re focused on ensuring we have the right kinds of stores and the right number of stores in the right locations. We’ll continue to provide the community with outstanding service at the five CVS Pharmacy locations remaining in Easton.

""We also offer prescription delivery [same day and 1- and 2-day options] to eligible patients through CVS.com and the CVS Pharmacy app to provide additional convenient access to medications.”

Meanwhile, Pintabone and Valley Health Partners Community Health Center Vice President Nate Boateng are looking to a future where South Siders won’t have to travel much further to get their prescriptions.

“A lot of our residents, particularly our elderly residents and most vulnerable residents, are a little upset and distraught,” Pintabone said.

“First of all, they're still saying that we lost the bank for the first time ever. We don't have a bank in South Side, and now we don't have a pharmacy in South Side.

""So I was happy to be able to inform them or remind them that Valley Health Partners, a full-service medical facility, is coming to South Side at 440 Lincoln St., and they do have a pharmacy.”

'Dialed back offering' detailed

Valley Health Partners has several locations throughout Allentown and in Monroe County, but it said its new location on Lincoln Street will provide easier access to prescriptions and medical services to people in Easton’s South Side.

That includes primary care, pediatrics, vision and dental services.

Boateng said that if the plan goes as scheduled, the clinics could take patients as soon as mid-May, and the pharmacy will see a soft opening on June 27.

A grand opening event currently is set for late August.

Boateng said customers may see a bit of difference in the setup of the Valley Health Partners pharmacy as opposed to a regular retail pharmacy.

“What you get at a larger, sort of chain retail pharmacy, are sort of a for-profit pharmacy, essentially,"" Boateng said. ""You can generally get groceries or shampoo, those kinds of supplies, taxable retail items

“We will offer sort of a more dialed-back version, since we're a nonprofit organization, so it'll be a more dialed-back offering.

""But it will be a full-service pharmacy in terms of prescription medications, along with some over-the-counter medications, cold medicine, and things like that you would typically get at a pharmacy.”

'We're excited'

Pintabone said the location for the pharmacy is convenient for South Siders, as it is right by the Dollar General Plus, a retail staple for many day-to-day items.

For those seeking care through the medical side, Boateng said those without insurance can get assistance in the form of a sliding fee scale, financial assistance programs and consultations with staff to apply for Pennie, or Pennsylvania Health Insurance.

“We have lots of programs to make sure that anyone who walks through our doors can afford care, and so we're excited to bring that to the South Side community,” Boateng said.

Pintabone said the new pharmacy is pivotal for a neighborhood that has a sizable aging population who may not be interested in excessive traveling for medications and doctors’ appointments.

Delivery services also will be available for those unable to travel at all, Pintabone said.

“It's just huge, and our residents would really, really be in a bad spot if Valley Health Partners was not coming into the South Side,” Pintabone said.

Boateng said that because 1 in 10 Americans relies on a community health center for care, “we try and fill gaps where those health care gaps exist.”

Pintabone and Boateng added the new facility will require additional staff, and Valley Health Partners is looking at the local community to help fill those roles.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:06:26.241241

In this article, we are going to take a look at where United Parcel Service, Inc.’s (NYSE:UPS) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer looked at recently.

On Wednesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the volatile trading day, pointing out that President Donald Trump’s actions are reshaping how investors assess stocks. Cramer highlighted that before Trump came into the office, his method of evaluating a stock was looking at its price, earnings, revenues, and gross margins.

“Now, though, I start with a simple question: Can President Trump hurt the stock? Can he damage it with an offhanded comment? Can he crush it in anger? And most important, does the price-to-earnings multiple make sense in this new world in light of the president’s love of tariffs and total hostility to the way this country’s been running the past, not to mention many of our country’s friends?”

Cramer specifically pointed to the automotive industry as a significant example of how Trump’s approach to trade has shifted the dynamics of the market. He recalled how the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was originally created, partly to protect the U.S. auto industry from the influx of low-cost imports from countries like Japan and South Korea.

“Without NAFTA, auto companies couldn’t compete against the flood of imports from Japan and South Korea, which only have a 2.5% tariff on them. The tariffs President Trump slapped on American companies that import products from Mexico or Canada, 10 times that.”

Cramer also acknowledged that the recent pause in tariffs for the auto industry caused a brief surge in market activity, which led to some unpredictability in stock movements. However, he noted that if automakers are forced to either pay the hefty tariffs or shift their production to the U.S., replacing inexpensive labor in Mexico with higher-cost union labor, their earnings could face a sharp decline. Cramer speculated that such a scenario could result in a significant cut in earnings, though he hoped the impact would not be as severe.

“Here’s the bottom line: This market is fiercely trying to revalue stocks because of the president’s comments. And we do it day after day after day because he’s always making so much news. So it’s been doing a poor job and that’s created a ton of opportunities for you to both buy and sell and I say you take them right away.”

Quality Bias Drove Resilience, Outperformance

Market Overview

Despite initial signs of market broadening following Donald Trump's election victory and further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, the market reverted to the narrow mega cap growth leadership that characterized most of 2024. Outside this group, market action was more subdued, with the benchmark Russell 1000 Value Index returning -1.98%, about 900 basis points behind its growth counterpart. Potentially reflationary policies from the Trump administration, such as tariffs, and slight upticks in inflation put upward pressure on longer-term interest rates, causing weakness in economically sensitive and rate-sensitive sectors.

2024 presented a number of challenges for the ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy due to the narrow market breadth, the strong performance of specific thematic growth stocks and the sluggish economy. Our diversified, valuation-sensitive approach struggled in this environment. Stock selection, typically a strong point for our Strategy, detracted from performance, especially due to certain technology and health care stocks like Intel (INTC), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and CVS.

Despite these setbacks, we remain confident in our long-term process of investing in high-quality franchises within durable, growing markets at reasonable valuations. We believe this approach will drive sustained outperformance over time. Notably, the Strategy showed improvement in the fourth quarter, demonstrating resilience and potential for recovery as the market began to normalize.

Our quality bias in materials and utilities stood out the most in a quarter that saw a reversal of some of 2024's themes. Materials was the worst performer in the benchmark, though we tend to avoid the highly commoditized businesses that led the selloff. Relative outperformance among utilities came from not owning AI-levered power companies, which sold off, and by our large active weight in Sempra (SRE), a well-positioned diversified utility likely to benefit from a Republican energy policy and growing LNG demand, both for export and domestic production.

Our overweight in financials, with a focus on payments and consumer finance companies like Visa (V), Capital One (COF) and American Express (AXP), proved beneficial. These firms, along with banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC), gained from economic resilience, robust consumer spending, yield curve normalization and the anticipated reduction in regulatory pressures from the incoming administration. Adhering to our valuation discipline, we trimmed positions in American Express and JPMorgan Chase, primarily due to their strong performance.

Detractors came mainly from the health care sector. Elevated utilization trends, lower Medicare Advantage rates, and more generous MA benefits broadly across the industry materially pressured profitability of CVS and, to a lesser extent, UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Ongoing Medicaid redeterminations resulted in increased acuity of remaining Medicaid members, leading to increased pressure on Medicaid profitability, with Elevance Health (ELV) being the most exposed among our holdings. Potential regulatory pressures on pharmacy benefit managers also weighed on CVS Health and UnitedHealth Group, while the latter's managed care business, along with that of Elevance, was pressured by increased medical care ratio increases. We elected to exit our marginal position in Elevance in the quarter, given relatively higher exposure to Medicaid, typically a target for Republican administrations, and redeployed some of the proceeds in CVS and UnitedHealth.

The largest relative detractor was the information technology sector, particularly Microchip Technology. The company announced a change in CEO, lowered its revenue guidance and revealed manufacturing restructuring plans, which collectively pressured the stock at year-end. The embedded semiconductor industry is experiencing a significant cyclical downturn as customers deplete inventories they had stockpiled during the COVID-era chip shortages. While this has negatively impacted Microchip's near-term financials, we believe that its large and fragmented customer base (~120,000 customers and several thousand SKUs) and sticky products will allow it to maintain pricing and market share once a recovery materializes. We took advantage of the weakness to add to our position, confident that Microchip is a well-positioned, scaled player in the analog/microcontroller market with the potential for higher margins in the long term.

Portfolio Positioning

In a very skewed market in 2024, we saw a large valuation divergence that provided opportunities for our process as high-quality companies simply weren't attracting capital. In the fourth quarter, we added to out-of-favor defensive holdings such as PepsiCo (PEP) and Becton Dickinson (BDX), appreciating their lower economic sensitivity and reasonable valuations. We also added to Deere (DE), which we had trimmed aggressively in 2023 as the agriculture cycle was in its later stages. We added to it during the period at what we view as very reasonable valuations based on what look like trough earnings. Deere's competitive advantages, such as distribution scale and tech stack, continue to manifest in sustainably higher profitability through the cycle, relative to peers and its own history. At the same time, we maintained our valuation discipline and reduced exposure to Oracle (ORCL) and Broadcom (AVGO). Both companies benefited from robust AI spending, Oracle on the infrastructure side and Broadcom on the custom silicon side, as well as a well-executed VMware acquisition.

Outlook

As the U.S. political landscape shifts, we are reminded why we try to own resilient, durable franchises that can withstand various uncertainties and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term. We anticipate a potentially more business-friendly environment under the new administration in the coming four years, which would support economic growth and a broadening of the market. The ISM Manufacturing PMI has been in contraction territory for some time; should that trend reverse, capital that has been on the sidelines may find more incentive to enter the market. We believe there are pockets that would benefit, perhaps those overlooked in the narrow market of 2023 and 2024, more than others. Given already-stretched investor optimism amid a variety of indeterminate risks, volatility is likely to create opportunities for disciplined investors with an eye on long-term value creation.

Portfolio Highlights

The ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy outperformed its Russell 1000 Value Index benchmark during the fourth quarter. On an absolute basis, the Strategy had positive contributions from four of the 11 sectors in which it was invested for the quarter. The financials sector contributed the most, while the health care, materials, and IT sectors were the main detractors.

On a relative basis, overall stock selection and sector allocation effects contributed to outperformance. In particular, stock selection in the materials, utilities and financials sectors helped relative returns. Conversely, stock selection in the IT sector and a materials overweight detracted.

On an individual stock basis, the largest contributors were JPMorgan Chase, Broadcom, XPO, McKesson (MCK), and Capital One. Positions in Microchip Technology, CVS Health, Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), UnitedHealth Group, and Elevance Health were the main detractors.

A bipartisan bill reintroducing mandatory country-of-origin labelling (MCOOL) for beef has been revived in the US Senate. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and John Thune (R-SD) reintroduced the “American Beef Labeling Act” on 5 February 2025, aiming to restore transparency in beef product labelling.

MCOOL was initially introduced in the 2002 Farm Bill but was removed in 2016 after the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that US labelling requirements for beef and pork violated trade agreements. Without MCOOL, imported beef can be labelled as a “product of the USA” even if only processed or packaged domestically.

The proposed legislation directs the US Trade Representative (USTR) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop a WTO-compliant plan for reinstating MCOOL within six months of enactment, followed by another six months for implementation. USDA regulations require country-of-origin labelling for other commodities, including chicken, lamb, fish, nuts, and fresh produce.

If passed, the legislation could impact processors, suppliers, and retailers, requiring accurate labelling to reflect the entire supply chain. Ranchers may also face new certification requirements detailing where livestock were born and raised. With the current Farm Bill set to expire in September 2025, beef production and processing businesses should closely monitor developments.

HPE set to axe up to 3,000 workers

Reducing its workforce is estimated to cost HPE about $350 million over the next two years, the company confirmed, but it hopes to see the benefits by 2027.

""We are pleased that we met our revenue guidance estimate as we navigated the quarter,” HPE CFO Marie Myers said, noting the company generated $7.9 billion in its most recent three-month period, ending January 31 2025.

“We took actions in the quarter to streamline costs, which helped us offset other impacts to profitability. We continue to align our strategy and execution with long-term growth trends that will fuel our performance,” Myers added.

HPE says it anticipates revenue of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion in the next quarter – even the higher figure would mark a drop.

Although AI-driven demand has surged, costly AI components have led to lower-than-ideal margins. HPE also ended up with excess inventory when Nvidia transitions to Blackwell GPUs, adding unnecessarily to the cost with heavy discounts for both dated and less headline-grabbing traditional servers.

HPE isn’t the only business in the family struggling – parent company HP also laid off around 2,000 workers just a few weeks ago.

The company is also facing non-financial struggles – despite EU approval, both UK and US antitrust regulators have expressed concern over HPE’s planned $14 billion acquisition of Juniper. If it goes ahead, the Department of Justice alleges the two combined companies would account for “well over” 70% of the market.

An HPE spokesperson shared with us the company's official statement: ""As part of our Q1 FY25 earnings, we announced cost savings measures the company will undertake to further strengthen our financial profile by better aligning our cost structure to our business mix and long-term strategy.

""We plan to reduce our employee base by roughly 5 percent over the next 12 to 18 months through the reduction of approximately 2,500 positions and expected attrition. These are not easy decisions to make, and we will treat all transitions with compassion.""

The Friday Checkout is a weekly column providing more insight on the news, rounding up the announcements you may have missed and sharing what’s to come.

Barely three months ago, the CEOs of Kroger and Albertsons appeared to be in lockstep, united in their conviction that the best way forward for their companies was to come together as one supermarket company.

Instead, Rodney McMullen and Vivek Sankaran’s shared vision imploded when the grocers’ controversial merger plan crashed into a regulatory brick wall — a spectacular flameout that perhaps foreshadowed the sudden announcements on a single day this week that McMullen is out at Kroger and Sankaran will retire from Albertsons in May.

Kroger has sought to project an air of calm despite the upheaval it is dealing with, moving ahead with an earnings call just three days after its announcement on Monday that McMullen had resigned following an investigation into unspecified ethical violations unrelated to the business. The company assured investors on Thursday that it is primed for growth, laying out robust plans to invest in new stores and forecasting steady sales during the rest of the year.

Albertsons, on the other hand, quickly followed up Sankaran’s pronouncement in December that the company was financially strong by rolling out an aggressive cost-cutting program. The grocer also recently disclosed that it is closing stores and laying off corporate workers. While those kinds of austerity measures may be par for the course in corporate America, they nevertheless paint a picture of uncertainty for Albertsons as it searches for stability. Susan Morris, the company’s chief operating officer, who will take over Sankaran’s role, has a difficult job on her hands.

Could this week’s unexpected changes at the top be just the jolts Kroger and Albertson needed to take control of their futures?

Kroger accounts for about 16% of total U.S. grocery visits, but the grocer’s share of total grocery visits varies by state — and some banners are more popular than others, according to newly released data from Placer.ai. The company’s Food 4 Less and King Soopers banners led the company’s portfolio in 2024, with both chains seeing growth in visits compared to 2023, the data firm found.

Because of Bitcoin’s popularity, financial institutions worldwide now review their positions regarding digital currencies. The banking sector in the United Kingdom maintains reserved behavior toward Bitcoin as they handle the struggle between regulatory rules and their users’ increasing interest.

The banking sector in Britain has exhibited skepticism about cryptocurrency for many years because it fears volatility alongside fraud and money laundering risks. The worldwide acceptance of Bitcoin creates ideal conditions for British banks to consider cryptocurrency adoption.

The Current Bitcoin price is a fundamental factor determining how banking entities handle cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency demands that UK financial organizations examine the future market value potential and market instability when deciding to embrace digital assets during rapid price increases. The state of the Bitcoin connection with British banks stands at an important transformation point due to rising institutional attention and regulatory framework adjustments.

The Historical Resistance of UK Banks Toward Bitcoin

British banking institutions have displayed apprehension toward cryptocurrencies throughout most of Bitcoin’s operational history. Financial institutions across the United Kingdom have imposed transaction restrictions on customers who want to deal with digital assets because they remain concerned about money laundering risks, fraudulent acts, and lack of consumer protection. The biggest British banks, such as HSBC, Lloyds, and Barclays, have restricted Bitcoin transaction access through exchange purchases for their customers.

Banks do not want to engage with Bitcoin transactions because regulatory challenges create uncertainty. The Financial Conduct Authority, as the UK’s main financial supervisor, has compressed cryptocurrency business operations by blocking consumer access to derivatives while issuing alerts warning about digital asset risk. The concern for regulatory compliance caused banks to select cautious behavior against Bitcoin platform membership.

UK Banks Show Developing Positive Interest in Cryptocurrencies

Current evidence points to a transformative attitude shift among UK banking institutions toward their Bitcoin-related policies. The growing number of customers demanding Bitcoin because it serves as both an investment tool and a method of financial independence drives UK banks towards positive changes in their Bitcoin strategies. British banks understand that total crypto market exclusion becomes ill-advised because institutional hedge funds, together with asset funds and government entities, now actively embrace Bitcoin.

The banking institution Barclays removed some regulatory obstacles concerning crypto transactions during 2022, thus permitting users to access deposit and withdrawal services from authorized cryptocurrency exchanges. Standard Chartered introduced a cryptocurrency trading operation that lets institutional market participants access Bitcoin markets and alternative digital currency markets. The banking sector in the UK has started moving away from its former all-encompassing distrustful stance towards cryptocurrency.

For example, fintech companies began their entry into the market as a leading change in the industry. The UK challenger bank ecosystem includes Revolut and Monzo, allowing customers to operate with Bitcoin through their application platform. Traditional banking institutions face customer attrition pressure as fintech firms accept digital assets, encouraging banks to adopt a different stance.

The Role of Regulation in Bitcoin Adoption by UK Banks

The lack of regulatory clarity is the main challenge for British banks in fully adopting Bitcoin as a platform. The UK government continues to advance its strategy to offer defined regulatory frameworks that support the cryptocurrency market. The Treasury revealed in 2022 its vision to develop the UK into an international cryptocurrency innovation leader through stablecoin regulation and blockchain technology examination for financial service applications.

The Bank of England now exhibits open intent about Bitcoin by declaring that the system presents no current risk to FinTech infrastructure yet maintains active crypto market oversight. The central bank operates experiments on digital pound creation because such digital currency development would enable broader connections between traditional finance and cryptocurrency systems.

The forthcoming regulatory framework will reduce British banks’ concerns regarding regulatory repercussions when they conduct business with Bitcoin. A regulatory system that protects consumers and promotes innovation will establish the speed at which British banks integrate cryptocurrency into their operations.

The Future of Bitcoin in the UK Banking Sector

UK banking institutions continue to improve their Bitcoin policies, leading to a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency throughout financial industry operations. Banks might provide Bitcoin custody services that permit them to protect digital assets they hold as clients’ representatives. The financial institutions Fidelity and BNY Mellon have started Bitcoin custody solutions, but British banking organizations may adopt these services to keep up with the interests of institutional clients.

The expansion of Bitcoin trading services will become part of traditional banking platforms as a possible future development. Central UK banks plan to introduce Bitcoin investment products, which will become available to retail and institutional clients through their platforms. Implementing this solution would allow customers to safely participate in Bitcoin market trades under regulatory supervision without requiring external exchange use.

As Bitcoin’s payment infrastructure develops further, it will likely boost United Kingdom banking institutions’ embrace of the new technology. More Bitcoin payment acceptance by merchants will push financial institutions toward finding solutions to Bitcoin transaction management, including adopting direct crypto payment gateways and blockchain company partnerships to create convenient payment options.

British banks have traditionally shown reluctance toward Bitcoin, but the current market environment indicates their growing openness to accepting it. Financial institutions are now examining new ways to work with cryptocurrency technology because regulatory definitions and customer cryptocurrency interest are strengthening. The digital asset revolution becomes more challenging for British banks to avoid as fintech companies and global institutions adopt Bitcoin and lead the industry change.

The path toward Bitcoin adoption by UK banking institutions remains long but advancing, as demonstrated by recent advancements in this process. Bitcoin will grow significantly in British finance in the coming years because of its implementation as a means of custody services, trading platforms, and payment integration. The financial dialogue within the United Kingdom now places Bitcoin at its core because banks need to adapt to this transforming environment.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:41:00.423735

The week started out with a bang as news broke that Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen was stepping down from the company’s top spot following an internal investigation into his personal conduct. While Kroger asserts that McMullen’s alleged breach of corporate ethics was not related to the business, including its financial performance, operations, reporting or talent, further information on his ouster has not been forthcoming.

Ron Sargent, lead director of Kroger’s board of directors, was appointed to serve as CEO and chairman of the board on an interim basis. During the company’s Q4 earnings call this week, Sargent said Kroger has hired a nationally recognized search firm and will look at internal and external candidates to replace McMullen on a permanent basis.

Later on Monday, it came to light that Albertsons Cos. CEO Vivek Sankaran was also vacating his top grocery role. Albertsons revealed a CEO succession plan under which Susan Morris, currently EVP and COO, will assume the role of CEO following the planned retirement of Sankaran on May 1. During the transition period, Morris will work closely with Sankaran to continue carrying out the grocer’s Customers for Life strategy. On the effective date, Morris will also join Albertsons’ board of directors, succeeding Sankaran.

2. Publix Faces Deceptive Pricing Lawsuit Amid Q4 Revenue Gains

Readers were interested this week in news that a Florida woman has filed a class action lawsuit against Publix, alleging deceptive pricing practices at self-checkout. The lawsuit claims that Publix manipulated the weights of food products sold by weight — such as meats, cheeses and deli items — through its POS system at five Tampa locations.

The lawsuit is a class action on behalf of all consumers. It asks for damages not only for the plaintiff, but also for all Publix shoppers allegedly overcharged at checkout.

Publix told PG that it ""would be inappropriate for us to comment on pending litigation.""

Meanwhile, the grocer shared this week that its sales for fourth quarter ended Dec. 28 were $15.5 billion, a 5.5% jump from the $14.7 billion logged in 2023. Comparable-store sales increased 4.1%. For fiscal year 2024, Publix’s sales were $59.7 billion, a 4.6% increase from $57.1 billion in 2023. Comps for FY2024 increased by 2.9%.

3. The Looming Threat of Tariffs

President Donald Trump officially implemented 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico on Tuesday. The president also imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, doubling the 10% duty that he placed on Beijing in early February.

By Thursday, however, the president postponed tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month.

The financial burdens of these tariffs, regardless of when or if they take effect, are expected to be passed onto inflation-weary shoppers — especially in America's grocery stores. Leaders from both the National Retail Federation (NRF) and the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) expressed concern over the move.

In a statement, NRF’s EVP of Government Relations David French said: “The decision to impose tariffs on our North American neighbors and two of our largest trading partners is a significant measure. Unfortunately, it is one that will only hurt hardworking Americans and the businesses that strive to provide customers with the products they want and need on a daily basis.

“Tariffs are just one tool at the administration’s disposal to achieve a secure border, and we urge it to explore other options to accomplish the same goals. As long as these tariffs are in place, Americans will be forced to pay higher prices on household goods,” French continued. “We urge the Trump administration and our Canadian and Mexican counterparts to work together to quickly resolve our outstanding border security issues.”

4. BJ’s, Sprouts Plan for Expansion in Key Markets

On the heels of a successful Q4, ever-growing BJ’s Wholesale Club released big plans to expand its footprint over the next two years, opening 25-30 new clubs. Most notably, it has plans for several clubs in the Dallas-Fort Worth area starting in early 2026 – a new market for BJ’s.

“We are eager to continue our expansion by bringing unbeatable value, convenience and assortment to the Dallas-Fort Worth community,” said Bob Eddy, chairman and CEO of BJ’s Wholesale Club. “Economic expansion and a growing population make Texas a great fit for us. We believe our unique club model, which delivers savings of up to 25% off grocery store prices every day, will resonate with the families in this area. We look forward to living our purpose of ‘taking care of the families who depend on us’ in Texas.”

Sprouts Farmers Market, meanwhile, is also readying for expansion. The natural grocer plans to open 35 new stores in FY2025, including at least seven in Florida. Sprouts is also currently preparing new store openings in Colorado and California.

5. Target Aims for $15B in Sales Growth by 2030

While Target CFO Jim Lee reported this week that the company will remain “appropriately cautious” with its expectations for 2025, its leadership and teams are hard at work on strategies and tactics to steer the best performance possible.

Among other business aspects, the retailer is focusing on on-trend affordable assortments, omnichannel discovery, enhanced supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, expanded Target Circle membership and strategic partnerships. Investments in these areas aim to accelerate Target's strategy and drive more than $15 billion in sales growth by 2030.

While Target saw better-than-expected sales and profitability in its fourth quarter, the retailer is anticipating a tough quarter ahead due to consumer uncertainty and the ongoing threat of tariffs.",https://progressivegrocer.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/files/2025-03/friday5march7_teaser.jpg,N,,2025-03-07 12:17:16.048103

Palantir Technologies has suffered a significant setback, closing at $80.46, down $9.67 or 10.73%. The sell-off extended into pre-market trading, with shares dipping further to $79.93, a 0.65% decline.

Why Is Palantir Stock Falling?

Government Spending Cuts Threaten Core Revenue

One of the biggest blows to Palantir’s outlook came after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced proposed defense spending cuts of approximately 8%—a staggering $50 billion reduction. Given Palantir’s heavy reliance on government contracts, these cuts raise serious questions about the sustainability of its revenue streams.

Palantir has enjoyed explosive growth, surging 341% in 2024 amid AI enthusiasm and expanding government partnerships. However, with a valuation exceeding 200 times price-to-sales (P/S), many analysts believe the stock was due for a correction. The broader market shift toward fundamental-driven investing has made such high-multiple stocks particularly vulnerable.

Investor Sentiment: A Divided Market

Analysts Clash Over Palantir’s Future

Opinions on Palantir remain starkly divided. Firms like William Blair maintain an optimistic outlook, citing AI-driven expansion, while others, including Goldman Sachs and Jefferies, caution investors about stretched valuations. This conflicting sentiment has contributed to the stock’s volatility.

Insider Selling Raises Eyebrows

Adding to investor concerns, key insiders—including CEO Alex Karp and Chief Accounting Officer Ryan D. Taylor—have offloaded millions of shares early in 2025. Insider sales at such a crucial time can be interpreted as a lack of confidence in future stock performance, further fueling uncertainty.

AI Partnerships: A Silver Lining?

Despite the downturn, Palantir continues to expand its AI-driven initiatives. Recent collaborations with TWG Global and Société Générale signal the company’s push into finance and anti-money laundering solutions. While these developments show promise, they have yet to offset the broader fears gripping the market.

Macroeconomic Uncertainty and Tech Stock Revaluation

Market-wide trends have also played a role in Palantir’s decline. The reassessment of high-growth tech stocks—particularly those with premium valuations—has been a major factor. While tariffs introduced by President Trump have been discussed, the key drivers of the downturn appear to be macroeconomic shifts and a recalibration of investor sentiment toward more sustainable valuations.

What’s Next for Palantir and Its Stakeholders?

Leadership Changes: A Turning Point?

The company has recently undergone notable leadership shifts, raising questions about future strategy. Investors will be watching closely to see how new executives align with previous growth strategies and whether their leadership stabilizes the company’s trajectory.

New Product Line: A Game Changer or a Risk?

Palantir has unveiled a new product line, aiming to innovate and capture additional market share. However, success will depend on how well these products are received. Strong adoption could boost investor confidence, while disappointing sales may lead to further skepticism about Palantir’s competitive position.

Operational Challenges: Supply Chain and Demand Fluctuations

Supply chain management remains an area of concern. Investors should keep an eye on how effectively Palantir navigates these operational hurdles. Additionally, fluctuations in consumer and enterprise demand will play a crucial role in determining future revenue potential.

Analyst Projections and Market Reaction

Shifts in analyst sentiment will be critical in shaping the stock’s next move. Any upgrades based on positive earnings forecasts could support a rebound, while further downgrades may lead to additional selling pressure.

Final Thoughts: Uncertain Road Ahead for Palantir

While Palantir’s AI-driven future holds promise, current market forces present significant challenges. Investors must weigh long-term growth potential against near-term volatility as the company navigates economic uncertainty, government contract risks, and valuation pressures.",https://www.apnakal.com/market/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DALL·E-2025-03-05-22.17.24-A-dynamic-and-visually-striking-image-depicting-stock-market-news.-The-image-features-a-large-digital-stock-market-ticker-displaying-fluctuating-numbe.jpeg.jpg,N,,2025-03-07 12:20:19.040693

ID21,Kraft Heinz,2025-03-07 15:35:37+00:00,The Drum,‘We will absolutely never sell. Ever’: why Rethink remains fiercely independent,,,,,,https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/03/07/we-will-absolutely-never-sell-ever-why-rethink-remains-fiercely-independent,"Ask chief strategy officer Sean McDonald what fuels Rethink’s success and he’ll point straight to what’s on the shelf.
“Focus on the product and extracting ideas from the brand or the product that brand sells,” he says.
“If you look at many of our Heinz ideas, or our ideas with Ikea and Molson Coors, the product is about 80% of the concept.
Meanwhile, rival Hellmann’s mayonnaise drew flak for putting more emphasis on saving the world than saving sandwiches from tasting bland.
Asked if the agency might ever be snapped up by a holding company, McDonald is crystal clear: “We will absolutely never sell.","Ask chief strategy officer Sean McDonald what fuels Rethink’s success and he’ll point straight to what’s on the shelf. “Focus on the product and extracting ideas from the brand or the product that brand sells,” he says. “If you look at many of our Heinz ideas, or our ideas with Ikea and Molson Coors, the product is about 80% of the concept. We’ve just played with it. We’ve made it weird. We’ve made it unexpected in some way.”

That philosophy drove the now-iconic tilt of the Heinz Ketchup label to show the perfect pouring angle – turning a slow-pouring quirk into an unforgettable global conversation. Meanwhile, rival Hellmann’s mayonnaise drew flak for putting more emphasis on saving the world than saving sandwiches from tasting bland. McDonald jokes, “I’m a Kraft mayonnaise guy anyway, so I have a bias to begin with,” but he’s serious about the risk of drowning out the simple reason people buy in the first place.

“Yes, I think brands should stand for something,” he acknowledges, “but I also think in some ways, the issues we face in the world today aren’t necessarily the kinds of issues that the brands and products we work with can always contribute to. Maybe there’s a realization that there is a limit to where we play a role, and there is a benefit to communicating within the context we exist. I’m not saying it’s not worthwhile; I just think it might do less to stay in your memory when you’re shopping in the aisles.”

Surprisingly, the place that launches such playful ideas is built around a painstaking process. “Spin is sin,” McDonald notes. “We have a process for how we onboard clients so we can have a very candid relationship, a process for how we get to the truths and opportunities we see strategically, and a process for how those carry through into creativity. We’ve been refining ourselves for 25 years. We want to keep friction low and throughput high, so we actually get work out in the world rather than watch it die in a boardroom.”

The next generation of Rethinkers

This emphasis on clarity and consistency has allowed Rethink to forge client relationships often spanning a decade or more – trust and collaboration that keep the creative momentum strong.

Asked if the agency might ever be snapped up by a holding company, McDonald is crystal clear: “We will absolutely never sell. Ever. We have established ourselves structurally not to sell. We spend a lot of time talking about who the next generation of Rethinkers will be. If you’re speaking to me, my legacy is putting people in a position to run this agency when my partners and I aren’t here any more and that’s what I get most excited about.”

He is similarly pragmatic about technology. “I remember math class before I could use a calculator, and I remember advertising before AI,” he says. “We’re impressed by AI, but I don’t think the experience is really different – it just evolves faster. At the end of the day, it’s about strategy and creativity. If a tool helps us get there, great, but it doesn’t replace that spark.”

After nearly 25 years, Rethink’s spark is burning brighter than ever, as its top spot in the independent agency rankings (and near-top placement overall) attests. By letting product truths and a disciplined process guide the work, this Canadian-born success story has become a global force - and shows no sign of slowing down.

As McDonald’s ethos suggests, maybe the easiest way to stand out in a noisy world is to focus on what’s already right in front of us.",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/screenshot_2025-03-07_121716.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-03-07 12:18:50.227031

The minister emphasized that ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India chose Andhra Pradesh for the plant because of the strong trust it has in the leadership of Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and the NDA government.
He expressed confidence that this project would eventually become the largest steel plant in India, driving significant industrial growth in the region.
This substantial project is expected to generate significant economic benefits for Andhra Pradesh, particularly in terms of job creation, infrastructure development, and industrial output.","ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India is set to establish a major integrated steel plant in Andhra Pradesh, with a total investment of Rs 1,47,162 crore. The project, which has been significantly advanced by the efforts of HRD and IT Minister Nara Lokesh, will be constructed in two phases at Nakkapalli mandal, located in Anakapalli district. The plant is anticipated to create around one lakh job opportunities for local residents, offering a substantial boost to the region’s economy.

Industries, Food Processing, and Commerce Minister TG Bharath provided detailed information about the project during the Assembly’s Question Hour on Thursday. The plant will have an overall production capacity of 17.8 million tonnes per annum. The first phase of the project will see an investment of Rs 61,780 crore, and it will be capable of producing 7.3 million tonnes annually. The second phase, with an additional Rs 85,382 crore investment, will increase the production capacity to 10.5 million tonnes per year.

Minister Bharath reflected on the discussions that laid the foundation for the plant. In 2018, during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Minister Lokesh and Aditya Mittal, Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, had a pivotal meeting where they discussed the possibility of setting up the steel plant in Andhra Pradesh. However, due to a change in the political leadership of the state in 2019, the initial plans did not materialize. Despite the setbacks, Lokesh continued to engage with Aditya Mittal, and after the TDP-led NDA government came into power, they were able to reignite the conversation. Minister Bharath stated that the positive response from Mittal following these efforts helped pave the way for the steel plant's establishment.

The minister emphasized that ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India chose Andhra Pradesh for the plant because of the strong trust it has in the leadership of Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and the NDA government. He expressed confidence that this project would eventually become the largest steel plant in India, driving significant industrial growth in the region. Minister Bharath also mentioned that during visits to Davos, both Chief Minister Naidu and Minister Lokesh highlighted the investment opportunities in the state, which helped further the development of the steel plant.

This substantial project is expected to generate significant economic benefits for Andhra Pradesh, particularly in terms of job creation, infrastructure development, and industrial output. The steel plant’s capacity to produce large quantities of steel will not only contribute to the domestic market but also bolster export potential. With the growing interest in the state’s industrial sector, the plant's establishment marks a crucial milestone in Andhra Pradesh’s economic development. The long-term impacts of this project will be felt across multiple sectors, positioning the region as a key player in India’s industrial and manufacturing landscape",https://www.chemanalyst.com/AdminProductImage/arcelormittal-nippon-steel-to-set-up-rs-1-47-lakh-crore-steel-plant-in-andhra-pradesh.jpg,N,,2025-03-07 11:16:39.524730

Richard, who serves as Chief Marketing Officer at ArcelorMittal Packaging Europe, was elected unanimously by the association’s general assembly and succeeds Luc Brantjes of Tata Steel. He brings 30 years of experience in the steel industry to the role and holds a master’s degree in business. His expertise in business area management has led to international assignments, including in Morocco, Russia and the UK.

Richard commented: “I would like to thank Luc Brantjes for his strong leadership during the past two years which have included significant change across the political and regulatory landscapes, as well as important developments within the association itself, such as the appointments of Steve Claus as Secretary General, along with Metka Cavka Luciani and Anastasia Kelesiadou in EU affairs.

“The months ahead are set to be among the most important in recent years for the industry, our association and its members. The adoption of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) has intensified the EU’s focus on industry competitiveness, in addition to highlighting the critical need to align growth with sustainability and innovation.

“Meanwhile, the forthcoming EU Circular Economy Act is set to unify circular economy policies and prioritise sustainable access to critical raw materials.”

Richard went on to discuss this circularity in more detail, connecting it to his role and the future of the packaging industry.

“The production of steel for packaging in the EU has a critical role to play in this and in achieving member states’ circular economy goals, conserving resources and reducing emissions,” he added, “as well as upholding the highest standards of environmental responsibility and regulatory compliance in European manufacturing, as evidenced by the development of Chromium Free Passivation Alternative (CFPA) for tinplate.

“My immediate priority in the coming months will be to ensure we continue to advocate for high-quality recycling and promote separate collection systems across member states while working to ensure EU steel for packaging manufacturing remains competitive on the global market.

“The critical role of packaging materials such as steel for maintaining food security and preventing food waste will also require significant focus in the immediate future and I look forward to working with my colleagues and stakeholders across the value chain to achieve our joint aspirations for a more sustainable, circular future.”

The France-based startup has earmarked the funds to accelerate its growth and increase its role on the freelancing market for large companies, strengthen its expertise in tech, particularly in AI and cybersecurity, and extend it to all business functions useful to its customers, and develop new offers and services for both key accounts and its freelancers.

Comet matches tech freelancers with companies. With a pool of over 15,000 freelancers, according to company data, it screens and evaluates top tech and data professionals to “build an elite community.”

The startup uses AI to “intelligently detect, qualify and match a contingent workforce with corporate projects, to enhance and simplify user experience.”

With a client base including L’Oréal, Les Mousquetaires, Allianz, Pernod Ricard and Total, it has a team of over 50 and headquarters in Paris, Lyon, Lille and Nantes.

Potel has been involved with Comet since 2017, as a board member and investor.

Since then, he said (in comments translated from the original French by software) he had seen the company grow, refine its model and establish itself as a key player in freelancing for large groups.

“For the past eight years, Comet has been offering the best tool for matching freelancers with the missions of large companies thanks to a proprietary algorithm that is now boosted with AI and in which we continue to invest,” wrote Potel on LinkedIn.

“Comet has been part of the FT Next40/120 ranking of La French Tech since last year, has a turnover of €80 million and more than 60 major accounts in the CAC 40 / SBF already trust us. With Comet, we have a mission: to give large companies quick access to the best independent talent.”

The equity fundraising involves historical shareholders, Daphni, Otium, FJ Labs and Kima Ventures, new investors Founders Future and Tomcat, and business angels.

The startup raised €11 million ($13 million U.S.) in 2018 from Otium and Daphni, to finance its expansion in Europe, starting in the U.K. and Germany. Comet had already raised €2 million ($2.3 million U.S.) the year before, FrenchWeb reported.

That, combined with the knock-on effects of the federal government layoffs, may push unemployment even higher in the coming months.","US job growth steadied last month while the unemployment rate rose — a mixed snapshot of a job market hanging on the balance of quickly changing government policy.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 151,000 in February after a downward revision to the prior month, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report out Friday. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1%.

Friday’s report is the latest evidence that the labor market is softening, with more people permanently out of work, fewer workers on federal government payrolls and a jump in those working part-time for economic reasons. The number of Americans holding multiple jobs climbed to a record of nearly 8.9 million.

That sets a weak backdrop just as President Donald Trump’s policies raise concerns about the broader economy. Inflation has proven sticky in recent months and consumers are starting to pull back on spending, which, if sustained, may lead businesses to rethink their hiring plans.

Federal Reserve policymakers have indicated they would like to see more progress that inflation is sustainably easing — including in next week’s consumer price index — before they resume cutting interest rates. Coupled with high uncertainty around the Trump administration’s policies, officials are widely expected to keep rates steady at their meeting later this month.

US stock futures, the dollar and Treasury yields fell following the release.

The advance in hiring was led by health care, transportation and financial activities. Government payrolls — which have been a key driver of payrolls in recent years — climbed at the weakest pace in nearly a year, while federal payrolls were down by the most since June 2022.

This is the first jobs report that fully reflects Trump’s second term, and the administration’s actions to shrink the government workforce have already contributed to the most job-cut announcements since early in the pandemic, according to separate data out Thursday. Some economists say the US could lose over half a million jobs by the end of the year because of the federal job cuts and their spillover effects to the broader economy.

Trump is also deploying tariffs in an effort to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, and that’s already incentivizing some companies like Apple Inc. and HP Inc. to consider investing more domestically. On the flip side, aluminum producer Alcoa Corp. has warned that the levies could result in 100,000 job losses.

Additionally, any efforts to restrict immigration — or send migrants home — will constrain a major source of job growth in recent years.

Higher Unemployment

The jobs report is composed of two surveys — one of businesses, which produces the payrolls figures, and another of households, which publishes unemployment and participation. The household survey also has its own measure of employment, which fell by nearly 600,000, the most in over a year.

The rise in the unemployment rate reflected more people who permanently lost their jobs, and joblessness was up notably among Hispanic people and those without a high school diploma. The number of people working part-time for economic reasons climbed to an almost four-year high, which boosted a broader measure known as the underemployment rate to the highest since 2021.

The participation rate — the share of the population that is working or looking for work — fell to the lowest level in two years, largely among men, according to Friday’s report. The rate for workers of ages 25-54, also known as prime-age workers, held steady at 83.5%.

Economists are also paying close attention to how labor supply and demand dynamics are impacting wage gains — especially as inflation risks heating up again. The report showed average hourly earnings increased 0.3% from January after a downwardly revised 0.4% gain.

While applications for unemployment benefits are near pre-pandemic levels, they may start ticking up as big-name companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Walt Disney Co. have announced sizable workforce reductions in recent days. That, combined with the knock-on effects of the federal government layoffs, may push unemployment even higher in the coming months.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/in/kris_638721076384441937.png,N,,2025-03-07 10:52:45.085536

From making history as Vogue's youngest-ever fashion editor to creating a gown fit for a Kennedy wedding – which would end up covered in grass stains – Vera Wang chronicles her career's surprising trajectory and shares some of her hard-won lessons as a woman at the top of her field.

Vera Wang may be best known for crafting some of the most memorable wedding gowns of all time. Mariah Carey, Victoria Beckham, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alicia Keys are just a few of the women who have chosen the designer for their big days. Less known is the fact that design wasn't her first foray into the fashion world… or even her second. Speaking to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, on her sit-down series Influential, Wang shares her long journey, from working at US Vogue to having her own creations grace those same pages.

Speaking to Kay, Wang shares that – like a true drama – her life and career have been a series of acts, and that each act has included the ever-present spectre of time looming over her. As a teenager, the designer wanted to be an Olympic figure skater, but failed to make the cut. After that, she landed a position as fashion editor at Vogue right after graduating from Sarah Lawrence College, New York, making history in the process at the age of 23.

""I was the youngest, probably, woman to ever be given the title of editor. Probably to this day,"" Wang says.

Her time at the magazine spanned 17 years, but like her time on the ice, Wang says that her skills didn't always match her passion. She didn't qualify for the 1968 Olympic Games in Grenoble and she never rose to the title of editor-in-chief.

""Some of the things I have adored the most, and by that, I mean passionately loved, are not fields I necessarily succeeded at,"" she says.

It wasn't until she was 40 years old, with Vogue and a position at Ralph Lauren behind her, that she launched her namesake fashion label. Bridal collections were just the beginning. Eventually, her brand would expand to include ready-to-wear, shoes, sunglasses, fine jewellery, home goods and even her own prosecco. Becoming too old for ice skating and the glossy world of magazines made Wang reassess what her next steps could be, even before she had the idea of putting her name on anything, much less everything.

""Women were considered transparent at a certain age, even in terms of their career,"" Wang says. ""You will age out of a career. I do not just mean modeling, I do not just mean being an editor,"" she adds, explaining to Kay that it takes a certain grit to outlast these supposed expiration dates. ""It is not about age, it is about style. And that is always how I felt. I have never not felt that way.""

More like this:

• It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome

• 'I was born to be an actor': Twice-knighted Derek Jacobi on nearly 70 years on the stage and screen

• Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to face a career beyond dance

When she decided to start with bridal gowns, Wang reflected on the approach to her own wedding. In 1989, Wang married investor Arthur P Becker (the two have since separated) and he had only one request of her for the ceremony.

""Please do not come in 'fashion'. Please look like a bride. [...] I want to make sure you look like a bride,"" Wang recalls him telling her.

She wouldn't be satisfied with simply following protocol. Blending her Chinese heritage into the ceremony, which was interfaith and drew from both Baptist and Jewish traditions, she inadvertently helped popularise the trend of brides slipping into a more festive look for their receptions.

""I got to change, because in Chinese culture, you change from the western [wedding] dress [into a] Chinese dress. But I changed into a party dress for afterwards. I started a trend way back in 1989, to change,"" Wang says.

A tradition of the ""going-away"" outfit dates back to the 1930s. It was generally something more comfortable for brides to wear to bid goodbye to their guests before being whisked away on their honeymoons. Wang’s choice to slip into something more festive has since become more widespread. High-profile brides – from the Princess of Wales (then the Duchess of Cambridge) and Princess Eugenie, to US actor Mandy Moore – frequently opt for a second dress for their evening reception.

What she did with her wedding would come to mark Wang's go-to move of adding a dash of irreverence to the usually stuffy world of bridal fashion – something her clients could feel when they chose one of Wang's gowns.

""My first client was Ethel Kennedy. Her son, Max, was getting married and marrying a beautiful girl who was a law student. I spent eight months on that dress, and within 10 minutes of the ceremony, she was out kicking a football with the Kennedy brothers,"" Wang says.

Now aged 75, Wang is well aware of her age, and that age is a topic of conversation around her. She tells Kay that she's noticed a shift in individuals being more critical of others and themselves today, a trend she blames on the rise of social media. Instead of focussing on how other people saw her as she grew older, Wang notes that as she has navigated the various acts of her career and life, she has focused on finding her passions and not what she saw in the mirror. This was a privilege, she reflects, of the era in which she was ageing.

""We did not have social media, and everybody did not age right before your very eyes, and everybody was not critical,"" she tells the BBC. ""It was really more about finding your way."" Looking back at the 1990s and 2000s, she adds, ""I do not see that obsession with ageing that I have felt for the last two decades."" Nevertheless, Wang's red carpet looks and social media posts prove that she's not shying away from the image that she cultivated over the years. She stays true to the sky-high platforms, micro-mini hemlines and long, lean silhouettes that have characterised her designs and personal appearances over the decades. She tells Kay that her age doesn't factor in how she gets dressed – and it never has.

Influential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.

That makes it a 128-bagger -- every dollar a person invested in Rollins stock 25 years ago would have grown into $128 today.

While people might typically associate returns like these with more ""exciting"" investments such as Nvidia, Palantir Technologies, or even Bitcoin, Rollins serves as a perfect reminder that stocks with market-crushing potential can be found everywhere in our daily lives.

However, I'm writing this today not just to point out how good Rollins has been in past decades, but rather to highlight how good it appears likely to be in decades to come. Here are four reasons why Rollins remains one of my favorite under-the-radar S&P 500 dividend growth stocks.

1. It dominates an essential industry

Though Rollins' returns have rocketed past the market's so far this century, its non-discretionary sales make it a steady Eddie investment.

Protecting its customers from rodents and termites, among other insects and pests, Rollins has grown its sales nearly sixfold since 2000, becoming the largest operator in its niche. Just as important as this market share leadership, however, is that Rollins has a dominant mind share among current and prospective customers.

For example, its largest brand, Orkin, has the highest brand awareness in pest control in the United States. Since 50% of customers come directly to Orkin after conducting their pest control research, that brand power has helped Rollins grow its revenues faster than the industry average -- 8% over the last 15 years, compared to an industry average of 3%.

Best yet for investors, long-term tailwinds such as the boom in do-it-for-me services, rising pet ownership, and stricter sanitation regulations and standards will combine to provide plenty of future growth for Rollins.

2. It has a successful M&A playbook

Rollins' impressive track record as a serial acquirer has played a key role in turning the company into a 128-bagger. Over its history, the company has acquired hundreds of smaller or regional pest control businesses -- including 44 tuck-in deals in 2024 alone. In fact, since 2015, Rollins has spent roughly half of its free cash flow (FCF) on acquisitions.

Targeting businesses that are already profitable and complementary to its operations (either geographically, culturally, or with new services), Rollins is actively consolidating the fragmented pest control industry.

Given that more than half of the pest control industry's revenue still comes from small operators generating less than $50 million in sales annually, Rollins will likely continue its acquisitive ways for decades to come.

When Rollins reported its fourth-quarter results earlier this month, it announced that it had received investment-grade corporate credit ratings from Fitch Ratings and S&P Global. This development increases the company's access to cheaper credit and makes it an even more powerful mergers and acquisitions (M&A) machine.

3. Both its margins and its dividend are growing

Rollins' additional M&A potential should excite investors since the company has a long track record of successfully integrating purchases into its network in an increasingly profitable manner. Consider the company's profitability metrics over the last two decades.

Since Rollins is already at scale as a nationwide enterprise, each new acquisition it brings into its fold typically juices profitability as management scouts for the best complementary pieces.

Furthermore, the company's cash return on invested capital (ROIC) has averaged 34% since 2005. Cash ROIC shows how much FCF a company generates compared to its debt and equity. Rollins' cash ROIC of 34% ranks in the top 10% of S&P 500 stocks -- a position that has historically been a harbinger of future outperformance.

Thanks to its improving profitability, Rollins' management has been able to pay respectable dividends -- which yield 1.2% at the current share price -- despite its high spending on M&A. Had an investor bought $1,000 of Rollins stock in 2000 and held until today, they would now be receiving $750 annually in dividend income thanks to two decades of payout increases.

4. It always trades at a premium valuation

Perhaps the biggest issue most investors see when considering Rollins stock is its lofty price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 55. However, since the company historically generates higher levels of FCF than net income, its price-to-FCF (P/FCF) ratio of 44 is a more applicable metric.

While that is still roughly 50% higher than the S&P 500's average P/FCF ratio, Rollins has a 10-year history of trading around this valuation -- and has doubled the market's returns during that time.

Long story short, when I add shares to my Rollins position, I am paying a premium price for a premium business. However, thanks to the company's critical services and its long track record of growing sales by around 8% to 10% each year (just as it did in 2024), I believe it will keep justifying this premium in the long run.

With the pest control industry still highly fragmented and Rollins well-funded to continue adding to its stable of businesses, I'm happy to continue investing in this under-the-radar S&P 500 dividend growth stock.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/808203/gettyimages-1367686706.jpg,N,,2025-03-07 10:53:42.368945

According to a post from the official Tesla Japan account on X, domestic sales of the two vehicles will end on March 31, 2025. After this date, the company will limit sales to existing inventory and pre-owned vehicles, discontinuing custom orders for new units.

Tesla did not give an explanation for the sudden end of Model S/X sales for the Japanese market. As it is the company is only selling around 10,000 units per quarter globally, with the majority of those going to the Canadian and U.S. markets, leaving a very small number of sales in Japan.

The decision to halt sales of these models in Japan aligns with Tesla’s broader strategy concerning right-hand-drive (RHD) markets. In May 2023, Tesla discontinued the production of RHD variants of the Model S and Model X, affecting markets such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Singapore. Since that date, Tesla has been selling left-hand drive (LHD) versions in Japan, a RHD market, which in itself was likely another reason for the change.

To comply with local safety standards, the Model S/X needed modifications, including the installation of a camera and display system to address the front passenger side blind spot in LHD vehicles for pedestrians.

The costs associated with these homologation processes may have outweighed the benefits, especially given the modest sales volume of these models in the Japanese market.​

Despite the discontinuation in certain markets, Tesla remains committed to the Model S and Model X. Lars Moravy, Tesla’s Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, hinted at an upcoming refresh for these models, stating that they would receive “some love later this year.”",https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/modelsx.png?fit=1170%2C572&ssl=1,N,,2025-03-07 12:17:27.467686

Scale Is a Key Tenet of Equities' Positive Impact

Market Overview

Despite initial signs of market broadening following Donald Trump’s election victory and further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, the market reverted to the narrow mega cap growth leadership that characterized most of 2024. Outside this group, market action was more subdued, with the benchmark Russell 1000 Value Index returning -1.98%, about 900 basis points behind its growth counterpart. Potentially reflationary policies from the Trump administration, such as tariffs, and slight upticks in inflation put upward pressure on longer-term interest rates, causing weakness in economically sensitive and rate-sensitive sectors.

2024 presented a number of challenges for the Strategy due to the narrow market breadth, the strong performance of specific thematic growth stocks and the sluggish economy. Our diversified, valuation-sensitive approach struggled in this environment. Stock selection, typically a strong point for our strategy, was weaker than we’d hoped due to certain technology and health care stocks like Intel (INTC), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and CVS.

Despite these setbacks, we remain confident in our long-term process of investing in high-quality franchises within durable, growing markets at reasonable valuations. We believe this approach will drive sustained outperformance over time. Notably, the Strategy showed improvement in the fourth quarter, outperforming and demonstrating resilience and potential for recovery as the market began to normalize.

Our quality bias in materials and utilities stood out the most in a quarter that saw a reversal of some of 2024’s themes. Materials was the worst performer in the benchmark, though we tend to avoid the highly commoditized businesses that led the selloff. Relative outperformance among utilities came from not owning AI-levered power companies, which sold off, and by our large active weight in Sempra (SRE), a well-positioned diversified utility likely to benefit from a Republican energy policy and growing LNG demand, both for export and domestic production.

Our overweight in financials, with a focus on payments and consumer finance companies like Visa (V), Capital One (COF) and American Express (AXP), proved beneficial. These firms, along with banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC), gained from economic resilience, robust consumer spending, yield curve normalization, and the anticipated reduction in regulatory pressures from the incoming administration. Adhering to our valuation discipline, we trimmed positions in American Express and JPMorgan Chase, primarily due to their strong performance.

Detractors came mainly from the health care sector. Elevated utilization trends, lower Medicare Advantage rates, and more generous MA benefits broadly across the industry materially pressured profitability of CVS and, to a lesser extent, UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Ongoing Medicaid redeterminations resulted in increased acuity of remaining Medicaid members, leading to increased pressure on Medicaid profitability, with Elevance Health (ELV) being the most exposed among our holdings. Potential regulatory pressures on pharmacy benefit managers also weighed on CVS Health and UnitedHealth Group, while the latter’s managed care business, along with that of Elevance, was pressured by increased medical care ratio increases. We elected to exit our marginal position in Elevance in the quarter, given relatively higher exposure to Medicaid, typically a target for Republican administrations, and redeployed some of the proceeds in CVS and UnitedHealth.

The largest relative detractor in terms of selection was the information technology sector, particularly Microchip Technology. The company announced a change in CEO, lowered its revenue guidance and revealed manufacturing restructuring plans, which collectively pressured the stock at year-end. The embedded semiconductor industry is experiencing a significant cyclical downturn as customers deplete inventories they had stockpiled during the COVID-era chip shortages. While this has negatively impacted Microchip’s near-term financials, we believe that its large and fragmented customer base (~120,000 customers and several thousand SKUs) and sticky products will allow it to maintain pricing and market share once a recovery materializes. We took advantage of the weakness to add to our position, confident that Microchip is a well-positioned, scaled player in the analog/microcontroller market with the potential for higher margins in the long term.

Portfolio Positioning

In a very skewed market in 2024, we saw a large valuation divergence that provided opportunities for our process as high-quality companies simply weren’t attracting capital. In the fourth quarter, we added to out-of-favor defensive holdings such as PepsiCo (PEP) and Becton Dickinson (BDX), appreciating their lower economic sensitivity and reasonable valuations. We also added to Deere (DE), which we had trimmed aggressively in 2023 as the agriculture cycle was in its later stages. We added to it during the period at what we view as very reasonable valuations based on what look like trough earnings. Deere’s competitive advantages, such as distribution scale and tech stack, continue to manifest in sustainably higher profitability through the cycle, relative to peers and its own history. At the same time, we maintained our valuation discipline and reduced exposure to Oracle (ORCL) and Broadcom. Both companies benefited from robust AI spending, Oracle on the infrastructure side and Broadcom on the custom silicon side, as well as a well-executed VMware acquisition.

Outlook

As the U.S. political landscape shifts, we are reminded why we try to own resilient, durable franchises that can withstand various uncertainties and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term. We anticipate a potentially more business-friendly environment under the new administration in the coming four years, which would support economic growth and a broadening of the market. The ISM Manufacturing PMI has been in contraction territory for some time; should that trend reverse, capital that has been on the sidelines may find more incentive to enter the market. We believe there are pockets that would benefit, perhaps those overlooked in the narrow market of 2023 and 2024, more than others. Given already-stretched investor optimism amid a variety of indeterminate risks, volatility is likely to create opportunities for disciplined investors with an eye on long-term value creation.

Portfolio Highlights

The ClearBridge Large Cap Value ESG Strategy outperformed its Russell 1000 Value Index benchmark during the fourth quarter. On an absolute basis, the Strategy had positive contributions from four of the 11 sectors in which it was invested for the quarter. The financials and energy sectors contributed the most, while the health care and consumer staples sectors were the main detractors.

On a relative basis, overall stock selection and sector allocation effects contributed to outperformance. In particular, stock selection in the materials, energy, utilities and financials sectors helped relative returns. Conversely, stock selection in the IT, consumer staples, health care and real estate sectors and a materials overweight detracted.

On an individual stock basis, the largest contributors were JPMorgan Chase, Broadcom, Williams Companies (WMB), XPO and McKesson 9mck). Positions in Microchip Technology, CVS Health, Danaher (DHR), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and UnitedHealth Group were the main detractors.

ESG Highlights: Public Equities Amplifying Positive Impact

Large companies with complex global operations may sometimes present challenges for sustainability-minded investors. In some cases, because a larger company’s business is more complex than smaller, pure play companies focused on one particular sustainability need (addressing unmet medical needs or enabling renewable energy, for example), its sustainability contributions might be misunderstood or overlooked. Yet some well-known companies can have lesser known sustainability strengths, and these may be all the more impactful due to their large scale. The importance of scale represents a key tenet of ClearBridge’s approach to ESG integration, as companies can make a positive impact simply because of their global reach, their deep supply chains and the depth of their involvement in the communities in which they operate.

A mega cap company like Amazon (AMZN) is a complex and very large company that may seem difficult to own in sustainable portfolios, as investors might be concerned about its overall carbon footprint and environmental impact, as well as working conditions, given the size and speed of the workforce. Amazon has drastically improved its capital allocation and profitability since 2022 under new CEO Andy Jassy; much of this has been driven by ongoing efforts at margin improvement through retail regionalization, scaling its advertising business and improving costs. Complementing these fundamental and governance improvements is Amazon’s growth as company for which sustainable improvements strengthen the business case, with potential for positive change that benefits multiple stakeholders (employees, customers and shareholders).

Since 2019, ClearBridge’s sector analysts have been engaging Amazon on the most material and relevant activities that could pose risk to the company in terms of operations and societal impact. These areas include climate change and climate targets; labor topics such as worker health and safety and unionization; packaging and materials; responsible AI; and disclosure. During our multiyear engagements, Amazon has agreed to disclose more data around each of these issues. In addition, Amazon reaches out to us throughout the year (and vice versa) to consult us on its sustainability progress and goals. Our most recent engagement, in September 2024, was on climate strategy and covered science-based targets, last-miles-driven, renewables and EV investments and AI power needs.

Sustainability disclosures are significant for shareholders as they help benefit the bottom line over the long term, and Amazon’s progress on several sustainability initiatives, such as reducing and innovating on packaging materials and increasing their circularity, are meaningful considering the scale of its operations. Amazon is the second-largest private employer in the U.S., with over 1.5 million employees: increasing wages, providing immediate family benefits and free tuition, and focusing on worker safety at these volumes positively impacts their many employees. The company delivers over 600 million packages per year with less materials and filling. It uses machine learning algorithms to determine the most efficient packaging for each order and so it can minimize empty space in boxes and optimize shipments to require less space in vehicles, reducing the number of vehicles on the road (Exhibit 1). AWS, meanwhile, is the largest cloud provider in the world, and is designing the latest protocols on addressing responsible AI. We believe progress made on these sustainability topics will have a material positive impact.

More Than a New Coat of Paint

As the world’s largest paint and coating company, Sherwin-Williams (SHW) may suffer from negative sustainability perceptions due to their paint products being derivatives of petrochemicals like propylene. The industry has, however, been increasingly replacing hydrocarbon-based solvents with water-based ones, which have no harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — in particular architectural paints, which are two-thirds of Sherwin-Williams’s business. Some waterborne solvent products made by Sherwin-Williams and others include air-purifying and sanitizing paints that reduce VOC levels from sources such as carpeting, cabinetry and fabrics in addition to fighting bacteria.

Sherwin-Williams further distinguishes itself with a sustainability-forward salesforce that helps its customers become more efficient. It stands out as an engaged supplier to its customers, providing education and recommendations on best practices using its products that can help its customers overcome labor shortages with paints that require fewer passes, for example, and use less material. In a recent engagement with the company, we also learned how it supports new accounts (small business owners) with consulting resources such as the digital infrastructure, invoices and accounting basics needed for new contracting businesses to succeed long term.

In terms of how to recycle or properly dispose of excess paint, Sherwin Williams volunteers many of its stores across the U.S. as drop-off locations for unwanted or leftover paint through its partnership with PaintCare, a nonprofit organization.

While the company’s execution on its stated sustainability goals such as carbon emission reductions has been slower than might be hoped, we recognize such large goals take time. Upgrading LED lighting kits for all paint store color displays, investing in renewable energy to power its facilities and growing its paint recycling program are positive signposts for Sherwin-Williams, as its recently appointed CEO — a woman (only 6% of CEOs at the companies in the S&P 500 are women),1 — continues to foster a winning culture of product innovation and service excellence with positive environmental and social impacts.

Change Should Start with Industry Leaders

Modern clothing manufacturing and retail is often considered riddled with environmental and social problems such as resources use, waste, pollution, overwhelmed landfills, child labor and unfair labor practices. However, a clothing manufacturer leader like Inditex (OTCPK:IDEXY) is actually an agent of change and improvement in a problematic industry. We believe change should start with industry leaders rather than with fringe or marginal players, and ClearBridge is following how a clothing behemoth like Spain-based Inditex, best known for its Zara brand, is using its leadership to improve its ESG rankings among its peers and benefit the entire industry.

Examples of Inditex’s environmental leadership include its use of sustainable fibers with low impact on the environment, its innovation in next-generation fibers and its use of recycling. Among its short-term goals are 100% responsibly sourced linen (it reached 100% for cotton in 2023) and a 25% reduction in water use by 2025. For 2030 it aims to improve biodiversity across 5 million hectares, reduce emissions by 50% across total product life from design to recycling (and by 90% by 2040), and move to 100% fibers with low impact on the environment.

Social leadership is equally important: Inditex is dedicated to remedying the poor social image of the industry with a comprehensive audit of all external suppliers. This will affect millions of people. The company is already a recognized leader for its internal human resources credentials for talent development, diversity and engagement of its 170,000 employees. It is now turning its focus outward on the entire ecosystem for responsible clothing manufacturing. Its “Workers at the Centre” program for supply chain management involves due diligence on all 1,700 suppliers, inspecting human rights, living wages, respect, and health and safety. It has spoken with 1.5 million people so far with the goal to reach 3 million people by 2025. Monitoring visits improved from 540 in 2022 to 820 in 2023.

While these improvements are laudable, we recognize there is still a lot of progress to be made, and some commitments could be made more credible with more detail provided on how they’ll be met. Yet given the extreme fragmentation of the fashion industry, we believe Inditex’s scale and forceful implementation of better sourcing and manufacturing should have an amplified positive impact on the whole industry’s supply chain.

CINCINNATI (AP) — Kroger Chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen has resigned after an internal investigation into his personal conduct.

Kroger, the nation’s largest grocery chain, said Monday that the investigation into McMullen’s personal conduct was unrelated to the business, but was found to be inconsistent with its business ethics policy.

Board member Ronald Sargent will serve as chairman and interim CEO, effective immediately.

Sargent has been on Kroger’s board since 2006 and has served as the lead director of the company since 2017. He’s worked in several roles at the grocery chain across stores, sales, marketing, manufacturing and strategy. Sargent is also the former Chairman and CEO of Staples.

McMullen, 64, began his career with Kroger in 1978 as a part-time stock clerk and bagger at a store in Lexington, Kentucky. He worked his way up through the company, becoming chief financial officer in 1995 and chief operating officer in 2009. McMullen was named Kroger’s CEO in 2014 and became the company’s chairman the following year.

Cincinnati-based Kroger said its board was made aware of the situation on Feb. 21 and immediately hired an outside independent counsel to conduct an investigation, overseen by a special board committee.

The company said that McMullen’s conduct is not related to its financial performance, operations or reporting, and did not involve any Kroger associates.

Kroger will conduct a search for its next CEO, with Sargent agreeing to remain as interim CEO until someone is appointed to the role permanently.

Kroger shares fell nearly 3% Monday.

McMullen’s departure comes as Kroger is regrouping from its failed effort to merger with Albertsons. The two companies proposed what would have been the largest supermarket merger in U.S. history in 2022, saying they needed to combine forces to better compete with rivals like Walmart.

But two judges halted the $24.6 billion deal in December, saying it was likely to lessen competition and raise prices. Albertsons later sued Kroger, saying it had failed to make every effort to ensure that the merger would win regulatory approval.

Also Monday, Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons said its CEO Vivek Sankaran plans to retire May 1. Susan Morris, Albertsons’ executive vice president and chief operations officer, will replace Sankaran, the company said.",https://woub.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP25062462521276-e1741358864244.jpg,N,,2025-03-07 10:51:45.091456

In pre-market trading, the stock is further down to $79.93, reflecting a 0.65% decrease.

Palantir faces significant stock decline

Palantir has seen a staggering slide from its all-time high, with a reported fall of 30-36% since earlier in 2025. This follows an extraordinary 341% leap in 2024, largely driven by AI enthusiasm and government contract gains. Today, analysts are raising eyebrows at the stock trading over 200 times price-to-sales (P/S), questioning sustainability amidst a market correction.

A pivotal moment for Palantir was U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s announcement of proposed defense spending cuts—approximately 8% or $50 billion—impacting a substantial portion of Palantir’s revenue, which relies heavily on government contracts.

Investor confidence wavered further as the number of shares dropped over 20% in a short span. This intensified sell-off reflects fears about the sustainability of revenue streams critical to Palantir’s operations.

Palantir stock dips 5% but insiders say AI’s future will make this look cheap

Analysts’ sentiment has become increasingly divided. Some, like William Blair, hold optimistic views based on AI-driven growth prospects, while others, including Goldman Sachs and Jefferies, urge caution on the stock’s lofty valuation. This polarized outlook may contribute to the stock’s current pressure.

Insider trading has also cast shadows on investor sentiment. Early in 2025, key figures, including CEO Alex Karp and Chief Accounting Officer Ryan D. Taylor, sold millions in shares, raising concerns about insider confidence in the stock’s future.

Yet, not all news is grim. Palantir recently announced partnerships with TWG Global and Société Générale, aimed at boosting AI adoption in finance and enhancing anti-money laundering efforts. While this has sparked optimism, it hasn’t been enough to offset broader market anxieties.

Market observers note that while tariffs introduced by President Trump have been mentioned in discussions, the key issues seem to rest on the market’s macroeconomic shifts and the reassessment of high-growth tech stocks.

As we navigate today’s downturn, Palantir’s stock reflects a blend of profit-taking and valuation scrutiny. The impressive partnerships may offer a glimpse of potential growth, but current pressures loom large on the horizon.

Implications for stakeholders

The recent announcement of leadership changes within the company raises questions about the future direction and strategy. Investors should closely monitor how these new leaders implement their vision and whether it aligns with previous strategies. Changes in leadership can often disrupt operations if not managed carefully, prompting scrutiny on potential shifts in company priorities and performance metrics.

The unveiling of a new product line highlights the company’s intentions to innovate and capture market share, presenting opportunities for growth. Stakeholders should focus on market reception and sales figures of the new products in the upcoming quarters. Positive reception can lead to increased market confidence, while lackluster sales may raise concerns about the company’s competitive positioning.

Operational challenges mentioned indicate potential hiccups in supply chain management. Investors must keep an eye on how effectively the company addresses these challenges. A robust response could enhance investor confidence, while persistent issues may signal deeper operational inefficiencies, affecting profitability and overall stock performance.

The article also points to fluctuations in consumer demand as a relevant factor. Monitoring shifts in consumer behavior and preferences will be crucial for understanding revenue potential. If consumer demand aligns well with the company’s offerings, it may signal robust growth; however, a significant downturn could negatively impact quarterly results.

Lastly, any commentary from analysts about future earnings projections should be analyzed carefully. Changes in analyst sentiment can provide valuable insight into how the market views the company’s prospects. A general upgrade in forecasts, based on positive developments, may buoy the stock, while downgrades could lead to a sell-off from jittery investors.",https://dataconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/everyone-hyped-palantir-stock-now-it-is-down-36-percent-what-went-wrong.jpg,N,,2025-03-07 10:54:30.699421

Elon Musk’s Net Worth Drops by $102 Billion Due to Tesla Stock Decline

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Musk’s wealth has fallen by 24% in less than 10 weeks. As of Thursday, his net worth stood at $330 billion. The sharp decline is linked to Tesla’s struggles, Musk’s political involvement, and concerns about his divided attention.

Tesla’s Stock Plunge

Tesla’s stock has fallen 35% this year. It dropped from $404 per share to $263. This sell-off erased over $400 billion from Tesla’s market value, bringing it below $900 billion. Several factors have contributed to this decline.

One major reason is Musk’s political activities. He donated over $250 million to Donald Trump’s reelection campaign. He also attended Republican rallies and urged his followers on X (formerly Twitter) to support Trump. Many investors dislike his political stance, which has hurt Tesla’s stock.

Musk has also taken on a role in Trump’s administration. He is leading efforts to cut federal spending through his White House DOGE office. Investors worry that this new role is distracting him from running Tesla. Concerns over declining Tesla sales in several countries have added to the pressure.

Billionaires Losing Money

Musk is not the only billionaire facing losses. A broader market downturn has hit other wealthy individuals. Oracle’s Larry Ellison has lost $19 billion, bringing his fortune to $173 billion. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos have each lost around $17 billion.

Bezos is now tied with Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg at $222 billion. While Bezos has lost money, Zuckerberg has gained $14 billion this year due to Meta’s stock growth.

What’s Next for Musk?

Musk’s financial recovery depends on Tesla’s performance. The company must boost sales and regain investor trust. His political involvement may win new supporters but also alienate others. Balancing his political interests with his business responsibilities will be key.

The next few months will be crucial. If Tesla rebounds, Musk could regain his lost wealth. If not, his fortune may continue to shrink. One thing is clear—Musk’s influence in business and politics remains strong.",https://www.gizchina.com/wp-content/uploads/images/2022/12/imagem_2022-12-14_204308476.png,N,,2025-03-07 10:54:46.306168

New Delh: Kandhari Global Beverages is ready for more bottling opportunities from Coca-Cola in India as well as foreign territories, its Managing Director Varinder Pal Singh Kandhari said on Wednesday.

Besides, Kandhari Global Beverages, which has recently acquired Coca-Cola's bottling operations in the North Gujarat region, plans to double its turnover in the next 5-6 years from the current Rs 4,500 crore.

The Atlanta-headquartered beverage major is divesting assets globally by franchising regional operations to local partners as part of its asset-light business model.

""We look forward if there is an opportunity, we will definitely look at it,"" Kandhari told a news agency.

Kandhari Global Beverages was one of the three existing bottlers to whom HCCB had transferred bottling operations of the Rajasthan market in the last round in January 2024. It already operates in parts of Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh.

""We have ambitions going beyond the boundaries of India and we trust Coca-Cola someday will give us an opportunity to do so,"" he added.

The Kandhari family-owned business entered in beverage business in 1967 and with eight bottling locations, the company has a capacity of 12,000 BPM (bottles per minute).

It has been associated with Coca-Cola since 1993 when the Atlanta-headquartered firm re-entered India.

On its expansion in Gujarat, Kandhari said the Indian beverages segment is very dynamic and provides exciting opportunities.

""As part of the transaction, we are committed to making substantial investments in the business over the next decade, not only supply chain RTM (route to market) and sales execution but also in people, digitalisation and sustainability,"" he said.

Though Kandhari did not share the value of the deal, however, said it would be funded through debt and internal accruals.

The industry insiders have pegged the deal to be around Rs 2,000 crore.

""We are very optimistic about our growth story in the country and even beyond the boundaries and we have a very good relationship with the company and the company trusts us,"" Kandhari said, adding, ""They know we invest ahead of the curve.

We are always there to take on the tough times and the good times together."" When asked about the disruptions created by Reliance Industries Campa Cola in the beverage market through aggressive pricing and increased margins, Kandhari said it will help to grow the beverage market.

""We welcome all types of competition…because we are so confident about our product range, about our pricing…the placement and…the space we operate. So when the new competition comes in, it helps us expand the market,"" he said.

Further, he said, ""Ultimately the consumer is the king and they decide what they want to have. So we, as a beverage company, always make sure we provide all kinds of beverages at the right price in the right place wherever it is required. So any competition is healthy for us."" The company is looking forward to this kind of competition and is confident about its product ranges.

Whether it will go in a price war with Campa, Kandhari said: ""We will do things that are required to be done in the market in terms of giving the right price right back and will give promotions from time to time in different markets in different occasions, in different packs."" On Tuesday, Coca-Cola announced that it will transfer North Gujarat business from HCCBL, its bottling arm in India, to its bottling partner Kandhari Global Beverages.

After this sale, HCCBL will be left with 15 operational plants in India, where it produces beverages like Coca-Cola, Thums Up, Sprite, Minute Maid, Maaza, SmartWater, Kinley, Limca, and Fanta, among others.

In the December quarter, Coca-Cola divested a 40 per cent stake in HCCBL to the Bhartia family. Though the company has not disclosed the amount, some media reports have pegged it to be around Rs 10,000 crore.

Earlier, in the March quarter of last year, it had franchised its bottling operations to existing bottlers in three key markets - Rajasthan, Bihar, and Northeast and parts of West Bengal - to its existing bottlers, earning USD 290 million (around Rs 2,420 crore).

The two other existing partners were SLMG Beverages and Moon Beverages.

In response to an analyst question on the CEO search, Sargent said Kroger is currently updating its CEO selection criteria, a process the company does annually as part of succession planning.
Net sales in the 2024 fourth quarter were $31.08 billion, down 7.4% year over year from $37.06 billion.
Excluding sales from fuel, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and the prior year’s extra week, net sales climbed 2.6%, Kroger noted.
Identical sales excluding fuel and adjustment items grew 1.5% for fiscal 2024, compared with a 0.9% uptick in 2023.","CINCINNATI — The Kroger Co. capped off fiscal 2024 with a mixed performance and finds itself early in fiscal 2025 with an interim chief executive officer at the helm after the exit of chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen earlier this week.

Cincinnati-based Kroger announced March 3 that McMullen had resigned following an investigation finding that he engaged in personal conduct that, while unrelated to the business, violated the company’s ethics policy. Lead board director Ronald Sargent was named as chairman and interim CEO and Mark Sutton as the new lead director.

With Kroger for over four decades, McMullen had served as CEO since 2014 and as chairman since 2015 — including during the planned $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons Cos. that underwent a more than two-year regulatory review before the transaction was blocked by courts and both companies terminated the deal in December 2024.

“I will be serving as the interim CEO as we search for a leader for our next phase of growth,” Sargent told analysts in a March 6 conference call on fiscal 2024 results. “The board has formed a search committee and has engaged a nationally recognized search firm. We look forward to updating you as we have more information. As a board member, I know Kroger’s strong leadership team well, and they support a unique culture that powers the company’s long-term success. We care for people and we love food, the most important elements of successful grocery retail.”

Because of the pending CEO search, Kroger has postponed its investor day planned for April and will update investors when the event has been rescheduled, Sargent said.

In response to an analyst question on the CEO search, Sargent said Kroger is currently updating its CEO selection criteria, a process the company does annually as part of succession planning.

“We are going to be looking at both internal candidates as well as external candidates,” he said. “But most importantly, we’re focused on identifying the right leader to drive progress growth and enhance shareholder value. I am proud to serve in this role for as long as needed, but I am absolutely confident that our board will select the right next CEO, whether from inside the company or outside.”

Merger costs impact bottom line

For fiscal 2024, Kroger saw net income rise to $2.67 billion, equal to $3.67 per share on the common stock, from $2.16 billion, or $2.96 per share, in fiscal 2023, which had 53 weeks. Excluding $581 million in adjustment items — primarily costs from the terminated merger with Albertsons — 2024 net earnings were $3.25 billion, or $4.47 per share, compared with $3.34 billion, or $4.56 per share, for 2023, not counting the 53rd week. Kroger’s 2024 adjusted earnings per share were a penny above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $4.46.

Fourth-quarter net income declined to $634 million, or 90¢ per share, from $736 million, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were $800 million, or $1.14 per share, versus $835 million, or $1.34 per share, in the prior-year period, excluding the extra week. Analysts, on average, had forecast adjusted EPS of $1.11.

Kroger tallied top-line growth for the year and final quarter ended Feb. 1. Fiscal 2024 net sales totaled $147.12 billion, down 1.9% from $150.03 billion a year ago but up 1.8% excluding fuel sales, specialty pharmacy sales and, in 2023, $2.7 billion from the 53rd week. The company sold its Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business in October 2024, which generated $2 billion for the fiscal year versus $3.2 billion for all of 2023.

Net sales in the 2024 fourth quarter were $31.08 billion, down 7.4% year over year from $37.06 billion. Excluding sales from fuel, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and the prior year’s extra week, net sales climbed 2.6%, Kroger noted.

Identical sales excluding fuel and adjustment items grew 1.5% for fiscal 2024, compared with a 0.9% uptick in 2023. The result reflected a lift in the fourth quarter, when identical sales rose 2.4% from a year-ago dip of 0.8%.

Digital sales (excluding the extra week) climbed 10% to more than $13 billion in fiscal 2024, including an 11% gain in the fourth quarter, when delivery sales rose 18%, driven by Kroger’s Ocado-automated customer fulfillment centers.

Kroger also expanded its Our Brands private label lineup in 2024. The supermarket giant launched more than 900 products, including 370 fresh items, such as the new Field & Vine berry brand, and meal bundles under the Simple Truth better-for-you brand. Health and wellness sales (including pharmacy) were strong as well, fueled by GLP-1 drugs and 11% growth in vaccinations, the company said.

As of mid-day trading on March 6, Kroger’s stock price was up 2% to $63.80 per common share.

“Today, Kroger operates from a position of strength,” Sargent said. “We delivered strong financial results in 2024 and have positive momentum in our business. We’re confident in our plans for 2025 and our commitment to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. I will be especially focused on executing with speed and confidence, keeping our team working toward the priorities that create long-term growth. We’re delivering on our go-to-market strategy, providing families across America with fresh and affordable food.

“In my retail career, I understood that an outstanding customer experience comes from best-in-class store conditions, friendly associates and great products at low prices. That’s who Kroger is today, and that’s who we will be tomorrow.”

2025 outlook includes more store expansion

Looking ahead, Kroger projected fiscal 2025 identical sales growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted net diluted EPS of $4.60 to $4.80, within Wall Street’s forecast range of $4.58 to $4.88 before the earnings report.

“In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect identical sales without fuel to be consistent throughout the year, building slightly as the year progresses, as we continue to improve our volumes,” Todd Foley, interim chief financial officer, said in the call. “We expect first-quarter adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be similar to last year, and we expect Q2 through Q4 to be consistently above each quarter compared to the same periods last year.”

Foley said inflation rose throughout 2024 and was in line with Kroger’s expectations.

“As we look ahead to 2025, we expect inflation to be 1.5% to 2.5%, which does not include the effects from tariffs announced earlier this week,” he said. “External factors continue to pressure certain fresh commodities, including eggs. Notably, the avian flu resulted in an inflation of approximately 70% during the quarter. Inflationary pressures are not new to our business, and we’re confident in our ability to navigate any inflationary environment. We will remain focused on keeping prices low for our customers.”

David Kennerley, CFO of PepsiCo Europe, is slated to take the reins as Kroger’s new CFO on April 3. He will succeed the retiring Foley, who has been interim CFO since February 2024, when Kroger CFO Gary Millerchip left to join Costco Wholesale Corp. as CFO.

“David is joining us from PepsiCo Europe and brings broad and extensive financial experience,” Sargent said. “We are confident that David’s expertise and leadership will help us to continue to deliver on our strategic and financial priorities.”

Both Foley and Sargent cited store expansion as a key growth driver in 2024 and for 2025.

“In 2024, we announced plans to significantly increase our investment in major storing projects, including new stores to accelerate sales growth and improve share while supporting our long-term growth model,” Foley said. “We delivered on that commitment in 2024, completing 29 major storing projects focused in higher-growth geographies that have a track record for generating strong cash flows and returns. We expect to complete 30 major storing projects in 2025. We also expect new stores to continue to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth model and would expect new store openings to accelerate beyond 2025.”",,N,,2025-03-07 15:56:45.233371

In Campbell’s Snacks segment in the quarter, net sales decreased 6% to $1.01 billion from $1.07 billion.
Excluding the impact of the Pop Secret divestiture, organic net sales decreased 3%, driven by declines in third-party partner and contract brands, Goldfish crackers, and Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels.
Net sales in the six-month period increased 10% to $5.46 billion from $4.97 billion.","CAMDEN, NJ. — Plans to reinvigorate The Campbell’s Co. Snacks segment, which saw organic sales decline 3% in the second quarter, include Goldfish flavor and packaging innovations.

“We’re driving innovation and differentiation with new Goldfish LTOs, such as Harry Potter Butterbeer grahams, and other differentiated flavors,” said Mick Beekhuizen, president and chief executive officer, in a March 5 earnings call to discuss financial results for the quarter ended Jan. 26. “We are also strategically expanding accessibility and enhanced value across our snacks portfolio by introducing new pack sizes and price points that provide consumers more choices for their favorite snacks, from Pepperidge Farm Chessman and Mini-Nantucket cookies in single-serve multipacks to Goldfish and small-size packs, offering an attractive opening price point. Overall, I’m excited about the opportunities within our Snacks portfolio.”

He said Campbell’s innovation pipeline includes better-for-you items such as Kettle Brand chips made with avocado oil.

In Campbell’s Snacks segment in the quarter, net sales decreased 6% to $1.01 billion from $1.07 billion. Excluding the impact of the Pop Secret divestiture, organic net sales decreased 3%, driven by declines in third-party partner and contract brands, Goldfish crackers, and Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels. Negative impacts came from volume/mix declines of 2% and lower net price realization of 1%. Operating earnings decreased 29% to $114 million from $161 million, primarily due to lower gross profit and higher marketing and selling expenses.

“Our snacks margin fell short of our expectations, driven by unfavorable mix and some operational headwinds in our fresh bakery business during the important holiday period,” Beekhuizen said. “We are actively addressing both areas, and combined with a normalization of our commercial support, we expect our snacks margin to improve sequentially throughout the second half of the fiscal year.”

Compared to the first quarter, progress in the second quarter came in Pepperidge Farm cookies and Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels, he said.

“Our Pepperidge Farm bakery business continued its in-market momentum from previous quarters as we maintained our overall share position,” he said. “Additionally, we made sequential share progress on our Pepperidge Farm cookies business, driven by the holiday activation.”

In crackers, market share increased for Lance, but increased promotional activity by competitors negatively impacted Goldfish crackers, Beekhuizen said.

“Lance is doing well, and I think it is a brand that’s obviously a little bit in the background, but it provides an attractive entry price point,” he said. “It is great value for the consumer, and on top of it, it provides that affordable protein proposition that consumers are looking for.”

Companywide, Camden-based Campbell’s had net earnings of $173 million, equal to 58¢ per share on the common stock, which were down 15% from $203 million, or 68¢ per share, in the previous year’s second quarter. Net sales increased 9% to $2.69 billion from $2.46 billion, driven by the acquisition of Sovos Brands, Inc. Organic sales declined 2%, driven by net price realization with flat volume/mix.

Over the first six months of the fiscal year, Campbell’s had net earnings of $391 million, or $1.31 per share, down 11% from $437 million, or $1.47 per share, in the same time of the previous year. Net sales in the six-month period increased 10% to $5.46 billion from $4.97 billion.

For the fiscal year, Camden-based Campbell’s now expects net sales growth of about 6% to 8%, down from a previous guidance of 9% to 11%, and organic net sales in a range of down 2% to flat, which compared to previous guidance of flat to a 2% increase.

“The lower organic net sales expectation is a result of a more muted volume mix contribution in the second half following the weaker-than-anticipated recovery in the snacking categories in the second quarter,” said Carrie Anderson, chief financial officer.",https://www.bakingbusiness.com/ext/resources/2025/03/07/AdobeStock_916300964_Editorial_Use_Only.jpg?height=635&t=1741358033&width=1200,N,,2025-03-07 12:19:00.783145

Leadership isn’t about fitting a mould – it’s about being genuine.
For me, it’s about creating an honest, judgment-free environment where people can explore their own path.
It’s one thing to talk about inclusion; it’s another to see individuals feel safe enough to show up fully as who they are.
That’s leadership in action, and theirs was exceptional.","International Women’s Day is right around the corner, but one day of recognition is hardly enough to celebrate the impact of women across all aspects of our lives.

As part of our continuing series, we’re spending this week and the next spotlighting voices from across the industry who have been kind enough to share their journeys, experiences, and insights.

This time, we hear from Rachida Murray, Chief Digital & Technology Officer at Spark Foundry Australia. Originally from France and now based in Sydney, she has always been fascinated by communication and mathematics. Growing up bilingual in a polyglot family, she developed a deep appreciation for sharing ideas in different ways.

Her journey into marketing began in business school, where she discovered a discipline that offered both creativity and opportunity.

The theme for International Women’s Day 2025 is “For ALL Women and Girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment.” What does that mean to you professionally and personally?

What an amazing theme for 2025! For me, it perfectly encapsulates what feminism means.

Professionally, as a female leader, it’s about creating equal opportunities for everyone. There’s an unfortunate tension in the fact that, while our workforce largely has the same rights, it doesn’t always translate into the same opportunities – largely due to the systems we operate in.

For example, when there is an industry training or event scheduled at breakfast or after work. While both men and women have the right to attend, we still live in a society where women are more likely to be the primary carers for children or elderly parents, limiting their ability to participate. Our role in leadership is to advocate for equal opportunity, not just equal rights.

Women are already powerful – it’s time we acknowledge that.

When it comes to empowerment, I have a slightly different perspective. Women represent over half of the population and control more than 80% of household spending. The narrative that women need empowering feels somewhat dated. Women are already powerful – it’s time we acknowledge that.

However, I do believe it is critical to the evolution of society that we empower men to take significant time off as primary carers when they become fathers; to take a day off to look after a sick child or parent; and to handle school drop-offs and pick-ups. Empowering men also means enabling them to say no to meetings that clash with these priorities.

What first drew you to the industry? Was there a defining moment or experience that shaped your path?

I studied a business degree, focusing on languages, marketing, and finance.

As a polyglot, I was always fascinated by communications, so marketing naturally appealed to me. I’m also a bit of a nerd, and solving numerical problems gives me great satisfaction. Honestly, I didn’t think I’d be able to reconcile these quite different areas of interest in a single career, until I did an internship in London for a telecommunications provider.

During that internship, I was tasked with setting up CRM systems, learning JavaScript, and establishing both SEM and SEO programs – all while using my third language. I loved it!

When I returned to Paris, my hometown, I landed a graduate role in the digital team at a little chocolate factory called Nestlé. That’s where I discovered agencies. I worked closely with some of the best in the business. The agency people were argumentative (well, French, to be honest), engaged in healthy debates, and sought data and evidence to test and learn.

It was truly a fabulous, formative experience. Reflecting on it now, I realise how much guidance I received from senior female leaders at Nestlé, Ogilvy and Publicis Groupe – mentorship that has stayed with me ever since.

Is there a person or people who inspired you professionally on your career journey?

There are so many, it’s hard to do the full list justice. Some were people I crossed paths with briefly, who offered words of wisdom in passing. Others have been formal mentors, like Adrianne Nixon (Mastercard) and Josie Brown (BWS), who generously shared their time and experiences when I first arrived in Australia. Their guidance helped me navigate unfamiliar territory, and I’m still grateful for it.

Then there are women who continue to inspire me every single day – like Imogen Hewitt (Publicis Groupe ANZ), whose intelligence, grace, empathy and ability to balance high performance with kindness in leadership is something I deeply admire.

You never know when kindness will resonate more deeply than you expect.

Many of the people who’ve influenced me probably have no idea how often I reflect on their words – even the smallest interactions can leave a lasting impression. It’s why I try to approach each day with the same warmth and thoughtfulness they showed me. You never know when kindness will resonate more deeply than you expect.

What’s a key lesson you’ve learned in your career that has shaped how you work today?

Leadership isn’t about fitting a mould – it’s about being genuine. There’s no need to try to emulate someone else’s leadership style or get caught up in behaviours that don’t resonate with you. Every day, I focus on being the best, most authentic version of myself – both at work and at home. And some days, I’m not the best version of myself. I own it, and I move on to the next day!

I’ve also learned that it’s OK to change your mind. In French, we say, “Only fools never change their minds.” There’s a common misconception that leaders should always have the answers. But the reality is, things change. Contexts shift, new information emerges, and what seemed like the right call yesterday may not be today.

True leadership is about taking accountability when you make the wrong call, being willing to adapt, and giving yourself permission to pivot – not just in business decisions, but also in what you want from your career.

I’ve also learned that it’s OK to change your mind. In French, we say, “Only fools never change their minds.”

Another key lesson is that no one achieves great things alone. Leading large, diverse teams has reinforced the importance of breaking down silos, fostering open communication and making sure people feel heard and valued. Setting a vision is important, but ensuring your team has the tools, confidence and support to deliver is what drives lasting success.

And finally, how you show up matters. Kindness, empathy and accountability aren’t just soft skills – they’re leadership essentials.

How has mentorship played a role in your career – both as someone receiving guidance and as a mentor to others? What have been your most meaningful takeaways from these relationships?

For me, mentorship has often been about navigating conflicting forces: my ambition, my drive for high performance and recognition, and my health, wellbeing and sense of self – as a woman, a mother and a leader. Having sounding boards, especially when I thought, “I can’t do this,” or felt like I was losing perspective, has been invaluable.

As a mentor today, I try to share my experiences with candour and without expectations. If what I share resonates, great. If it doesn’t, that’s okay too. For me, it’s about creating an honest, judgment-free environment where people can explore their own path.

How can organisations effectively champion diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), especially in the face of current challenges? What specific strategies have you found effective?

I firmly believe DEI is a collective responsibility – one that requires everyone to lean in. Creating truly inclusive environments isn’t just a task for leadership or HR; it’s something that needs to be embedded into the fabric of an organisation’s culture, policies and everyday interactions.

I’m incredibly proud to be the executive sponsor for Publicis Égalité in Australia, our LGBTQI+ community group. The progress we’ve made, and continue to make, in creating a workplace where all our people can be the best and most authentic versions of themselves is something that genuinely motivates me. It’s one thing to talk about inclusion; it’s another to see individuals feel safe enough to show up fully as who they are. That’s when you know you’re making a real difference.

Creating truly inclusive environments isn’t just a task for leadership or HR; it’s something that needs to be embedded into the fabric of an organisation’s culture, policies and everyday interactions.

But talk alone isn’t enough. DEI initiatives must be properly resourced – not just with well-intentioned statements but with tangible investment in time, education and leadership accountability. Token efforts or box-ticking exercises won’t move the needle.

From my experience within Publicis Groupe, an effective DEI strategy sits on three key pillars:

Policies: These need to be more than words on paper. They should reflect modern realities – whether that’s flexible working arrangements, comprehensive parental leave policies that support all family structures or clear anti-discrimination measures.

Education: Bias, whether conscious or unconscious, doesn’t shift without awareness and education. Regular, thoughtful training programs paired with open forums for discussion are key to helping people understand different perspectives and challenge outdated thinking.

Behaviours: Culture isn’t what you say, it’s the behaviours you tolerate. You can have the best policies in the world, but if everyday interactions undermine them, your culture won’t evolve. Leaders need to model inclusive behaviours, call out exclusionary actions and create environments where everyone feels psychologically safe.

Lastly, leadership must be open to evolving. DEI work is complex and nuanced. It’s okay to get things wrong, course-correct and continuously learn.

Is there a project or initiative you’ve worked on that you’re particularly proud of? What made it meaningful to you?

I was on parental leave in 2020 when the so-called ‘third-party cookie apocalypse’ was first announced. Returning to work in 2021 (after months of lockdown with a newborn and homeschooling a five-year-old), I felt disconnected and out of touch.

Despite that, my team had been hard at work. I was incredibly proud of the mitigation strategies they had crafted, tested and consolidated. Together, we built a Digital Growth Opportunities framework – one that was both future-proof and effective. Over the following years, it evolved into a core part of our operations, helping clients unlock growth across digital paid, owned and commerce channels, all supported by technology.

Leadership is what happens when you’re not in the room.

While much of the heavy lifting happened during my leave, I’m still genuinely proud of this project for several reasons:

Leadership is what happens when you’re not in the room.

My team took the vision we developed (while I was eight months pregnant, no less) and ran with it. They navigated ambiguity, collaborated and delivered something impressive without needing me there every step of the way. That’s leadership in action, and theirs was exceptional.

I overcame a moment of personal and professional uncertainty.

Coming back, I questioned everything: my ability, my career choices, my future as a working mum. But I proved to myself that my experience, adaptability and value still held strong. I leaned on industry friends (asking for help isn’t usually my forte) and got up to speed. Managing that self-doubt was as much a part of the journey as the work itself.

It turns out, I must have done alright.

Today, I’m the co-chair of the IAB Data Council in Australia, and I can talk about third-party cookie deprecation in my sleep.

The fear is that US banks, helped by looser regulations, will more easily be able to win business and dominate the banking landscape around the world.
“The Commission will continue assessing developments in banking markets to ensure swift reaction whenever financial stability, the internal market, or international competitiveness of the EU banking sector is threatened,” the Commission said in the draft communiqué seen by Bloomberg.
A spokesperson for the European Commission declined to comment.","The European Commission has vowed to speed up a planned review of the competitiveness of the bloc’s banks after the region’s three biggest economies demanded urgent action to ensure their lenders can properly compete with Wall Street rivals.

The Commission will publish a report on the “overall situation” of the banking system that includes an evaluation of the sector’s competitiveness by the end of 2026, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News.

The EU’s next scheduled review of banking regulation was due to be completed by 2028, but France, Germany and Italy have been intensively lobbying for such a review to take place more urgently, arguing that Europe must act to close the gap between its lenders and US rivals.

The move comes as US President Donald Trump has promised to ditch large swaths of regulation as part of his plans to stoke economic growth in the country. Regulators around the world now fear that the Trump administration could scrap parts of its plans to implement an update of stricter capital standards known locally as Basel Endgame.

The confidential document also hinted at plans for single supervision of Europe’s capital markets though it stopped short of suggesting that Europe’s main supervisor for such activities - the European Securities and Markets Authority - assume the same powers held by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

“Delivering single supervision in capital markets will require a new balance between supervisory responsibility at EU and national levels,” the document said, suggesting European supervisory agencies “make better use of their existing supervisory convergence tools to achieve more integrated and harmonised supervision.”

It also promised to follow up with proposals “to achieve more unified supervision of capital markets as indicated in the Competitiveness Compass, including by transferring certain tasks to the EU level.”",https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/l4mahh-shutterstock-1329076487.jpg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/shutterstock_1329076487.jpg,N,,2025-03-07 10:54:34.996661

The acclaimed Philips Signage 3000 Series EcoDesign is PPDS’ debut digital signage offering designed with the company’s evolutionary EcoDesign methodology, implementing new manufacturing processes, physical features, materials, packaging, and built in software that are kinder to the environment and deliver better energy efficiency.

Delivering uncompromised high impact 4K performance while consuming 50 per cent less* energy versus comparable premium digital signage models, the Philips Signage 3000 Series EcoDesign has already received among the industry’s lowest energy label ratings (E on the 50″ model, D on the 55″ and C on the 65″ models) and was initially awarded an EPEAT Climate+ Silver designation.

Founded in 2006, EPEAT is the world’s premier eco label for electronics, measuring the social and environmental impacts of products from extraction to end-of-life, while also certifying they have met 100 per cent of the Climate Criteria plus at least 50 per cent of the existing optional criteria. These include:

Climate: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing supply chain and product use.

Circularity: How products are designed for reuse and recycling, and which ones responsibly address packaging, water, and waste.

Chemicals of concern: Eliminating the use of toxic chemicals that are hazardous to human health and the environment.

Responsible supply chains: The responsible sourcing of materials, fair labour practices, and worker health and safety in the electronics supply chain.

Owned and operated by the Global Electronics Council® (GEC) – a mission-driven non-profit that seeks to create a world with only sustainable electronics – EPEAT helps to support and promote more informed, sustainable-driven buying decisions, providing access to a free online Registry, identifying and detailing products from the broadest range of manufacturers across the globe.

As a globally recognised leader and advocate for innovating sustainability driven AV hardware and software solutions – including implementing the latest packaging designs and technological breakthroughs into existing products for advanced performance and energy efficiencies – the 50” Philips Signage 3000 EcoDesign meets the most demanding set of criteria for sustainability leadership in electronics, with the 55” and 65” set to follow.

Bart Wouters, International Product Manager at PPDS, commented: “At PPDS, the environment and sustainability are at the core for our product development, from the initial designs, right the way through to manufacturing, delivery, and post installation. With the Philips Signage 3000 EcoDesign Series, we achieved a major industry milestone in gaining EPEAT Climate+ Silver. As with all our products, we continued in our pursuit for more. And now this groundbreaking product achieved even better, with EPEAT Climate+ Gold.”

The gold standard

Continuing to innovate, and to overcome the challenges customers are facing in the marketplace, the Philips Signage 3000 Series EcoDesign benefits significantly from PPDS’ ongoing strategy to reduce wastage – including plastic – from its packaging, delivered in 90% recycled and 100% recyclable materials, with the removal of paper-based manuals and instructions.

In addition, all plastic bags have been removed, while the use of polystyrene has been replaced with innovative cushioning made using 100 per cent recycled carton, maintaining the same high levels of safety and protection of the product.

Furthermore, the Philips 3000 Series EcoDesign – part of PPDS’ growing Android SoC family – can be managed either manually, or entirely remotely, using third party software or PPDS’ range of in-house solutions, including the Philips Wave remote device management ecosystem.

Just getting started

Andrea Barbuti, Global Product Management Lead for EMEA at PPDS, added: “The scrutiny of our products for their sustainability features doesn’t end when we launch a new display. That is still very much the beginning. Tracking the performance of a range, checking the product life cycle, and working for better and more. It is all very much on our radar. With Android SoC, we strive to update and enhance at every opportunity and, as we unearth innovations and methodologies to help enhance performance and energy efficiencies, we work to include these in our existing models, as well as our brand new ones.

Now is not the time to rest on one’s risk management laurels; it’s imperative to keep driving for solutions.
Top Benefits of a Multinational Property Program Getting a handle on growing property risks as they impact businesses across the globe is the main goal of a multinational property program.
“Clients are increasingly asking questions and seeking advice on their property insurance and risk management strategies,” Sansone said.
AXA XL, the property & casualty and specialty risk division of AXA, provides insurance and risk management products and services for mid-sized companies through to large multinationals, and reinsurance solutions to insurance companies globally.","The commercial property insurance market has had its fair share of ups and downs over the last few years, from the impact of natural catastrophes to economic pressures and inflation. Multinationals with properties in various locations have had to come up with solid risk management plans to keep pace.

Some lines appear to be reaching a level of stabilization following years of necessary rate increases; however, multinational businesses must continue to pursue the best risk strategies possible. Now is not the time to rest on one’s risk management laurels; it’s imperative to keep driving for solutions.

“The outlook for the commercial property insurance market is still cautious, even with a sense of stabilization occurring. Insurers need to balance rate pressures and responsible underwriting practices. I believe, for multinationals, an emphasis on risk mitigation and property risk engineering will be essential,” said Michele Sansone, CUO Property and Multinational Solutions, AXA XL.

One strategy that works is a multinational property program, which can enhance risk mitigation efforts across operations. Insurers and property owners work together to develop comprehensive risk management, aimed at addressing the various challenges that persist globally.

Here’s a deeper look at what makes a strong multinational property program and how these operations can work with their insurance partners to get the most out of them.

Property Risks Still Rising

Perhaps the most important thing to review is that, even when rates are stabilizing, risk remains.

Hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters are still growing concerns for the property market. The U.S. alone saw 24 disaster events with total losses exceeding $1 billion each in 2024.

Wildfires in Chile, floods in Hungary, Cyclone Chido — all events just scratching the surface of last year’s natural catastrophes are having severe impact on how multinational business is being conducted.

“The primary challenge lies in the cost of transporting goods from one location to another and understanding the potential business interruption impact resulting from these costs, rather than the supply chain itself,” said Sansone.

“For instance, if a piece of equipment manufactured in Germany is damaged due to a fire in the U.S., the key considerations are the time required to replace it and whether the cost will be higher. These types of impacts persist, indicating that the risks are still present, albeit with varying degrees of severity.”

Outside of Nat CATs, there’s also concerns around geopolitical disruptors, like Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine, as one example.

“Inflation is also significantly influencing the commercial property insurance market,” Sansone added.

Top Benefits of a Multinational Property Program

Getting a handle on growing property risks as they impact businesses across the globe is the main goal of a multinational property program.

However, creating and maintaining such a program may seem like a daunting task. But it’s important to note that having a global system in place can provide a comprehensive view of all operations and enhance effective mitigation strategies.

“A global program provides a standardized approach to risk management, ensuring consistency across all operations,” Sansone explained. That consistency further enables multinational businesses to collect centralized data and analysis, leading to better risk assessment and decision making.

Not to mention, a multinational property program gives way to improved cost efficiency because it leverages global purchasing power and reduces redundancy.

A Local View to Managing Global Risk

Multinational property programs will often look to insurers to front their operations. This involves using a local insurer in each country to issue policies, with the multinational company retaining the risks.

“This structure allows companies to comply with local regulations while maintaining control over their global risk strategy,” Sansone explained.

The fronting partner has the ability to harness local insurance prowess to gain better understanding of regional risks and the regulatory environment the company is operating within.

“This is crucial for tailoring coverage,” said Sansone.

Local expertise also helps in navigating cultural differences and building relationships with stakeholders in different areas. It also facilitates faster and more effective claims resolution due to localized knowledge and support.

“Having a network with local expertise is crucial in providing valuable information to our clients,” Sansone concluded. “Our goal is to provide consultative advice when we review and offer insurance solutions.”

Best Collaboration Strategies for Risk Management

Once a multinational operation commits to having a global property program, it’s key to think about the makeup of its insurance team. A good insurer will not only have the breadth of knowledge needed to manage risk across borders but also an internal network primed to work with the multinational.

“Effective collaboration between a carrier and an insured involves more than just the underwriter and the client; it also means involving claims and risk engineering teams as well.

“After all, the client is paying a premium for potential claims, so they need to understand how the policy will be interpreted,” said Sansone.

Risk engineering plays a vital role in helping clients become better risks. By involving these professionals, multinationals have the ability to receive comprehensive risk assessments that not only help build risk mitigation strategies but also can lower potential costs.

“Loss estimates are an essential aspect to the information risk engineers provide. If we base all loss estimates on outdated information or property values, we are likely to see very high numbers — a worst-case scenario for an underwriter,” Sansone said.

“But if an engineer informs us about risk mitigation measures like sprinklers and shut-off valves, the potential charges will be lower.”

Access to the claims team is essential for effective collaboration. If an insured is familiar with its claims team, they have the ability to inquire about previous claims or discuss a concern raised by senior management.

“Providing them with a point of contact for future questions is invaluable,” Sansone said.

Across the Globe, Under One Roof

At AXA XL, the team understands that, in order to truly manage today’s most pressing property risks, clients need the utmost support from their insurance partner. That’s why Sansone and her colleagues work every day to provide tailored coverage to meet the diverse needs of its multinational partners.

“Clients are increasingly asking questions and seeking advice on their property insurance and risk management strategies,” Sansone said. “We leverage our local market knowledge and expertise to provide better risk assessments and management tailored to our clients’ specific regional needs.”

AXA XL recently launched a Multinational Solutions Portal for its clients. The portal provides centralized management of multinational insurance programs across operations, with the goal to simplify administration and reporting.

“Users have a clear overview of the global property program including where instructions have been given, the status of policy issuance and copies of issued policies. They have access to all of their policy information and data in one place including the number of countries covered, policies instructed, issues and outstanding,” Sansone explained.

Above all, AXA XL’s multinational solutions aim to provide businesses with peace of mind as they navigate the complexities of operating in various global markets.

“When a client approaches us to front their program and provide evidence of insurance in all the countries where they operate, we conduct a thorough analysis,” Sansone said. “We examine the exposures in each country to determine the significance of having a local policy. It’s crucial to ensure that the policy issued in each country is compliant and has the appropriate limits, coverage, and premium charge.”

“We do all of this so that our multinational clients have the utmost confidence in their insurance coverage and global risk mitigation strategy,” she said.

ITV Starts Recouping ITVX Costs “Earlier Than Expected”

ITVX revenues have exceeded costs “two years earlier than expected”, according to ITV’s full-year earnings, and the company expects to have recouped its investment in the streaming service this year. The UK broadcaster said it has “optimised investment in content and technology”, and posted 15 percent YoY growth in digital ad revenues in 2024 alongside two percent growth in total advertising revenues.

Total revenues fell 3 percent however, weighed down by a 6 percent decline at ITV Studios, due to the impact of the Hollywood strikes in 2023, alongside “softer demand from free-to-air broadcasters”. But the company delivered £521 million in pre-tax profits during 2024, up from £193 million in 2023, and expects ITV Studios to return to growth this year.

“We are becoming a more resilient business with content production and digital now accounting for close to two-thirds of our revenue,” said Carolyn McCall, Chief Executive of ITV. “Our ongoing transformation ensures we are an adaptable and agile company, well positioned to deliver good profitable growth, strong cash generation and attractive returns to shareholders.”

WPP Announces Stability AI Investment and Partnership

Agency holding group WPP this week announced a new strategic partnership and investment in Stability AI, developer of Stable Diffusion, which the company says will enhance its ability to deliver AI-driven solutions across channels including streaming platforms and interactive experiences.

WPP will use Stability AI’s open visual media models across image, video, 3D and audio to create marketing assets, while WPP’s market insights will guide development of Stability AI’s technology. The two companies say they will establish a joint R&D pipeline, and Stability AI’s models will be integrated directly into WPP’s ‘operating system’ WPP Open.

“The advertising landscape is evolving quickly, and AI is at the heart of that evolution,” said WPP CEO Mark Read. “Our investment in Stability AI, alongside our increased annual investment of £300m in AI and technology through WPP Open, ensures WPP and our clients remain at the forefront of this new era of innovation. As part of the collaboration, WPP and Stability AI will also work on bringing their talent pools closer together, strengthening WPP’s in-house production and studio facilities and capabilities.”

IAB UK Forecasts Rapid Growth for Video Amid “Demise of the Traditional Media Funnel”

IAB UK forecasts video ad spend to grow at twice the rate of the overall UK digital ad market over the next five years, amid a rapidly changing ad market in which agency models and planning approaches will become much less channel-centric.

The trade group’s new ‘Futurescape’ report forecasts that total digital ad spend in the UK will reach £43.1 billion by 2030, with the market averaging five percent growth year-on-year. ‘Video display’ (a category defined by IAB UK as including social video, BVOD, outstream, publisher video and AVOD) meanwhile is expected to reach £14.7 billion over the same time frame, representing 34 percent of all digital ad spend.

The report also foresees the demise of the traditional media funnel, due to the growing role of retail media platforms, and AI’s impact on how people discover and purchase products. With instantly shoppable formats potentially becoming the default, IAB UK predicts that brand marketing will become more important than ever, helping to create differentiation and win consumers’ attention.

ICO Investigates How TikTok, Reddit, and Imgur Use Children’s Data

The Guardian Launches Ad-Lite Tier in Consent-or-Pay Strategy

UK newspaper The Guardian this week launched a new ad-lite subscription tier, which allows readers to pay £5 per month in order to opt-out of personalised advertising. The move comes shortly after the UK’s data regulator gave the green light to consent-or-pay mechanisms as a way of collecting consent for personalised advertising.

“Put simply, the more people who press “reject”, the less money we have to fund the quality reporting you value from the Guardian, including in-depth investigations and world-leading climate coverage,” said The Guardian’s chief advertising officer Imogen Fox. “As a result, we are now asking readers who aren’t already paying for an ad-free experience to pay to reject personalised advertising.”

Reach’s Post-Cookie Strategy is Helping it Deal with Gen AI Threats

While third-party cookies no longer look set to disappear from Chrome entirely, Reach executives say the publisher’s first-party data strategy has delivered strong results for the publisher regardless. Reach’s full year financial results show that while total revenues fell by 5.3 percent, to £538.6 million, digital revenues were up by 2.1 percent. And within digital, it’s data-driven revenues which are driving growth.

Speaking on an earnings call, CEO Jim Mullen also said that the group’s focus on first-party data has seen its newspapers forge closer relationships with audiences. And this in turn is helping Reach-owned newspapers become less dependent on search traffic, which is at risk of drying up as search engines promote AI-generated news summaries within their interfaces.

Brand Safety Institute Helps Publishers Check Whether They’re Classed as MFA

Amid an industry push to crack down on wasteful ad funding of made for advertising (MFA) websites, there’s been debate about what does and doesn’t constitute MFA, with some publishers saying they’ve unwittingly found themselves on MFA blocklists. The Brand Safety Institute has launched a new tool to help solve this problem, allowing publishers to check whether their site domains appear on MFA blocklists used by third-party vendors. The tool will also help publishers make changes to their websites to prevent them from appearing on these lists, according to AdExchanger.

Got privacy? Florida seeks drug prescription data with names of patients, doctors

Florida’s insurance regulator has demanded an unusually intrusive trove of data on millions of prescription drugs filled in the state last year, including the names of patients taking the medications, their dates of birth and doctors they’ve seen.

More from the Orlando Sentinel and Medical Xpress.

Ad fraud is a major problem for advertisers, says UKSAFC. Estimates put the cost of ad fraud at up to $100 billion and suggest that almost half of ad spend drives no results. While there is no single measure to combat ad fraud, UKSAFC says it believes the scale of the problem could be significantly reduced if advertisers and their agencies took the time to verify the credentials of the publishers and websites on which their ads appear.

The UKSAFC’s Know Your Customer (KYC) initiative will invite all players in the programmatic advertising supply chain to carry out due diligence checks on every company they deal with - requiring them to provide independent verification of the company’s name, registered address and company number, company directors, and the company’s bank details. Companies that get behind the initiative will benefit from increased trust and investment in their platforms from brands, added UKSAFC.

UKSAFC says the initiative stems from discussions held at its meetings throughout 2024 - a year in which significant progress was made at both an industry and government level. The riots which occurred in the summer, and the part played by fraudulent MFA (Made For Advertising) sites in fuelling the violence, raised awareness among politicians of the ad fraud issue and its consequences. UKSAFC is committed to continuing to push action on ad fraud during 2025.

“The fight against ad fraud is a journey, not a destination,” said UKSAFC spokesperson Ian Moss. “If advertisers and their agencies have better control over where their money is going, we feel we could eliminate many of the bad actors at a stroke. The Know Your Customer initiative will go a long way towards cleaning up ad networks. Now we need everyone in the industry to get on board.”

The UKSAFC says it will be undertaking consultations with the industry trade bodies, platforms, agencies and brands over the coming months to get their feedback and support.

The UKSAFC was set up in 2023 to highlight the scale of advertising fraud and the threat it represents, and to coordinate a multi-stakeholder approach to addressing the issue. The UKSAFC’s taskforce, which consists of advisors from the industry, has come together to tackle the problem in the UK and aims to provide a template the rest of the world can follow.",,N,,2025-03-07 10:17:16.211980

Nottingham Building Society announced yesterday it is paying out £11.2m, following on from financial announcements in recent days from Leeds Building Society of its £10.3m commitment and Newcastle Building Society saying it has set aside £20m for the voluntary payments to customers affected by the collapse of a company called Philips Trust Corporation (PTC).

The three mutuals, along with Saffron Building Society which is due to reveal its payment figure later this month, decided last year to voluntarily reimburse almost 700 affected customers despite having no legal or regulatory obligation to do so. It followed The Yorkshire Post and other media highlighting the stories of victims who had been campaigning for compensation.

The societies and six other smaller mutuals had introduced hundreds of customers to unregulated advisers who sold them family trusts linked to properties and investment schemes for their savings which then became mired in financial complications.

The assets ultimately ended up in the hands of PTC. It collapsed in 2022 while holding £138m of 2,300 building society customers’ assets including properties in trust and £44m worth of invested savings.

Administrators then struggled to recover millions in savings which PTC had passed on to high-risk “investment management” firms, several of which had themselves collapsed. It had left those affected fearing they would lose everything – eventually leading to the announcement of the voluntary repayment scheme.

Among those affected were two brothers from Dewsbury after the £180,000 proceeds from the sale of their late mother’s house were used by PTC to pay off other debts rather than being returned to them. Leeds Building Society has confirmed it is refunding the full amount.

Newcastle Building Society highlighted the payments as the key reason that its £15.7m profits before tax for 2024 were 46 per cent down on the £29.1m recorded the year before.

Chief executive Andrew Haigh said: “As we began to understand the scale of the impact on members, even though the society had no responsibility for, nor involvement in these actions, nor did we have any legal or regulatory obligation to offer support, we chose to offer voluntary support to the members involved. The strength of the society and underlying performance during the year ensured that we were able to set aside a sum of £20m to provide this support.

“We believe that these actions are entirely consistent with the principles of the society and the wider mutual movement, in supporting members through such a time of difficulty.”

Under the agreement, the societies are due to receive money back from administrators depending on what can be recovered, with the administration process due to end next year. Nottingham’s 2024 accounts listed an initial recovery of £1m.

A Nottingham Building Society spokesperson said: “This £1m recovery figure sum is NBS's share of the amount returned to the building societies from Kroll at the end of 2024 relating to the recovery of one of the PTC funds, the Woodville fund.

""We are pleased to have been able to support those of our customers impacted by Philips Trust.

""We think it is unlikely that we will see any significant recoveries from the administration process but we continue to be in contact with the administrators as they work through this.”

A spokesperson for the Philips Trust Action Group, made up of affected victims and family members, said: ""Had it not been for the relentless coverage by The Yorkshire Post and other media outlets – whose reporting played a crucial role in embarrassing the building societies into doing the right thing – these voluntary financial settlements may never have materialised.”",,N,,2025-03-07 13:07:29.182890

Mixue Bingcheng is a Chinese bubble tea and ice cream chain with more than 45,000 restaurants worldwide as of September 2024, while the number of McDonald’s restaurants all over the world is around 41,800, according to Statista via Chowhound.

The Asia-based fast-food chain is known for selling soft-serve ice cream cones for one yuan (15 cents) and drinks ranging from between 2 to 8 yuan (30 cents to $1.20).

Despite its huge number of locations, 90 percent of them are in China. There are also outlets in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. There isn’t a single location in the United States.

Mixue Bingcheng was founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao, and originally started out as a store selling shaved ice and cold drinks.

“Let people around the world eat well and drink well for just two American dollars,” Hongchao previously told Chinese state media about his strategy for the business.

Over 99 percent of the bubble tea chain’s stores are franchised, with most of their revenue coming from selling food materials, equipment, and packaging to its franchisees.

Although Mixue Bingcheng does have the highest number of locations worldwide, its revenue is still behind other large drink chains in the U.S., such as Starbucks and Tim Hortons.

Its growth is rapid, though. According to its prospectus, Mixue’s net profit jumped 42 percent to 3.49 billion yuan ($479 million) in the first nine months of 2024 from the same period in the previous year. Its revenue increased 21 percent to 18.7 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) in the first nine months of 2024.

The scheme, which amassed over 56 million downloads and generated more than 200 million bid requests daily, was systematically distributing full-screen interstitial video ads while offering no real functionality to users.

According to the IAS report, the fraudsters behind Vapor created over 180 fake apps, disguising them as common utilities, health trackers, and lifestyle applications. Initially launched with legitimate functions, these apps were later updated to remove usability, leaving only intrusive advertisements in place. Many of these apps removed their icons or open buttons, making them difficult for users to detect or uninstall.

Google has since taken action, removing all identified Vapor apps from the Play Store and implementing Google Play Protect measures to disable these fraudulent applications, even if they were installed from third-party sources. Despite these enforcement efforts, the Vapor scheme demonstrated remarkable resilience, with fraudsters creating new developer accounts and continuously introducing new fraudulent apps.

The Impact on Advertisers

Vapor’s ability to manipulate ad bidding systems on a large scale posed a significant threat to advertisers. By flooding the digital ad ecosystem with fake impressions, the operation diverted advertising spend away from legitimate publishers and businesses, costing the industry millions in lost revenue.

Industry Response & Future Monitoring

IAS has collaborated with industry partners to mitigate the impact of the Vapor scheme. Through its fraud pre-bid avoidance technology, IAS ensures that demand-side platforms (DSPs) do not bid on impressions originating from these fraudulent apps. Additionally, IAS continues to monitor for emerging threats, as fraudsters rapidly evolve their tactics to bypass security measures.

As digital ad fraud remains a growing concern, the Vapor case serves as a stark reminder of the sophistication and scale of modern cyber threats.

The deal, revealed on Thursday, is expected to expand Publicis’ data capabilities and global reach.

Lotame, founded in 2006, provides identity-based data solutions and management tools, working across 109 countries. With the decline of third-party cookies, its proprietary identity system has proven useful, generating 1.6 billion unique IDs, serving clients such as PepsiCo and Carat. Publicis says incorporating Lotame into Epsilon will allow it to reach 91% of adult internet users worldwide and access 4 billion customer profiles.

Publicis has spent around $1.5 billion on mergers and acquisitions over the past six months, including purchases of Influential, Mars United Commerce, and BR Media. The company has earmarked a further $800 to $900 million for M&A in 2025, prioritising first-party data, digital media, and AI-driven marketing technology.

While financial details of the Lotame deal have not been disclosed, Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun said the acquisition aligns with the group’s long-term strategy to strengthen its first-party data stack. He also confirmed that Lotame will operate under the Epsilon umbrella but may retain its branding in some regions, such as APAC.

Lotame’s 150+ employees will transition to Publicis, and the company will continue serving its existing 4,000 clients, including businesses outside Publicis’ network. This suggests that, despite the acquisition, Lotame may maintain some level of independence within its new structure.

The purchase also bolsters Publicis’ CoreAI, an artificial intelligence-driven operating system designed to assist with media planning, creative execution, and data analysis.

One data point presented at the event showed that 62% of business leaders from large organizations expressed confidence in their growth prospects (Capgemini Research Institute). However, they also recognized the need for bold actions to achieve sustainable success. Key priorities such as cost control, supply chain resilience, and customer experience were at the forefront of discussions. For CIOs, the message was clear: Efficiency, future-ready technology, and innovative workforce strategies are essential.

Cost reduction: The balancing act

Cost control remains a critical focus for CIOs in 2025. A Davos presentation highlighted that 56% of organizations are prioritizing expenditure reduction over revenue growth in 2025 (Capgemini Research Institute). CIOs must balance cost cutting with strategic investments.

Our take: CIOs must focus on smart spending rather than indiscriminate budget slashing. Investing in automation technologies can significantly reduce waste and downtime. Modernizing infrastructure will cut down on repairs, outages, and energy costs. Accelerating digital transformation is essential to optimize business processes, and reducing technology debt will enhance agility and efficiency. (See also: 10 IT budgeting mistakes to avoid.)

Supply chain resilience and sustainability

The fragility of global supply chains has been a major concern, making resilience and sustainability top priorities. Sixty-two percent of business leaders reported in a Capgemini Research Institute survey that they plan to boost sustainability investments.

Our take: Building resilient and sustainable supply chains is crucial. CIOs should drive technology-enabled sustainability initiatives, such as green logistics , ensuring supply chain visibility and security will help meet regulatory requirements and improve brand reputation and market growth. They should also implement AI-powered predictive analytics for better decision-making. (See also: The top 15 supply chain management certifications.)

Customer experience (CX) imperative

Customer expectations are evolving rapidly, and meeting them is crucial for competitive advantage. Seventy-eight percent of business leaders reported in a Capgemini Research Institute survey that they are increasing CX investments.

Our take: CX investments are paramount. CIOs should enhance AI-driven customer engagement through hyper-personalization and leverage data analytics to improve customer journeys and boost brand loyalty and revenue growth. Investing in automation to streamline service delivery and prioritizing CX technologies will help maintain industry leadership.

U.S. vs. Europe tech investment disparity

One of the stark realities highlighted at Davos 2025 is the growing disparity in technology investments between the U.S. and Europe. U.S. enterprises are set to outspend their European counterparts significantly, according to research from Capgemini Research Institute. Large U.S. enterprises will allocate 1.45% of their annual revenue to technology, compared with 1.29% in Europe. For midsize enterprises, the gap is even wider, with the U.S. spending 3.04% versus Europe’s 2.07%.

This disparity stems from several factors:

Slower commercialization of innovations in Europe

Regulatory fragmentation that stifles growth

Insufficient public and private R&D investments

A large base of SMEs struggling with tech adoption

Brain drains to the U.S. due to a more innovation-friendly environment

A focus on mature technologies over emerging ones

Our take: European CIOs need to bridge the innovation gap through bold actions. They must overcome regulatory barriers, increase investment in emerging technologies, and foster a supportive startup ecosystem.

Talent scarcity

Another unavoidable truth is the critical issue of talent scarcity. From IMF’s World Economic Outlook of October 2024, we know that 64% of business leaders identified talent shortages as a significant risk to business growth over the next 12-18 months. Industries like telecom, media, high-tech, life sciences, and insurance are particularly affected.

Our take: Talent scarcity is a significant risk. CIOs must focus on attracting top-tier digital talent and ensuring their existing workforce remains competitive. They must shift from a job title-centric approach to a skills-based model. Upskilling and reskilling should be core business strategies, emphasizing communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. Without the right talent, even the best technology and transformation strategies will fall short. (See also: CIO hiring on the rise: How to land a top tech exec role in 2025.)

Conclusion: A call to action for CIOs

In summary, Davos 2025 highlighted the need for CIOs to balance cost efficiency with innovation. Focus on strategic cost cutting, modernizing infrastructure, and reducing tech debt. Prioritize supply chain resilience and sustainability. Enhance customer experience through AI and data analytics. Address the U.S.-Europe tech investment gap and tackle talent shortages with upskilling initiatives. Leveraging these insights and strategic guidance will be crucial for navigating the challenges ahead and ensuring success in 2025 and beyond.

“I strongly believe that empowering women with data-driven insights is essential — not only to advance gender equality but also to drive sustainable economic growth across the region,” Margaret stated.
Such growth has positioned MSL APAC as one of the fastest-growing regions within the MSL global network.
Moreover, consumers are more discerning, demanding and less trusting of companies and brands–adding to evolving challenges for industry leaders to explain to their clients.","As a public relations network under Publicis Groupe, MSL has strived to make its clients stand out publicly through enhanced capabilities in creative and unique earned-first storytelling, strategic stakeholder engagement and sophisticated influencer marketing. In an era where corporate reputation is important to stand out from polarising consumer viewpoints, services like those from MSL help brands navigate changing narratives and insights from the masses.

With such a task in mind, how does an agency like MSL continuously meet the ever-changing expectations of the industry, and how do its talents also evolve alongside it?

To answer these questions, we recently sat down with Margaret Key, chief executive officer at MSL APAC for our latest Agency Leadership Decoded interview, as she shares her guiding principles of leadership and her outlook on MSL’s growth in the region.

Understanding her leadership philosophy

As the leader of MSL in the APAC region, Margaret understands that she carries a very strong sense of responsibility for their network, their clients and their teams. She firmly believes that leadership is not defined by title or position but by the ability to inspire, guide and elevate others towards a common goal or shared purpose.

“At the core of my approach are trust and accountability – fundamental principles that create an environment where teams feel empowered to take ownership, think independently, and drive meaningful outcomes. I want our leaders and teams to feel comfortable talking to me, telling me things they enjoy about their work but also equally, what they don’t enjoy.

She further notes that she is fortunate that her professional experiences have also touched her at a personal level by expanding her community, her growth mindset and how she views the world.

“As such, I look at what I do as important to contributing–both professionally and personally,” she added.

Margaret admits that when she first started her stint at MSL, she observed how Publicis was already very far into consolidation under the country model, which made it a challenge to demonstrate the power of the MSL network.

“As the only PR agency, MSL was thus not well understood for what it did and how it fit into the Groupe as well as the value PR can bring in part of the proposition to clients,” she notes.

To navigate this particular challenge, Margaret explained that instead of trying to push for understanding, she spent more time with their MSL leaders, trying to appreciate how they were working at the local level, what challenges they faced and where they saw opportunities in the country and across the region. This then allowed her to present back to the MSL and Groupe leadership on their ‘shared’ challenges and opportunities.

“By looking to how we could evolve together, we naturally leaned more into each other and that has made all the difference, internally as well as externally, showcasing more collaborative work across the region,” she stated.

Initiatives for women empowerment

One of the initiatives within MSL that Margaret has taken part of is the launch of the Women’s Forum Asia Barometer–which she spearheaded. Said strategic initiative is designed to uncover the untapped economic potential of women across key markets, including Australia, China, Japan, and Korea.

Moreover, this report also highlighted critical workplace challenges and persistent gender disparities in labour force participation, reinforcing the urgency for actionable solutions.

For instance, in its latest report for 2024, it highlighted how 1 in 3 women have already realised they were paid less than male colleagues with equal competence. Moreover, around 1 in 3 women have also realised that a male colleague had been promoted or chosen for promotion over them, even though she was more competent.

“I strongly believe that empowering women with data-driven insights is essential — not only to advance gender equality but also to drive sustainable economic growth across the region,” Margaret stated.

Aside from the Women’s Forum Asia Barometer, she also led the formation of the MSL APAC EXCO team, where over 50% of leadership positions are held by women.

“This initiative reflects my dedication to championing diversity within the Groupe, fostering a leadership culture that is equitable, representative, and built for long-term impact,” she added.

Navigating milestones and what lies ahead

Reflecting on MSL APAC’s trajectory from five years ago, she has stated that the firm has achieved significant transformation, where half of their top clients now span multiple markets, with most clients generating significant revenue, and their largest client reaching a substantial annualised amount. Such growth has positioned MSL APAC as one of the fastest-growing regions within the MSL global network.

“The robust MSL network enabled local offices to tap into broader ideas and strategies, leveraging regional insights to benefit local clients and support their growth beyond borders. This success underscores the power of strategic leadership, operational excellence, and a unified vision for growth and innovation,” she explained.

When asked on her advice for future professionals in this industry, Margaret said that as a service industry, the future of leaders in this industry must be agile and reflect the changes that clients commonly face.

She added that there has never been a more dynamic time than now when one considers the speed of change across technology, innovation, media consumption and consumer sentiment. Moreover, consumers are more discerning, demanding and less trusting of companies and brands–adding to evolving challenges for industry leaders to explain to their clients.

“Our clients look to us for guidance, best practice and stewardship. The future leaders of marketing communications must be informed and focused on the journey but most importantly, the output as defined by business outcomes. They must also be able to transcend the traditional siloes of communication disciplines,” she concluded.

ID11,CVS Health,2025-03-07 13:38:19+00:00,Healthcare Dive,EHR vendors turn to artificial intelligence to modernize health records,,,,,,https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ehr-artificial-intelligence-efforts-epic-oracle/741541/,"Some of the largest EHR vendors, including Epic and Oracle, have announced or accelerated modernization efforts in recent months.
And about two-thirds of its customer base are live with the vendor’s generative AI products, according to Howard.
Meanwhile Meditech and eClinicalWorks, a company that offers cloud-based EHR software currently in use at 70,000 care sites, are pursing a partnership approach.
Generative AI in particular is tricky to monitor.
There should always be a human in the loop when it comes to ambient documentation and generative AI products, said Meditech’s Wilkes.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Health records companies are racing to weave artificial intelligence into multiple segments of their software, hoping that by streamlining clunky experiences they can attract clients and keep up with competitors doing the same.

Some of the largest EHR vendors, including Epic and Oracle, have announced or accelerated modernization efforts in recent months. The companies say they aim to increase the productivity of a healthcare system facing rising costs — while improving job satisfaction for doctors and nurses, increasing the quality of patient care and advancing the state of the art of medicine.

The shift represents a sea change for a software often cited by providers as a significant source of frustraction.

“Doctors are not looking for AI to act as a doctor, to step in their place,” said Leigh Burchell, chair of the Electronic Health Records Association. “They really want to take the things that are adminsitrative burdens, or that take them time after a visit to document, and get help with that. So those are really the areas where our members are most focused.”

Marrying medicine and technology

EHR software allows clinicians to access and update a patient’s complete medical history electronically, including diagnoses, lab results and medications. Healthcare providers in the U.S. were required to adopt EHRs more than one decade ago in order to continue receiving full funds from federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Use of the software spiked, with 78% of physicians and 96% of hospitals using an EHR in 2021, according to government data.

However, doctors often express annoyance with EHRs. The systems can be tricky to use, cluttered with pop-ups and screens and requiring significant time for clinicians to enter and find data. Another common criticism is that EHRs were designed more for billing purposes than for clinical decisionmaking. Many doctors say the systems distract from patient care as a result.

Major EHR vendors have long said they’re working to make their products simpler and easier to use. That crusade is being significantly accelerated by recent advances in AI: like generative AI, which can understand and create original text and images; ambient listening, which marries microphones and machine learning to produce transcripts of clinician-patient encounters in real time; and agentic AI, which can complete complex tasks largely without human oversight.

In the past, navigating EHRs required a lot of data entry and “persistent screen after screen navigation,” Girish Navani, the CEO of EHR vendor eClinicalWorks, said. “If you look at the last two years, the advent and the rapid rise of generative AI makes a lot of those paradigms obsolete.”

Epic, the largest EHR vendor in the U.S., has “been working to incorporate in particular generative AI across the software,” said Seth Howard, Epic’s executive vice president of research and development.

The Wisconsin-based company holds more than one-third of the hospital market, trailed by Oracle Health, at 22%, and Meditech, with 13%, according to health analytics company Definitive Healthcare.

More than 3,100 hospitals use Epic, the company says. And about two-thirds of its customer base are live with the vendor’s generative AI products, according to Howard. Those include algorithms that help doctors write notes and summarize patient information for clinicians prior to a visit.

Epic integrated ambient listening software from a startup called Abridge into its workflow last year, but is working to make its software compatible with more products that can transcribe patient visits in real time, Howard said. The company is also working to make its documentation tools multimodal, so they can understand videos, images and other types of information beyond text.

Over the past year, Epic has also started building a framework aroung agentic AI into its software, to see how digital assistants that can summarize information, interact with patients, schedule followups and more can work together, according to Howard.

Overall, Epic has 125 AI use cases either in development or live, he said.

“We are investing massively to ensure we rapidly innovate and get it right at the same time.""

Bharat Sutariya

Chief Health Officer, Oracle Health

Similarly, in October Oracle announced that it plans to release a new EHR platform this year that incorporates its clinical AI agent, voice-activated navigation and search capabilities. The clinical agent, which can record and transcribe patient visits and draft a note in the EHR for the clinician’s approval, is currently available for more than 30 medical specialties, the company said on Tuesday.

Bharat Sutariya, Oracle’s chief health officer, called the refresh “nothing short of a complete reinvention of the EHR.”

“We are investing massively to ensure we rapidly innovate and get it right at the same time,” he said.

Meanwhile Meditech and eClinicalWorks, a company that offers cloud-based EHR software currently in use at 70,000 care sites, are pursing a partnership approach.

Meditech has long worked with Google to accelerate clinicians’ access to data and with Microsoft to automate scribing, including deploying Microsoft’s ambient listening and clinical documentation tools into its EHR.

Meditech also plans to include Microsoft’s latest clinical assistant as it rolls out this year, according to Rachel Wilkes, Meditech’s corporate lead for generative AI initiatives. A variety of other AI scribes are also available to Meditech’s customers through integrations with the company’s software, she said.

“We want to keep our existing customer base engaged,” Wilkes said. But “yes, we are looking to attract new customers as well by having a platform that is innovative, scalable, and a really good alternative to maybe other competitors that are out there.”

eClinicalWorks has also partnered with Microsoft to use machine learning to match patient records, and with a company called Healow to create an AI medical scribe and an AI contact center.

AI checks and balances

EHR vendors are remaking their software with AI despite dogged concerns about quality, privacy, bias and a lack of federal regulation around the technology.

Generative AI in particular is tricky to monitor. The models are known to hallucinate, or provide factually incorrect or irrelevant answers, or omit information altogether. Their performance can also degrade over time, in a phenomenon called model drift.

Still, records companies say that they, along with their clients, are carefully supervising AI to make sure they’re not making up any information — or leaving anything out.

Leaders with eClinicalWorks, Meditech and Epic said they’ve invested heavily in risk management and have stood up stringent guardrails, including ongoing assessment by clinicians.

There should always be a human in the loop when it comes to ambient documentation and generative AI products, said Meditech’s Wilkes.

Meditech also includes disclaimer language on any records created by AI, sharing that it was created by an algorithm and reviewed by medical staff. The company is working to put more formal citations into the workflow to clarify what’s generated and where the model pulled relevant information from, Wilkes said.

Epic applies the same principles to ensuring AI quality as it does to any other software to make sure it works well and isn’t causing harm, according to Howard.

But “the techniques you might use to understand, ‘is it working well?’ are different,” Howard said.

Still, despite concerns with the models, hospital customers are full steam ahead on adoption, vendors say. According to a survey from HIMSS conducted in the fall, 86% of respondents already leverage AI in their medical organizations, mostly for administrative tasks, though there’s growing interest in more clinical use cases.

“Our customers are very warm to it. More warm over the past 12 months,” said Wilkes. “We’ve gone from doing a lot of education about the impact, to — now the question we’re getting is, ‘When? When can I get it? How much is it going to cost? What’s the plan?’.”

“There’s always going to be the early adopters, the mid adopters and the lagging adopters of technology. It’s happened with smartphones, it happened with color TV, it’s happened with every product,” said eClinicalWorks’ Navani. “All I can tell you today is we are seeing incredible multiples of customers who you would call early adopters.”

But “this is not just being done because modern is new and it’s good,” Navani continued. “It’s got a clear efficiency benefit written all over it. That’s driving the change.”",,N,,2025-03-07 13:06:40.143829

More About the IoT Smart C2C Connector

The solution is available now on the AWS Marketplace, and pricing is bespoke and based on individual requirements.

The C2C connector does not store any user data (like PII, access tokens, or device information), thus reinforcing security and compliance. The connector takes advantage of AWS Lambda for deployment, which optimises compute time and minimises costs.

User data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), access tokens, or device data, is never stored within AWS. The connector enables OAuth authentication between the OEM Cloud and the devices.

R Systems called out the key benefits of the solution:

Simplified Smart Home Connectivity: Supports connectivity with AWS IoT Device Management.

Secure & Compliant Communication: Ensures data integrity and privacy through OAuth authentication.

Optimized Cost & Performance: AWS Lambda deployment reduces costs while maintaining high performance. It is hosted within the service provider’s AWS account.

Ease of Integrations: It supports a unified interface through pre-defined data models in AWS IoT Device Management. The Matter Data format is fully supported, and each C2C Connector is designed individually for a specific OEM and device type.

Enterprise Times: What does this mean?

The new R Systems solution has huge potential. But the company needs to deliver a live solution to demonstrate the benefits it can deliver to service providers. Philips is no stranger to IoT solutions and has already delivered in partnership with Salesforce, the HealthSuite digital platform.

With many in real estate organisations looking for smart devices to cut energy costs, the idea of a single platform for many of the varied locations they manage could be very attractive. It means that they can manage a wide range of devices within buildings without worrying about updated or different protocols.

However, R Systems will need to work with other OEM clouds to make this a workable solution for many. The first step will be to attract a launch customer and to demonstrate the benefits the connector has delivered.",,N,,2025-03-07 10:17:05.013841

Shoe sales increased 39% year over year in the fourth quarter, while apparel was up 83% and accessories were up 86%.","President Trump's new economic policies are spooking the markets, and the S&P 500 index has been trending downward after starting the year with a bang. The new tariff program could have a substantial impact on many public companies, both U.S. companies that import supplies as well as foreign companies that export to the U.S.

Investors don't enjoy seeing the market lose gains, but this could present some buying opportunities for the savvy investor. The market has been looking expensive lately, and this might be the reset you've been waiting for.

If you're looking for an incredible growth stock with massive opportunities, consider On Holding (ONON -1.80%). It just reported another fabulous quarter, but its stock is down year to date, and this looks like a great time to buy the stock.

Why On

On sells sneakers and other athleticwear, but it's differentiated from similar companies by its distinctive sole design. At this point, it has many products that don't look different from any other brand, but people know it for its original On Cloud shoe.

As a premium brand, On targets an affluent clientele. But it's resonating with a mass audience through its athlete endorsers, who run the gamut of professional sports and might only be recognizable to those ""in the know"" about these sports, as well as a strategic partnership with actress Zendaya.

It's still rolling out across the world, and it has low brand awareness in many locations. However, it's growing quickly in the areas where it's launched. That gives it an incredible market opportunity and a long growth runway.

On has consistently reported strong operating results. That would be impressive on its own, but even more impressive is that it's at a time when inflation has been hitting pocketbooks, and many companies' results -- including other premium athleticwear brands like Nike and Lululemon Athletica -- are feeling pressure. That implies On's constituency is resilient, and that it might be pulling market share from competitors.

This past week, On released a blowout fourth-quarter earnings report, beating its own and Wall Street's expectations. Revenue increased 40% year over year (currency neutral), with a 49% increase in direct-to-consumer sales. On has a careful mix of direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels, as well as a robust digital presence. It also has 50 physical stores in strategic locations that it feels are a ballast of the network, where customers get to see it in real time.

It has the highest gross margin in the industry, and it's getting higher, increasing from 60.4% to 62.1% year over year. It charges premium prices, and as its name catches on worldwide, its more affluent target customer is willing to pay for its products, strengthening the margins.

Down to the bottom line, net income increased 436% from a loss the previous year. Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.33, beating Wall Street's average consensus of $0.18.

Why now

On stock was lifted on the excellent report, but it's still down 8% year to date. At the current price, it trades at a forward 1-year P/E ratio of 32, which looks quite reasonable for a growth stock.

Management said that it's still working with the strategy it outlined in its 2023 investor presentation, the pillar of which is generating brand awareness. The other elements are expanding its global footprint, innovating with product, and maintaining operational excellence. It made great strides in all of those areas last year, but there's plenty more to accomplish this year and beyond.

One area that's incredibly promising is outside of footwear. Shoe sales increased 39% year over year in the fourth quarter, while apparel was up 83% and accessories were up 86%. That means customers are loving its brand right now, not just its shoes.

Management is guiding for sales to increase 27% in 2025, ahead of its previous guidance. If inflation chills, On's results could stay elevated. As it amplifies its brand and expands its reach, On could be a standout stock this year and beyond.",,N,,2025-03-07 10:14:41.507240

Can you confirm or deny that only a fraction of the best-priced models of 9070 and 9070 XT will be sold at their announced MSRP?
It did address the larger question of MSRP availability with this statement from chief gaming solutions architect (and gaming marketing boss) Frank Azor, though: It is inaccurate that $549 / $599 MSRP is launch-only pricing.","Yesterday, reviewers agreed: AMD is finally beating Nvidia with its RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards, assuming they actually launch with sufficient stock at their $549 and $599 prices.

But this morning’s launch, while better than recent Nvidia launches in terms of supply, may not have met that bar — and AMD would not deny reports that even the best-priced models of these GPUs are capped to specific quantities, after which they may be sold at higher than $549 or $599.

When The Verge checked this morning, major US retailers Best Buy and Newegg listed as few as a single model of each GPU at their MSRP, which sold out quickly, of course. Most cards are listed for a $100 premium over that MSRP, if not more.

Micro Center appears to be doing far better, with as many as five 9070s and five 9070 XTs at MSRP and a website that claims they’re even still available for purchase if you visit one of its 28 US locations in person.

What happens next? It’s not unusual for each graphics card partner to sell a variety of fancier grades of the same GPU at higher prices with fancier cooling and overclocking — but retailers are now suggesting that even the prices of entry-level cards won’t hold.

“We have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT […] they will apply to a limited number of cards,” wrote Swedish retailer Inet.se, as documented by VideoCardz.

“MSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through,” UK retailer Overclockers UK also reportedly wrote.

Even Best Buy seemed to suggest that $549 / $599 prices were only temporary. When we visited this morning, the Best Buy website described them like they were on sale, though the company has since removed the “save $80” and “save $130” you see below. AMD says the Best Buy listings were an error.

We asked AMD:

Can you confirm or deny that the best prices on the best-priced cards are capped in this way?

Can you confirm or deny that only a fraction of the best-priced models of 9070 and 9070 XT will be sold at their announced MSRP?

Can you confirm or deny that AMD has okayed any board partners or retailers whatsoever to raise their prices beyond MSRP after selling through a certain quantity or certain number of shipments?

AMD would not confirm or deny. It did address the larger question of MSRP availability with this statement from chief gaming solutions architect (and gaming marketing boss) Frank Azor, though:

It is inaccurate that $549 / $599 MSRP is launch-only pricing. We expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599 (excluding region specific tariffs and / or taxes) based on the work we have done with our AIB partners, and more are coming. At the same time, the AIBs have different premium configurations at higher price points and those will also continue.

On X, Azor tweeted that AMD is working to replenish stock “in the coming days and weeks,” adding, “MSRP pricing (excluding region specific tariffs and/or taxes) will continue to be encouraged beyond today so don’t despair.”

In addition to the campaign featuring an array of American brands—including Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, MICHAEL Michael Kors, and Tommy Hilfiger—Macy’s is hosting a slew of events celebrating America’s favorite pastimes.

Thomas says the campaign features a philanthropic element, as well. Macy’s is teaming up with Got Your 6, a campaign that connects the entertainment industry to veteran-centered nonprofits, in attempt to raise $3 million for more than 30 nonprofits that are part of the Got Your 6 alliance. According to Thomas, from May 12 to June 9, customers will have the opportunity to buy a $3 pass, allowing them to redeem a shopping offer, or a $6 pass that also comes with a Got Your 6 pin. All proceeds go to Got Your 6.

“In the military, the term ‘Got Your Six’ means I’ve got your back,” Thomas says. “This new initiative, [which] launched last year, aims to change the conversation around American veterans—to one of empowerment and leadership at home.”

To spread word about the campaign, Macy’s is using direct mail, TV, digital advertising, social, and in-store visuals, Thomas says.

Mastering this skill can transform complex analytics into actionable insights that inspire confidence and foster growth.

To assist companies in their endeavors, Adverity — the integrated data platform trusted by leading agencies and brands like Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Bosch, and Publicis Groupe — has unveiled a new guide on how agencies can leverage data storytelling to enhance client reporting and gain a competitive edge.

In “Data storytelling: How good data storytelling can set your agency analytics apart,” agencies can learn all there is to know about data storytelling — from identifying the impact of weather conditions to predicting future trends.

The first ingredient to good data storytelling is a no-brainer — good data. With the right data, agencies can draw valuable insights and conclusions beyond basic reporting.

To this end, Adverity laid out three crucial factors: connectivity, granularity, and frequency.

1. Connectivity

Connectivity is not just about connecting to your client’s data sources. You also need to collect data from other relevant sources.

Adverity points out the most commonly used example: the weather — particularly how different weather conditions impact sales conversions and the like.

This data may lead to insights regarding where budgets can be best leveraged or even predict future trends based on data patterns.

Automating the collection of data should also be considered to avoid potential issues with data quality and to save time.

2. Granularity

More data does not equal successful storytelling — getting the right data at the right level of granularity does. This is where understanding a campaign’s performance requires a more nuanced approach, based on the foundation laid by basic metrics.

3. Frequency

Collecting data frequently helps keep you ahead of the game. For some, collecting daily data works, while 15-minute fetches are enough for others. Adverity notes that real-time streaming data is only necessary for a few specific use cases, such as sports betting websites.

Her leadership breaks barriers and creates tangible opportunities for the next generation of female leaders.

Personal commitment to gender inclusivity

Govender’s commitment to gender inclusivity is deeply personal.

Early in her career, she encountered a lack of mentorship opportunities, an experience that fuelled her passion for ensuringthat other women do not face the same obstacles.

This vision has been brought to life at PGA, where she has integrated gender equality into the organisation’s DNA.

As the co-founder and chairperson of Phakama Women’s Academy, she is providing women with the resources, mentorship, and skills they need to advance their careers.

Prestigious Glass Lion category

Under Koo’s leadership, PGA has made significant strides in increasing female representation in executive roles.

More women now hold key decision-making positions, driving the company’s success and influencing the industry at large.

Her advocacy extends beyond PGA, as she has played a pivotal role on the global stage, serving as a Cannes Lions juror for the prestigious Glass Lion category, which recognizes groundbreaking work addressing gender equality.

Govender’s vision for the future remains bold, with PGA committed to strengthening its mentorship and leadership development initiatives to support women at every stage of their careers.

The organisation is also enhancing its recruitment and retention strategies to create structured pathways for female talent to advance into leadership roles.

Rightful place around the boardroom table

By cultivating a culture that prioritises gender equity, PGA continues to set the standard for inclusivity and empowerment in the industry.

Govender’s vision and legacy remain to see more women taking their rightful place around the boardroom table.

How expensive is Starbucks stock?
There's a bit too much optimism priced into Starbucks stock right now Starbucks looks incredibly expensive given the challenges that lie ahead for the business.","Starbucks (SBUX -0.60%) has one of the most iconic consumer brands in the world. Its premium-priced coffee has enabled the business to experience strong profit growth over the years. However, it has experienced a slowdown in its growth recently amid worsening global economic conditions. Last year, it brought on CEO Brian Niccol from Chipotle Mexican Grill, in an effort to turn things around.

Even though those efforts are in their early stages, the stock has been doing well since then. It rallied more than 20% in the past six months, hitting a new 52-week high of $117.46 last week. Could this be the start of even larger gains to come for Starbucks stock, or should investors be concerned that it may be approaching a peak?

Starbucks still has a lot of work to do in turning its business around

Starbucks brought on Niccol in the hopes that he could get Starbucks' business back on the right path. Slowing sales numbers have been a concern for investors, and that remains an issue today.

When the company reported earnings in January, its same-store sales were negative for a fourth straight quarter. Same-store sales growth tells investors how much growth the company has achieved when excluding the effect of new store openings and closures. It considers only those stores that were open a year ago.

However, even when considering its overall growth rate, those numbers also haven't been impressive.

Niccol is making some changes that should help the bottom line, such as cutting 30% of the menu and reducing staff, but tariffs could negate some of those cost savings and efficiencies. Under the threat of trade wars and global economic uncertainty, it may not be easy for Starbucks to jump-start its growth rate anytime soon. The problem is, many investors may already be pricing in the stock as if its turnaround is complete.

How expensive is Starbucks stock?

The coffee stock's strong rally in recent months means that investors now have to pay 37 times its trailing earnings to own a piece of the company. For a business that's struggling to generate growth and that faces some tough competition in China from low-cost rivals, that looks like an expensive ask for investors, especially given the more modest earnings multiple Starbucks has averaged in recent years.

Investors are normally willing to pay a premium for a stock that's growing at a fast rate. But in Starbucks' case, that isn't happening, and things may not get better anytime soon.

There's a bit too much optimism priced into Starbucks stock right now

Starbucks looks incredibly expensive given the challenges that lie ahead for the business. Even if the risk and uncertainty related to tariffs prove to be short-lived, Starbucks still hasn't shown that it can find a way to get back to growing its revenue at a rate high enough to justify a high valuation.",,N,,2025-03-07 10:19:49.867507

The satellite segment to maintain its leadership status during the forecast period

Based on payload type, the satellite segment contributed to the largest share in 2020, accounting for around three-fourths of the global carrier rocket market, and is projected to maintain its leadership status during the forecast period. Moreover, this segment is estimated to witness the largest CAGR of 11.8% from 2021 to 2030. This is due to rise in adoption of advanced satellites by telecommunication organizations to implementing high-speed internet services worldwide. The report also discusses segments including cargo and others.

The government segment to continue its lead position during the forecast period

Based on end user, the government segment accounted for the highest share in 2020, holding more than around three-fifths of the global carrier rocket market, and is estimated to continue its lead position during the forecast period. This is due to increase in deployment for defense and monitoring services by government organizations. However, the commercial segment is expected to portray the highest CAGR of 12.4% from 2021 to 2030. This is attributed to surge in initiatives undertaken by commercial space organizations for deploying advanced space payloads and conducting space exploration missions.

The parties discussed issues from staffing to taxes, and when tariffs came up, attendees reiterated a request to exclude food and drinks from the duties, the person said.

The association had made the request in a letter to Trump in February, also arguing that the levies would cost the industry about $12 billion and cut into the sector’s already thin margins. In the meeting, attendees also said they supported Trump’s efforts to review trade agreements.

In the early 1990s, Germany was at the centre of a re-alignment of the global security system. German unification was the beachhead for replacing Soviet influence in eastern Europe, to be followed over the coming decades by the extension of the European Union (EU) and NATO to countries that had been behind the Iron Curtain. But this came at a financial cost, requiring huge expenditure in Germany to rebuild the east and normalise living standards between the two parts of the country. Bond yields reflected the burden this would put on public finances, and on 1 March 1990, 10-year German bond yields rose by 34 basis points (bp). It took three years for bond yields to fall back to end of December 1989 levels (7.5%).

Pricing the new reality

History does not always repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Germany is again at the centre of the global security system realignment. Except this time, it is because of the potential withdrawal of the US security guarantee for Europe, rather than securing the collapse of Soviet influence. Germany, along with other European countries – including the UK – is having to increase defence spending. Markets do not yet know how big this will be, what form it will take, and over what time horizon it will happen. They do know, however, that there is no choice other than for governments to commit more of their budgets to defence. It will mean more borrowing – either via individual states or through some EU mutualisation. The 10-year German government bond yield rose 30bp on 5 March in the wake of the suggestion that Germany will need to spend €500bn in the coming years to boost defence and rebuild infrastructure. The 10-year yield ended last week at 2.4% - as I write this on Friday morning it stands at 2.84%. To the close of business on Thursday 6 March, the ICE German Government Bond index lost 3.1% since the end of last week.

US away

These political developments are of historical importance. They have been prompted of course by the ongoing Ukraine conflict, and by the stance of the US Trump Administration. Washington has signalled the US is no longer willing to shoulder what it sees as an unfair burden - providing global economic security by playing the role of consumer of last resort, and playing the role of global peacekeeper by providing unlimited security and military aid through NATO funding.

Changing assumptions

All of this is upending global trade and political relations. It is creating uncertainty in markets as well as in diplomatic circles. There are clear investment implications, the most obvious being that the mode of policy making employed by Trump is one that generates uncertainty, reflected in increased volatility in financial markets. The potential for disruption to trade and capital flows is clear, and in turn this will impact consumption and investment decisions, as well as economic policy. Previously held assumptions about growth, inflation, monetary policy, and long-term borrowing costs are all being challenged. What was supposed to be the Trump trade - US bond yields and equities higher - has been turned on its head. Meanwhile, the European narrative is now about fiscal spending, “making Europe great again” growth initiatives, and opportunities for European stocks to continue to outperform. Even though the European Central Bank (ECB) reduced its deposit rate again on 6 March to 2.50%, there is much less certainty that it can continue to cut rates to below 2.0% this year. As ECB President Christine Lagarde said at the press conference following the rate decision, “there is uncertainty everywhere”. Growth and neutral interest rate assumptions may need to be revised higher. That, and the prospect of a huge increase in European government bond supply, is why yields are rising.

Upside-down Trump trade

There is not much spare capacity in the US economy even though there are tentative signs of the data flow softening. The noise around tariffs, DOGE and broader budget initiatives means that convictions on growth, inflation and the path of interest rates cannot be strongly held. If economic activity is disrupted, it becomes harder to value corporate revenues and cashflow. This should mean higher risk premiums on US equities and credit. The S&P 500 equally weighted index price-earnings multiple is around 20 times, according to Bloomberg. The risk is that the multiple will contract and earnings growth forecasts will be lower. For credit, spreads are in the bottom decile of their range of the last 10 years. Given recent years’ good macroeconomic backdrop, US markets are priced for perfection. Perfection, however, is looking somewhat elusive. The consensus earnings per share 12-month growth rate forecast for the S&P 500 peaked in December and has been coming down since. The market is now looking for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to cut rates three times this year.

Euroboost

For Europe, the game changer is the increase in borrowing costs. The rise in yields has been impressive. Only Germany has any real fiscal space to expand debt so other countries will be relying on the EU to provide concessions on how defence-related spending is treated. But borrowing will increase and there might need to be savings found in other areas of spending. As such it is hard to see what the net effect on growth will be. Some argue that pure defence spending has limited multiplier effects. We need to see what the balance is between pure defence and broader infrastructure spending – today’s warfare depends on technology, communications, logistics, as well as manufacturing hardware. But shouldering more of the defence burden and potentially having to adapt and respond to US tariffs could turn out to be positive in terms of the European growth outlook. That is the way European equity investors are viewing things.

3.5% Bunds?

Higher sustained borrowing implies that real interest rates will need to move higher and there will be a structurally higher long-term neutral rate. I suspect rates markets will price in this new reality quicker than credit or equities. It is difficult to say where the necessary real rate will be – German real rates were around 5% in the early 1990s. They don’t need to be that high given Germany’s relatively low level of public debt and high level of household savings. Looking at one of Germany’s legacy inflation-linked bonds, the real yield has been slowly edging up since central banks started hiking, but it is low. Prior to this week it was at 0.5%. Real yields elsewhere have been higher (around 1.2% for French, UK and US inflation-linked). Assuming German real yields move to those levels, this implies a nominal bond yield of close to 3.5% (the current 10-year yield is 2.9%). German yields have not been 3.5% or above since before the global financial crisis.

ECB still easing

Future rate and yield developments also depend on the ECB. The gap between the 10-year German Bund yield and the ECB deposit rate has been above 3.0% before, so even with another 50bp or so of easing following March’s 25bp rate cut, Bund yields could still potentially enter the 3.5%-5.0% range. This is not a forecast, but investors need to think about what might happen. Such an outcome would be difficult for other European countries with weaker fiscal balances. European sovereign spreads versus German bonds have been trending lower over the last year. So have corporate credit spreads. Higher Bund yields will push yields on other government debt higher, prompting new concerns about fiscal sustainability in some countries – especially if they are also going to be raising defence spending. So far, Eurozone corporate bond spreads have been stable, but credit analysts will need to factor in higher overall borrowing costs in this new era.

Euro fixed income becomes less dull

It is more likely to be the case that the market will price a long-term rate which does not endanger another European sovereign debt crisis. Timing and mutualisation can mitigate the market impact. Bund yields above 3.0% and certainly above 3.5% might be seen as high enough. Fixed income markets can quickly re-price. In the short term that means being exposed to duration might lead to negative returns while the shorter maturity end of the bond market is likely to be less impacted. If credit markets remain stable, short duration credit strategies should do better than all maturity bond indices and portfolios. Once the market thinks enough has been done, then fixed income will look attractive again. In 1990, German bond yields rose 170bp. In 1991 they fell 100bp and another 70bp in 1992. Higher bond yields are not great for equities, or economic growth (or a fixed exchange rate mechanism), but they can ultimately provide for attractive fixed income returns.

Growth less sure for equities

I struggle a little more with the equity outlook. The disruption to revenues from a huge shift in trade and political relations which impact on US companies and elsewhere should mean lower valuation multiples for stocks. Easy to write, of course, when the S&P 500 has given back its post-Trump victory gains. The market index level is still 13% to 15% higher than it was a year ago. But betting that political risk disappears, and the previous rally continues is wishful thinking. Trump is not going to become less of a source of uncertainty, there is risk around Ukraine, relations with the EU, China and Russia, and his questionable stance towards Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal. Political risk continues, market volatility continues.

Trump’s world upending everything

Despite comments to the contrary, I suspect President Trump does watch the stock market. The so-called Trump trade is supposed to mean higher stock prices and higher bond yields as the policy mix generated a more inflationary backdrop. The backtracking on tariffs on auto companies is a realisation that tariffs are very disruptive to supply chains, which could also hit output and employment eventually. Meanwhile, front running of imports led to a massive surge in the trade deficit in January. Disruptions to economic data might be temporary, but for thin-skinned traders and financial market commentators, the mood is changing quickly. The market now has three Fed rate cuts priced in for this year and the terminal rate for the cycle has fallen to 3.3%. I suspect bond yields will move below 4.0% at some point, so the gap between US Treasuries and European bond yields will narrow further. That is a signal for a lower dollar also.

Trump’s world will provide people like me no end of things to write about. The trick is trying to see through it all and come to solid views on markets. Not easy. For now, risk aversion is likely to be the best approach until there is more clarity on some of the most important geopolitical events. The US growth outlook is being questioned, so good for Treasuries and bad for the S&P 500; the European growth outlook may be being revised higher, so bad for Bunds and good for Euro Stoxx. If only it were that simple. Stay tuned.

According to AXAL XL cyber risk strategies and partnership programmes global head Tim Smit, Darkweb’s Ransomware Detection & Response solution prevents attacks before data is stolen or encrypted.

Additionally, the Supply Chain Security+ service shields against disruptions and data breaches caused by attacks on key third-party vendors and suppliers, he said.

AXA XL cyber insurance coverage supports the investigation and management of cyber incidents, financial protection against liabilities and risk management services.

Smit said: “Partnering with cybersecurity experts Darkweb IQ enables us to provide comprehensive and effective solutions to our clients, helping them to safeguard their digital assets, data and operations from potential cyberattacks and data breaches. Access to a cyber expert like Darkweb IQ is crucial in helping our clients fight the ongoing battle against ransomware.”

Last month, AXA XL appointed Simon Rees as its chief underwriting officer for North America Programmes.

Rees, who has more than 20 years of industry experience, will take on the new responsibility from 1 April 2025.",,N,,2025-03-07 08:15:43.637789

“In the 1990s, the Medicaid drug rebate program was created.
“Public policy set a culture that became addicted to higher list prices and the discounts rolling off the top of them.
“There are ‘anti-steering’ laws but somehow many patients still end up with PBM-owned specialty pharmacies,” Feldman said.
“The FTC just lambasted them, so we will see what happens next.” References: FTC report: https://www.ftc.gov/reports/specialty-generic-drugs-growing-profit-center-vertically-integrated-pharmacy-benefit-managers","The “big three” pharmacy benefit managers have imposed markups ranging from 100% to more than 7,000% on generic specialty drugs dispensed at their affiliated pharmacies, according to a Federal Trade Commission report released this year.

The markups — at CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx — were seen not only in medications to treat cancer and HIV, but also in the rheumatology space.

“The FTC really let them have it,” Robert W. Levin, MD, past president of the Florida Society of Rheumatology, president of the Alliance for Transparent and Affordable Prescriptions, and associate affiliate professor of medicine at the University of South Florida, told Healio. “The markups on these drugs are disgusting.”

The report, released in January, shined a spotlight on 51 generic specialty drugs, including sildenafil, tadalafil, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Among other findings, the FTC uncovered markups ranging from 188% for MMF as dispensed by a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM)-affiliated pharmacy, to 7,736% for tadalafil.

“Remember, these are generic small molecule drugs like an aspirin that do not cost much to make at all,” Madelaine A. Feldman, MD, FACR, vice president of advocacy and government affairs at the Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations, and founder and past president of the Rheumatology Alliance of Louisiana, said in an interview.

“The significant markups on the generic specialty medications the FTC analyzed generated more than $7.3 billion in income from dispensing drugs in excess of their estimated acquisition costs from 2017 to 2022,” she added. “The acquisition cost of the drugs was based on the NADAC price.”

NADAC refers to the average acquisition cost of the drug for pharmacies, according to Feldman.

“The price that the larger specialty pharmacies — such as those owned by the big three PBMs — pays for these drugs is even lower because of their volume,” she said. “Consequently, the revenue generated is thought to be much higher than $7.3 billion.”

For Levin, the FTC report reflects his own personal experience in the clinic, where he has witnessed patients pay hundreds of dollars for generics drugs.

“We all see it, and it is not just biologics or injectable specialty medications,” he said. “How many times have I seen a patient who for some reason is paying several hundred dollars for a generic NSAID?”

The question now is whether legislators in statehouses across the country, and in Washington, D.C., will begin to pass laws to fundamentally reshape this system. According to Antonio Ciaccia, CEO of 46Brooklyn Research, a nonprofit based in Ohio that aims to make U.S. drug pricing data more accessible, the report has been a “learning experience” for lawmakers.

“Like anything in health care, you diagnose and then you treat,” he told Healio. “This FTC report has been a learning exercise for Congress and the executive branch, in addition to what they have learned in the last few years. Now it comes to how we treat.”

‘Addicted to higher list prices’

As is the case in many clinical assessments, understanding the history is critical to understanding both the dramatic findings in the FTC report and the current efforts to bring greater transparency to drug pricing in the United States.

“In some ways, public policy decisions necessitated the existence of PBMs in their current form,” Ciaccia said. “In the 1990s, the Medicaid drug rebate program was created. It was a well-intended program.”

Medicaid chose not to pay list prices manufacturers set, according to Ciaccia.

“Instead, they asked for a 23% discount on all brand drugs,” he said. “If manufacturers raised prices beyond the rate of inflation, they incurred penalties.”

The result was that hospitals were no longer getting the best prices for medications, which created an expansion of Medicaid best prices to covered entities through the 340B program.

“This philosophical approach of achieving lower brand drug costs through discounting in the public sector — instead of through incentives aimed at drug companies lowering their actual prices — birthed increasingly inflated manufacturer list prices over time,” Ciaccia said. “This, in turn, created a greater emphasis for non-public sector payers to insulate themselves from increasingly inflated brand drug prices.”

Commercial payers — and eventually Medicare plans — turned to PBMs to take on this role of negotiator, according to Ciaccia.

“Initially, the PBMs took a flat fee to facilitate negotiations,” he said. “When they began to turn a profit in the discount and rebate system, it led to the current situation.”

According to Feldman, once the rebate system began, rebates and other post-sale price concessions were exempt from being labeled as “kickbacks” due to a stipulation of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987. This allowed PBMs to construct the rebate system without incurring legal repercussions for receiving these concessions, she said.

“Now, you have manufacturers who have little incentive to shrink the list price,” Ciaccia said. “Public policy set a culture that became addicted to higher list prices and the discounts rolling off the top of them. PBMs started to make money off of those discounts. So, there is no real objective rhyme or reason for why prices are the way they are.”

Educating legislators about this history may be the first step toward finding a remedy. According to Ciaccia, lawmakers should understand that patients in the current marketplace need both insurance and the PBMs to afford their medications, because “there is no way in any sober reality that you can afford these sky-high prices.” This situation has in turn created an over-reliance on the negotiator, giving said negotiators much power, which has led to spread pricing, differential payments and the complicated rebate system that exists today, he said.

“There is now a subjective approach to winners and losers in the marketplace,” Ciaccia added.

‘Fuel to the fire’

“As far as its effect on PBM reform, this report can only add fuel to the fire demonstrating the need to curtail PBM's ability to incentivize higher prices for their formularies — with delinking and rebate pass through legislation — and their ability to use their specialty pharmacies as an ATM,” Feldman said.

In December, a bipartisan group of legislators in Congress introduced the Patients before Monopolies Act, or PBM Act. Introduced by Reps. Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) and Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) in the House of Representatives, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) in the Senate, the bill would, among other reforms, prohibit joint ownership of PBMs and pharmacies. However, it failed to gain the necessary traction during the short time before the 118th Congress concluded on Jan. 3.

“It had bicameral and bipartisan sponsors,” Feldman said. “It would mandate that the PBMs and their mother ship divest themselves of all pharmacies. We need it to be introduced again and it would directly address the issues noted by the FTC in this most recent interim report.”

Although the Patients Before Monopolies Act has not yet been scored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), another PBM Act — the Patients Before Middlemen Act — has, and boasts one major advantage over other previous reform efforts, according to Levin — it benefits the government.

“The CBO recently scored delinking legislation at a cost savings of about a billion dollars,” he said.

Specifically, the bill would delink the compensation of PBMs from drug price and use. It would also ensure fair treatment of all pharmacies by requiring Medicare Part D plans to contract with any willing pharmacy that meets reasonable terms and conditions. It had previously been introduced in the 118th Congress, and was reintroduced on March 6 by Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.).

“Most of the legislation we advocate for will cost the federal government money, so it puts a damper on the willingness to move forward with it, but this may have a chance because of the savings,” Levin said.

Feldman added that passing this legislation would go a long way to reducing the price of specialty generic drugs, as well as protecting the non-affiliated pharmacies from the issue of patients being “steered” to PBM-owned specialty pharmacies.

“There are ‘anti-steering’ laws but somehow many patients still end up with PBM-owned specialty pharmacies,” Feldman said. “It would also cut down on mandated ‘white bagging,’ which requires providers to receive their provider-administered drug form the insurance company-owned specialty pharmacy.”

Meanwhile, reforming the PBM rebate system may be a different story, according to Levin.

“The CBO has scored rebate pass through legislation as costing the federal government money,” he said.

However, Levin said he still believes that the rebate system should remain a target for future legislation.

“Paying PBMs a flat-fee, fair market value for their service instead of a rebate based on the list price of the drug is critical to bringing down drug prices,” he said.

‘Congress has to ask itself’

With all of the above in mind, zooming out and considering at the big picture may be helpful in guiding legislation through Congress, according to Ciaccia.

“The question Congress has to ask itself is whether public policy should be designed in a way to increase our reliance on insurance companies and PBMs, or do we start changing our approach so we decrease that reliance?” he said. “Or do we try to force manufactures to compete by lowering prices?”

Ciaccia added he understands that this will be a difficult task, but not, he noted, because of any malicious intent on the part of legislators.

“In many instances, the way that Congress has approached PBMs has been underinformed, and not driven by Congresspeople being dumb or lazy or not paying attention,” he said. “It is just a really complicated and opaque marketplace.”

PBMs have also stayed one step ahead of reform efforts by diversifying their revenue streams, according to Levin.

“Specialty pharmacies are now the biggest revenue source for PBMs,” he said. “It used to be the rebate system, but that system came under scrutiny and pressure, so the PBMs changed their approach.”

Other tactics include denying the generic when a name brand is on the formulary, or classifying generics in specialty tiers, Levin added.

“All of this has made drugs really unaffordable for our patients,” he said.

Meanwhile, online pharmacies like Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drug Co. and GoodRx are doing what legislation has yet to accomplish — making cheaper generic medications available to patients.

“The ‘Mark Cuban Effect’ and other pharmacies like his are the key to showing everyone how much these generic drugs actually cost and hopefully that will bring down the specialty pharmacy house that PBMs built,” Feldman said.

The PBMs may be taking notice, according to Ciaccia.

“Mark Cuban is eating the lunch of these PBMs because of the over-inflated markups,” he said.

However, the impacts of these competitors may still not be enough, according to Levin.

“I always draw the analogy of what happened at the turn of the 20th century with the trustbusters,” he said. “With vertical and horizontal integration, PBMs control everything in health care.”

To that end, the question of whether President Donald Trump’s administration has the will or power to break up these trusts remains to be seen.

“During the campaign, Trump was touting all the waste involved in the middlemen,” Levin said. “The FTC just lambasted them, so we will see what happens next.”

What impact will the ‘Target Fast’ have?","A 40-day boycott of Target that calls for supporters to give up shopping at the company's stores during the Lenten period kicked off this week, to protest the discount retailer's decision to end some of its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

The Rev. Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church near Atlanta, organized the “Target Fast” that began Wednesday — the first day of Lent — along with other faith and civil rights leaders. A website for participants points to the spending power of Black Americans and described the boycott as “a spiritual act of resistance.""

“This is a fast for accountability. A fast for justice. A fast for a future where corporations do not bow to pressure at the expense of marginalized communities,"" reads a message on targetfast.org. “Turn your dollars into data, power, and change.”

Target declined to comment directly on the boycott, which runs through April 17. Here's what to know.

What happened with Target's DEI initiatives?

Target announced in January that it would phase out a handful of DEI initiatives, including a program designed to help Black employees build meaningful careers and promote Black-owned businesses.

The Minneapolis-based company, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it long had intended to end the program this year, but its announcement came after other prominent American corporations scaled back their diversity activities.

Target also said it would stop setting hiring and promotion goals for women, members of racial minority groups and other underrepresented communities.

Conservative activists, and more recently, President Donald Trump’s White House, have sought to rid the federal government, schools and private workplaces of DEI policies that were adopted to counter discrimination. Critics maintain the range of goals and programs arising from such policies are themselves discriminatory and counterproductive.

While Target rival Walmart also rolled back its DEI initiatives in November, Target's actions seemed to cause more customer outrage. Numerous calls for boycotts emerged across the country, including from Minneapolis civil rights activists who gathered outside Target's headquarters. The daughters of one of Target's co-founders also expressed shock and alarm.

“The surprise element is what attracted customer ire” said Akshay Rao, a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. He and others point to Target's previous messaging around DEI and reputation as a strong advocate for the rights of racial minorities and LGBTQ+ people.

Target also faced boycott calls almost 15 years ago after it was revealed that the company donated to an organization that supported Republican Tom Emmer, then a vocal opponent of gay marriage, in his campaign to become Minnesota's governor. Then, as now, Target received more blowback than other companies that made similar donations because its actions ran counter to expectations, Rao said.

What does giving up Target for 40 days involve?

Organizers of the ""Target Fast” urged people who take part to stop shopping at Target and instead redirect their dollars to Black-owned businesses.

Targetfast.org lists the demands of boycotters, which include Target completely restoring its commitments to DEI and honoring a previous pledge to spend over $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025.

Bryant, the pastor spearheading the protest, told The Washington Post on Wednesday that about 110,000 people signed up to participate. Bryant was not immediately available for further comment when The Associated Press contacted his staff on Thursday.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, announced in late January that the civil rights organization would identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be subjected to consumer boycotts for abandoning their DEI pledges.

What impact will the ‘Target Fast’ have?

Time will tell. But experts say boycott appeals reflect the risk companies face when making moves that could potentially alienate their customer base — particularly when the moves go against past corporate messaging.

“One of the ways that you can really upset (consumers) is to claim to be something and then violate that standard that you claim to be,” Americus Reed II, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, said. “It lands really poisonous on people, especially in vulnerable communities where people have put their trust in you. ... And now, you're reversing.""

A sense of betrayal can be a significant motivator for customers to take their money elsewhere, Reed said. And successful boycotts, he adds, need to generate enough energy to “make this not just a moment, but a movement.”

Targeting single companies for a more prolonged period of time may prove effective, but organizers need to provide multiple ways for people to participate, Reed said.

Pledging to avoid large chains like Target or Walmart, for example, may be difficult for those who have fewer alternatives either geographically or because of what they can afford. Reed says targeted “buycotts,” such as trying to only purchase products from the Black-owned brands that large chains stock, could help bridge that gap.

Larger market pressures, such as the tariffs on goods from Canada, China and Mexico that Trump imposed this week — are likely to have bigger implications for Target’s bottom line in the months ahead, Rao said.

Getting consumers to change their buying habits, even for a cause they support, can be very difficult, Reed said. Boycotts that gain traction online also sometimes come across like “virtue signaling as opposed to real change,"" but making them part of the national conversation nonetheless is a huge step, he said.

“A lot of times, you’re in sort of inertia in your life as a consumer. And you’re just rolling along, you’re clicking a button on Amazon and getting your stuff,"" Reed said. ""Then something like this (boycott) comes up, and you’re forced to confront the reality of, ‘OK, what am I going to do?’”",,N,,2025-03-07 10:17:08.850421

Last week, the European Commission unveiled its long-awaited Omnibus package on sustainability. It substantially waters down two directives intended to end social and environmental malpractice along product supply chains, citing a need to simplify the legislation and reduce red tape.

Among the proposals scrapped in line with several of these lobbyists’ requests were a civil liability regime that could have provided some justice to victims of corporate abuse and a minimum cap for financial penalties on companies set at 5 per cent of their global turnover.

In a bid to “regain competitiveness,” both were removed from the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), while other loopholes were introduced to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

Many of these measures were pushed for by companies that were invited to a ‘reality check’ consultation with the European Commission on 5 February, according to a list of invitees seen by Equal Times.

However, 64 per cent of them – 28 of the 44 – have faced accusations ranging from rape, murder and torture along their supply chains to union busting and denying workers bathroom breaks.

""These companies were allowed to rewrite Europe’s laws through the back door to ensure they made bigger profits at the expense of workers and the planet,” says European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) deputy general secretary Isabelle Schömann. “It is clear that European lawmaking has been captured by corporations with a history of human rights violations and environmental destruction.”

Lobbyist demands

Several changes incorporated into the Commission’s final proposals were requested by trade associations representing 16 of the 28 companies accused of abuses: Airbus, Allianz, DHL, Deutsche Bank, Engie, Eni, Generali, Intesa Sanpaolo, I.CO.P, La Poste, Metro AG, Michelin, Schneider Electric, Société Générale, TotalEnergies and Volkswagen.

The demands were made in a joint position paper by Germany’s BDI, Italy’s Confindustria and the Mouvement des Entreprises de France employers’ associations, dated 25 January 2025 and seen by Equal Times.

“The CSDDD imposes burdensome provisions in terms of scope, applicable rules, liability and sanctions, causing legal uncertainty, excessive bureaucracy and incalculable risks for companies,” the document said.

It called for scrapping the civil liability mechanism and turnover-based financial penalties, limiting the scope of the CSRD to enterprises with more than 1,000 workers, similarly restricting the CSDDD, and limiting due diligence responsibilities to direct suppliers.

The Commission acceded to all these requests, which were largely echoed by the BusinessEurope lobby group, that attended the second day of the consultation.

Other changes made to the CSDDD lengthened the time between company supply chain checks from every year to every five years and weakened the punishment on offending contractors from severance to suspension of relations.

Implementation of the directive’s reporting requirements was delayed for two years – until 2028 – and its scope was limited to firms employing over 1,000 workers, exempting 80 per cent of the businesses that would originally have been covered. The same limitation was imposed on the CSRD.

“Consulting poachers on gamekeeping policy”

“The Commission’s idea of consultation is clearly to gather together some of the worst offenders to justify reckless slashing of its sustainability achievements,” says the Dutch Labour Party MEP Lara Wolters. “It’s like consulting poachers on gamekeeping policy. The fossil fuel industry at the consultation had almost as many representatives as the entirety of European civil society. More credible voices would have told them that we do not need to cause harm to people and planet in order to remain competitive, and that the new plans flagrantly go against industry best practice. Unfortunately, it seems those voices were shut out.”

Some businesses which have already invested in cleaning up their supply chains say they have been put at a competitive disadvantage by the Commission’s volte-face. One forward-looking company, the Dutch chocolate manufacturer Tony’s Chocolonely – which has worked with Wolters – condemned the EU’s retreat.

A company statement said that the EU’s goal “shouldn’t be to simplify and weaken upcoming legislation. Why? ’Cause we all know that strong legislation is the only way to hold business accountable and inspire global change. […] We prove every day that supply chain due diligence is possible – because we do it. And we believe all businesses should do the same.”

These sorts of concerns led Pascal Canfin, a French MEP with the centrist Liste Renaissance, to decry the stakeholders meeting as “a fake consultation process” that was really “a smokescreen for deregulation”.

Paul de Clerk of Friends of the Earth Europe was one of the few civil society voices to gain entry to the consultation, on its second day. He says that oil and gas firms were sat in the front row of a “very friendly meeting,” facilitated by the right-wing European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis and attended by other EU commissioners and senior officials.

“Speakers kept saying they wanted to reduce red tape and administrative burden in a simplified process that would not affect the legislation’s ambition and of course we’ve now seen that this was a complete lie because they’re proposing to completely dismantle the CSDDD,” says De Clerk. “They’ve literally taken all the demands from the position paper ‘wish list’ of the German, French and Italian industry associations.”

Schömann, who also attended the consultation’s second day, tells Equal Times that the consultation marked “a very dangerous turn” in the way that the Commission was pursuing its ‘better regulation’ agenda.

“It is not respecting how social partners from different organisations have to be consulted,” she says. “The room was full of big businesses, multinationals, employers’ organisations and we were only two trades unions – the ETUC and IndustriAll – even though we represent 45 million workers in the EU.”

Schömann said that the 44 companies had been given privileged access to the upper echelons of the Commission the day before (5 February). “We hadn’t had this opportunity and even had to invite ourselves to the roundtable. It’s not acceptable and is very detrimental to any trust we can put in how the Commission listens to social actors,” she added.

For its part, the European Commission said: “The selection of companies was made to get a geographically balanced group of different sizes and sectors forming an overall manageable group. Some business associations have assisted the Commission in the selection of companies. The aim was to interact with practitioners operationally involved with business compliance of the issues under discussion.”

The official pointed out that two trades unions, and eight NGOs had also attended the reality check on 6 February, along with an expanded list of corporates, and over 40 business associations: “The mix of stakeholders reflects the need to gather practical insights from those applying the legislation in question. This balance is essential to improving the legal framework for the benefit of all stakeholders, including citizens and civil society organisations.”

Accusations against companies

Among the 44 companies that attended on the first day, Eni has been accused of ignoring oil spills in Nigeria’s Niger Delta. Deutsche Bank is reportedly one of the biggest lenders to, and investors in, major companies working in ecosystem risk sectors.

DHL faces accusations of suppressing union activities and subjecting workers to inhumane conditions – including being denied bathroom breaks and suffering physical assault. Airbus allegedly broke an arms embargo on Libya.

TotalEnergies has a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique beset by accusations of rape, murder and human rights abuses. Volkswagen faces scrutiny for potentially using Uyghur forced labour in its supply chains as well as for workplace abuses in Serbia. Michelin allegedly used a Belgian rubber supplier implicated in environmental destruction and land grabbing practices across West Africa.

Intesa Sanpaolo, along with Allianz and Deutsche Bank is accused of holding shares and bonds in fossil fuel companies fuelling violence in South Sudan. Amnesty International has accused Generali of heavily investing in extractive companies involved in severe human rights abuses, while I.CO.P officials have been investigated for unauthorised industrial wastewater discharges that polluted aquifers and other waterways.

Metro AG has been accused of union-busting practices, dismissals, harassment and other abuses in Pakistan, while Schneider Electric allegedly sacked workers who tried to join a union. Executives at La Poste were accused of using racist slurs against North African employees in a WhatsApp group.

Société Générale is accused of supplying credit to the Israeli army used for activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Allianz has reportedly provided finance to arms companies exporting to Israel, while an OECD complaint was filed against Engie over its alleged involvement in the mining of ‘blood coal’ in Colombia.

All of the allegations were made in the last five years, with the exception of Eni and La Poste’s in 2018, Schneider Electric’s in 2016 and Generali’s in 2013.

Equal Times approached all the accused companies for a response to their involvement in the consultation, given the accusations against them.

A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said the company “engages in constructive dialogue with its stakeholders including associations, NGOs and policymakers,” and referred further questions to its trade associations, and a LinkedIn statement.

An Allianz representative said: “We appreciate and support the simplification and streamlining proposals of the EU Commission to reduce the regulatory burden and enhance competitiveness.”

A spokesperson for La Poste Group said they aimed to reach net zero emissions by 2040, and “to have a positive impact on society as a whole,” in line with their status as mission-driven company under French law. The company rep added: “La Poste has a particular legitimacy as both a producer and a user of data to share feedback on the extra-financial reporting framework. Moreover, as part of the CSRD first wave companies and as having reported for a couple of years under the EU taxonomy (sustainable classification system), La Poste is in a position to share its first-hand experience on the concrete implementation of these legislation.”

A DHL spokesperson said: “We believe it is reasonable, and even essential, to seek input from European companies that are fully compliant with these regulations. These companies, like DHL Group, can offer valuable insights based on their experience navigating the rules, highlighting both the benefits and potential challenges. Engaging with those who are adhering to the standards ensures that policies are practical, fair and effective, while also fostering a balanced perspective on how regulations impact businesses in real-world settings.”",,N,,2025-03-07 08:19:23.554062

As analysts are scrambling to identify sectors best positioned to weather President Donald Trump’s trade policies, one common answer keeps coming up: healthcare.

""America is aging, and no tariff will slow that trend,"" said CapWealth Research Director Grant Stark. “There will likely be more demand for advanced medicines, skilled care, and other health-related segments.”

How real is tariff long-term threat?

Tariff talk isn’t new.

Uncertainty has been mounting since Trump’s election. But while analysts widely agree that tariff-related fears are a driving force behind market instability, opinions vary on the long-term impact.

“Tariffs of this size and magnitude haven’t happened in about 100 years,” said Ritholtz Wealth Management’s Callie Cox. “We’re working with a pretty unprecedented change in policy here.”

As trade disputes with Mexico, Canada, and China escalate, markets have responded with a sharp selloff.

The auto industry is particularly exposed due to its reliance on imported parts. A one-month delay on Mexican and Canadian import tariffs announced this week buys U.S. automakers some time.

But Barclays analysts warn that tariffs “could wipe out effectively all profits” for General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA).

“These exemptions don’t do much to resolve the general air of uncertainty,” said BMO Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Yung-Yu Ma. “Businesses will remain cautious until there’s more clarity on tariffs.”

Investors are expected to follow suit, which is why sectors like healthcare remain attractive to analysts like Stark and Brian Mulberry of Zacks Investment Management. Both recommended CVS Health Corp (CVS) as a potential winner.

Healthcare is one of the few pockets of the market that has stayed afloat while Trump wages a trade war with both adversaries and allies.

Mulberry, who believes the market’s tariff reaction is “a little overdone,” still advised caution when it comes to pharmaceutical firms with overseas operations and health-related companies vulnerable to tariffs.",,N,,2025-03-07 10:16:00.125305

Months after Neumora reported a phase 3 flop, J&J has stopped development of its rival drug candidate aticaprant as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD).

Aticaprant and Neumora’s navacaprant are oral opioid kappa receptor antagonists. Navacaprant failed a phase 3 MDD trial in January. Earlier this week, Neumora halted one trial of the candidate and paused two late-stage studies after assessing a data set that was even worse than analysts feared based on the top-line failure.

Neumora has cited phase 2 aticaprant data as evidence that its mechanism works and that its failed trial may be an anomaly.

The revision comes after UBS analysts observed volatility in the company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin and a general shortfall in sales performance.

“Our positive view on HMB was predicated on a successful turnaround in the H&M brand driving a sales and EBIT margin recovery,” UBS analysts led by Sreedhar Mahamkali said in a note.

“But continued volatility and generally weaker than expected sales and the volatility in EBIT margin suggest a potentially much longer period for this turnaround to materialise than we anticipated,” they added.

The downgrade reflects concerns over H&M’s ability to execute a successful recovery strategy, which initially seemed promising due to improvements in assortment design, pricing, sourcing, and marketing efforts.

The discontinuation of smaller non-core brands like Afound and Monki had also appeared to support a positive trajectory for the brand. However, the need for tactical promotions to boost sales has impacted gross margins, and external challenges have intensified.

In turn, UBS has adjusted its model for H&M, reducing the forecasted normalized gross margin for fiscal year 2027 from approximately 54% to 53%, and the EBIT margin from 10% to 8.3%. The price target for H&M shares has been lowered to SEK 149 from SEK 187.

Moreover, the investment bank has lowered its earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 12% and 19% for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, respectively.

The first quarter, which ended on March 27, typically accounts for only about 9% of H&M’s annual EBIT. While the quarter is not a significant contributor to full-year figures, analysts argue that it is still indicative of broader trends.

They expect a local currency sales growth of 3.0% for the quarter, with a slowdown observed in February. The shift in Black Friday timing had previously inflated sales figures reported up to January 28.

With a minor boost from favorable foreign exchange (FX) rates, analysts forecast a reported sales growth of 4.5%. They also estimate a gross margin of 49.5%, a year-over-year decrease of 200 basis points, citing “tactical promotions, lower margin mix, continued price cuts and greater negative external factors.”

Operating expenses in the first quarter are projected to be higher compared to the fourth quarter due to increased marketing expenditures, with an anticipated EBIT of SEK 1.76 billion.

“Further, with gross margin support more 2H weighted and with marketing costs annualising in 2H, we see progress in FY25e being more 2H weighted,” analysts added.",Not Available,N,,2025-03-07 10:52:41.473260

Although the data has not yet shown signs of economic weakness, investors are already on alert for potential spillover effects from the data, especially as the Trump administration implements reciprocal tariff measures, while Musk's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE) attempts to significantly reduce the size of the federal government, and Republicans in Congress hope to create room for tax cuts in the budget.

BNY Mellon’s macroeconomic strategist John Velis stated that the non-farm report could reveal another piece of the economic puzzle. However, he warned that if the data is weaker than expected, it could trigger market panic.

Wall Street expects 160,000 new jobs to be added in February, with the unemployment rate remaining unchanged at 4%. This data has not yet reflected the federal workforce reductions under the Trump administration.

The stock market often experiences significant volatility when economic data surprises or when Powell discusses the interest rate path. This has been the case even before growth concerns are revisited.

""Employment data will be a key test of economic resilience,"" said Andrew Husby, senior U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. While he expects the current unemployment rate to remain stable, the risk is that negative sentiment could quickly accumulate and lead to cancellations of corporate plans.

In this scenario, ""the Federal Reserve may need to take measures to support economic growth,"" Husby said.

The market has been unsettled by Trump's trade war due to concerns that measures initially seen as protecting the U.S. border from fentanyl and illegal immigration could spiral out of control, ultimately imposing heavy costs on families, businesses, and the U.S. economy.

Amid concerns about economic growth, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond sharply fell from a peak of 4.8%, but rebounded to 4.28% on Thursday.

On Wednesday, the stock market rose after automakers received a new one-month suspension of a 25% tariff. These tariffs could be painful for Canada and Mexico and could severely impact the core of U.S. industry, becoming a drag on economic growth.

Despite new tariff exemptions for Mexican goods, the stock market fell sharply on Thursday, with the Nasdaq approaching correction territory. According to Dow Jones market data, if the closing price is below 18,156.50 points, it will mark at least a 10% decline from the previous record high for the Nasdaq, confirming entry into correction territory. As of Thursday, the Nasdaq has fallen 5% year-to-date.

The S&P 500 index has dropped 2.8% year-to-date, while the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks a group of large tech stocks, has further entered correction territory. The Dow Jones has decreased by 0.3% year-to-date.

This is inconsistent with Wall Street's expectations during Trump's campaign, when he promised tax cuts and other ""growth-promoting"" policies. Instead, his second term has begun with tariffs, growth concerns, and government layoffs led by MuskFriday will be the first complete monthly employment report for Trump 2.0. In the weeks since his inauguration, the U.S. has disrupted long-standing military and economic alliances and pressured Ukraine to allow the U.S. access to its mineral wealth in exchange for help in reaching a peace agreement with Russia.

On Wednesday, U.S. stocks briefly rebounded after Trump held talks with executives from Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis, leading to a one-month suspension of a 25% tariff on cars from Canada and Mexico.

However, Canada has announced retaliatory measures, with Ontario Premier Doug Ford stating that his province will also ""tear up"" the $100 million contract with Musk's Starlink and prohibit all U.S. companies from participating in government contracts. Ontario and several other Canadian provinces have also banned the import of U.S. wine, beer, and spirits.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:14:49.454616

The Europe sustainable (recycled and green) steel market was valued at $94.09 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.31%, reaching $157.86 billion by 2034

The growing need for low-carbon construction materials and stringent environmental laws are driving this expansion. Technological developments in steel production, such as improved recycling procedures and hydrogen-based reduction techniques, are major factors driving the market. Furthermore, the European steel industry is becoming more carbon-conscious and sustainable as a result of strategic alliances and investments in green infrastructure projects.

The market for sustainable steel in Europe is expanding as businesses move toward green, recycled, and low-carbon steel products to satisfy strict environmental standards and sustainability objectives. In order to lessen CO2 emissions and dependency on fossil fuels, this market includes carbon capture-integrated processes, bio-based steel production, green hydrogen-based steel (H2-DRI), and recycled steel (scrap-based production).

Steelmakers are being pushed toward more environmentally friendly options by major forces such as the European Green Deal, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and corporate net-zero targets. While investments in electric arc furnaces (EAFs) and direct reduced iron (DRI) technologies are driving market growth, the automotive, construction, and manufacturing industries are increasingly embracing sustainable steel to reduce their carbon footprint.

Despite its high growth potential, challenges such as high production costs, technological limitations, and the availability of green hydrogen impede rapid adoption. Nonetheless, a positive market environment is being created by encouraging policies, carbon pricing schemes, and rising end-user demand. Prominent firms like Voestalpine, SSAB, and Arcelor Mittal are making significant investments in environmentally friendly production techniques.

Due to innovation, regulatory support, and growing corporate commitments to green procurement, the sustainable steel market is expected to grow significantly as Europe approaches climate neutrality by 2050.

How can this report add value to an organization?

Growth/Marketing Strategy: The Europe sustainable steel market has been growing at a rapid pace. The market offers enormous opportunities for existing and emerging market players. Some of the strategies covered in this segment are mergers and acquisitions, product launches, partnerships and collaborations, business expansions, and investments. The strategies preferred by companies to maintain and strengthen their market position primarily include product development.

Competitive Strategy: The key players in the Europe sustainable steel market analyzed and profiled in the study include manufacturers and recyclers. Additionally, a comprehensive competitive landscape such as partnerships, agreements, and collaborations are expected to aid the reader in understanding the untapped revenue pockets in the market.

Steel prices in India had plunged to the lowest level in more than three years in August last year, with local prices of hot rolled coils then averaging 52,267 rupees per ton.
“India’s steelmakers are caught up in rising geopolitical and trade tensions and that is creating more uncertainty in their outlooks,” S&P Global Ratings analyst Ayushman Bharati said.
The tariffs are making exports to the U.S. costly, and diverting flows to other geographies, S&P Global said.
“Sluggish steel prices could delay the full utilization of this capacity and may hinder expansion,” Bharati said.","Indian steel mills are likely to see a sharp drop in prices after U.S. import tariffs come into effect and reshape global trade of the alloy, potentially redirecting a glut of supply into the South Asian country, S&P Global said in a note.

The agency estimated Indian steel may see a price correction of about 3,000 rupees ($34.52) per ton.

Local steelmakers have been battling a rising influx of discounted steel, with intake from China, South Korea and Japan hitting a record high in first 10 months of the current fiscal.

Steel prices in India had plunged to the lowest level in more than three years in August last year, with local prices of hot rolled coils then averaging 52,267 rupees per ton.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the country come into effect on March 12, and the measures have triggered a global trade war.

“India’s steelmakers are caught up in rising geopolitical and trade tensions and that is creating more uncertainty in their outlooks,” S&P Global Ratings analyst Ayushman Bharati said.

The tariffs are making exports to the U.S. costly, and diverting flows to other geographies, S&P Global said.

India, which already gets 40% of its steel imports from Japan and South Korea, will likely see higher influx from the countries, once the tariffs are imposed, Bharati added.

Steel from Japan and South Korea account for 15% of total steel imports in the U.S.

India added about 15 million tonnes of steel capacity in 2024.

The enterprise technology company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 for the first quarter, missing analyst estimates of $0.50. Revenue came in at $7.85 billion, slightly above the consensus of $7.81 billion and up 16% YoY.

However, HPE's outlook overshadowed its quarterly performance. The company forecasts second-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.28-$0.34, well below analyst expectations of $0.50. Revenue guidance of $7.2-$7.6 billion also fell short of the $7.93 billion consensus.

For fiscal 2025, HPE projects adjusted EPS of $1.70-$1.90, significantly lower than the $2.13 analysts were expecting. The company expects revenue growth of 7-11% in constant currency, with non-GAAP operating profit growth between -10% and 0%.

Adding to investor concerns, HPE announced a cost reduction program aimed at cutting structural operating costs. The plan involves workforce reductions and is expected to deliver gross savings of approximately $350 million by fiscal 2027.

Executive Search 2025: Balancing AI Innovation with a Human Touch

The executive search industry is entering one of its most transformative eras, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, data analytics, and shifting client needs and expectations. In 2024, firms faced many challenges marked by economic uncertainty, evolving workforce dynamics, and increasing demand for specialized leadership roles. While internal talent mobility and cautious hiring strategies were dominant themes, the need for resilient, adaptable leaders capable of driving innovation has positioned the industry for a pivotal shift in 2025, recruiters tell Hunt Scanlon Media. Firms are stepping up to meet these demands by integrating cutting-edge technology into their workflows while emphasizing the irreplaceable value of human expertise.

Technology, particularly AI, is reshaping how firms identify, evaluate, and connect with top talent. From automating routine tasks to uncovering deeper insights into market trends and candidate fit, these tools enhance efficiency and precision. However, as industry leaders emphasize, the human element remains central to success in this relationship-driven field. By leveraging AI to scale capabilities without sacrificing the personalized touch, executive search firms are not only redefining their processes but also reimagining their role as strategic talent advisors. As 2025 unfolds, the firms that can balance technological innovation with a deep understanding of leadership and culture will set the standard for the future of the industry.

“Canada is and always will be the true north, strong and free.” Penetanguishene Mayor Doug Rawson said the municipality doesn't fly the U.S. flag at any town locations.
Tiny Township Mayor David Evans said he's aware of Barrie's decision to remove U.S. flags, but assumes the flags were in indoor arenas, which Tiny does not have.
""Displaying the USA flag is not included in Tiny Township’s procedures bylaw and to my knowledge I don’t recall any USA flags,"" he said.
""There are a few Trump flags around though (in Perkinsfield).""","With the trade war now in full swing and anti-American sentiment likely the highest it’s been since the War of 1812 or whenever Wayne Gretzky represents Canada nowadays, MidlandToday set out to find out what, if anything, local municipalities are doing.

Midland Mayor Bill Gordon initially told MidlandToday that the town didn’t have any American flags flying, but later discovered there was one hanging near a scoreboard at the North Simcoe Sports and Recreation Centre.

He then vowed to have it removed.

Gordon used the opportunity to create a video of himself addressing U.S. President Donald Trump with another video superimposed of the flag being removed by town staff.

In the address to the “untrustworthy” Trump, Gordon begins by pointing out that the sovereign nation of Canada has been the United States’ closest ally and trading partner for the last 158 years.

“On behalf of the 18,000 hardworking men and women and families in our community that will be harmed by your baseless and illegal trade war against Canada, I stand in solidarity with 40 million Canadians who are united against your attacks to our democracy, our sovereignty and our economy,” Gordon said.

“We will resist and repel your efforts to bend Canada to your will and we will never be your 51st state.”

Gordon said that while the two countries will always be neighbours.

“Perhaps, one day, we will once again be friends, but today is not that day,” he said. “Canada is and always will be the true north, strong and free.”

Penetanguishene Mayor Doug Rawson said the municipality doesn't fly the U.S. flag at any town locations.

Tiny Township Mayor David Evans said he's aware of Barrie's decision to remove U.S. flags, but assumes the flags were in indoor arenas, which Tiny does not have.

""Displaying the USA flag is not included in Tiny Township’s procedures bylaw and to my knowledge I don’t recall any USA flags,"" he said. ""There are a few Trump flags around though (in Perkinsfield).""

However, Evans said that Barrie Mayor Alex Nuttall's actions don't align with his personal perspective.

""I disagree with President Trump's implementation of what I perceive to be punitive tariffs targeting Canada with the intent to cause significant harm,"" he said. ""It's important to acknowledge that the USA has been our top trading partner for over 150 years and likely will remain so for the foreseeable future.

""However, these measures reflect the policies of the current administration and not the sentiments of all Americans. As longstanding friends and allies, it’s imperative we recognize the deep interconnectedness between our two nations. Achieving reconciliation requires open dialogue and constructive engagement, rather than resorting to heated rhetoric.""

While noting that his township doesn’t currently display the American flag on any municipal property or facility, Tay Mayor Ted Walker took a more cautious approach, voicing concerns about acting too quickly.

“My opinion is since we are dealing with a revolving door – where changes are constantly being made, we should not do anything rash until we know exactly what we are dealing with,” Walker said.

“And then the approach should be a unified one with all municipalities and the County (of Simcoe).”",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/midlandtoday/images/government/20250306-img_1106.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-03-07 12:19:15.281054

Bloomberg News

(TNS)

Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits fell last week and returned to muted levels seen at the start of the year, offering some relief after other reports pointed to worsening labor-market conditions.

Initial claims decreased by 21,000 to 221,000 in the week ended March 1, lower than analysts anticipated. However continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose to an almost three-year high reached in January, a sign those out of work are having more trouble finding new positions.

Separate data from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas published earlier Thursday showed February had the highest number of job-cut announcements since mid-2020, led by federal agencies, as well as retail and technology firms.

The Challenger report raised concerns about a coming deterioration in the labor market as the Trump administration moves to shrink the federal government and tariffs weigh on business decisions. Multiple large companies have said they’re cutting jobs in recent weeks, including HP Inc., Walt Disney Co. and Grubhub.

US stock futures pared losses while Treasuries pared gains after the release of the data.

Before adjusting for seasonal factors, the Washington, DC- Maryland- Virginia region saw filings fall 6,556 from 7,150, pulling back from the highs in early February but remaining above levels seen late last year.

Filings by out-of-work federal employees are not included in those figures and reported separately. In the week ended Feb. 22, the latest available for this category, claims almost tripled to 1,634 from 614 the previous week. That number will be updated by the Department of Labor for the week ended March 1 later Thursday.

Data published Wednesday by ADP Research showed hiring at private-sector U.S. companies slowed in February to the lowest pace since July as services firms shed jobs. The government’s monthly employment report due Friday is expected to show a pick in job growth, based on economists’ forecasts. Data for the report was collected prior to many of the federal cuts.

The Motley Fool owns shares of Citigroup, PNC Financial Services Group, and Bank of America.","Capital One's (NYS: COF) quest to become the No. 1 U.S. online banker by purchasing ING Direct from ING (NYS: ING) has hit a bit more than a snag.

Congressman Barney Frank, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has asked Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke for at least another 60 days of public comment on the acquisition. He also wants the Fed to hold public hearings on what such a deal would mean for consumers.

It starts to add up

A worry is that if Capital One keeps growing, it might turn into another too-big-to-fail institution. In the last six years it has acquired Hibernia National Bank, North Fork Bank, and Chevy Chase Bank, making it the 11th largest U.S.-based bank by size of deposits. If the $9 billion ING deal goes through, Capital One would jump up to sixth largest, behind JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (NYS: BAC) , Wells Fargo (NYS: WFC) , Citigroup (NYS: C) , and US Bancorp (NYS: USB) .

Source: BankRegData.com.

Even with the steep falloff in bank deposits from the first four banks to the possible numbers five and six Capital One, it's hard to escape the fear of more future bailout scenarios since Capital One at its current size is already considered ""systemically important.""

If the Fed or Congress does scuttle Capital One's acquisition plans, that could also spell N-O to other bank deals a-brewin'. It's hard to see how PNC's (NYS: PNC) plan to buy the Royal Bank of Canada's U.S. banking and credit card operations for $3.62 billion could survive. That marriage, if consummated, would bring PNC's deposits to around $210 billion, a hair below the potential Capital One deposits.

Credit card worries

And consumer groups, such as the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, already concerned with the increase in high-interest credit card lending, feel that Capital One's recent acquisition of HSBC's U.S. credit card business would be funded by the ING Direct deposits. The group is uneasy about this pushing more consumers into a debt spiral.

Make or break...

On Friday, the Fed decided to grant Congressman Frank's request, and will hold three days of public hearings on the proposed acquisition. It also agreed to allow the period of public comment to continue through Oct. 12.

The deal that started out as a source of annoyance to ING Direct customers unhappy having Capital One become their new banker may become the make-or-break determiner of bank consolidations for the foreseeable future. Keep track of your bank investments by adding them to your Watchlist.

Securely verified Corsair Capital has acquired a majority stake in IDnow, increasing its investment in the Munich-based identity verification company.","Let’s kick things off with tech! Monument Group’s Zac Williams expects a big spike in European technology deals in 2025, as the region offers more appealing valuations compared with the US.

Next up, we dive into a report from S&P Global Market Intelligence, which shows that while global private equity and venture capital deal value jumped 26.6 percent in February compared with January 2025, it still lagged behind last year’s number, dropping 28 percent from February 2024.

Lastly, ID verification systems are becoming more crucial than ever, fueled by a surge in online fraud, identity theft and tighter regulations like know your customer and anti-money laundering. Also, AI is changing the game for security and cyber threats. Against this backdrop, Corsair Capital has made a move to increase its stake in Munich-based IDnow, securing a majority share.

Favorable valuations

European technology deals will see significant growth in 2025, underpinned by more favorable valuations compared to the US, Zac Williams, partner at Monument Group, told PE Hub. “Major tech hubs such as Berlin, London and Stockholm benefit from deep benches of engineering talent and Europe’s fragmentation fosters a global mindset from the outset, resulting in faster internationalization.”

Climate tech is emerging as a key area to watch, thanks to Europe’s heightened focus on sustainability and its lead in green transition, London-based Williams said.

On the AI front, infrastructure projects continue to attract sizable capital backing and will benefit from “political enthusiasm” to facilitate large projects, he said. However, there is a growing pool of specialized software and deep tech opportunities targeting sectors like healthcare, finance and legal services, where Europe’s established sectors and stricter regulations present a competitive advantage.

“AI also naturally proliferates where its value-added solutions can serve industries increasingly seeking automation and efficiency, such as in high-value manufacturing.”

Bolt-on acquisitions will also play a big role in overall M&A activity, he said. “Looking at this from the reverse angle, with valuations correcting in the venture and growth space, some high-potential companies may find an appealing liquidity route via strategic sales rather than braving the prospect of down-rounds.”

However, the sector does face some challenges, he added. “Fragmented public markets and lower retail investor engagement limits the pool of liquidity options for European firms and navigating a patchwork of regulations across the region remains complex.”

Below are the tech deals we covered this week in Europe:

Main Capital’s Timegrip buys Software4You

LDC sells Blis in a deal valued at $175m

Arcus-backed FixMap picks up Internet Union

Thoma Bravo-backed USU buys Saasmetrix

Main-backed Xitres snaps up Hartje Wonen

Exponent to invest in digital transformation provider Hippo Digital

Equistone to sell stake in Timetoact Group to HIG Capital

Blackstone-and Permira-backed Adevinta to sell Willhaben

Sluggish trend

Global private equity and venture capital deal value in February dropped 28 percent year over year from $52.64 billion in February 2024, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The number of deals also saw a decline by about 12.7 percent during the same period.

Looking at the first two months of 2025, deal volume and value were down compared to the same period in 2024. Investment value decreased about 20 percent to $67.89 billion and the number of deals were down to 1,670 from 1,788, the report said.

In fact, January marked the slowest start for US dealmaking in over a decade, according to data PE Hub’s analysis of multiple providers.

However, February showed some signs of recovery, with deal value climbing 26.6 percent from January to reach $37.93 billion.

Technology, media and telecommunications led the transactions in February with 278 deals totaling $13.72 billion, followed by the industrials, with $7.41 billion across 103 transactions. These two sectors also led dealmaking in Q4 of 2024, according to PE Hub data.

Six of the top 10 deals during the month were in the US and Canada. The largest PE transaction was Blackstone’s $5.65 billion purchase of Safe Harbor Marinas, followed by Turn/River Management’s $4.42 billion buyout of SolarWinds.

Securely verified

Corsair Capital has acquired a majority stake in IDnow, increasing its investment in the Munich-based identity verification company.

Founded in 2014, IDnow develops proprietary, AI-powered identity verification technologies that address cybersecurity and digital verification needs.

Corsair first invested in IDnow in October 2019 with a minority stake. Since then, IDnow strengthened its technical leadership position, grew its portfolio of differentiated identification systems and completed two strategic acquisitions, which expanded the company into new geographies, including establishing a leadership position in France, a statement read. In 2021, IDnow acquired Ariadnext and Trust Management.

Now, with a controlling stake, Corsair plans to accelerate IDnow’s market position through additional acquisitions, broadening its reach and strengthening its position across multiple geographies, it said.

In an attempt to revive the airline, Ghana International Airlines was launched in 2005 as a public-private partnership.
As Ghana celebrates its heritage during Ghana Month, the question remains: will the country ever reclaim its national airline?","In the heart of Ghana’s growing aviation landscape stands Kotoka International Airport (KIA), a symbol of the nation’s journey through history and progress.

KIA has received honours due to its excellence in service quality and passenger experience. It was named the Best Airport by Size and Region (2-5 million passengers per year) in Africa by Airports Council International in the 2021 Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards, having previously won in the same category in 2019 and 2020.

Originally built as a military airbase during World War II, KIA has transformed over the decades into one of West Africa’s busiest airports.

However, despite its modern facilities and strategic position, Ghana still lacks a national airline—a gap that has persisted for nearly two decades.

KIA’s story dates back to the early 1940s when it served as a crucial airbase for British and Allied forces. Following Ghana’s independence in 1957, the airbase was converted into a civilian airport and named Accra International Airport. In 1969, it was renamed in honor of Lieutenant General Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka, the military officer who played a role in Ghana’s first coup d’état.

Over the years, Kotoka International Airport (KIA) has undergone significant expansion. It now features three terminals, including the state-of-the-art Terminal 3, completed in 2018, which serves as the primary hub for international flights. With a 3,403-meter runway, KIA can accommodate some of the world's largest aircraft, including the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. Notably, it has also hosted the Antonov AN-225 Mriya, the largest aircraft ever built.

In 2023, KIA welcomed the U.S. Air Force 2 during the historic visit of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to Ghana.

The airport handles approximately 5 million passengers annually, cementing its status as a major hub in the region.

The Struggle of a National Airline

Despite Ghana’s investment in a world-class airport, the absence of a national airline remains a significant gap in its aviation industry. Ghana Airways, established in 1958 as the country’s flag carrier, was initially a partnership between the Government of Ghana (60%) and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) (40%).

In 2002, the airline faced a severe financial crisis that weakened its staff strength and competitiveness. Much of its troubles stemmed from its earlier decision to become fully independent by purchasing BOAC’s 40% stake. This move, however, led to operational and financial difficulties, including issues with its Boeing fleet after the cancellation of an agreement with BOAC.

The crisis deepened when BOAC, seeking to recover an outstanding £4 million debt, obtained a legal injunction that resulted in the seizure of La Dante DC-10, one of Ghana Airways’ aircraft, at Heathrow Airport according to reports by The Guardian and The Telegraph.

The situation worsened when a £4 million lawsuit from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) led to one of its aircraft being seized in London.

The aircraft was finally brought home and was turned into a restaurant serving up to 118 people in the Capital. Even as a restaurant, it didn’t survive — The La Tante DC-10 Restaurant was shut down in 2023.

In an attempt to revive the airline, Ghana International Airlines was launched in 2005 as a public-private partnership. However, it too faced financial difficulties and ceased operations in 2010, leaving the country without a national flag carrier.

Unfulfilled Plans for Revival

Over the years, multiple efforts to re-establish a national airline have stalled. In 2019, the government led by former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Boeing to acquire three 787-9 Dreamliners at a cost of US$877.5 million at the Dubai Air Show, with EgyptAir along in partnering on the project. However, these plans have yet to materialize.

Despite these setbacks, Ghana’s aviation sector continues to thrive, with KIA serving as the gateway to the country. Airlines such as British Airways, Emirates, Delta, Qatar, Kenyan and Ethiopian Airlines operate frequent flights to and from Accra, connecting Ghana to major destinations worldwide.

As Ghana celebrates its heritage during Ghana Month, the question remains: will the country ever reclaim its national airline? While private airlines operate domestically and regionally, a national carrier could serve as a symbol of pride and economic opportunity.

For now, Kotoka International Airport remains a testament to Ghana’s aviation history—modern, busy, and globally connected, yet missing a crucial piece of its identity.",,N,,2025-03-07 08:16:52.126428

The project brought together major fashion brands including adidas and Levi Strauss & Co., with Under Armour joining as a project partner.

Fiber fragmentation is a significant topic of concern across the industry, with studies highlighting the potential threat to ecosystems and human health, underscoring the need for the development of effective strategies aimed at mitigating the negative impact of fiber fragments.

In recent years, several domestic and industrial mitigation efforts have been developed to capture fiber fragments before they enter air, water and soil. However, the focus lies in reducing fiber fragments from entering the environment downstream, rather than tackling the problem at the source. The “Behind the Break” project seeks to identify the root causes of fiber fragmentation within manufacturing processes, such as different dye methods, focusing on cotton and polyester knits.

The project includes various testing methods, leveraging the expertise of partners such as Paradise Textiles, the fabric segment of Alpine Group.

“We recognize that the future of the fashion and textile industry hinges on our ability to address challenges like fiber fragmentation head-on,” said Lewis Shuler, head of innovation at Alpine Group and Paradise Textiles. “Our objective is to identify processes and strategies that mitigate fiber pollution through informed textile design and manufacturing processes. We’re excited about continuing this critical work and pioneering innovative technologies that can reshape the industry for the better.”

Many investors believe that this outstanding performance still has room for further improvement. Société Générale SA refers to the seven major Chinese tech giants, including Alibaba and Tencent Holdings, as the ""Seven Giants."" This basket of stocks, compiled on an equal-weight basis, has risen over 40% this year. In contrast, the American ""Seven Giants"" index has fallen by about 10%, and its sluggish performance has pushed the Nasdaq 100 index toward a correction.

This is a dramatic reversal of fortunes in the stock market that few on Wall Street anticipated. At the beginning of 2025, the Nasdaq index was still reaching new highs, while the Chinese stock market was languishing. However, almost overnight, the emergence of DeepSeek disrupted previous perceptions, and the market began to realize that China might not need many years to catch up with the U.S. in the field of artificial intelligence.

Since then, Chinese tech stocks have surged, even those who were long skeptical have turned from pessimism to optimism. This week, with the Chinese government's plans to increase support for tech companies and the launch of a series of new AI tools by companies like Alibaba, this wave of growth has been further propelled.

Charu Chanana, Chief Investment Strategist at Saxo Markets, stated: ""The success of DeepSeek and the launch of a series of AI models in China remind the world that despite the U.S. implementing chip export restrictions, China's innovative strength should not be underestimated. Considering the valuation discount, there is still room for growth in Chinese AI-related stocks.""

Société Générale has listed this Chinese corporate portfolio based on market capitalization and growth trajectory, which also includes Xiaomi, BYD, SMIC, JD.com, and NetEase. Frank Benzimra, a strategist at Société Générale, pointed out in a report on February 28 that this portfolio currently has an expected price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times, which is over 40% lower than that of the American ""Seven Giants.""

On Friday, the Hang Seng Tech Index rose over 1%, with a cumulative increase of about 10% this week, reaching its highest level since the end of 2021.

U.S. vs. China

Now, the previously undervalued Chinese stocks seem to be on an upward trajectory, while U.S. stocks have faced multiple blows. U.S. President Donald Trump has disrupted the global trade order, and a series of tariff measures have left American businesses and consumers worried, shaking the belief that ""the rise of the U.S. stock market is unstoppable,"" a notion stemming from ""American exceptionalism.""

The rise of large U.S. tech stocks, led by NVIDIA, has encountered obstacles after years of growth, and investors have begun to question the reasonableness of their high valuations, demanding higher expectations for earnings surprises.

Despite the rising optimism toward China, the long-standing performance of the Chinese stock market, unexpected policy shifts, and the intensifying geopolitical tensions under Trump's administration still leave some investors cautious Although the Hang Seng Tech Index has risen this year, it is still about 40% lower than its peak in 2021. Its five-year return rate is approximately 18%, which pales in comparison to the over 130% increase of the Nasdaq 100 Index during the same period.

However, as concerns about the U.S. stock market bubble grow, China has become a viable alternative for many investors.

Vey-Sern Ling, Managing Director of Union Bancaire Privee, stated, ""The necessary driving factors for Chinese tech stocks to outperform the market are in place, including high-level government support, earnings recovery, and the structural growth theme of artificial intelligence.

By Bloomberg

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. plunged about 20% after it said profit in the coming year would be hurt by tariffs, weak margins on server sales and execution issues. The company also said it would eliminate about 3,000 jobs.

CompanyValueChange%ChangeBanka Bioloo₹81.3213.5519.99Somi Conveyor Beltings₹184.3130.0619.49Balaxi Pharmaceuticals₹70.9311.0518.45Laxmi Dental₹434.0060.9516.34Compucom Software₹22.503.0415.62

Earnings, excluding some items, will be $1.70 to $1.90 per share in the fiscal year ending in October 2025, HPE said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $2.12 a share.

The lower profitability is due largely to issues in HPE’s closely watched server unit, Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri said in an interview. Discounting during sales, higher-than-realized costs and a buildup of older-generation semiconductors will dent profit in the coming quarters, he said. Tariffs will also weigh on the profitability outlook.

The company is working through these problems, which included “execution performance,” Neri said. Part of that will be a reduction of about 3,000 roles — 2,500 of which will come through job cuts and the rest through attrition, he said. HPE employed 61,000 people as of the end of October. The workforce reduction will cost HPE about $350 million over the next two years, the company said in the statement, although it estimates annual savings of the same amount by fiscal 2027.

Artificial intelligence has fueled a wave of demand for powerful servers from hardware makers like HPE, Dell Technologies Inc., and Super Micro Computer Inc. Still, this business line has been a double-edged sword due to lower margins because of the need to fill those servers with expensive AI chips from Nvidia Corp. and others.

The issues in the server unit leading to lower profits were present in both traditional and AI equipment, Neri said.

The weak outlook suggests problems at the company may go beyond tariffs and weak margins on AI systems, wrote Woo Jin Ho, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The company’s cost actions, including job cuts, suggest meaningful inefficiencies.”

The shares dropped to a low of $14.32 in extended trading after closing at $17.96 in New York. The stock has declined 16% this year.

Tariffs also weighed on the profit guidance issued last week by computer and printer maker HP Inc., which said it would cut as many as 2,000 jobs.

In the fiscal first quarter, which ended Jan. 31, HPE’s AI Systems revenue was about $900 million, down from $1.5 billion in the previous quarter, the company said in a presentation. Quarterly orders of these systems surged to $1.6 billion. Neri said there was a jump in orders by enterprises, a customer category generally expected by analysts to provide higher margins.

HPE reported total quarterly sales increased 16% to $7.85 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated $7.81 billion. Server revenue was $4.3 billion, also just ahead of estimates.

In the current quarter ending in April, sales will be $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, compared with an average projection of $7.94 billion.

Adjusted gross margins in the quarter slipped nearly 7 percentage points from the prior year to 29.4%, short of the 31.3% anticipated by analysts. Profit, excluding some items, was 49 cents per share, just shy of estimates.

Last month, the US Justice Department sued to block HPE’s $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks Inc., arguing the tie-up would harm competition in the market for enterprise wireless equipment.

Neri said the company remains “very committed” to the transaction and expects to close the deal by the end of the fiscal year. A trial date for the antitrust lawsuit has been set for July, HPE said in the statement.

The acquisition aims to expand the capabilities of its targeted marketing unit Epsilon. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.

Specialised in data, identity and technology, Lotame is home to one of the largest end-to-end data marketplaces in the world, spanning 109 countries.

The combined footprint of Epsilon and Lotame will expand Groupe’s unique profiles to almost four billion, extending global coverage to more than 90% of consumers worldwide. This scale combined with unmatched breadth and depth of data allows marketers to find and activate against the right audiences with even greater accuracy, to engage their consumers in more relevant and meaningful ways.

With the acquisition, Publicis aims to improve the use of artificial intelligence on its CoreAI platform, which requires quality information in order to be effective.

'Connect or die', the name of the AI game

In a video to cement Publicis' strategy on identity-based big data, Sadoun said, “In the age of AI, the name of the game is: connect or die. By connecting Lotame to Epsilon, we’re reinforcing our industry-leading identity graph, giving clients the unique competitive advantage of seeing and engaging with 91% of all adults who use the internet, safely and transparently.""

Sadoun added that influencers and digital commerce have completely rewritten the marketing rules. ""With proliferation and fragmentation of channels from channels, networks, platforms, social and creators, it has become harder for marketers to see if their marketing across all of those channels and through the consumer journey is really driving business.""

""By connecting that best-in-class identity to our clients’ data thanks to AI, and leveraging it across their marketing spectrum from their paid, earned, shared, and owned (PESO) media ecosystem to content production all in their owned environments, we are delivering measurable outcomes for their business,"" he added.

Sadoun also explained that CoreAI, housed on its Marcel platform, can connect capabilities to capabilities based on its data foundation and the AI applications it has built over the last year. With this, the advertising group will be able to connect the core capabilities across media, commerce, influencers, customer experience, creative, production, technology, and consultancy, to transform its clients’ marketing and business model.

""It’s how we are making CoreAI a reality, and how we’ve built a category of one for Publicis. That means today, we are the world’s largest advertising group, leading the industry on every KPI. As we continue to invest in the products, services and talent that drive differentiation and growth for our clients, I couldn’t be happier to welcome Andy Monfried and the outstanding teams at Lotame on board,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Monfried, CEO of Lotame said “We have a rich history of innovation, building out our global data marketplace and scaling our identity solution to become among the most trusted and adopted in the industry.”

“We are beyond thrilled to join Publicis Groupe, who shares our commitment to industry interoperability, connectivity, and privacy. Together with Epsilon, we look forward to delivering the next chapter of connected identity for Publicis,"" he added.

Glass Lewis On March 4, 2025, Glass Lewis sent a memo to clients providing an update on its diversity-related proxy voting policies.
The 2025 policy also removes BlackRock’s prior disclosure-based voting policy (i.e., BlackRock previously would consider taking voting action if a company did not adequately explain its approach to board diversity).
State Street State Street’s updated policy for 2025 removes all previous numerical diversity targets from its board composition policy.
However, the continued focus on board diversity from some key stakeholders means that aggregate diversity disclosure may make sense for many companies.","Public companies find themselves rethinking disclosures relating to the diversity of their board and their director recruitment practices as they head into proxy season, given recent developments – including the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s decision striking down Nasdaq’s board diversity rules, the current administration’s presidential executive orders on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and changes to proxy advisor and institutional investor policies on board diversity.

Companies will need to make decisions about proxy statement disclosures amid ongoing uncertainty (see, e.g., this February 25, 2025, Cooley alert discussing the US District Court for the District of Maryland pausing the enforcement of certain key provisions of the DEI executive orders) and while balancing competing stakeholder priorities. Political and legal developments, including executive orders, litigation and activist pressure campaigns have been consequential, and this environment has resulted in changes to proxy advisor and some institutional investor policies. This alert aims to provide an overview of updated board diversity voting policies of proxy advisory firms and key institutional investors and offer guidance to companies as they review their board diversity disclosures and practices in the current environment.

As a sign of the quick pace of developments in this space, following the initial publication of this alert, on February 28, State Street Global Advisors published its updated Global Proxy Voting and Engagement Policy, which removes prior quantitative diversity requirements from its board composition policy. In addition, as previewed, on March 4, Glass Lewis also published new guidance on the application of its policies. This alert has been updated to reflect these changes.

Proxy advisory firms’ policies

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)

On February 11, 2025, ISS announced that, for shareholder meeting reports published on or after February 25, 2025, it will no longer consider board gender and racial and/or ethnic diversity when making vote recommendations with respect to the election or re-election of directors at US companies under its benchmark and specialty policies. Before this policy change, ISS generally recommended voting against the nominating committee chair of a board with no women members or a Russell 3000 or S&P 1500 board with no apparent racially or ethnically diverse members.

Glass Lewis

On March 4, 2025, Glass Lewis sent a memo to clients providing an update on its diversity-related proxy voting policies. While an earlier Glass Lewis memo from February 19 previewed that Glass Lewis was considering implementing changes to its director diversity guidelines, the new memo provides that Glass Lewis will continue to apply its existing policies for the 2025 proxy season. However, Glass Lewis will now provide a “For Your Attention” flag on any proxy report with a negative diversity-related director recommendation, “pointing clients to a supporting rationale they can leverage if their preference is to vote differently from the recommendation.” Under Glass Lewis’s existing board diversity policies:

For Russell 3000 companies, Glass Lewis generally recommends voting against the nominating committee chair of a board that is not at least 30% gender diverse or all nominating committee members of a board with no gender diverse directors. For companies outside of the Russell 3000 index, Glass Lewis will recommend voting against the nominating committee chair if there are no gender diverse directors.

For Russell 1000 companies, Glass Lewis generally recommends voting against the nominating committee chair of a board with fewer than one director from an underrepresented community.

Major institutional investors’ policies

BlackRock

BlackRock’s updated policy for 2025 removes previous numerical diversity targets (boards should aspire to at least 30% diversity of membership, and S&P 500 boards should have at least two women directors and a director from an underrepresented group). The 2025 policy also removes BlackRock’s prior disclosure-based voting policy (i.e., BlackRock previously would consider taking voting action if a company did not adequately explain its approach to board diversity). Nonetheless, the 2025 policy provides that BlackRock may still consider taking voting action if an S&P 500 board is an outlier relative to market norms, noting that 98% of S&P 500 companies have boards with at least 30% diversity.

Vanguard

Similarly, Vanguard’s updated policy for 2025 includes a significant rewording and softening of policies on board composition and diversity. The 2025 policy removes prior language providing for negative votes against nominating committee chairs for insufficient action to achieve “appropriately representative” board composition, as well as language stating that boards should, “at a minimum, represent a diversity of personal characteristics, inclusive of at least diversity in gender, race, and ethnicity on the board.” Nonetheless, the 2025 policy continues to emphasize the importance of “cognitive diversity” to effective boards, resulting from an appropriate breadth of skills and experience, as well as a diversity of personal characteristics, such as age, gender or race/ethnicity. In addition, the 2025 policy provides for potential negative votes against nominating committee chairs if board composition or related disclosure is inconsistent with relevant “market-specific governance frameworks or market norms.

State Street

State Street’s updated policy for 2025 removes all previous numerical diversity targets from its board composition policy. State Street’s prior policy provided for potential negative votes against the nominating committee chair of a Russell 3000 board with less than 30% women directors or an S&P 500 board without at least one director from an underrepresented racial or ethnic community, as well as potential negative votes against all nominating committee members of a board that has had no women directors for three consecutive years. In addition to removing these numerical diversity targets, the 2025 policy goes further than BlackRock and Vanguard by not including explicit language indicating that State Street may still take negative voting action against market outliers. Instead, the 2025 policy provides that nominating committees are best placed to determine the most effective board composition, while still encouraging companies to maintain “sufficient levels” of diverse experiences and perspectives in the boardroom.

To date, among the top 20 institutional investors, as measured by total assets under management,1 no other US-based institutional investors have published their policies for 2025 or announced anticipated changes to their voting policies on board diversity.2 However, a few larger non-US institutional investors have actually announced policy changes for 2025 that include more expansive or stringent diversity standards, including Allianz (extending its policy requiring at least 30% gender diversity to small- and mid-cap companies), UBS (now requiring that boards have at least 40% diversity across gender and ethnicity dimensions), and BNP Paribas (increasing its gender diversity requirement to 40% women directors from 35%). Companies should continue to monitor their top investors’ voting policies for any relevant updates.

Adapting to the evolving landscape

In response to the changing landscape, companies should consider taking the following actions:

Review public disclosure of board diversity data: Consider whether to continue providing individualized director diversity data in the proxy statement or whether aggregate diversity disclosure is sufficient to satisfy the needs of various stakeholders. Following the Nasdaq decision, the broader political environment, and ISS, BlackRock and Vanguard changes, many companies may feel less compelled to have granular board diversity disclosure in the form of a matrix or otherwise. However, the continued focus on board diversity from some key stakeholders means that aggregate diversity disclosure may make sense for many companies.

Review board recruitment processes and update governance documents and disclosures as needed: Companies and their boards should review the role of race, gender and other demographic criteria in their director recruitment processes, given the broader focus of the current administration on removing diversity-focused initiatives, including recent executive orders, as well as litigation developments and public pressure campaigns. “Rooney Rule” (typically a rule that requires one or more “diverse” candidates are considered on the interview slate) policies especially may draw scrutiny, but so may more general statements regarding the role of race and gender in the director recruitment process depending upon the current administration’s interpretation of what constitutes “illegal DEI.” Companies and their boards should ensure that they are aligned in terms of risk tolerance with respect to their current practices, and that they describe lawful recruitment practices accurately in their proxy statements, governance documents and other public disclosures. Board dynamics, stakeholder expectations, federal government contractor status and other factors may inform a company’s ongoing assessment of risk in this area as events continue to unfold.

Stay informed: Companies should stay updated on ongoing legal challenges and regulatory changes involving diversity programs and initiatives that could impact the board recruitment process, and continue to evaluate current practices and disclosures from both a risk and compliance lens.

ID8,Capgemini,2025-03-07 07:23:35+00:00,Capgemini,Tech lessons for positive futures,,,,,,https://www.capgemini.com/news/inside-stories/tech-lessons-for-positive-futures/,"Three colleagues reflect on how Capgemini’s Tech 4 Positive Futures initiative has had a positive impact on their skills and careers.
Since its launch in 2020, Capgemini’s Tech 4 Positive Futures initiative has engaged hundreds of colleagues around the world to create tech solutions that can make a positive impact for the planet and society, for example by reducing carbon footprints and protecting biodiversity.
While the winning projects all hope to deliver lasting change, being part of a Tech 4 Positive Futures team also positively impacts careers too.
“Tech 4 Positive Futures allowed me to align my career goals with my personal passion for making devices that improve the world,” he says.
I’ve also brought that knowledge into the latest edition of Tech 4 Positive Futures, where I’m now supporting the team as a mentor.","Three colleagues reflect on how Capgemini’s Tech 4 Positive Futures initiative has had a positive impact on their skills and careers.

Since its launch in 2020, Capgemini’s Tech 4 Positive Futures initiative has engaged hundreds of colleagues around the world to create tech solutions that can make a positive impact for the planet and society, for example by reducing carbon footprints and protecting biodiversity.

While the winning projects all hope to deliver lasting change, being part of a Tech 4 Positive Futures team also positively impacts careers too.

Christopher Lue Sang, an electrical engineer at Synapse Product Development, part of Capgemini Invent, was a winning team member in the 2023 edition of the initiative. The team prototyped smart nets that could reduce unwanted by-catch in fishing.

“Tech 4 Positive Futures allowed me to align my career goals with my personal passion for making devices that improve the world,” he says. “It’s really cool that there’s an initiative where those two spheres can meet.”

For Christopher, working on the project meant getting an added level of support to develop new skills.

“It gave me more confidence, at a deep level,” he says. “My colleagues really encouraged me to push things forward, and it wasn’t just about developing hard tech skills, it was about improving soft skills too. Whether it’s organising the project or getting buy-in from stakeholders, those skills are also key. It’s been a very positive experience.”

Also part of the smart nets teams was Peter Hauser, head of the New Product Introduction team at Synapse in San Francisco.

“My role in the team was really to understand how to best scale the product,” he says. “That’s what I do in my day-to-day work. But, by working on the project, I learned a lot about micro-manufacturing. How do you create something that you can build with minimal tools and with minimal skills? How could we foster that? I gained a new set of skills.

“I also learned about the importance of having the legal details sorted out, as a priority, before the work starts. That’s often an overlooked piece of work and yet it’s really important because it enables the delivery without hitting roadblocks along the way.

“I think that was my biggest area of learning. It was an eye-opener for me and something I’ve carried over into other parts of my work. I’ve also brought that knowledge into the latest edition of Tech 4 Positive Futures, where I’m now supporting the team as a mentor. It’s been a win-win – I’ve been able to guide the teams with their submissions, and to support the team at Capgemini that is continuing to foster the (Tech 4 Positive Futures) initiative. If we can pass on the knowledge that others can benefit from to continue the programme, then we’ve achieved some real legacy building.”

Hardik Pithadia, an innovation consultant in Capgemini’s Applied Innovation Exchange (AIE), was also part of a winning Tech 4 Positive Futures team in 2023. The team created an app that encouraged people and communities in urban areas in England to grow the native wildflowers that enable pollinators to thrive.

“When you get that sense of satisfaction through what you’ve achieved with your work, and from the support you receive from colleagues, and you know you’ve made a positive difference in the world – that’s a great feeling,” he says.

“From a career point of view, the project also gave us a lot of exposure within Capgemini. It’s a conversation starter with colleagues and at events, and it helps us understand the types of things that are possible in terms of climate-related projects and sustainability initiatives.

“From a skills point of view, I learned a lot because this was the first project of this type for me. My usual role is more to do with the sales side, but with Tech 4 Positive Futures I was part of a delivery team that was creating a technical solution. I learned so much, and since then I’ve worked on three other projects as a product owner. I’m loving it.

“We’ve also taken the knowledge we gained on the project and applied it to other projects as well. So yes, we were looking at the specific topic of bees and pollinators, but I learned so much about sustainability, biodiversity, and the environmental challenges we’re facing.”

Hardik, like Christopher and Peter, feels that the Tech 4 Positive Futures initiative, has provided a focus for the major challenges faced by societies around the world.

“It has changed my perspective on how I can help clients, and I’ve learned how to ensure sustainability is right there at the front and centre. It’s about being prepared for what’s ahead.”

Ultimately, the solutions the teams delivered, and the skills they learned along the way, are a localised way of learning to make a positive difference globally.",,N,,2025-03-07 08:16:06.654176

Larsen & Toubro (L&T) Chairman SN Subrahmanyan has announced a one-day menstrual leave policy for women employees in the parent group. This move makes L&T one of the first companies in the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) sector to adopt such a measure. Women employees constitute approximately 9% of the company’s 60,000-strong workforce.

Announcement After 90 Hours Work Week Controversy

The announcement has been made after the significant backlash from Subrahmanyan’s earlier remarks advocating for a 90-hour work week. During an internal meeting in early 2025, Subrahmanyan expressed regret about not being able to make employees work on Sundays and suggested that working 90 hours per week was key to success. His comments, which included a controversial remark about “staring at your wife,” sparked public outrage and debates over work-life balance.

After a huge controversy L&T’s HR department replied to Subrahmanyan’s remarks. Sonica Muraleedharan, Head of HR for Domestic Operations, stated in a LinkedIn post that the chairman’s words were taken out of context and were casual in nature, not intended as a directive.

Menstrual Leave Policies In India

L&T’s policy places it among a growing number of Indian companies supporting menstrual leave for female employees.

Zomato had introduced 10 days of paid menstrual leave annually in 2020. Swiggy had also implemented a menstrual leave policy, though specific details are less widely known.

At the state level, Odisha became the first in India to introduce a one-day menstrual leave policy for women workers in government and private sectors in August 2024. Karnataka has proposed six days of paid menstrual leave per year under the Right of Women to Menstrual Leave and Free Access to Menstrual Health Products bill, though its implementation remains uncertain.

(M&M Ltd.), one of India’s leading automotive companies, today announced that it has become the only car manufacturer in the world to achieve a top 1 percent Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) ranking in S&P Global’s prestigious 2025 Sustainability Yearbook.

The 2025 Sustainability Yearbook ranks the top sustainability performers across various sectors based on S&P Global’s annual CSA. This year’s yearbook analysed over 7,690 companies globally, with only 780 earning a place in the exclusive publication. M&M’s inclusion in the top 1% reflects its outstanding performance and dedication to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles and underscores the company’s commitment to sustainability leadership.

Moreover, very recently, the company has achieved leadership status in the DJSI (Dow Jones Sustainability Index) World Index for 2024 within the ‘auto sector’ as part of the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA). Mahindra’s score this year is 82/100, indicating a 12-point jump from last year, and it marks the 4th consecutive year of being part of the DJSI World Index. This achievement makes M&M the first and only Indian company to attain the DJSI world leader status within the automobiles industry, while being ranked 2nd in the Automobile & Component Industry combined globally.

Veejay Nakra, President, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd. said, “We are incredibly proud to be recognised as a global sustainability leader by S&P Global. This achievement reflects our deep commitment to building a sustainable future for all our stakeholders. As the only automobile company in the Top 1% of the Sustainability Yearbook, we are setting a new benchmark for the industry and demonstrating that sustainable practices are integral to long-term success.”

Mahindra’s placing in the S&P Global CSA rankings follows the company’s placing as a ‘World Leader’ in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index last month. It also builds on the recognition it earned in last year’s S&P Global CSA rankings where it scored 82 points.

Mahindra’s exceptional performance is particularly notable in key governance areas. The company chalked up a perfect 100 percentile score in Business Ethics, Risk & Crisis Management, and Transparency & Reporting. The company also demonstrated strong environmental stewardship, earning top scores in Environmental Policy & Management and Waste & Pollutant Management. Furthermore, M&M excelled in social responsibility, achieving high scores in Customer Relations, Human Rights, and Human Capital Management.

Mahindra’s commitment to sustainability is embedded in its core values and business strategy. The company continues to invest in innovative technologies, sustainable manufacturing processes, and community development initiatives to minimize its environmental impact and create positive social change.",,N,,2025-03-07 08:18:36.863215

The strength of the quarterly profit surprised Wall Street, but sales were just below expectations and uncertainty about both the American consumer and new tariffs seeped into the company's outlook for 2025.

Shares dipped 1% in morning trading Thursday.

Macy's joins other retailers including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Abercrombie & Fitch that have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025.

The imposition of new tariffs this week by President Donald Trump against America’s three biggest trading partners resulted in immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China, while roiling financial markets. Tariffs risk reigniting inflation, which in recent weeks appears to have begun to tick higher.

The U.S. slapped 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. It also doubled the tariff Trump announced last month on Chinese products, to 20%.

Possibly raising anxiety further, certain aspects of U.S. trade policy appears to be fluid, making it more difficult for businesses and households to plan ahead. On Wednesday, Trump reversed course and granted a one-month exemption on his new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers.

Macy's executives emphasized that the company is facing lots of uncertainty given the ever-changing tariff policies. But the company is focusing on what it can control and zeroing in on improving its merchandise and services. Company executives told analysts on the earnings call Thursday that Macy's has been working with its suppliers to increase variety and reduce redundant styles, while adding more exclusive offerings. It's also focusing on improving its store label brands.

“We are in that retail therapy business, a place of escapism, an opportunity to get away from all of the political noise that happens every day,” Macy's CEO Tony Spring said. ""And we have to lean into that. And so, I don’t think the consumer is going to feel a sense of relief in the short term. I’m not an economist, I can’t tell you how long it’ll go on. I challenge our teams every day to think about what do we control?""

The uncertainty comes as retailers like Macy's were already dealing with cautious consumer spending though sales at the department store have been improving.

Macy's, which also runs Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, reported net income of $342 million, or $1.21 per share, for the three-month period ended Feb. 1. Adjusted per-share earnings per were $1.80, exceeding analyst expectations of $1.54 per share, according to FactSet, and reversing a $128 million loss last year.

Sales fell 4.3% to $7.77 billion from $8.12 billion in the year-ago period.

Comparable sales at the overall company— established business from physical stores and online channels — rose 0.2%. At Macy's nameplate stores, comparable store sales dipped 1.9%.

Macy's has been on a campaign to modernize stores, and that appears to be working. At the first 50 stores that have been upgraded, comparable sales rose 1.2%. Those initiatives — which include offering more service in shoe departments and more visual displays— have been added to another 75 stores.

Macy's other brands continue to excel, with comparable sales growth at Bloomingdale’s hitting 6.5%, while Bluemercury reported its 16th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth, the latest at of 6.2%.

Macy's expects to earn $2.05 to $2.25 per share on net revenue of $21 billion to $21.4 billion in the current year. Analysts expect a profit of $2.29 per share on sales of $21.34 billion.",,N,,2025-03-07 08:16:01.381412

The event highlighted both promising and challenging aspects of integrating LLMs into financial analysis, with insights into stock performance linked to executive communication styles.

Key Takeaways

Executives who are proactive and on-topic can generate 247 basis points of alpha annually, while reactive and off-topic counterparts face negative 256 basis points.

The analysis covered the Russell 3000 index, using data from January 2008 to September 2024.

Proactive communication is linked to reduced speculative uncertainty and higher valuation multiples.

LLMs are becoming more integrated into investment workflows, though adoption is still in early stages.

A coding notebook was provided to replicate the research and analysis.

Financial Results

Proactive and on-topic managers generate 247 basis points of alpha per year, while reactive and off-topic managers see negative 256 basis points.

Russell 3000 long side generates 190 basis points of alpha with a 61% hit rate; Russell 2000 generates 200 basis points with a 62% hit rate.

Long short strategies yield 390 basis points for Russell 3000 and 450 basis points for Russell 2000, both with a 63% hit rate.

Operational Updates

S&P Global Market Intelligence uses machine-readable transcripts from January 2008 to September 2024, focusing on the Russell 3000 index.

Questions and answers from earnings calls are summarized using Snowflake’s Cortex LLM summarization function.

LLM embeddings vectorize text to maintain semantic meaning, and cosine similarity scores determine on-topic responses.

Portfolios are ranked monthly, with top 20% companies held long and bottom 20% shorted.

Future Outlook

Proactive executives signal strong risk management and operational strength, reducing speculative uncertainty.

Transparent firms with competitive advantages are more likely to communicate clearly and directly.

LLMs are expected to become more integrated into investment management workflows, although still in early adoption stages.

Q&A Highlights

Sector variations are controlled by ensuring equal representation in long and short portfolios.

Cosine scores are used to assess whether responses are on or off-topic, rather than binary assessments.

LLM challenges include structuring input data and fine-tuning for accuracy.

Evasive behavior in executives is a negative indicator for future performance.

Readers are invited to refer to the full transcript for a comprehensive understanding of the methodology and findings.

With that now out of the way, we’re ready to dive in. We have an all star lineup joining us today. Liam Hynes, our Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research will be walking through the team’s work. Henry Chang, Quant Analyst is going to walk us through the code for this research. And Ronan Feldman, Founder of Pronto NLP, which is now an S and P Global Market Intelligence Company, will discuss how Pronto and this research come together.

Liam, take us away.

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Great. Thank you, Dan. Okay. We’re going to jump right into it. There’s a lot of content to cover today.

So first of all, we’re going to start off with a little bit of a history lesson. On 10/16/2001, Enron held their third quarter two thousand and one earnings call. On the Q and A section of that call, one of the questions asked, how confident can we be that these will be the last write offs? Kenneth Lay, Enron’s CEO responded, if we thought we had any other impaired assets, they would be on this list today. But we do still have at least three areas of uncertainty in the company, which you’re aware of.

Of course, one’s California, we’ve got India, and then of course, finally, broadband. Was Kenneth Lay reactive or proactive on this write off topic in his pre prepared remarks? When analysts posed questions on write offs, there were six questions on write offs

Henry Chang, Quant Analyst, S and P Global Market Intelligence: from analysts and

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: write offs were not mentioned once in the pre prepared remarks. That meant that Kenneth Lay was being reactive rather than proactive on the write off topic. Did Kenneth remain on topic to the analyst question? No, he did not. California, India and broadband do not equal write offs.

Kenneth Lay was pivoting and totally off topic to the question asked. I think folks probably know the rest of the story. Enron collapsed in December 2001, wiping around $74,000,000,000 off its shareholder value, costing thousands of employees their jobs and retirement savings. Lay was actually indicted in 02/2004 on charges including fraud and conspiracy, and in May 2006, he was convicted on multiple counts. This exchange with the analyst was actually evidence in the case the Department of Justice brought against Lay, as prosecutors argue that Lay’s statement was intentionally misleading as he failed to disclose Enron’s true financial troubles.

So that gives us a nice segue into some of the hypothesis that we want to test. The first hypothesis is, do firms that remain on topic when answering questions during earnings call Q and A have superior stock performance compared to those that pivot to adjacent or unrelated topics. And the second, firms that proactively address key issues in their pre prepared remarks before analysts ask about them in earnings call Q and A have superior stock performance compared to those that were stopped responding reactively. So what we’re going to look at today, the data set that we’re looking at and this analysis was stood up on top of is S and P market intelligence machine readable transcripts. The time period we’re looking at is Jan two thousand and eight to September 2004, and we’re looking at the WOSN 3,000.

Okay. So let’s have a look at an example here. The first thing we need to do is identify the question and answer pairs in the earnings call and process them. In this example, we show Caterpillar’s second quarter twenty twenty four earnings call and a question around adjusted margin on lower sales. What we do is we push this question to Snowflake’s Cortex LLM summarization function.

And what that does is it gives us a summarized question, given to that 2023 performance, should margins be adjusted on lower sales and is this due to pricing? Okay, well, why do we do that? Well, summarization does four things. It does noise reduction, it improves semantic matching, there is a standardization and comparability And then lastly, there is some computational efficiency to be gained by doing that. So let’s look at the question and answer pairs, what we actually do here.

So first of all, we start off with the original question and answer in their long form. Then we summarize those questions and answers. And then what we do is we use large language model embeddings. We vector embed the text. So the LLM vector embeddings represents text as a numerical vector.

What this does is it preserves the semantic meaning for efficient processing downstream. And by vector embedding the text, we can now identify whether the answer to the question is on or off topic by calculating the cosine similarity score between the question and answer vectors. So a high cosine score indicates that the answer is using concepts and language similar to the question, I. E. It’s on topic, and a low cosine score equates to the answer being off topic.

We do this for every question and answer pair in the earnings call, and then we get an average cosine score for the entire call. So what we do downstream once we’ve done this feature generation? So we want to see if on topic executives outperform their off topic peers. We’ve just run through the feature engineering. Next, what we’ll do is we’ll form portfolios.

So what we do is by taking the average cosine score, we resample it to the end of the month, we rank the companies in each sector and then what we do is we go along the top 20% of companies with a high Cosan score and remember that’s a high on topics score and then we short the companies with a low Cosan score on companies who are off topic. We then look at the 114 returns, which we have FAMA adjusted for FAMA French adjusted for market value size and momentum. And then we’ve also adjusted the forward returns for some natural language processing signals, sentiment, language complexity and numeric transparency. So here are the results for the Russell baskets. So, you can see here on the long side, the Russell three thousand generates statistically significant alpha of 190 basis points and that’s with a hit rate of 61% and the smaller cap Russell two thousand generates 200 basis points with a hit rate of 62.

On the long short side, the Russell three thousand generates three ninety basis points of alpha with a 63% hit rate and the Russell two generates four fifty basis points, again with a very strong hit rate of 63%. So pure alpha signal from identifying on or off topic executives on an earnings call. So now we’re going to move on how we calculated the proactive and reactive score. For this, we used prompt engineering, for an LLM to pretend it was an executive on an earnings call and to answer the questions. So the context that we gave the executive, the LLM executive to answer the analyst question was just the pre prepared remarks and any proceeding answers to the previous question.

So for example, if there were 20 questions on the call, for the twentieth question, we gave the LLM executive the pre prepared remarks plus the answers to the preceding 19 questions for it to answer. And then we do the exact same process as we did previously. We take those features and we form the portfolios going long, the top 20 of pro active companies, shorting the bottom 20% of reactive companies. And we see the alpha results here. So again, long short portfolio, on the long side, there was a three generates statistically significant alpha of 74 basis points, hit rate of 53%.

And the smaller cap Russell II generates just under 100 basis points there, 96 basis points with a hit rate of 61%. And on the long short side, the Russell three, one hundred and seventy three basis points, 55% hit rate and then the smaller Cap Russel two, small alpha there, two forty basis points with a hit rate of 57%. So again, a pure alpha signal from just identifying proactive and reactive executives on an earnings call. So just going to jump into now a couple of examples, going back to the Caterpillar example. One of the questions from the earnings call was backlog increased by $300,000,000 Was this due to pricing or an increase in order volumes?

Well, higher sales and order volumes were actually covered in the prepared remarks by Andrew Bonfield, the CFO. And when we posed that question to the LLM executive, the answer was the backlog increase was due to a mix of higher prices and increased order volumes resulting from new orders and a dealer inventory changes. That came out with a Cosent score of 0.89, putting it in the 80 percentile and this indicated that the executive was being proactive. So what was the actual original executive answer? The original executive answer was price had significant impact while volumes fluctuate quarter by quarter, backlog remains healthy.

And how did that executive score? Eighty second percentile and the executive was answering the question and on topic. So we look at how did Caterpillar perform two weeks post that earnings call when the S and P 500 was down 2.16% and Caterpillar actually outperformed, it returned seven point three percent two weeks post the call, so a 9% active return of the S and P 500. Onto another example, this is taking a question from Golden Ocean Group’s first quarter twenty twenty three earnings call. So the question was, could you talk about the FFA markets as Capes large vessels are in backwardation and smaller vessels are in contango?

Well, FFA markets was not covered in the pre prepared remarks by the executive. The L and M answer was the FFA market croissant score, tenth percentile, so the executive was being reactive, I. E, this topic was not covered in the prepared remarks and the executive was reacting to the analyst’s question. How did the executive actually answer the question? Our comments are more in the longer term perspective, so I won’t be able to comment specifically on the FFA curve.

I would say that that’s not even going off topic. I think that’s changing the topic or just bluntly not even answering the topic. Cosan score is 0.69, fifteenth percentile. Executive is clearly answering off topic. What happened to Golden Ocean Group’s share price?

Two weeks post the call, the S and P 500 was up 1% and Golden Ocean Group dropped seventeen point three percent two weeks post the call. Okay. So we’ve identified two alpha producing signals. One is, a proactiveness and the second is on topicness. But what what happens if we create four communication styles from those two signals?

So the first one we looked at is a proactive and on topic manager. So this is an executive that is giving the analysts everything that they want to know in the prepared remarks. And when the analyst ask a question, the executives remaining on topic to the question asked. The second is proactive and off topic. So proactive in the prepared remarks but answers the question off topic.

The third is reactive and on topic. So even though they didn’t cover the topics in the pre prepared remarks, when analysts do ask about those topics in the Q and A, executives remain on topic to the question asked. And then you’ve got the entire flip side, you’ve got reactive and off topic. So these are executives where they haven’t given everything that the analysts are looking for in the prepared remarks. And when those analysts go looking for that information with their questions, the executives go off topic.

And the performance is quite telling. So you can see here the blue line, the proactive and on topic executives significantly outperformed their reactive and off topic peers. This is a backtest that was done over the past sixteen years on the Russell three thousand. So proactive and on topic managers generate two forty seven basis points of alpha per year. And the flip side, their reactive and off topic counterparts generate negative two fifty six basis points of alpha year.

So that’s a differential of five zero six basis points on the long short side from those two communication styles. So what we’re looking at here is a table of those returns. So the top left quadrant that you can see here is a proactive and on topic manager and the bottom right quadrant is a reactive and off topic manager. Essentially, what we did is we did a dependent sort on proactiveness. So we looked at the proactive cosine score, we put that into three buckets, into three tertiles.

And then within each of those tertiles, we tertiled it on the on topic score. And what that does is it gives you nine distinct portfolios. And what you’re looking at here is the return of those portfolios, the T stat in the brackets and the hit rate percentage below that. So firms with the most on topic and proactive executives outperform those with the most off topic and reactive executives by more than 5% per year. The spread of on versus off topic is larger when executives are reactive and the spread of proactive versus reactive is larger when executives are off topic.

But an interesting exercise to do is to rebase the returns in the table. So if I’m looking at the top left proactive and on topic quadrant here, I can see that 100%. That represents the maximum return that you can get from this strategy. On the bottom right, the 0% there that you can see represents the zero return that you can get from this. So the interesting thing is that it is the combination of the two evasive behaviors, both reactiveness and off topic alignment that signals underperformance.

So managers are significantly penalized if they’re both reactive and coupled with off topic. It makes sense, right, they haven’t covered some key topics in the prepared remarks that analysts are looking for. And then when analysts actually go and try and find information from the executive on those topics, they’re avoiding the question, going off topic and potentially being evasive.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Hey, Liam, fantastic. So far, we’re getting a lot of action through our Q and A widget here. I see a question has just come in. So just to clarify on this analysis, I’m going to rephrase the question a bit here. So what you’re basically saying is that you could be the most off topic executive, but as long as you’re proactive, you can earn $0.75 on the dollar and as long as you’re on topic, even if you’re the most reactive, you can earn $0.69 on the dollar.

Is that the way to understand this?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, that’s exactly right, Dan. Yes, so you can be entirely you can be an executive and be entirely off topic, but as long as you are proactive in the presentation, you’re not penalized as much. And the same, you can be an entirely reactive executive on the earnings call, but as long as you’re answering the analyst questions and remaining on topic, you’re not penalized. It’s when both of those characteristics are blended in an executive that they’re really penalized. When they’re both reactive and off topic, there’s significant deterioration to the returns of that company.

Okay, so we’ve kind of run through, we’ve shown empirical results that these two behavior signals are efficacious of forward returns. But why? We’ve kind of experienced the what, but why are they experiencing these returns? Well, when a manager or an executive is in the earnings call and they are answering questions, what does their one year forward gross profit look like? So reactive and off topic managers, about one year from the earnings call, generated around 12% growth in their gross profit.

But proactive and on topic managers have around 2.5 times that growth. They generate 31% growth in their gross profit one year prior to the earnings call. So essentially what that means is that you have executives that are exuding some confidence because they understand their business very well and they can probably understand if there’s any headwinds or any operational inefficiencies in their organization in the coming twelve months. So their non evasiveness breeds transparency, they’re willing to answer every question and remain on topic and they’re not evading or hiding anything from the audience.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: We’ve got another good inbound here, Liam. A question, did you look at whether there was any multiple expansion within the company? So just sort of dovetailing on what you were saying there, it looks like firms can either appreciate and value via stock price through multiple expansion or through improving actuals. And so you’re showing improving actuals here, which argues that there’s real improvement in the firm. How about perception wise?

Did we see any growth in the multiple that the stock trades on for the proactive and on topic firms?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, there was some slight growth in that. The main effect on the multiples basically came from the actual next slide I have, but essentially proactively addressing key issues reduces speculative uncertainty, so it actually leads to a lower risk premium. So the more transparent you are, the potentially the lower the risk premium you have. And what that can do is it results in in a higher valuation multiple as investors pricing stability and there’s some predictability around the future earnings growth. So very well timed question there from the audience.

Thank you. And then the other economic rationale that we have is strategic foresight and competitive positioning, right? So firms that proactively address investor concerns, they demonstrate strong risk management and strategic foresight. And what that does is it signals operational strength. Confident firms with durable competitive advantages are more likely to engage in clear direct communication and then firms in weaker positions may avoid key topics signaling underlying vulnerabilities.

So like I mentioned on the previous slide with the gross profit growth, if you’re an executive and you know that your twelve year outlook isn’t that strong, it puts that executive in a weaker position and they avoid key topics and they may try to avoid difficult or hard questions from analysts. I’m going to hand it over to Henry Chang. Henry is going to run through a little bit of a coding tutorial on how we took the machine readable transcripts and pointed it to the LLM API and came up with these two scores, the proactive score and the on topic score. I’ll hand it over to you, Henry, there if you want to share your screen.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: And while Henry is pulling that up, I’ll just let the audience know as when Henry shares his screen, the media player should get larger within the webinar console. So the slides will still be visible on one side, but the demo is going to occur in the media player and that should resize automatically for you. As a reminder, everything in the webinar console is resizable, movable. So if you need to adjust, now is a good time to do that. Go ahead, Henry.

Henry Chang, Quant Analyst, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Thanks, Sam. Thanks, Liam. So in my part, I’ll be covering how to actually start from the transcript and divide those two signals that Liam just mentioned. So for the purpose of today’s demo, I’m pulling up Caterpillar’s Q2 twenty twenty three earnings call transcript in a PDF format, but keep in mind that on the back end, we have 196,000 transcript in machine readable format to be processed systematically. So let’s have a look at this transcript.

So in the transcript, you can have a look at all the participants. So there are two CEOs that attend this earnings call and there are also analysts from investment banks that jump onto this earnings call and ask the questions. So there are two sections in an earnings call. First, they start with the presentation. So this is when the CEO and the CFO jump onto the call, tell everyone how much money they’ve made in that quarter and they also talk about other things like risks, outlook and basically provide details of the finance of that company.

And then there’s a second section which is the Q and A. So this is a section where the investment banking analysts, they jump onto the call, they heard all of the questions they heard of the pre prepared remarks that the executive just gave and they asked questions around those topics. So you can see here that these are different analysts and here the executive takes turns to answer those questions. The demo that Liam just gave in the case study was this question that came from Temi Zakaria. She is an equity researcher from JP Morgan and her question was on the backlog.

So backlog increased by RMB300 million and she was asking if that’s purely driven by pricing or an increase in the order volume. So now I’m jumping on to Snowflake and show you how we process this systematically on the back end. So let me pull up the same transcript. It’s the second quarter twenty twenty three and the company is Caterpillar. So in here you can see this transcript.

We are starting from the Q and A pairing table. So essentially what it says is that we have everything up from the very first question, which is normally just greetings, paired to the answers. So we have all the question and answers pair running from the first to the end. And on average, we have about 20 to 30 of these Q and A pairs in an earnings call transcript. On the back end, we paired all of these together so that we can process them, we can do all the vector embedding, the cosine similarity calculation that VM just mentioned and here I’m going to show you how powerful it is our machine readable transcript product is.

So it gives you the details of the transcript. So basic information like the call date, so this earnings call was conducted on the 08/01/2023. It’s the second quarter of twenty twenty three and you can also see the headlines. So these are all just basic information of the earnings call, right? Nothing too surprising.

But here I’m going to show you how that really the part that how amazing our machine readable transcript is. It’s about how we can link each of the questions to the person that’s asking the question. So we actually have our professionals dataset that allows you to map each of the components from the transcript to the person that’s asking a question. So here you can see that Temi Zakaria was on here and you can see her question pro ID. So this allows you to map this person to the estimates.

So it’s a very powerful tool that allows you to map the questions to the estimates so you will be able to analyze things like whether in an earnings call, if an executive is only picking is picking more bearish than bullish analysts who ask the questions or stuff like mapping this to the estimates and allows you to sort of predict sort of the outcome of the company. And then you can also do that for on the answer side. So you’ll be able to map that to the person who is answering that question by the pro ID. So you know that some of them are coming from the CFO and some of them are coming from the CEOs and this allows you to analyze the language that each of the person is using in answering these questions. So it opens up tons of NLP analysis work that you can do to the transcript.

So jumping back to our signals, what we did was that we vector embed both the questions and the answers and then we can calculate the coherence similarity between them. That’s for the first signal, the on topic signal. And we also have the second signal, which is the proactive and the reactive signal and that will have to generate the LMM response. And here is the prompt that generates all that. So as Liam mentioned, the prompt first started with pretend to be a top executive, please answer these questions that came from analysts and then we provided with 60% of the pre prepared remarks that the executive gave and then we asked the same question that the analyst asked.

So now let’s take the example of that question that came from Temi Zakaria. It’s a twenty fourth question in the component order, so let’s select that and we can also have to answer that corresponding to that question. So what’s happening on the back end is that the prompt I just showed you, we are giving that to an LMM and the LMM is generating the LMM response on the fly. So here you can see that this was the question. It was on the 300,000,000 increase in backlog and here’s the executive answer that we just saw in the PDF and now this is the LM answer.

So as Diya mentioned, we also summarized all three of them for consistency and for standardization. Here is the summary of the question. So indeed, it was talking about 300,000,000 increase. Here’s the answer. The executive answered that increase was used to both the both pricing and the volume.

The LMM answered similarly. It’s about pricing and the volume. So from here, you can vector in-depth both the question and the answers and here are your signal scores. With that, I’m going to hand back to Dan and he’s going to introduce Roman from Pronto.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Thank you so much, Henry and Liam. That was a fantastic deep dive into how we construct these signals. To quickly recap, we built these signals using machine readable transcripts using an off the shelf large language model. The pre calculated signals for this research are now an integrated part of Pronto NLP, providing actionable insights to investors. Pronto NLP also includes many other signals, including those generated with a fine tuned, purpose built large language model designed specifically for financial applications.

And what we’d like to do now is to help us understand the ProntoNLP approach and how this enhancement aids in the generation of the signals. We are going to turn it over to Ronan Feldman to discuss a little more about Pronto. Ronan, over to you.

Ronan Feldman, Founder, Pronto NLP, S and P Global Market Intelligence Company: Thank you, Dan. Basically, what you see here is we take an earning call, we break it into its sections, like the presentation part and obviously the Q and A pairs. And then we break it further into sentences. And if the sentences are complex, we break it even into multiple phrases. For each phrase, we identify the sentiment that we have for that phrase, positive, negative and neutral.

Then we also identify the importance, how important is that particular phrase within the context of the whole section. So we have high, medium and low in terms of the importance. We can use it when we calculate scores in the signals, we can use the importance in order to provide weights. Then we also have an explanation. The explanation is extremely important because it’s like a guardrail to make sure that there are no hallucinations.

We look at the explanation and we see if it really correlates to the actual text. We look at the numbers that are in the explanation to see if they appear inside the text. If we see that there is no connection between the explanation and the actual text, we actually run it again. So that minimizes the chances of any hallucinations that we may get from the LLM. One of the nice things that we get from the LLM is that events are generated automatically.

There is no predefined taxonomy. So unlike a lot of other competing products where you have a predefined defined taxonomy and then where there is a new topic, you do not discover it until you manually change it. We use the LLM to automatically detect new topics. The problem is that there are 2,700,000 topics that were identified by the LLM. That’s way too many for any quantitative signal.

And this is why we use the embeddings of all the instances that the LLM identified and cluster them into 110 events. When you use actually our platform, which is part of the offering, you do get the original LLM tech. So you can actually see it and you can consume it using the API. Let’s go now to an example that actually utilizes the topics that we identify. So you saw previously that we identify all those events.

And you can see that combining all the amazing work that Dan, Liam and Henry did, we combine it with the topics that we identify. And then you can actually find interesting peaks for specific topics that are connected to off topicness, reactiveness, so to see what topic actually are exactly the topics that executives like to avoid. And let’s look at the first one. The first one, if we can see in 2021, we remember the supply chain issues during COVID. And that was a topic that both executives that were off topic, they did not like to discuss.

The next one, we can see is a recession. So this was in 2022. Consider there was a big jump in terms of the negative sentiment related to a recession and that again was the main topic for both executives that wanted to avoid answering the direct questions and when the questions are around recession, usually they try to find some detour. And the last one that we can actually get here is margin, which was in 2023. And again, for all of those executives that were below the score that you can see or the 0.8, we see that there was a big increase in such topics for both executives that try to avoid questions or find any way to go around them things around margin.

So back to

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: you, Dan.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Thank you, Ronan. That was a great deep dive on Pronto NLP and a fantastic webinar so far, folks. We’ve got plenty, plenty of time for Q and A and a lot of questions coming in. So looking forward to that session. Before we jump into the questions, we’ve got a polling question up.

To what extent have you incorporated large language models into your investment management workflows? And we’ll give everyone just a few minutes, a few seconds to fill that out there. Lots of folks at different parts of the journey and lots of considerations to be made before bringing this in. Okay, we’ve got another ten seconds here to fill that out. Again, folks, there’s a Q and A widget in the webinar console and we’ll be shifting questions coming in, in droves here.

That’s great. Keep them coming while you fill out that polling question. All right, let’s take a look at our results. We actively use LLMs only 8.3%, experimenting 25%, exploring 33% and not currently using 33%. So still a very early part of the journey for many folks.

And I think this hopefully will help with getting started on that process. Okay. So let’s jump into some of the questions we’ve received so far. I’ll give the first one over to Liam. A question came in, how do you account for sector specific variations in executive Q and A when constructing your signals?

I think you addressed that, but maybe you could just recap real quick.

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Sure, sure. So I’m going to be on topic here. The best way to do this is probably repeat the question. So how do we control for sector variations in the portfolio construction? What we do is we obviously construct the on topic scores and the proactive scores.

And then what we do is we go into at the end of every month, we go into each sector and then we rank within the sector. So we’ll get the top 20% and the bottom 20% in each sector and then we combine those 11 secondtors, top 20% and bottom 20%. And what that ensures is that there’s an equal representation of sectors in the long portfolio and in the short portfolio.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Fantastic. So sector neutral, equal representation in long and short. So we don’t have a sector tilt in any of those. Here’s another one. I really like this question.

The the ask the LLM, is this question on topic, was it addressed in the prepared remarks?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Do you want me to take that one, Dan? Sure. Yes. Well, there’s a few reasons why we didn’t do that. One is that it’s probably too subjective for the LLM, so and also it would be a binary outcome for the LLM to determine whether or not the answer was on topic or not.

So it would either say that the question was on topic or was off topic. So it would be a binary assessment and it’s not a continuous quant assessment like the cosine score. So, the LLM doesn’t necessarily do this well. So if you go back to the Golden Ocean answer, technically the LLM might have said that that was on topic, right, because the executive mentioned the FFA curve, but quantitatively, it was off topic. And, you know, we’ve obviously published this research.

It’s along with a coding notebook and there’s a rag engine that we stood up on the back end for this and there’s a couple of reasons why we went down that route. We need consistency in responses from the LLM. Technically, you could ask the LLM, is this question on or off topic? And then you could ask the LLM the same question again and it might give you a different answer. So something where you’re relying on the LLM to be very subjective gives you very inconsistent results.

So I could run it back just today and tomorrow if I ask the LLM again, I might get varying results altogether. And so the way we did it this way is we ring fenced the LLM to generate a very refined feature and then we pipe that feature into our backtesting framework.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, that’s a very comprehensive answer. So yes, so quantification to your point, you sort of quantify it as opposed to just labeling it with a binary label. And then, if cosine score goes from zero to one or minus one to one depending on whether your vectors are all positive or not,

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: it’s

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: certainly one might think arbitrarily that off topic is less than 0.5 or something. But I think you were finding that most of the off topic answers were zero it’s really like about a 0.8 threshold that kind of divided the universal on the medians. Is that right?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, that’s correct. And actually, we have a slide in the appendix, I just put it up on the screen there, that might kind of help answer this subjective question, right? So we did a bit of an experiment where

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: we

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: asked an LLM to look at the Q and A of an earnings call and we gave it two prompts. The first prompt said, you are a financial expert and then asked to score the Q and A section from very negative to very positive on a scale of minus two to plus two, so five increments. And then the second prompt, we just did not include a financial expert. We just said score the Q and A on a very negative minus two to a very positive plus two. And you can see here in the chart that the financial expert prompt came out with a mean of one.

And then when we excluded the financial expert from the prompt, it actually came out closer to minus one. So very small changes and the LN can be very subjective. So you don’t get these consistency in responses when you ask the LOM a very kind of broad based question.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Makes sense. So the vectorization and the cosine score is all very consistent and well controlled, whereas the LOM responses has more variability. This actually dovetails with another question we’ve got and maybe Ronan, you could jump in on this one as a generic question. What are the biggest challenges in applying LLMs in the financial markets and how do you address those in both this research and Pronto NLP?

Ronan Feldman, Founder, Pronto NLP, S and P Global Market Intelligence Company: So I think one of the main issues is first you need to structure the input in the right way. In this case, we did it for earning calls. We actually do it for any kind of financial content like filings and then you need to accommodate for a lot of things that you need to filter. So just the pre processing until you get really clean text that is structured in the right way is very important. The other thing is I want to go back to the point that Dan mentioned before.

We actually do heavy fine tuning to the Lama models in order to get to a really good financial LLM. So we use over 10,000 tagged paragraphs using a bootstrapping approach, the classic teacher student framework. And we saw that that alone, if you do it in the right way, gave a huge boost in terms of the alpha that you get out of the signal.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Maybe Liam, coming back to you, we’ve got a few questions here around comparing this approach to traditional sentiment analysis, Did you control for the sentiment of the call when you were calculating your returns and what other sort of considerations might have been made?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes, let me just push it to the slide with the backtest results. Yes, so you can see here on the third bucket there on the backtesting when we computed the portfolio returns, we looked at the one month forward returns. We did actually control for sentiment in the 114 returns. So what we did is we stripped out the Fama French for residuals, but then we actually looked at natural language processing signals. So sentiment being net positivity.

So we looked at the Lachlan McDonald dictionary that was published, I think, in 2010, and we looked at all the positive words from that dictionary in the call, all the negative words, and you can look at a ratio of the net positivity. So we actually stripped that positive sentiment out of the signal. So it’s a pure alpha signal. It doesn’t have that sentiment variable embedded into

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: it. Got it. So these and how about correlation wise? Do you see any major correlation between earnings call sentiment and these other signals?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: No, actually. We did some time on Macbeth, a regression on it and it actually came out very, very strong. So the on topic score has got about 80 basis points of a coefficient with a very strong T stat of around 3.5 and that’s after we controlled for seven or eight fundamental factors and three or four sentiment factors. So no, it seems to be kind of a unique on topic and proactive signal that we’re after finding here. It’s not correlated to sentiment, which makes sense really when you think about it, right?

Because sentiment is looking at whether or not the executive was speaking positively or negatively, right? But theoretically, I could be answering a question on or off topic and still have a positive or negative angle on it. So I could be answering a question off topic, but be very positive about how I was answering it off topic, right? So it is an accretive signal to sentiment. The way I like to think about it is, this is more of a behavioral signal rather than a sentiment signal, right?

We’re identifying behavioral characteristics of the manager on the call and the behavior is how do they answer the question? Are they on topic or off topic? And then what’s their presentation like? Are they proactive and reactive? So I would say it’s mutually exclusive to this sentiment.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Henry, this next question I think is for you here. Can you talk a little bit about the large language model that was used? You mentioned LAMA, which LAMA model was used? And how much of the proactive on topic signal is using the original transcript product, how much is part of Pronto NLP?

Henry Chang, Quant Analyst, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Absolutely. So we use the LAMA 3.18 b model. And the reason that we use this model is because at that time, we were looking for an LMM that has large enough context length. That is a big thing for us. Because if you think about it, an average earnings call transcript has about 10,000 tokens in its prepared remarks and another 10,000 tokens in its answer.

So we need to find a model that’s large enough to fit all of these texts in. GBT 3.5 was an option at that time but then due to the context length constraint, we have to go with LAMA. And in terms of whether this is built on top of Pronto, at that time, this was purely done on machine readable transcript But then after we get those results, we can combine this signal with Pronto, which is another value add and strengthened result that we have.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Excellent. Thank you. Liam, coming back to you. On these signals, could an executive deliberately go off topic to avoid discussing bad news? And how often do we see executives going off topic during earnings

Ronan Feldman, Founder, Pronto NLP, S and P Global Market Intelligence Company: calls?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Good question. So could an executive purposely go off topic to avoid answering questions, is that what you asked?

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Sure. And I think it’s just a clarifying sort of question as to what you’re trying to

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: capture. Right. Yes. We’re essentially trying to capture evasiveness, right, or the executive not wanting to cover a particular topic. So that’s what we’re trying to capture when we’re looking at the on topic and off topic from the executive.

And it seems to be systematically when you look across the Russell three thousand, it is efficacious and it is quite a strong signal. So executives, when if they just exhibit that one characteristic of just not being able to answer the question and remain on topic, it’s a very poor sign for forward results. And when you think about it, there’s two reasons why you might have an executive who goes off topic, right? One is that they just might have the competency to answer the question or they might know. And the second one is that they’re purposely pivoting or going off topic.

Both of those reasons are bad, right? One is evasiveness, which is not good news and the other one is the executive potentially doesn’t understand the question or the business model or the operations associated with it. I’m sorry, Dan, what was the second question, Russ?

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: How often do executives go off topic? I think you had a slide towards the end there on the number of off topic and reactive questions and I think there was an absolute sort of number. Do you have a sense of what

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Yes. So actually, this is quite interesting actually. So if we look at a cosine score threshold of about 0.8 both on the proactive score and the off topic score, you can see here that it kind of hovers around, let’s say, 28% or 30% of executives who are reactive and off topic. So it’s quite a sizable chunk, maybe anywhere between a quarter to just under a third. And actually, if you look at this chart, you can actually see that there’s some spikes here in the fourth quarter, right?

And the reason we think that there might be some spikes in the fourth quarter is that the fourth quarter earnings call is normally going to be centered around the full year results. So when executives are delivering their prepared remarks, it’s mainly going to be centered around financials and there might be a lot of room for the topics in there. Hence, you get this spike in reactiveness in the fourth quarter because they’re discussing full year results. And also, you see that in them being off topic as well in the fourth quarter. And that’s potentially because they might be focusing on the financial results or they might be prioritizing other components in the earnings call.

So they have less room for spontaneous discussion.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Fantastic. Maybe one more question. We’ve got about five minutes left and all three of you maybe can weigh in. How should those that are interested in adopting large language modeling in their process and generative AI in general think about the approach, how should we get started?

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Well, there’s one way you can get started. We actually published, let me jump on to the so if you scan this QR code, you’ll be able to get access to the paper every row, but in this paper, we also have a coding notebook and that is a very comprehensive thousands of lines of code in there in order to stand our readers up on machine readable transcripts, generating the data frame, getting those Q and A pairs, vector embedding the text, doing the cosine similarity scores, the whole shebang. Everything that we’ve covered in the presentation today and on the research is, you can see that in the coding notebook. If you click a link on the PDF, it will bring you to a non compute coding notebook where you can view all of our code, so fully transparent. That’s one way that you could successfully stand up some LLM integration onto your textual data suite.

Dan Samberg, Moderator, Head of Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Okay. This has been a fantastic discussion and I want to thank all of our speakers, Liam, Henry, Ronan for sharing your expertise today. For those who want to revisit today’s session, a webinar replay will be available. You can also check out the related content widget, which should have links to the white paper, the coding notebook additional resources. On behalf of S and P Global Market Intelligence, thank you very much for joining us.

We look forward to continuing this conversation. Have a great day ahead, folks.

Liam Hynes, Global Head of New Product Development for Quant Research, S and P Global Market Intelligence: Thanks, Dan. Thanks, folks.

Ronan Feldman, Founder, Pronto NLP, S and P Global Market Intelligence Company: Yes. Thanks, Dan. That was wonderful.

As of this week, a selection of ""less popular"" beverages, including several Frappuccino blended beverages, will be removed from the menu.
A full list of Starbucks beverages being cut can be found below.
The Royal Breakfast Latte, White Hot Chocolate and several Frappuccino blended beverages are among the beverages set to be cut.
Starbucks lays off 1,100 corporate workers In addition to menu and policy changes, Starbucks revealed last week it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees.","Oregonians will have to say goodbye to some ""less popular beverages"" on Starbucks' menu, as the company retires them this week.

In an effort to boost sales and prioritize customers, new CEO Brian Niccol has made changes he says will help the Seattle-based coffee chain get ""back to Starbucks.""

Under Niccol's leadership, Starbucks has reversed its open-door policy, unveiled new and returning coffeehouse amenities, in addition the menu overhaul and corporate layoffs.

Starbucks has said it would begin to ""optimize"" menu offerings, resulting in a 30% reduction in both beverage and food items by the end of the fiscal year.

As of this week, a selection of ""less popular"" beverages, including several Frappuccino blended beverages, will be removed from the menu. A full list of Starbucks beverages being cut can be found below.

""We’re simplifying our menu to focus on fewer, more popular items, executed with excellence. This will make way for innovation, help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company,"" Starbucks said in a statement.

How many Starbucks locations are in Oregon?

Oregon has around 400 Starbucks locations. To find a store near you, visit the Starbucks store locator at starbucks.com/store-locator.

See list: Starbucks cuts Frappuccinos, other 'less popular' beverages

The drinks were cut for one of three reasons: either they weren't commonly purchased, complex to make, or were similar to other beverages on the menu.

The Royal Breakfast Latte, White Hot Chocolate and several Frappuccino blended beverages are among the beverages set to be cut.

Here's the full list, according to Starbucks spokesperson Erin Stan:

Espresso Frappuccino

Caffe Vanilla Frappuccino

Java Chip Frappuccino

White Chocolate Mocha Frappuccino

Chai Creme Frappuccino

Caramel Ribbon Crunch Creme Frappuccino

Double Chocolaty Chip Creme Frappuccino

Chocolate Cookie Crumble Creme Frappuccino

White Chocolate Creme Frappuccino

White Hot Chocolate

Royal English Breakfast Latte

Iced Matcha Lemonade

Honey Almondmilk Flat White

New and returning items coming soon to Starbucks

While some drinks face an imminent retirement, Starbucks has plans to bring back ""beloved"" Lavender beverages and will also introduce a new Iced Cherry Chai and Jalapeño Chicken Pocket in the spring.

Starbucks lays off 1,100 corporate workers

In addition to menu and policy changes, Starbucks revealed last week it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees.

The announcement, summarized in a press release, came a month after senior leaders began ""evaluating the role, structure and size of"" its global corporate divisions.

The retailer has also made the decision to not fill ""several hundred"" open positions. The move does not apply to baristas and others who work in Starbucks stores themselves.

""I recognize the news is difficult. It is not a decision the leadership team took lightly,"" Niccol said in a statement. ""We understand the real effect this has on partners’ lives and their families. We believe it’s a necessary change to position Starbucks for future success.""

Laid off employees will be offered comprehensive severance packages that may include pay, health care and career transition services, Niccol added.

Ozery Bakery, Vaughan, Ontario, offers Morning Rounds, portable flatbreads in flavors like Blueberry and Apple Cinnamon, as well as Snacking Rounds, which are bite-sized.
“Anything you can just pick up and eat in one bite I feel like is the biggest thing for people right now,” Demi Kontos, commercial strategy and analytics, Kontos Foods.
“Snacking has been a big trend.” Tortillas are well-suited for the snacking and convenience trends, observed Jim Kabbani, chief executive officer of the Tortilla Industry Association (TIA), as many producers already offer smaller sizes for products such as street or mini tacos.
Kontos Foods’ pre-grilled panini breads have been popular with foodservice operators and consumers alike for this reason.","The line between meals and snacks has become increasingly blurred, with many consumers, especially younger ones, replacing traditional meals with frequent snacking throughout the day. Tortilla and flatbread producers are playing into this with snackable products that offer consumers the on-the-go convenience they desire.

“There’s a clear shift toward smaller, snack-sized formats, reflected in products like mini naan dippers, mini soft flour tortilla bowls and street taco-sized tortillas,” observed Julia Mills, food and drink analyst, Mintel.

Ozery Bakery, Vaughan, Ontario, offers Morning Rounds, portable flatbreads in flavors like Blueberry and Apple Cinnamon, as well as Snacking Rounds, which are bite-sized. The rounds are marketed as offering “none of the crust and fuss of sliced bread.”

“[The rounds] can be used for everything from snacks to wraps to breakfast,” said Sabrina Pacitto, marketing manager, Ozery Bakery. “By keeping flavors fresh and exciting, we help make mealtime more interesting, encouraging customers to enjoy our products across various occasions.”

Kontos Foods, Patterson, NJ, recently introduced flatbread minis, 2-inch cocktail flatbreads ideal for kids’ lunches, meal prep or catering events.

“Anything you can just pick up and eat in one bite I feel like is the biggest thing for people right now,” Demi Kontos, commercial strategy and analytics, Kontos Foods. “Snacking has been a big trend.”

Tortillas are well-suited for the snacking and convenience trends, observed Jim Kabbani, chief executive officer of the Tortilla Industry Association (TIA), as many producers already offer smaller sizes for products such as street or mini tacos. Tortilla makers just need to remain nimble and quickly adjust their portfolios and innovation strategy to meet these evolving consumer preferences, he said.

The desire for convenience extends to foodservice as well, where Kontos said operators are looking for flatbread and tortilla products that require little preparation and can help them save on labor. Kontos Foods’ pre-grilled panini breads have been popular with foodservice operators and consumers alike for this reason.

“The grill marks create a great presentation, and operators don't have to do anything to them to achieve that fresh-off-the-grill look,” Kontos explained. “Our breads heat up very easily, so it just saves time, it saves labor, it saves money. That's a product big that's skyrocketed this year.”",,N,,2025-03-07 10:16:34.352921
