In court papers filed Tuesday in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Kroger said Albertsons disregarded the companies’ merger agreement and worked secretly with a partner, C&S Wholesalers, to try to force Kroger to divest more stores to C&S.

Kroger also claimed that Albertsons was secretly planning to sue Kroger if the deal didn’t go through long before the merger actually fell apart in December. Kroger said in Tuesday's court filing that it should not be forced to pay Albertsons a $600 million termination fee as well as billions of dollars in legal fees.

In a statement Tuesday, Albertsons said it was Kroger that failed to honor the merger agreement.

“Kroger’s self-interested conduct doomed the merger, and we are now focused on returning value to Albertsons’ shareholders to compensate for those losses,” Albertsons said.

Kroger and Albertsons first proposed the merger in 2022. They argued that combining would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart and Costco.

But the Federal Trade Commission and two states — Washington and Colorado — sued to block the merger last year, saying it would raise prices and lower workers’ wages by eliminating competition. It also said Kroger and Albertsons' plan to divest 579 stores C&S Wholesalers was inadequate to ensure competition, since C&S was ill-equipped to take on so many stores.

In December, judges in Washington and Oregon halted the merger in two rulings issued within hours of each other.

Kroger said even after lower courts ruled, it believed the merger still had a chance of going through. Kroger said it told Albertsons it was planning to re-engage with the FTC after President Donald Trump's election because it thought the FTC under Trump would be less hostile to mergers.

But instead, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger the day after the lower court rulings. Albertsons said Kroger refused to divest more stores, even as it became clear that regulators weren't satisfied with its plans. Albertsons said Kroger also should have sought other buyers beyond C&S to satisfy regulators' concerns.",https://img.foodmanufacturing.com/files/base/indm/multi/image/2025/03/AP25084614661950.67e411d90e28a.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&rect=0%2C0%2C5385%2C3029&w=1200,N,,2025-03-26 13:05:42.060160

""Kiwis are paying some of the highest prices in the world for groceries and would welcome the sort of competition to the duopoly of Woolworths and Foodstuffs that will bring down prices. Doing that would require Foodstuffs and Woolworths to divest part of their operations to a third, entirely separate player"".

Further, 48% of McValue consumers said the platform is why they chose McDonald’s over a quick-service peer.
Still, most of the McValue customers were already loyal McDonald’s customers before the launch, meaning the platform isn’t generating many new customers.
Ninety-four percent of McValue buyers visited a McDonald’s restaurant prior to the platform launch, while 90% visited a McDonald’s more than three times in the first half of 2024.
According to Placer.ai data, McDonald’s traffic jumped nearly 9% year-over-year during the week after the McValue platform’s launch, Jan. 13.","The McDonald’s McValue platform, launched in early January, intensified an already cutthroat value environment that began in the middle of 2024 when restaurant brands witnessed their traffic numbers declining. Much of that erosion came from low-income consumers, who have continued to pull back on their discretionary spending. This trend has become a major concern at McDonald’s in particular, given that the company over indexes with lower-income consumers.

So, has the McValue strategy worked so far? In some ways, yes. In other ways, meh.

According to a new report from consumer insights company Numerator, the McValue menu is re-engaging low-income, diverse households looking for an affordable meal. Forty-two percent of McValue consumers said they bought the meal because it offered a low-price deal, for instance, while nearly 30% said it provided options at a variety of price points less than $5. That’s a notch in the positive column for the chain.

Further, 48% of McValue consumers said the platform is why they chose McDonald’s over a quick-service peer. Chains they would have visited instead include Burger King (18%), Chick-fil-A (17%), Wendy’s (14%), and Taco Bell (11%).

Still, most of the McValue customers were already loyal McDonald’s customers before the launch, meaning the platform isn’t generating many new customers. Ninety-four percent of McValue buyers visited a McDonald’s restaurant prior to the platform launch, while 90% visited a McDonald’s more than three times in the first half of 2024.

In other words, Numerator indicates that the McValue menu has driven incremental visits to McDonald’s, while the chain’s peers have lost some trips. But most of those customers were lapsed customers rather than new ones.

The good news is Numerator’s research shows that McValue customers are satisfied with the offering — 91% said they will likely buy off the menu again. Despite that satisfaction, many want to see McDonald’s add even more protein and treat options to the platform. Forty-four percent of category buyers want more burger options, while 35% want more chicken sandwich options, 34% want more breakfast sandwich options, 30% want more sweets and treats, and 26% want more beverage options.

The bad news is the total household penetration for McDonald’s value offers peaked at the end of September 2024, prior to the McValue launch, and has steadily declined since, according to Numerator.

On the traffic side, the picture isn’t much rosier. According to Placer.ai data, McDonald’s traffic jumped nearly 9% year-over-year during the week after the McValue platform’s launch, Jan. 13. Since then, however, traffic has been negative year-over-year at the chain, with some weeks down as much as 8% (Feb. 17). Weather was a major factor for the restaurant industry’s slow performance across much of the country during January and February, but Numerator also notes that McDonald’s has pulled media support for its McValue menu, which could also have an impact. The company is expected to report first quarter results in the coming weeks, which will provide a much fuller picture.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltea7aee2fca050a19/blt1c1aa9ea0e9fa739/67e2df38ffbcf7f7e3f80dee/McValue_Burgers.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-03-26 11:04:43.797198

Updated On Mar 26, 2025 at 05:23 PM IST

French tyre major Michelin is seeking continuity in passenger vehicle tyre imports into India till production ramps up at its upcoming Chennai-based plant over the next few years, according to CEO Florent Menegaux. The Clermont-Ferrand-based firm, which reported a revenue of 27.2 billion euro last year, is in talks with the Indian government to extend its import licence for passenger vehicle tyres till the time local production matures in the country.

The company is setting up production capacity for passenger vehicle tyres at its Chennai facility at an investment of Rs 564 crore.

Advt

The plant is expected to commence production later this year with gradual portfolio scale up expected to take place over the next few years.

The local manufacturing would help the company, which has 86 tyre production sites across the globe, to scale up operations in India, which remain subdued with the government introducing import restrictions in 2020.

The tyre maker currently sells only premium bigger size tyres in limited quantity especially for performance-oriented models in India.

In 2020, the government imposed curbs on imports of certain new pneumatic tyres used in motor cars, busses, lorries and motorcycles in a move to promote domestic manufacturing.

Tyre companies can now import only a small number of tyres into the country under a limited import licence, which was not the case before 2020.

Menegaux told PTI here that the company is having extensive discussions with the Indian government to extend import licence.

""We have good relationship with the government, and we are having extensive discussions to extend our licence. We have been granted some licence to import but to grow faster we will need the licence, at least till we have our facility for passenger car ready,"" he stated.

The company has rolled out an investment plan to produce passenger vehicle tyres in the country, but it will take few years till the production touches optimum level, Menegaux stated.

Advt

Michelin already has a facility in Chennai for manufacturing a range of radial truck/bus tyres and defence tyres for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as well as for the replacement market in the country.

The company has invested Rs 2,840 crore on the plant which has an installed production capacity of over 30,000 tonnes per annum.

The facility, which is operational since 2014, caters mainly to Indian market and few export markets.

Besides, Michelin also gets two-wheeler tyres manufactured in the country through a partner.

Menegaux noted that the Indian market has plenty of potential for growth while exhorting the need for a level-playing field for all operators.

""In relationships, I believe in an open world, rules of the games are enforced by countries with a level-playing field. Right now, in India, like many other countries, there is a tendency to look at the world from just the country's (own) perspective,"" Menegaux stated.

""I think this is not adequate. We are citizens of the world, and we should cooperate. I think if we could have more attention towards how do we create a level playing field so that competition can be exercised in proper manner,"" he added.

He noted that India has seen tremendous growth in infrastructure development over the last ten years and the tyre maker sees it an important market globally.

""Like what we have seen in China a few years ago, infrastructure is getting better in India. A lot of investment is taking place in roads and vehicles, etc. So the vehicle parc is expanding,"" he noted.

He further said that Michelin has invested across various segments in India like manufacturing, research and IT services.

""Our core expertise in artificial intelligence comes from India. And so for all of that, India is important to us, and we are making investments,"" Menegaux said.

On a question regarding competition from emerging companies especially from China, Menegaux mentioned that the tyre maker likes competition as it helps it to progress.

""Provided there is acceptable rules of the game, competition strengthens us,"" he added.

""We had one competition from Japan long time back. Then there was one from South Korea and we will have competition from China. We will also have one competitor from India. Maybe you will see one coming from Africa. But that's ok. There is space for everyone as the market grows,"" he stated.

Michelin employs close to 1.3 lakh people globally. The company, which produced around 200 million tyres in 2022, has set a goal of achieving 100 per cent sustainable materials in its tyres by 2050.

The Michelin group aims to become a leader in composite solutions, particularly flexible composites like coated fabrics, films, seals, conveyors, belts, hoses, and inflatable structures.

It operates its composites businesses worldwide under the brands of the Fenner group, which it acquired in 2018.

It took another major step in its development in June 2023, when it acquired the Faitplast, Angeloni, and Orca-Pennel&Flippo brands.

Michelin, as part of a NASA project, plans to leverage its expertise in airless tyres and its knowledge of high-tech materials to design a lunar wheel capable of withstanding extreme temperatures (over 100°C and below -240°C) and solar and galactic radiation.

NASA recently announced that the Moon RACER team, of which Michelin is a member, has been awarded the feasibility study for phase 1 of the ARTEMIS project.

The project, entitled ""Lunar Terrain Vehicle Phase 1 Feasibility Study"", aims to design a lunar vehicle capable of operating in extreme conditions on the moon for 10 years.

Menegaux said the the developments carried out as part of the project will enable Michelin to continue innovating in terrestrial applications.

The company is setting up production capacity for passenger vehicle tyres at its Chennai facility at an investment of Rs 564 crore.
The tyre maker currently sells only premium bigger size tyres in limited quantity especially for performance-oriented models in India.
Tyre companies can now import only a small number of tyres into the country under a limited import licence, which was not the case before 2020.

The Clermont-Ferrand-based firm, which reported a revenue of 27.2 billion euro last year, is in talks with the Indian government to extend its import licence for passenger vehicle tyres till the time local production matures in the country.

The company is setting up production capacity for passenger vehicle tyres at its Chennai facility at an investment of Rs 564 crore.

The plant is expected to commence production later this year with gradual portfolio scale up expected to take place over the next few years.

The local manufacturing would help the company, which has 86 tyre production sites across the globe, to scale up operations in India, which remain subdued with the government introducing import restrictions in 2020.

The tyre maker currently sells only premium bigger size tyres in limited quantity especially for performance-oriented models in India.

In 2020, the government imposed curbs on imports of certain new pneumatic tyres used in motor cars, busses, lorries and motorcycles in a move to promote domestic manufacturing.

Tyre companies can now import only a small number of tyres into the country under a limited import licence, which was not the case before 2020.

Menegaux told PTI here that the company is having extensive discussions with the Indian government to extend import licence.

""We have good relationship with the government, and we are having extensive discussions to extend our licence. We have been granted some licence to import but to grow faster we will need the licence, at least till we have our facility for passenger car ready,"" he stated.

The company has rolled out an investment plan to produce passenger vehicle tyres in the country, but it will take few years till the production touches optimum level, Menegaux stated.

Michelin already has a facility in Chennai for manufacturing a range of radial truck/bus tyres and defence tyres for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as well as for the replacement market in the country.

The company has invested Rs 2,840 crore on the plant which has an installed production capacity of over 30,000 tonnes per annum.

The facility, which is operational since 2014, caters mainly to Indian market and few export markets.

Besides, Michelin also gets two-wheeler tyres manufactured in the country through a partner.

Menegaux noted that the Indian market has plenty of potential for growth while exhorting the need for a level-playing field for all operators.

""In relationships, I believe in an open world, rules of the games are enforced by countries with a level-playing field. Right now, in India, like many other countries, there is a tendency to look at the world from just the country's (own) perspective,"" Menegaux stated.

""I think this is not adequate. We are citizens of the world, and we should cooperate. I think if we could have more attention towards how do we create a level playing field so that competition can be exercised in proper manner,"" he added.

He noted that India has seen tremendous growth in infrastructure development over the last ten years and the tyre maker sees it an important market globally.

""Like what we have seen in China a few years ago, infrastructure is getting better in India. A lot of investment is taking place in roads and vehicles, etc. So the vehicle parc is expanding,"" he noted.

He further said that Michelin has invested across various segments in India like manufacturing, research and IT services.

""Our core expertise in artificial intelligence comes from India. And so for all of that, India is important to us, and we are making investments,"" Menegaux said.

On a question regarding competition from emerging companies especially from China, Menegaux mentioned that the tyre maker likes competition as it helps it to progress.

""Provided there is acceptable rules of the game, competition strengthens us,"" he added.

""We had one competition from Japan long time back. Then there was one from South Korea and we will have competition from China. We will also have one competitor from India. Maybe you will see one coming from Africa. But that's ok. There is space for everyone as the market grows,"" he stated.

Michelin employs close to 1.3 lakh people globally. The company, which produced around 200 million tyres in 2022, has set a goal of achieving 100 per cent sustainable materials in its tyres by 2050.

The Michelin group aims to become a leader in composite solutions, particularly flexible composites like coated fabrics, films, seals, conveyors, belts, hoses, and inflatable structures.

It operates its composites businesses worldwide under the brands of the Fenner group, which it acquired in 2018.

It took another major step in its development in June 2023, when it acquired the Faitplast, Angeloni, and Orca-Pennel&Flippo brands.

Michelin, as part of a NASA project, plans to leverage its expertise in airless tyres and its knowledge of high-tech materials to design a lunar wheel capable of withstanding extreme temperatures (over 100°C and below -240°C) and solar and galactic radiation.

NASA recently announced that the Moon RACER team, of which Michelin is a member, has been awarded the feasibility study for phase 1 of the ARTEMIS project.

The project, entitled ""Lunar Terrain Vehicle Phase 1 Feasibility Study"", aims to design a lunar vehicle capable of operating in extreme conditions on the moon for 10 years.

Menegaux said the the developments carried out as part of the project will enable Michelin to continue innovating in terrestrial applications.",https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/wire-updates/pti-preview-theweek.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 08:03:53.326964

Bank of America Securities forecasts an 8% decline in domestic package volumes for United Parcel Service in the first quarter of 2025. The projection takes into account strategic internal changes within the business, weather disturbances, and tariff-related uncertainties as well as pressure from these factors.

The expected drop occurs during a larger UPS delivery strategy reconfiguration. A major client whose slow move to in-house logistics has impacted shipping companies, the firm is projected to lose around half of its Amazon (AMZN, Financials) business by mid-2026. UPS is internalizing 50% of its SurePost volumes at the same time, which affects general volume measurements as well as raises average rates.

Bank of America analyst Ken Hoexter reacted by cutting his first quarter earnings per share projection by 15% to $1.31. Based on updated projections for worse operational performance and reduced margins, the 2025 full-year EPS forecast was also reduced by 6% to $7.40.

Although UPS's January performance exceeded expectations, internal data allegedly indicate February and March volume decline. Bank of America reports the firm is not aggressively restructuring costs right now as it sees the weakness as transient.

Now forecast at $643 million in Q1, international adjusted operating income is down from a prior projection of $733 million. Operating margins are predicted to shrink to 15%, down from 17% a year earlier.

Bank of America reaffirmed its Buy recommendation on UPS despite these obstacles, saying long-term faith in the company's capacity to reduce structural expenses as required. Based on a value of 17.5 times expected 2025 profits, the price objective was cut by 3% to $129.",https://static.gurufocus.com/1526208121872130048.jpeg,N,,2025-03-26 10:02:29.034521

In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, the company said excluding non-recurring gains from lot sales and incentives under the Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) program, core net income grew by 11 percent.

GT Capital’s performance was driven by Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (Metrobank) and Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP), which posted record net incomes of P48.1 billion and P15.9 billion, respectively. Its associate, Metro Pacific Investments Corp. (MPIC), also delivered a record P28 billion profit.

“GT Capital’s core net income grew by 11 percent in 2024, building on the record levels achieved the previous year,” said GT Capital President Carmelo Maria Luza Bautista.

“We remain optimistic that our core businesses will sustain this growth momentum moving forward.”

Metrobank’s net income rose 14 percent year-on-year to P48.1 billion, supported by strong asset expansion and improving asset quality. The bank’s return on equity increased to 13 percent from 12.5 percent in 2023.

TMP reported a 15.3 percent increase in net income to P15.9 billion, driven by a 9 percent rise in retail sales to 218,019 units, representing 46 percent of the auto industry’s total sales in 2024.

Strong commercial vehicle sales, led by the Hilux, Raize, Innova, Avanza, and Hiace models, boosted the company’s market share. Lexus remained the leader in the luxury segment with a 53.5 percent market share.

TMP also recorded a 95 percent year-on-year growth in electrified vehicle sales, with 14,057 units sold, accounting for 58 percent of the industry’s total. In December, the company launched the Next-Generation Tamaraw, a Filipino-assembled light commercial vehicle designed for small businesses and local government units.

GT Capital’s property subsidiary, Federal Land, Inc., reported P12.0 billion in revenues and a net income of P750 million for 2024. The company launched several projects, including Meadowcrest in Laguna and Grand Hyatt Manila Residences South Tower in Bonifacio Global City.

MPIC posted a 21 percent increase in consolidated core net income, reaching P23.6 billion in 2024 from P19.5 billion in 2023.

Stronger performances from its key businesses drove a 16 percent rise in contribution from operations to a record P28.4 billion. Growth was fueled by higher energy sales at Meralco, increased billed volumes at Maynilad Water, and more traffic on toll roads, complemented by higher tariffs.

Another affiliate, AXA Philippines Life and General Insurance Corp., also recorded a 19 percent rise in gross premiums to P30.4 billion in 2024.

CVS Health Corporation (NYSE: CVS) reported its fourth-quarter results for the fiscal year 2024, showing a notable increase in total revenues. The company achieved revenues of $97.7 billion, marking a 4.2% rise compared to the same period last year. However, the company’s operating income faced a decline, dropping to $2.37 billion from $3.37 billion in the previous year.

The adjusted operating income also saw a decrease, coming in at $2.73 billion, down from $4.23 billion the previous year. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) reflected this downturn, with a GAAP diluted EPS of $1.30, a decrease from $1.58 in the prior year. The adjusted EPS also fell significantly to $1.19 from $2.12. This decline in earnings was primarily attributed to challenges faced by the Health Care Benefits segment, which experienced increased utilization pressures and negative impacts from Medicare Advantage star ratings.

Despite these challenges, CVS Health’s revenue growth was driven by the Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segments. These areas saw positive momentum due to increased prescription volumes and a favorable pharmacy drug mix, although offset by reimbursement pressures and a decline in front store volume. Overall, the fourth quarter’s results reflect both the strengths and challenges faced by CVS Health in a complex healthcare environment.

CVS Reports Double Beat in Fourth-Quarter FY2024

When comparing CVS Health’s fourth-quarter performance to market expectations, the company exceeded revenue projections and earnings. Analysts had anticipated revenue figures around $96.97 billion, but CVS surpassed this with $97.7 billion. This increase can be attributed to strategic growth in certain business segments, despite facing industry-wide challenges.

In terms of earnings, the company reported a GAAP diluted EPS of $1.30 and an adjusted EPS of $1.19, exceeding the expected EPS of $1.00. The decline in adjusted EPS was significant, dropping from $2.12 in the prior year, underscoring the pressure faced by the company in maintaining profitability amidst rising costs and competitive pressures.

The chain was surpassed by Starbucks in in 2016.

According to earnings reports, Starbucks faced significant challenges in 2024.

After suffering four consecutive quarters of financial decline, the Washington-based chain is no longer the top-ranked restaurant brand in terms of value.

That title now belongs to McDonald's.

Before Starbucks, McDonald's was the most valuable restaurant chain globally, before Starbucks took the top spot in 2016.

While Starbucks fell off last year, McDonald's achieved a massive 7% increase in value, bringing the company's overall worth up to $40.5 billion.

According to research conducted by brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance, McDonald's growth can be attributed to its Brand Strength Index (BSI).

The chain's BSI rating rose 7.6% to 90.5 out of 100, scoring AAA+.

The rating weighs several factors including familiarity, consideration, and preferred brand, for which McDonald's scored highly in all three categories.

According to Brand Finance, McDonald's is the 42nd most valuable brand in the world.

On the other hand, Starbucks' overall value dropped 36% to 38.8 billion, making it the world's second-most valuable restaurant brand.

Starbucks was the most valuable from 2016 to 2024, but its diminishing reputation and recommendation scores may be the reasons for the company's valuation decline.

Brian Niccol, the former CEO of Chipotle, was appointed as Starbucks' new CEO in August 2024.

Starbucks hoped that a change in leadership could reverse the company's gradual decline.

Niccol's strategy includes revamping its cafe culture by improving its seating and service.

The company also reintroduced ceramic mugs for in-store orders, with the aim of keeping customers in stores longer.

STARBUCKS IN THE NEWS

In 2023, Starbucks was overtaken by Chinese coffee chain Luckin Coffee as the largest coffee chain in China.

Luckin recently announced that it would be expanding to the US for the first time.

Meanwhile, a popular fashion brand opened its first cafe location in New York, replacing a Starbucks location.

The cafes have stores across Asia, but are now entering the US market for the first time.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/RTRMADP_STARBUCKS-DECISION-SUPERVISOR_1585036325_RC2Z81A6J6BE_2023-07-24T221435Zjpg-JS833940831.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1375&h=923&crop=1,N,,2025-03-26 09:01:58.956412

The Company also announced that the AirJoule® system can use low-grade waste heat from industrial processes to improve energy efficiency and produce pure distilled water for less than 160 watt-hours of energy consumption per liter (“Wh/L”). This marks a step change in water harvesting efficiency, allowing humanity to cost-effectively access water stored in the most reliable freshwater aquifer – the Earth’s atmosphere.

Fourth Quarter 2024

AirJoule® Utilizes Low-Grade Waste Heat to Produce Pure Distilled Water

After extensive testing at the Company’s facility in Newark, DE, AirJoule® demonstrated the ability to produce pure distilled water from air with an energy requirement of less than 160 Wh/L of water by utilizing low-grade waste heat (with test conditions of 80°F and 60% relative humidity). Compared to existing technologies, AirJoule® is up to 4x more efficient at separating water from air than refrigerant-based systems (400-700 Wh/L) and up to 8x more efficient than desiccant-based systems (more than 1,300 Wh/L).

Waste heat is the world’s largest untapped energy source. Approximately 70% of the energy produced on the planet is lost as waste heat at power plants, and up to 50% of energy inputs to industrial operations are lost as waste heat. Most of this waste heat is low-grade (under 100°C) and previously has not been economical to recapture for reuse or electricity generation. By tapping into the significant low-grade waste heat available at nearly all industrial operations globally, including data centers, AirJoule® can generate pure distilled water at attractive costs. AirJoule® is unlocking two vast resources to improve energy efficiency and water sustainability – low-grade waste heat and water in the atmosphere.

The Company and the AirJoule JV (defined below) are in advanced discussions with multiple data center operators, project developers, and industrial facilities about potential proof of concept deployments where AirJoule® demonstration units would be installed and field tested to validate their operational capabilities. If successful, these initiatives will lay the foundation for large-scale water generation projects that harness waste heat to produce pure distilled water on-site at competitive costs while also driving greater energy efficiency.

Data centers, which are vital to our increasingly digital world, require substantial amounts of power and water. When deployed to data centers, AirJoule® can transform the vast low-grade waste heat from these facilities, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, into a valuable asset through the production of distilled water for evaporative cooling and for other beneficial purposes.

Full Year 2024

Executive Commentary

“We are pleased with the significant progress made in 2024,” said Matt Jore, CEO of AirJoule Technologies. “We achieved several key milestones that position us well for the extensive commercial opportunities we see ahead at the intersection of energy efficiency and water security. The significance of AirJoule® separating pure water from air at less than 160 watt-hours per liter cannot be overstated. Once commercialized, this unprecedented level of energetics can enable transformational solutions including waste heat to water, distributed water generation, and more energy-efficient dehumidification and air conditioning systems.”

Mr. Jore continued, “We are incredibly energized to have completed our first year as a publicly traded company. We are excited for what’s to come in 2025 and look forward to updating our stakeholders on our progress throughout the year.”

The conglomerates said its growth momentum was sustained by the record net incomes of operating companies Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (Metrobank) and Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP).
“GT Capital’s core net income grew by 11 percent in 2024, building on the record levels achieved the previous year.
This continuous improvement reflects the group’s strong fundamentals across diversified sectors,” said GT Capital President Carmelo Maria Luza Bautista.
Reported net income rose faster to ₱28 billion from ₱20 billion, owing to additional non-recurring gains from MPIC’s real estate business and a lower interest bill.","GT Capital Holdings, Inc., the investment arm of the Ty family, reported a two percent dip in consolidated net income to ₱28.8 billion for 2024 from the ₱29.3 billion it earned in 2023 due to non-recurring gains in the previous year.

Excluding non-recurring gains from lot sales and incentives under the Comprehensive Automotive Resurgence Strategy (CARS) program, GT Capital’s 2024 core net income increased by 11 percent from 2023.

The conglomerates said its growth momentum was sustained by the record net incomes of operating companies Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (Metrobank) and Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP).

GT Capital’s performance was also supported by its associate Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (Metro Pacific), which achieved a record high net income of ₱28 billion in 2024.

“GT Capital’s core net income grew by 11 percent in 2024, building on the record levels achieved the previous year. This continuous improvement reflects the group’s strong fundamentals across diversified sectors,” said GT Capital President Carmelo Maria Luza Bautista.

He added, “We remain optimistic that our core businesses will sustain this growth momentum moving forward. This year, GT Capital is committed to pushing boundaries further and reaching new milestones.”

Metrobank’s net income rose 14.0 percent year-on-year to a record ₱48.1 billion in 2024, supported by robust asset expansion and improving asset quality. This translated to a 13.0 percent return on equity, higher than the 12.5 percent recorded in the same period last year.

“The hard work that all Metrobankers put in growing our corporate, middle market, retail and wealth segments as well as our investments in technology and human resources and risk management initiatives continue to bear fruit,” said Metrobank President Fabian S. Dee.

He noted that, “This positive momentum and our strong balance sheet set us up very well to continuously meet the growing needs of our clients and to pursue our medium-term strategies.""

TMP’s net income grew 15.3 percent in full-year 2024 to ₱15.9 billion, primarily driven by a nine percent increase in the automotive company’s retail sales volume, which reached a record level of 218,019 units sold by year-end, comprising 46.0 percent of the auto industry’s 473,842 total sales.

“In my first year as president of TMP, I have been able to witness first-hand the strength and potential of the Philippine automotive industry,” TMP President Masando Hashimoto said.

He noted “Our record-breaking numbers reflect the trust and confidence that Filipinos have entrusted in our brand. This 2025, we remain committed to providing quality and reliable vehicles to our customers, ensuring that we continue to offer sustainable mobility solutions, and in turn, supporting the country’s economic progress.”

Federal Land, Inc. reported that earnings fell to ₱750 million from the core net income of ₱2.1 billion in 2023 as revenues dropped to ₱12.0 billion from ₱20.8 billion.

Metro Pacific continued to break new record highs, with consolidated core net income rising 21 percent to ₱23.6 billion in 2024 compared with ₱19.5 billion in 2023.

Albertsons terminated the merger immediately after courts blocked it and sued Kroger, alleging a breach of contract that led to the deal falling apart.

The formal termination ended a two-year effort by the grocery chains to combine that regulators — who moved to stop the deal — said would eliminate competition, cause higher prices and reduce leverage for unionized workers.

In December, Albertsons asked for billions of dollars in damages along with a $600 million termination fee. Kroger had called the claims baseless.

Albertsons engaged in a campaign with divestiture buyer C&S Wholesale Grocers to pursue its own regulatory strategy, Kroger said on Tuesday.

""Albertsons' misconduct shockingly came to light in the middle of the antitrust trials under government cross examination of Susan Morris, Albertsons' recently promoted CEO designate,"" Kroger said.

The supermarket chain said Albertsons was not entitled to the termination fee or other damages due to its ""misconduct.""

""Kroger's weak claims are a deliberate tactic to distract from its own ongoing executive leadership issues; blatant and recurring failures to carry out its contractual obligations under the merger agreement; and avoid paying the damages it owes,"" Albertsons told Reuters in an emailed statement.

In early March, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen resigned after a board investigation found that his personal conduct was ""inconsistent"" with certain company policies.

The same day, Albertsons said its CEO Vivek Sankaran would retire, and insider Morris would assume the top role.

Kroger said the counterclaim aimed to seek damages from Albertsons to recover the investment it had made to obtain regulatory approval for the merger.

The grocer also added in the counterclaim it appeared that Albertsons had shifted its focus toward the current legal battle long before instead of pushing to close the transaction.

However, Albertsons said on Tuesday it was ""committed to the success of the combination from the outset,"" and it was Kroger who did not hold up its end of the bargain.

""We look forward to presenting our case in court,"" Albertsons said.",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3048/304876/30487649.JPG?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2025-03-25 18:04:46.427832

Financial Analyst Perspective

As a financial analyst, the upcoming conference call by Levi Strauss & Co is a critical event for stakeholders to gain insights into the company's financial health and performance for Q1 2025. The absence of preliminary financial data in the press release suggests that investors should pay close attention to the call for detailed analysis.

From a market research standpoint, Levi Strauss & Co's extensive global reach and diverse brand portfolio position it well in the competitive apparel industry. The company's ability to maintain significant revenue levels indicates strong brand loyalty and effective market strategies.

AirJoule Technologies cautions you that these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond AirJoule Technologies’ control.","RONAN, Mont., March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AirJoule Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRJ) (“AirJoule Technologies” or the “Company”), the developer of the transformational AirJoule® system for separating pure water from air, today announced its fourth quarter and full year results. The Company also announced that the AirJoule® system can use low-grade waste heat from industrial processes to improve energy efficiency and produce pure distilled water for less than 160 watt-hours of energy consumption per liter (“Wh/L”). This marks a step change in water harvesting efficiency, allowing humanity to cost-effectively access water stored in the most reliable freshwater aquifer – the Earth’s atmosphere.

Fourth Quarter 2024

AirJoule® Utilizes Low-Grade Waste Heat to Produce Pure Distilled Water

After extensive testing at the Company’s facility in Newark, DE, AirJoule® demonstrated the ability to produce pure distilled water from air with an energy requirement of less than 160 Wh/L of water by utilizing low-grade waste heat (with test conditions of 80°F and 60% relative humidity). Compared to existing technologies, AirJoule® is up to 4x more efficient at separating water from air than refrigerant-based systems (400-700 Wh/L) and up to 8x more efficient than desiccant-based systems (more than 1,300 Wh/L).

Waste heat is the world’s largest untapped energy source. Approximately 70% of the energy produced on the planet is lost as waste heat at power plants, and up to 50% of energy inputs to industrial operations are lost as waste heat. Most of this waste heat is low-grade (under 100°C) and previously has not been economical to recapture for reuse or electricity generation. By tapping into the significant low-grade waste heat available at nearly all industrial operations globally, including data centers, AirJoule® can generate pure distilled water at attractive costs. AirJoule® is unlocking two vast resources to improve energy efficiency and water sustainability – low-grade waste heat and water in the atmosphere.

The Company and the AirJoule JV (defined below) are in advanced discussions with multiple data center operators, project developers, and industrial facilities about potential proof of concept deployments where AirJoule® demonstration units would be installed and field tested to validate their operational capabilities. If successful, these initiatives will lay the foundation for large-scale water generation projects that harness waste heat to produce pure distilled water on-site at competitive costs while also driving greater energy efficiency.

Data centers, which are vital to our increasingly digital world, require substantial amounts of power and water. When deployed to data centers, AirJoule® can transform the vast low-grade waste heat from these facilities, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, into a valuable asset through the production of distilled water for evaporative cooling and for other beneficial purposes.

Full Year 2024

Key Milestones

Formed a 50/50 joint venture with GE Vernova to commercialize the AirJoule® technology (“AirJoule JV”); at the end of 2024, the AirJoule JV team included 24 full-time employees who were primarily focused on engineering and product development activities

Entered a binding joint commercialization term sheet with Carrier Global Corporation for AirJoule® applications in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning market

Built out a 35,000 square foot facility in Newark, DE to support sorbent-coating, manufacturing, assembly, and testing operations for AirJoule® units at the AirJoule JV

Opened the Company’s first international office in the United Arab Emirates to spearhead business development and growth initiatives in the Gulf Cooperation Council region

Balance Sheet and Liquidity

Completed a $50 million private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) financing in March 2024, led by investments from GE Vernova, Carrier, and Rice Investment Group, among other third parties

Raised an additional $12 million through a PIPE financing from primarily existing investors in June 2024

Ended the year with $28 million of cash and cash equivalents with sufficient liquidity to support the Company’s operations through expected commercial sales in 2026

Executive Commentary

“We are pleased with the significant progress made in 2024,” said Matt Jore, CEO of AirJoule Technologies. “We achieved several key milestones that position us well for the extensive commercial opportunities we see ahead at the intersection of energy efficiency and water security. The significance of AirJoule® separating pure water from air at less than 160 watt-hours per liter cannot be overstated. Once commercialized, this unprecedented level of energetics can enable transformational solutions including waste heat to water, distributed water generation, and more energy-efficient dehumidification and air conditioning systems.”

Mr. Jore continued, “We are incredibly energized to have completed our first year as a publicly traded company. We are excited for what’s to come in 2025 and look forward to updating our stakeholders on our progress throughout the year.”

Committed Equity Facility

On March 25, 2025, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC (“B. Riley”), providing the Company with the right, but not the obligation, to sell up to $30 million of newly issued shares to B. Riley over a period of 36 months, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The Purchase Agreement gives the Company financial flexibility to opportunistically raise incremental capital in support of future growth and development activities.

In addition, Kuros reached profitability in 2024 reporting an EBITDA of 2.2 million Swiss Francs ($2.5 million) in 2024 versus a loss in 2023 of 5.9 million Swiss Francs ($6.7 million).
This growth was driven by the successful roll-out of our technology in key markets, particularly as demand continues to grow globally.
Kuros also plans to expand its distribution network to the Asia Pacific and South American markets in 2025.
Elting has previously held executive leadership positions at Orthofix Medical, Inc., Trivascular Technologies, and St. Jude Medical.","Swiss-based Kuros Biosciences, supplier of MagnetOs bone graft and NeedleGrip™, reported an exceptional 125% rate of sales growth from 31.7 million Swiss Francs ($36 million) in 2023 to 75.6 million Swiss Francs ($86 million) in 2024.

In addition, Kuros reached profitability in 2024 reporting an EBITDA of 2.2 million Swiss Francs ($2.5 million) in 2024 versus a loss in 2023 of 5.9 million Swiss Francs ($6.7 million).

To be sure, the company noted, “adjusted EBITDA excluding the Fibrin-PTH costs, recurring and one-time share-based compensation, and the relevant social security charges totaled at CHF 9.0 million ($10.2 million), representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9%.”

Kuros Biosciences CEO Chris Fair said of his company’s performance: “We recorded exceptional direct MagnetOs sales growth of 136%. This growth was driven by the successful roll-out of our technology in key markets, particularly as demand continues to grow globally. Overall, this was a transformative year for Kuros, marked by delivering our first positive EBITDA for the Group much earlier than anticipated.”

Fair continued, “In addition, exceeding cash flow breakeven is a key milestone for the company. Strategically, a landmark Level 1 clinical study published in Spine continues to drive customer preference.”

Medtronic Deal

“We also secured a five-year exclusive agreement with Medtronic to accelerate MagnetOs adoption in the U.S. Our expansion into adjacent extremities markets, portfolio innovation in minimally invasive surgery, and broader global distribution capabilities position us for continued explosive growth. With a strong foundation and a clear roadmap, Kuros is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities and drive sustained shareholder value.”

More Details and Outlook

According to the press release, direct MagnetOs sales “increased by 136% to CHF 74.8 million (2023: CHF 31.7 million).” MagnetOs is a bone graft that can grow bone even in soft tissue. It utilizes NeedleGrip™ surface technology which, per its website, “provides traction for our body’s vitally important ‘pro-healing’ immune cells (M2 macrophages).” This “unlocks previously untapped potential to stimulate stem cells—and form new bone throughout the graft.”

Kuros Group reported a positive outlook for future sales, with expected “sales growth of at least 60% in 2025” and anticipated “sales of between USD 220 million and USD 250 million by 2027.”

In 2025, Kuros plans to change its reporting currency from CHF to USD. Kuros also plans to expand its distribution network to the Asia Pacific and South American markets in 2025.

Kuros may also be welcoming a new board member. Kimberley Elting, an experienced medtech executive, has been proposed as a new board member.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with UPS.

Bank of America Securities forecasts an 8% decline in domestic package volumes for United Parcel Service in the first quarter of 2025. The projection takes into account strategic internal changes within the business, weather disturbances, and tariff-related uncertainties as well as pressure from these factors.The expected drop occurs during a larger UPS delivery strategy reconfiguration. A major client whose slow move to in-house logistics has impacted shipping companies, the firm is projected to lose around half of its Amazon (AMZN, Financials) business by mid-2026. UPS is internalizing 50% of its SurePost volumes at the same time, which affects general volume measurements as well as raises average rates.Bank of America analyst Ken Hoexter reacted by cutting his first quarter earnings per share projection by 15% to $1.31. Based on updated projections for worse operational performance and reduced margins, the 2025 full-year EPS forecast was also reduced by 6% to $7.40.Although UPS's January performance exceeded expectations, internal data allegedly indicate February and March volume decline. Bank of America reports the firm is not aggressively restructuring costs right now as it sees the weakness as transient.Now forecast at $643 million in Q1, international adjusted operating income is down from a prior projection of $733 million. Operating margins are predicted to shrink to 15%, down from 17% a year earlier.Bank of America reaffirmed its Buy recommendation on UPS despite these obstacles, saying long-term faith in the company's capacity to reduce structural expenses as required.

It also lowered its annual investment budget to a $20 billion-$22 billion range through to 2028.

The world's biggest liquefied natural gas trader said it wants to grow LNG sales by 4-5% each year in the next five years.

While keeping its oil output stable at 1.4 million barrels per day.

Shell estimates global demand for liquefied natural gas to rise by around 60% by 2040.

That's driven largely by economic growth in Asia, the impact of artificial intelligence and efforts to cut emissions in heavy industries and transportation.

The oil major has a $3.5 billion buyback for the current quarter, making this the 13th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion of share repurchases.

Shell spent around $8 billion by the end of last year on low-carbon solutions set for 2023 to 2025.

It said by the end of the decade it would have up to 10% of its capital employed - which measures the sum of total equity and debt - in lower carbon platforms.

Albertsons filed suit against Kroger after the $24.6 billion merger fell apart in December 2024 over antitrust concerns.
Albertsons says Kroger didn't work hard enough to get federal approval for the merger and owes a $600 million termination fee stipulated in the initial merger agreement, plus billions in damages.
Kroger claims Albertsons convinced C&S to criticize its deal with Kroger, giving federal regulators pause.
""But, within hours of the court decisions blocking the merger, Albertsons terminated the merger agreement and filed a 140-page complaint against Kroger.","Cincinnati-based Kroger Tuesday filed a countersuit against Albertsons, the latest legal fallout from a failed merger between the two grocery giants.

Albertsons filed suit against Kroger after the $24.6 billion merger fell apart in December 2024 over antitrust concerns. Albertsons says Kroger didn't work hard enough to get federal approval for the merger and owes a $600 million termination fee stipulated in the initial merger agreement, plus billions in damages.

Kroger, on Tuesday, pushed back, accusing Albertsons executives of plotting with C&S Wholesale Grocers and secretly pursuing a separate strategy for regulatory approval that undermined Kroger's. C&S was lined up to buy hundreds of stores from Kroger to allay antitrust concerns. Kroger claims Albertsons convinced C&S to criticize its deal with Kroger, giving federal regulators pause.

""Albertsons's misconduct shockingly came to light in the middle of the antitrust trials under government cross examination of Susan Morris, Albertsons's recently promoted CEO designate,"" Kroger said in a news release. ""As a result of its misconduct, Albertsons is not entitled to the $600 million termination fee under the terms of the parties' merger agreement, nor is Albertsons entitled to the other damages it seeks.""

Kroger and Albertsons first agreed to the merger in 2022. The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in eight states and the District of Columbia sued to oppose the deal claiming it would hurt competition and raise prices. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and AGs in three other states filed briefs supporting the merger.

Had the deal gone through, it would have been the largest supermarket merger in U.S. history.

In its filing Tuesday, Kroger claimed Albertsons was preparing to abandon the deal and sue Kroger prematurely.

""Kroger was prepared, in the event of adverse court decisions, to pursue all remaining options to close the merger,"" the company said. ""But, within hours of the court decisions blocking the merger, Albertsons terminated the merger agreement and filed a 140-page complaint against Kroger. These actions ensured that the merger would never close, and further demonstrated that Albertsons had long before shifted its focus towards the litigation that is now pending between the parties, abandoning its contractual obligation to use best efforts to close the transaction.""

Kroger's rebuttal reverses charges Albertsons made against the company in its lawsuit.

In that suit, filed Dec. 11, 2024, Albertsons accused Kroger of failing to take regulators' antitrust concerns seriously, refusing to sell enough of its stores to win regulatory approval and not collaborating with Albertsons on winning approval for the deal.

In its countersuit, Kroger is seeking unspecified damages and to recoup expenses it incurred trying to win regulatory approval for the merger.

NKE has dropped 6.2% since reporting third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on March 20.

For fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the consensus mark for revenues and EPS indicates 11.3% and 74.3% year-over-year declines, respectively.
Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
Zacks Investment Research","NIKE Inc. NKE has dropped 6.2% since reporting third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on March 20. While earnings per share (EPS) and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, investor concerns stem from year-over-year declines in both metrics. Sales were impacted by weak traffic, which fell in the double digits, and retail performance lagged expectations. Despite macroeconomic challenges, the sports market continues to grow in China.

NKE provided a cautious fiscal fourth-quarter outlook, citing the expected impacts of new tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. Management anticipates the fiscal fourth quarter to reflect the peak effects of its ‘Win Now’ strategy, with revenue and margin pressures beginning to ease. The company faces ongoing external uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions, tariffs, currency fluctuations and evolving tax regulations. Additionally, macroeconomic volatility and its effect on consumer confidence have been concerning.

For fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, NKE expects a revenue decline in the mid-teens, though at the lower end, due to North American shipment timing and foreign exchange headwinds. The gross margin is projected to drop 400-500 bps, indicating the impacts of prior-year restructuring charges. SG&A expenses are forecast to rise in the low to mid-single digits, including last year’s restructuring charges. The company continues to manage costs while investing in ‘Win Now’ initiatives, particularly in demand creation.

NKE’s lackluster third-quarter fiscal 2025 performance compounds ongoing challenges, including weakness in its lifestyle segment and a decline in digital revenues, reflecting shifting consumer preferences. The company is also grappling with lower retail traffic and sell-through rates in Greater China, a key market in its global strategy. These factors have contributed to slower revenue growth and tighter profit margins.

These factors have affected the Beaverton, OR-based company’s share price performance, which has slumped 27.2% in the past year. Shares of the company have underperformed its industry peers, which collectively declined 24.9% in the past year. The NKE stock compared unfavorably with the broader Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 3.7% and 9.3%, respectively, in the same period.

NKE’s One-Year Price Performance

NIKE's performance is notably weaker than its competitors lululemon athletica inc. LULU and Skechers SKX, which have declined 13.3% and 2.8%, respectively, in a year. NKE has also lagged Adidas’ ADDYY 8.5% growth in the same period.

At the current share price of $67.39, NIKE trades close to its 52-week low mark of $65.17, reached on March 21. The stock price reflects a 3.4% premium to the company’s recent 52-week low. Meanwhile, the NKE stock’s price reflects a 31.3% discount from its 52-week high of $98.04. NIKE trades below its 50 and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish sentiment.

NKE’s Estimate Revision Trend

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NKE’s fiscal 2025 EPS moved up 2.4% in the last seven days, while the same for fiscal 2026 EPS edged down 0.9%.

For fiscal 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIKE’s revenues and EPS implies year-over-year declines of 10.4% and 46.6%, respectively. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, the consensus mark for revenues and EPS indicates 11.3% and 74.3% year-over-year declines, respectively.

Premium Valuation for NIKE Stock

NKE is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 30.4X, exceeding the industry average of 24.54X and the S&P 500’s average of 20.77X.

Though trading much below its five-year high of 48.27X, the current valuation may be considered expensive, given the significant downside risks if the company's ongoing perils are not resolved for a prolonged period.

Can Investors Be Hopeful About NKE’s Strategies

Despite the ongoing challenges, NIKE is on track with its actions to reposition itself to be more competitive and drive sustainable, profitable long-term growth. The company is intensifying its focus on sports, speeding up the introduction and expansion of products and innovations. NIKE is accelerating product diversification by introducing performance and lifestyle footwear while reducing its reliance on classic franchises.

With innovations like the Pegasus Premium, Vomero 18 and Air Max platforms, alongside a more segmented and differentiated wholesale strategy, NIKE is positioning itself for sustainable growth by catering to evolving consumer preferences and expanding its market reach across key global regions.

The company is leveraging its deep connection to sports by amplifying athlete-driven storytelling and engaging consumers through major sporting events like the Super Bowl and NBA All-Star Weekend. By aligning its brand messaging with cultural moments and investing in impactful marketing, NIKE aims to reinforce its brand distinction, enhance consumer loyalty and drive long-term growth.

NKE is revitalizing its digital and retail strategy by reducing promotions, improving premium brand positioning and refining its go-to-market processes. By strengthening partnerships with wholesale retailers and optimizing its NIKE Direct ecosystem, the company is creating a more seamless and engaging shopping experience, ultimately driving margins and brand loyalty.

How to Play the NIKE Stock?

NKE's strategic initiatives lay the foundation for long-term growth by strengthening its competitive position, expanding its product range and deepening consumer engagement. Through accelerated innovation, diversified offerings and an improved retail and digital strategy, the company is adapting to shifting market trends while maintaining its leadership in sports and lifestyle apparel. Its emphasis on key global markets, athlete-driven storytelling, and premium brand positioning supports a resilient and sustainable growth outlook despite industry challenges.

However, near-term pressures persist as NIKE navigates its product realignment and inventory adjustments. Investors should closely watch the company's efforts to stabilize sales, improve margins, and manage its digital and international transitions. Given its premium valuation and slowing growth, a cautious approach may be warranted while NIKE works through its strategic transformation and broader economic challenges.

After dominating since 2016, Starbucks has lost its crown to McDonald’s, which has reclaimed the top spot, according to a report from consulting firm Brand Finance. McDonald’s brand value surged by 7% to $40.5 billion from 2024 to 2025, while Starbucks (SBUX) saw a sharp 36% decline, dropping to $38.8 billion.

Recent moves from the respective chains have been crucial to their rise and fall. Brand Finance data shows that Starbucks’ decline is driven by drops in key brand strength metrics in both the U.S. and China, particularly in areas like “reputation” and “recommendation.” This reflects low customer expectations, rising dissatisfaction, and ultimately a decline in sales.

In contrast, McDonald’s has pushed forward with strategic changes to its operations, though not without challenges. Most notably, an E.Coli outbreak late last year forced the chain to launch a $100 million recovery plan.

Since then, the burger giant has been on a marketing blitz. Earlier this month, it reorganized its team into three departments, focusing on winning in beef, chicken, and beverages. New product launches, including the McCrispy and Chicken Big Mac, and recent promotions — like the return of the Shamrock Shake and $5 meal deal — have helped drive customer traffic. A collector’s cup promotion also became a hit, with some selling for up to $100 on eBay.

On the other hand, Starbucks continues to face challenges under the leadership of new CEO Brian Niccol, who is working to make the coffee giant a staple once again. Starbucks recently reported its fourth-consecutive quarter of declining sales, particularly in China, the company’s second-largest market.

Despite this, Starbucks is on the road to a “Big Fix.” As part of Niccol’s efforts to turn things around with a “Back to Starbucks” strategy, the company has pared down its menu by 30%, promising to serve coffee in under four minutes. Starbucks has also removed 13 drinks from its menu, eliminated the extra charges for non-dairy milk alternatives, and is reintroducing TV marketing, condiment bars, and power outlets for paying customers.

Not all the company’s changes have been well received. Starbucks recently reversed its position on its 2018 open-door policy, which previously allowed anyone to sit in stores, following the arrest of two Black men at a Philadelphia location.

In early March, Niccol delivered a stern message to corporate employees, urging them to step up their efforts and take more responsibility for Starbucks’ financial performance after the company laid off 1,100 workers.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/quartz.com/5f802ad10e26f3cfed775ac54f3dc231,N,,2025-03-25 15:07:04.788432

Work with retailers to add shelf-talkers and signage to make it easier to find and prepare meals with plant-based products.","Anaheim, Calif. – The plant-based industry is much like a garden: it once flourished with vibrant growth but has since faced a dry spell, awaiting the right conditions to rebloom. At Natural Products Expo West, key industry stakeholders may have offered the industry the nutrients it needs.

Between 2018 and 2024 the plant-based foods industry grew from $4.5 billion to $8.1 billion in annual sales, supported by the 59% household penetration and 79% repeat rate observed throughout 2024, according to a session, titled “From Plants to Plates: Unpacking Consumer Spending & Sentiment in Plant-Based vs Animal-Based Categories,” which presented recent data created in partnership with the Plant Based Foods Association and Kroger’s data insights firm 84.51.

However, despite the perceived growth, the industry has struggled in recent years, facing headwinds, particularly from key “decreasers”—those who have dialed back their plant-based purchases.

To win back these consumers, decreasers cite lower pricing, better taste and texture, and wider availability of plant-based options on-shelf as key motivators to continue purchasing plant-based categories, explained PBFA head of marketplace Hannah Lopez.

The conversation, which also included 84.51 director of loyalty marketing consulting Maureen Heis and non-dairy creamer brand Nutpods CMO Patrick Coyle, looked at the state of the industry and advised plant-based manufacturers and grocers how to address key industry pain points.

“The plant-based food industry is keenly aware of consumer sentiment and continues to drive innovation throughout the industry,” added Lopez.

Already, measurable success has been achieved to mitigate these growing pains.

On the other end of the spectrum, for example, consumer “increasers” say they’re upping their plant-based consumption because of taste and variety.

The report polled consumers in May 2024 and December 2024, finding that those who increased purchases cited taste as the fast-growing motivator, increasing 13% to 36%, while variety increased by 3% over the same period to 33%.

Plant-Based Growth Indicators

The 2025 outlook for the plant-based sector looks optimistic, with both plant-based evangelists and skeptics increasing consumption across categories.

Across households, household consumption has increased by 34%, while 57% note they are maintaining their purchasing behavior. When asked why, health perception, taste, environmental impact, variety, and animal welfare reasons all grew between May 2024 and December 2024.

As a result, 91% of increasers and 96% of decreasers of plant-based foods claim to be increasing or maintaining consumption, according to the report. This indicates strong wins for the sector.

The key to tapping into this growth? a comprehensive strategy considering mechanization, pricing, and personalized promotions.

Capturing Growth With a Plant-Based Portfolio

Coyle noted that the sentiment data underscores the key to plant-based success—consumers care about the product before the mission.

“There’s a balance between value and values,” he said. “We must balance the heart with the head. In most cases, consumers won’t pay twice as much for a more sustainable product.”

Additionally, he recommended tempering the research with a comprehensive strategy. For example, consumers cite decreasing plant-based consumption because of fewer promotions on these products throughout 2024; however, from a brand perception standpoint, a product line shouldn’t always be on sale.

Instead, he recommends working with retailers to maximize the limited display space in stores. Designated plant-based sections could be a blight on a brand, as it does little to attract new consumers to the area, so facilitating any way to foster special moments with plant-based products can help inspire trial and repeat purchases.

Lopez agreed, adding that business leaders should consider the following:

Provide transparency on nutritional benefits to educate them on the category.

Offer promotions and variety (within reason) to assuage the category’s negative price and availability perceptions.

Work with retailers to add shelf-talkers and signage to make it easier to find and prepare meals with plant-based products.

A tenet of the plant-based 2.0 movement, Coyle added that its brand benefited from eschewing flavor parity with its dairy-based analog. He said that the brand has invested significant R&D into optimizing taste and texture, however, the goal is to make it the best it can be, rather than an imitation of a dairy creamer.

“The reason you use coffee creamer is to make your coffee better. If it doesn’t, the customer won’t buy it,” he said.

Dive Brief:

Apparel, accessories and footwear spending fell 2% in January and February, lagging behind overall spending in the U.S., according to a report from Consumer Edge released Tuesday.

Luxury spending fell 7% during the period, which the report said was on par with 2024’s 8% decline in the sector. Spending at department stores increased 2%.

Within the apparel, accessories and footwear segment, fast fashion and the combined category of consignment and thrift saw the highest growth during the period, with both categories seeing spending increase by 5% compared to the same period last year.

Dive Insight:

Consumer Edge gathered the sales transaction data from more than 40 million active U.S. credit and debit cards, according to a company spokesperson.

The report found that customer spending on sports footwear and athletic apparel fell 6% compared to the same period last year. Strong performances from newer brands including Alo Yoga, Vuori and On Running “failed to compensate for ongoing softness among traditional sportswear brands,” the report said.

Multi-brand luxury platforms fell 22% in the period compared to last year. However, the report found that MyTheresa and Farfetch gained share among wealthier shoppers and proved more resilient than Net-A-Porter and Ssense, per the report.

Single-brand luxury fell 6% compared to last year, which Consumer Edge said was despite positive performance from midlevel brands such as Coach and Ralph Lauren. Customers pulled back their spending at higher-end brands including Chanel and Christian Dior for the second year in a row, which Consumer Edge said could be attributed to a potential protest against price hikes and limited product innovation.

Among high-income shoppers, Louis Vuitton and Cartier increased their share of spending while Gucci saw the worst share losses, per the report.

The report also broke down spending by age group, which a Consumer Edge spokesperson said was based on a subset of its larger data panel.

While all age groups reduced spending on apparel, accessories and footwear, consumers aged 25 to 34 cut back by 6.2% — the most over the last 12 months. Spending among people aged 18 to 24 declined the least, at 1.8%, per the report.

Consumers older than 65 cut their spending by 4.5%. Report authors said this was an important segment of the market, because this group has more disposable income and includes more people reaching retirement age.

Meanwhile, those aged 35 to 44 decreased their spending 4%; people aged 45 to 54 decreased spending 5%; and those aged 55 to 64 decreased spending 3.8%.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Mw2N5xEqAeZolIpC_HSuxr2swTHZHtvg8vf1AHXemT8/g:nowe:0:254/c:2500:1412/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODU1NjY3NTE0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-03-25 13:05:26.214645

ID23,McDonald’s,2025-03-25 14:54:19+00:00,QSR Magazine,Did McDonald's Answer the Call for Value Customers? - QSR Magazine,Danny Klein,,,,,https://www.qsrmagazine.com/story/did-mcdonalds-answer-the-call-for-value-customers/,"CEO Chris Kempczinski, in McDonald’s Q4 recap, said the brand witnessed an increase in guest counts—a key development given ongoing soft traffic—and the stealing of visit share.
MORE: McDonald’s Builds Focused Category Teams to Compete with Chicken and Beverage Specialists While the industry saw double-digit declines in lower-income-consumer traffic in Q4, McDonald’s said it observed its highest share all year.
Survey platform Numerator recently polled 400 verified McValue Menu customers to track their reactions to the deal.
Most McValue Menu customers were already loyal McDonald’s guests prior to the launch of the McValue Menu—94 percent went to McDonald’s in the first half of 2024.
Forty-eight percent of McValue Menu buyers said the McValue Menu made them choose McDonald’s instead of going to a different restaurant.","It remains relatively early in McDonald’s race back to unified value. The chain in January launched its McValue Menu—a platform housing every deal: in-app offers, local food and drink specials, a new Buy One, Add One for $1 lure at breakfast and lunch/dinner, and, naturally, the $5 Meal Deal itself, which arrived late June and has extended through.

Beyond the point this change was, as is often the case for McDonald’s, the largest domino in a wider fast-food value rush, it also marked the first time in nearly six years it boasted a company-wide value position across the U.S. (the last being the $1 $2 $3 menu).

CEO Chris Kempczinski, in McDonald’s Q4 recap, said the brand witnessed an increase in guest counts—a key development given ongoing soft traffic—and the stealing of visit share. Unsurprisingly, guest counts ran ahead of check as well. That latter point is consistent with McDonald’s experience launching new value programs, he said. “And then, as you get that sort of bedded down and you introduce food news and other things on top of that, you get the one, two punch of check plus [guest count] growth. So that’s what we’re expecting in the U.S.,” Kempczinski said.

Essentially, McDonald’s, for a while, lifted its top line on price instead of traffic—like much of the industry. But the equation wobbled as hikes held and it shed business from the lower-income cohort of its guest base.

From 2019 to 2024, McDonald’s appreciated 30 percent same-store sales growth, even with negative customer counts. However, as inflation persisted, there were simply fewer visits to compete for, leading to a “street-fighting mentality,” as CFO Ian Borden explained last April. That kicked off the $5 Meal Deal and, ultimately, the holistic McValue Menu.

McDonald’s simply had to retrench itself among value seekers. Kempczinski’s Q4 commentary suggests it did just that, which is why the company saw check depression with more customers tapping value instead of higher-ticket orders—a point, as noted, he feels will level out once innovation ramps up and the cadence settles.

The brand’s U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4 percent in Q4. Yet it was a difficult stretch to gauge considering October’s slivered onions E. coli outbreak. McDonald’s told investors its domestic business experienced mid-single-digit comps growth, with traffic expansion slightly below, before the incident. The Quarter Pounder hit slid sales to a low point in early November, with trends rebounding into December. Kempczinski said guest count growth reported slightly positive in December and up compared to peers in Q4. He added momentum continued in Q1 2025 and McDonald’s expects to be fully recovered by the start of Q2.

While the industry saw double-digit declines in lower-income-consumer traffic in Q4, McDonald’s said it observed its highest share all year.

The culprit: value, product news, and digital strength (the total number of 90-day active users reached more than 170 million across 60 markets, with systemwide sales to loyalty members totaling roughy $30 billion in 2024).

The $5 Meal Deal was live in Q4 and the Chicken Big Mac rolled out before the McRib returned in December. And, again, Q1 started with McValue. Executives said leadership of value and affordability scores improved thanks to the $5 Meal Deal and BOGO $1 offer. Both increased average transaction numbers since guests added items beyond the promotion.

Checks that included the $5 Meal Deal were north of $10 on average in Q4. The BOGO offer also boosted breakfast sales—historically McDonald’s highest-margin daypart.

Is the value resonating?

Survey platform Numerator recently polled 400 verified McValue Menu customers to track their reactions to the deal. Here were some results:

McValue Menu buyers said their main reasons for purchasing were the menu offered a low-priced deal (42 percent), the menu offered options at a variety of price points (28 percent), and they specifically wanted an item (or items) available on the McValue Menu (22 percent).

Compared to all McDonald’s shoppers, McValue Menu buyers were 30 percent more likely to be Black, 15 percent more likely to be low income, 15 percent more likely to have children, and 14 percent more likely to be Hispanic.

Most McValue Menu customers were already loyal McDonald’s guests prior to the launch of the McValue Menu—94 percent went to McDonald’s in the first half of 2024.

Forty-eight percent of McValue Menu buyers said the McValue Menu made them choose McDonald’s instead of going to a different restaurant. The restaurants that they would have visited instead were Burger King (18 percent), Chick-fil-A (17 percent), Wendy’s (14 percent), and Taco Bell (11 percent).

Forty-four percent of McValue Menu buyers said they were going to go to McDonald’s anyway, and 8 percent said they were not planning to eat fast food at all but the McValue Menu caused them to go to McDonald’s.

Ninety-one percent of McValue Menu buyers said they are likely to buy off the menu again.

The top options that McValue Menu buyers would like to see on the menu are more burger options (44 percent), more chicken sandwich options (35 percent), more breakfast sandwich options (34 percent), Filet-O-Fish (33 percent), and sweets & treats (30 percent).

So what do these stats clarify in a vacuum? It does appear McDonald’s is swaying some value-driven customers from competitors, getting back into the occasion set after ceding ground over the past couple of years. But it’s also potentially sending loyal diners down the ladder. Like Kempczinski said, this could be a transitory reaction as customers tap “what’s new,” which also happens to be the value end of the spectrum.

The brand has some non-discounted launches on deck, like Snack Wraps, future Chicken Big Mac drips as an LTO, and a new chicken strip offering. The company believes it can add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026. Globally, its signature McCrispy Sandwich is sold in over 70 markets and will be available in nearly all by the end of this year. It’s a $1 billion brand across several markets.

“We do have, I think, some very exciting food news, food innovation coming in the U.S., but my U.S. team would kill me if I gave any more details about the when and the exact specifics of how we’re going to plan on doing that but certainly expect that to come online later in the year,” Kempczinski said in Q4.

Snack Wraps are a product that left most U.S. menus in 2016, with some restaurants keeping them on through 2020. Introduced in 2006 and priced at $1.29, it’s likely the Snack Wrap not only gives McDonald’s another marketing piece with strong nostalgic pull, but one that can provide a consistent value entry point, either as an add-on or a menu item with ladder-up potential.

BTIG analyst Peter Saleh, from franchisee checks in February, said the McValue platform, $5 Meal Deal, and app/loyalty discounts were accounting for more than a third of sales—three times the company’s historical mix and the highest Saleh could recall.

Plainly, he felt McDonald’s was over-indexing to value with a discount so much higher than the traditional average of low-teens. Some franchisees, he added, indicated food costs as a percent of sales had not been this high in six or seven years, implying margin pressure. Several franchisees, reportedly, raised prices on the BOGO items before the deal went into effect to protect margins.

The BOGO represented a mid-teens percent of mix, while the $5 Meal Deal was still in the low double-digits, placing the total discount block north of 30 percent, as mentioned, when including existing app/loyalty discounts (mid-single digits).

Although McDonald’s dealt with inflation, investment in value, and the E. coli incident in 2024, U.S. franchisees still achieved cash flows north of $500,000 per unit, the company claimed.

But broadly, more clarity will come in 2025 as McDonald’s emerges from the E. coli incident and stretches past January weather. Will the brand be able to move its loyal guests off deep discounts and bring in new ones?

It’s a verdict that’s going to have to wait.",https://www.qsrmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/McDsSign.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 12:10:50.532546

But Coca-Cola’s growth strategy goes beyond new products.
While not responsible for creative messaging, Publicis must ensure the brand’s messages reach the right consumers at the right time.","In adland, account wins and losses dominate the headlines, but the real story is what happens next.

Now, in the next chapter of the age-old soda wars, Publicis has won Coca-Cola’s U.S. media business from incumbent WPP, while PepsiCo is doubling down on its future, acquiring the fast-growing prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion.

Beyond the agency shakeups and corporate restructuring, the bigger question is how these brands are actually performing and what challenges lie ahead. For Coca-Cola, the real test is whether its business strategy is built for long-term growth in an increasingly competitive, health-conscious industry.

To evaluate the soda giant’s position and cut through the noise, Campaign Red analyzed the company’s financial performance, strategic direction and the broader forces shaping its future.

Coca-Cola’s financial tightrope

One of Coca-Cola’s biggest challenges is that consumers aren’t buying significantly more of its products than they did last year.

In North America, unit case volume growth — a key measure of consumer demand — has remained flat. This metric reflects the change in the total number of Coca-Cola beverage cases sold, whether by the company itself or by its bottling partners.

While sparkling flavors and Coca-Cola’s signature brand saw modest growth, sales of water, sports drinks, coffee and tea declined, dragging down overall performance.

The only real momentum came from juice, dairy and plant-based beverages, which saw the strongest gains. Brands in this category include Core Power, fairlife, Minute Maid and Simply.

Yet despite sluggish volume growth, the soda maker’s revenue is climbing.

The reason? Higher prices and shifts in product and packaging mix.

The company’s North American net operating revenue rose 11% in 2024 compared to 2023, but price increases and changes in package and category mix drove nearly all of the gains.

Rather than selling significantly more drinks, Coca-Cola is making more per unit, which has fueled double-digit revenue growth but raises questions about long-term sustainability in a competitive market.

Coca-Cola’s profitability is also under pressure. Operating income in North America declined by 2% year over year, dropping from $4.44 billion in 2023 to $4.34 billion in 2024.

The company’s North American operating margin shrank by 3.1 percentage points, a sign of rising costs, higher expenses and other financial pressures.

Coca-Cola attributed the decline to higher commodity costs, increased marketing spending and higher operating expenses, challenges that even a 1% increase in concentrate sales volume and “favorable pricing initiatives” couldn’t fully offset.

The ‘total beverage company’ approach

With soda consumption under increasing pressure, Coca-Cola has leaned into its “total beverage company” business strategy, expanding beyond traditional soft drinks to diversify its product portfolio.

The company has invested heavily in juices, dairy, plant-based beverages and functional drinks, hoping to meet changing consumer preferences. A key test of this strategy is Simply Pop, Coca-Cola’s latest foray into the fast-growing prebiotic soda space — a category that rival PepsiCo recently tapped into with its $1.95 billion acquisition of Poppi.

However, Simply Pop faces an uphill battle against Poppi, which has already built strong brand awareness and consumer loyalty.

According to a recent survey by consumer insights firm Zappi, nearly half of 1,000 U.S. soda drinkers recognized Poppi as a brand offering prebiotic and probiotic beverages, while only 14% were aware of Simply Pop.

But Coca-Cola’s growth strategy goes beyond new products. The company has also overhauled its marketing approach, shifting away from traditional TV ads and increasing digital ad spend from less than 30% in 2019 to approximately 60% in 2023.

This shift is at the heart of Coca-Cola’s effort to “recruit the next generation of drinkers.” Instead of casting a wide net with TV ads that once reached 80-90% of the population, the company is now using digital segmentation to focus its marketing dollars on those most likely to buy.

Coca-Cola segments consumers into four key groups: “Weekly plus” drinkers, “intenders,” “neutrals” and “rejectors.”

By filtering out those unlikely to convert and zeroing in on “positive intenders,” people who already drink in the category but either prefer a competitor’s product or don’t buy Coca-Cola as often, the brand is sharpening its digital strategy to make every marketing dollar count.

“You don’t need to invest dollars behind [rejectors],” said Manolo Arroyo, Coca-Cola’s global CMO in a presentation during Q3 2023. “That drives a very different dynamic in this whole model.”

Uncertain waters: The challenges ahead

Coca-Cola’s future growth is also deeply intertwined with political and regulatory hurdles.

U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed banning the use of federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funds to “buy soda or processed foods,” calling these products “poison.” If enacted, such a policy could have ripple effects on soda consumption and sales.

The beverage giant, and the soda industry at large, is no stranger to public health debates, but the Kennedy-led “Make America Healthy Again” movement could introduce new obstacles.

The company is also facing the possibility of new taxes on sugary drinks and increasing governmental regulations around ingredients, additives and manufacturing processes. These could impact not only consumer behavior but also Coca-Cola’s profitability.

Additionally, stricter regulations on the advertising, labeling and sale of sweetened beverages could become further threats to Coca-Cola’s ability to connect with consumers.

“If negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image, corporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer,” the company said in its latest annual financial report.

In response to these growing concerns, Coca-Cola has reinforced its commitment to a broader beverage portfolio, emphasizing its low- and no-calorie options, clear nutritional labeling and responsible marketing practices, such as not targeting children under 13 with ads.

The critical challenge remains: Can Coca-Cola sustain long-term growth in a market where health-conscious and functional beverages are gaining priority among consumers, regulators and retailers?

Enter Publicis, Coca-Cola’s newly appointed U.S. media agency. While not responsible for creative messaging, Publicis must ensure the brand’s messages reach the right consumers at the right time. The success of this strategy will determine whether Coca-Cola can maintain its dominance, or whether PepsiCo’s aggressive push into functional beverages will force it to rethink its approach yet again.",https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/150/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/SUC/Coca-Cola-analysis-CUS.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 12:11:02.537872

This figure represents a decrease of 10 percent compared to the 50 million euros in profit recorded the previous year.","Madrid – The jewellers Tous have just reported their financial results at the close of their latest financial year in 2024. This was the first year that the company concluded under the implementation of its new strategic “GEM” plan. This plan has proven to be a real game-changer, given the outstanding performance achieved, surpassing the 500 million euros turnover mark for the first time in its history.

Based on the financial information shared by the management of the Manresa-based firm, Tous closed 2024 with a turnover of 523 million euros. This figure represents an increase of 9.6 percent compared to the 477 million euros in sales invoiced during the previous year. It also leaves the Spanish company growing by 32.4 percent compared to the 395 million euros it achieved in 2019, the last year completed before the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

Regarding its profitability, Tous reported an EBITDA that decreased to 114 million euros (minus 1.72 percent year-over-year), resulting in a net profit that totalled 45 million euros. This figure represents a decrease of 10 percent compared to the 50 million euros in profit recorded the previous year. However, it is still plus 50 percent higher than the 30 million euros in net profit recorded in 2019. Tous attributes this drop in profit to exchange rates.

“In 2024, we successfully met the objectives set for the first year of the ‘GEM’ plan,” said Carlos Soler-Duffo, chief executive officer of Tous. He defended the results in a statement shared by the management team. “Tous is now a stronger brand, with a solid global presence and a unique differential proposition in jewellery.” He added that Tous has “solid levers that have translated into results and on which we will continue working to drive our sustainable growth”.

Organic growth, with new retail formats

Delving into the company’s performance throughout 2024, sales in Tous stores accounted for 76.5 percent of the company’s total turnover, at 400 million euros (plus 8.9 percent). The online channel increased from 23 to 23.5 percent of the company’s total sales in one year, at approximately 122.9 million euros (plus 12 percent).

Regarding these same channels, Tous highlighted that, for the physical channel, sales growth occurred in a year in which its commercial network remained stable. The company focused on updating and renovating its store fleet to boost turnover, with approximately 50 renovations carried out throughout the year. These improvements have served to start developing new store concepts, such as the first points of sale for the new formats dedicated exclusively to its Tous Atelier and Suot Studio lines. As for the online channel, the firm has taken a further step in its commitment to internationalisation, with the launch of its new global website in 2024. This launch complements the network of over 600 physical stores that Tous has in 40 countries.

Regarding its performance by country and region, Tous has limited itself to pointing out that, following the organic growth that has sustained it in 2024, this in turn “has been widespread in all regions, including the most mature markets for Tous”, such as Spain and Mexico. These operations have enabled the brand to strengthen itself on a global scale, one of the main objectives of the “GEM” plan. The eyewear, watch and perfume collections produced through the assignment of licenses have also contributed to this, generating a global business volume of approximately 200 million euros, in terms of sales to the end customer.

At the beginning of the month, Starbucks removed 13 drinks from its menu.","Starbucks took a shot in the dark with their new policy, and it’s bean working.

The coffee giant has been making moves to rebrand their stores as classic coffeehouses for communities to “sit and stay” — and it’s paying off, according to numbers shared with Axios.

At the end of January, Starbucks implemented a new refill policy where customers ordering in-store have to say if they would like their drink “for here” or “to go.”

Those who order “for here” get their drink served in a ceramic mug, glass or a personal cup. These people are able to get free refills during their visit on hot brewed or iced coffee, or hot or iced tea.

Starbucks revealed to Axios that over the past three weeks, “the number of customers who choose ceramic mugs and glasses to sit and stay in cafes has on average increased by more than 3X in the U.S.”

Customers must have their first drink served in one of these reusable cups in order to receive free refills, and no disposable or plastic vessels can get free refills — which is encouraging some patrons to stay awhile.

New CEO Brian Niccol — who took the helm back in September — said at the company’s annual shareholders meeting last week that he was “pleased at the early reaction to changes we’ve made from both customers and partners.”

These changes come as Starbucks is hoping to increase foot traffic and sales as part of its “Back to Starbucks” initiative, a plan to simplify offerings and return to its roots.

The company is “leaning into our coffee culture,” Tressie Lieberman, Starbucks’ global chief brand officer, told Axios.

“We’re reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse and reintroducing Starbucks to the world,” Lieberman added.

The coffee giant is aiming to expand their reach, investing in ads on TV and streaming that will “evoke the feeling that ‘I want to go to Starbucks.'”

Starbucks has already started to test new designs in select locations, too, bringing back “more comfortable seating and spaces,” further giving stores an old-school vibe where customers can sit for hours relaxing or doing remote work.

New designs include “expanded seating options, power outlets, and abundant food displays” as well as some locations with “more separation between the cafe and mobile order experience,” the company revealed to Axios.

Niccol has been making quite a few changes to the popular coffee chain since he came aboard from Chipotle.

When he started, he noted that one of his priorities to accelerate growth at the company is to simplify the “overly complex” menu so baristas can speed up service with a goal to cut “roughly 30%” of food and drink options from its menu by late 2025. At the beginning of the month, Starbucks removed 13 drinks from its menu.

The company also recently shared that users on the Starbucks app and website will no longer be able to make certain modifications because these changes are included in beverages that already exist on the menu.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/starbucks-shift-entices-customers-sit-101078504.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-03-25 11:04:10.529912

In a statement, Conagra said the facility will close by the end of June this year.

The company behind brands such as Birds Eye and Duncan Hines said the closure is a bid to manage its facilities and overall operations as “effectively and efficiently as possible”.

Conagra added the production of pie filling will be relocated to another facility, although specific details have not been disclosed.

The closure follows Conagra’s shutdown of its Birds Eye frozen vegetables plant in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, in April, which impacted 252 workers.

Alongside these operational changes, Conagra has trimmed its full-year sales forecast due to supply chain disruptions affecting two product categories.

Last month, the company projected organic net sales to decline by approximately 2%, revising its previous guidance of a potential 1.5% decline at worst to flat at best.

Conagra has also lowered its outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $2.35, down from the previous range of $2.45 to $2.50.

The adjusted operating margin forecast has been reduced to approximately 14.4% from 14.8%.

During the quarter, gross profit remained stable at $847m, while adjusted gross profit fell by 2.3% to $842m “as productivity and higher organic net sales were offset by the negative impacts of cost of goods sold inflation and unfavourable operating leverage”.

Net sales up by 12.9% to CHF 361.3 million; adjusted for currency effects, growth was 13.6%.

EBITDA improved by 13.6% to CHF 57.0 million; EBITDA margin reaches 15.8%.

Dividend of CHF 0.40 per share proposed for the 2024 financial year.

Strategic initiatives for integrated process systems and a higher degree of standardization in the equipment business are on track; pre-approved services to start in 2026.

For 2025, a revenue growth in the mid-teens and an EBITDA margin between 14 and 16% are targeted.

Allschwil, 25 March 2025 – The SKAN Group can report another successful financial year. Market growth continued unabated in 2024. The ongoing trend towards injectable drugs, and thus towards SKAN’s process solutions for the aseptic filling of biopharmaceutical active ingredients, ensured high demand among customers. In the reporting year, there was particularly strong demand for filling lines for antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) – modern oncology drugs that enable more targeted therapies. SKAN received several orders in the double-digit million range for such large and complex lines with the highest quality requirements. Another, albeit less pronounced, driver was equipment for filling GLP-1 drugs for obesity, which accounted for around 15% of the order intake in the reporting year. Last but not least, the logjam of orders that occurred after the coronavirus boom has now been cleared.

Taken together, these factors contributed to a marked increase in incoming orders compared to the previous year. In particular, a significant increase in requests for quotations was noticeable from May onwards, reflected in an acceleration of incoming orders towards the end of 2024. The success rate for quotations remained high, which is attributable to the high quality and leading technology of SKAN systems as well as its process expertise. This enabled SKAN to consolidate its position as number one in the high-end segment of the isolator market.

Strong order intake

Overall, the SKAN Group recorded incoming orders of CHF 359.5 million. This corresponds to an increase of 21.8% compared to the previous year. The order backlog climbed to CHF 318.3 million, which gives us good visibility in the equipment business for the rest of the year. The SKAN Group increased its net sales by 12.9% to CHF 361.3 million; adjusted for currency effects, growth was 13.6%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) grew by 13.6% to CHF 57.0 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 15.8%.

In terms of sales growth, the SKAN Group fell short of the expectation communicated for 2024. This was due to the fact that some projects were postponed to 2025. Although the relevant systems were already at the customers' premises at the end of the year, work on-site was delayed. At the EBITDA margin level, however, the target was exceeded.

Profit for the 2024 financial year amounted to CHF 40.8 million. The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting of SKAN Group AG on 7 May 2025 that a dividend of CHF 0.40 per share be distributed.

Equipment & Solutions with progress in integration and standardization

The Equipment & Solutions segment increased the order intake in the financial year 2024 by 19.6% to CHF 255.0 million. Net sales rose by 14.3% to CHF 270.9 million. The segment thus contributed 75% of the SKAN Group's total sales. The segment's EBITDA rose by 12.9% to CHF 30.3 million, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 11.2%.

In the reporting year, the SKAN Group generated good sales of large-scale systems, including those used for the aseptic filling of the aforementioned ADC or GLP-1 substances. At the same time, the trend towards personalized medications requires smaller production batches, and thus smaller, flexible systems. The integrated systems that the SKAN Group has been developing for some time together with Aseptic Technologies and other long-standing partner companies are designed to meet these requirements. In the reporting year, a large portion of the expenditures for research and development, which corresponded to 8.3% of sales, was invested in the development of such integrated solutions.

The SKAN Group also made good progress with the strategic initiative to increase the degree of standardization of the systems. Measurable successes were seen in a reduction of complexity through the use of standardized components and the associated increase in efficiency.

An extraordinary contribution to the sales of the Equipment & Solutions segment was made last year by the trading business, which fulfilled a major order for 246 biosafety cabinets for a Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer.

Services & Consumables benefits from growing installed base

The Services & Consumables segment recorded an order intake of CHF 104.5 million in the 2024 financial year, 27.6% more than in the previous year. Net sales increased by 9.0% to CHF 90.4 million and EBITDA amounted to CHF 26.6 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 29.5%.

One driver of growth in the service business is the continuous expansion of the installed base of SKAN systems. These require maintenance, periodic requalification as required by regulations, and spare parts. The retrofit business – the renewal of technical equipment and software for older isolators – also developed favorably.

As expected, the subsidiary Aseptic Technologies continued to see growing acceptance of its automated processing solutions for closed vials. New drugs filled in AT-Closed Vials® have been approved for distribution, meaning that eight drugs had been approved by health authorities in 17 regions and launched by the end of 2024. The development pipeline of medications to be filled in a AT-Closed Vial® contains several hundred active ingredients. Accordingly, the sales volume of AT-Closed Vial® and associated consumables, such as filling sets, is expected to increase further in the future.

The Pre-Approved Services project was also driven forward in the reporting year. The response from initial selective customer discussions has been extremely positive. According to the current project status, the inspection by the Swiss regulatory authority is planned for the first quarter of 2026, so that commercial operation can start in the second half of 2026.

Investments in future growth

Most of the investments, totaling CHF 53.8 million, were used to develop pre-approved services in the 2024 financial year. The remaining funds were used to expand infrastructure in Switzerland and Belgium.

Cash flow from operating activities rose significantly, from CHF 8.7 million to CHF 46.7 million, primarily driven by increased profitability, reduced inventory levels, and effective management of trade receivables. Equity at the end of 2024 amounted to CHF 202.6 million, corresponding to an equity ratio of 52.7%.

Sustainability strategy in place and responsibilities defined

In the 2024 financial year, SKAN pushed ahead with its sustainability policy and anchored it even more firmly within the company. A group-wide ESG strategy has been adopted to ensure that sustainability considerations are systematically integrated into business activities. The corresponding responsibilities have also been defined. At the Board of Directors level, Vice President Cornelia Gehrig is responsible for sustainability, while CEO Thomas Huber is responsible for sustainability at the Executive Board level.

In addition to the sustainability report in accordance with the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) standard, which SKAN has been publishing since 2021, the company successfully completed the assessment of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for the first time last year. This assessment provided a comprehensive understanding of the climate-related opportunities and risks that are relevant to the business. In addition, the necessary data collection was established in the reporting year to comply with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which will be required at the European level.

SKAN confirms double-digit growth target for 2025

The SKAN Group is focused on a market that is benefiting from structural growth. The medical applications targeted by the customers' medications will continue to increase. The trend towards injectable drugs will continue, as will the shift from traditional clean rooms to superior isolator technology. Accordingly, customer demand for aseptic filling process solutions and related services and consumables will also continue.

Due to the nature of the project business, there may be delays in the execution of orders. From today's perspective, the Board of Directors and Management therefore expect a subdued sales development in the first half of 2025. The resulting shortfall in sales and earnings should be largely compensated for in the second half of the year, so that sales growth in the mid-teens is expected for the full year. At the EBITDA margin level, a target between 14% and 16% has been set.

In addition to the structural growth drivers and the high order backlog, the strong order intake in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first months of 2025 are particularly encouraging. Furthermore, some customers have reserved production capacities for the coming months. The newly acquired projects will be reflected in sales in the second half of 2025 and then especially in 2026.

ID35,Starbucks,2025-03-25 10:03:32+00:00,Modern Retail,"From Starbucks to indie brands, soaring bean prices are squeezing the coffee industry","Allison Smith, Gabriela Barkho",,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/operations/from-starbucks-to-indie-brands-soaring-bean-prices-are-squeezing-the-coffee-industry/,"As coffee prices soar, small and mid-sized coffee companies are scrambling to adapt.
For instance, Starbucks locks in its coffee prices through futures contracts 12-18 months in advance, according to company filings.
VitaCup, which is sold online and wholesale through major retailers like Walmart, purchased coffee futures, locking in prices at below $3 a pound.
Changing consumer behavior As coffee prices remain elevated, Leslie expects consumers to shift more of their habits home.
All told, coffee companies are bracing for more volatility — and trying to plan ahead, even amid the uncertainty.","It was the second significant cost increase Hart had faced in less than a year. Just a few months earlier, Couple’s Coffee had axed its social media manager, even though Hart knew it would hurt the brand’s visibility, to keep prices stable for customers. Now, with another cost hike on the horizon, there wasn’t much fat left to trim.

“We’re kind of cornered,” she said. “This time, we have no choice but to raise prices.”

What’s more, Hart’s roaster warned of not just higher bean prices, but also widespread strain across the coffee supply chain — including bankruptcies, defaults and the possibility that Trump’s sweeping tariffs would further hit the industry hard.

Prices of arabica beans — a staple of major coffee chains like Starbucks — have surged over the past year, with arabica futures hitting an all-time high above $4.30 per pound in February. Prices for robusta beans, a cheaper variety typically used for instant coffee, have also spiked. It’s all because of droughts in major producing countries like Brazil and Vietnam, which have tightened supply while demand remains strong.

As coffee prices soar, small and mid-sized coffee companies are scrambling to adapt. In addition to supply disruptions in key producers, the specter of tariffs is also adding another layer of uncertainty for coffee companies. For brands already stretched thin, the cost crunch is forcing hard choices: raise prices, eat the losses or scale back operations.

Coffee’s price reckoning

This year is shaping up to be a reckoning for the industry, according to Brandon Fishman, founder of San Diego-based VitaCup, a vitamin-infused coffee brand. That’s because many larger retailers are only now reaching the end of their long-term futures contracts, which had shielded them from the worst of the increases. For instance, Starbucks locks in its coffee prices through futures contracts 12-18 months in advance, according to company filings.

Traditionally, coffee companies invest in the futures market to lock in prices for coffee they will purchase in the future, mitigating the risk of sudden price increases. But supply shortages have persisted, keeping prices high, meaning that coffee companies who hedged their bets in the futures markets are feeling the pinch now, too, and are poised to pass the price off to customers, who are already paying more for coffee than ever. In February 2025, the average price of ground roast coffee climbed to a record high of $7.25 a pound, according to the federal data.

VitaCup, which is sold online and wholesale through major retailers like Walmart, purchased coffee futures, locking in prices at below $3 a pound. But now, those contracts are expiring, and the brand will have to pay around $4 a pound moving forward.

Samuel Klein, green coffee buyer at New York-based Partners Coffee, said that looking back about five years ago, much of the conversation within the coffee industry was actually about prices being unsustainably low. That’s because coffee can often be unprofitable to grow, and yield is dependent on weather patterns or disease. But just in the past year alone, Klein said, the rate of upward trend has been rapid. “Coffee is about twice as expensive now,” he said.

“I don’t think people understand the scale of what’s coming. I’m not talking about 10% price increases. It could be 50% or more, especially on private-label brands at big-box stores,” Fishman said. “Come April or May, a lot of those contracts expire, and that’s when the market will really feel it.”

Indeed, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri told investors in January that rising coffee costs are squeezing profits. The impact is even greater in the company’s packaged goods division, where price volatility is hitting “in a more meaningful way,” she said.

VitaCup increased its prices twice in the last six months, a dollar each time. Fishman expects more hikes to come. “We’re also cutting software, anything we can,” he said.

Tariff pressure

For coffee brands, the uncertainty around tariffs adds another layer of stress.

“What I’m more concerned about is decaf coffee, because the overwhelming majority of it is processed in either Canada or Mexico,” said Partners Coffee’s Klein.

Craig Leslie, founder of The Bean Coffee Company, is also feeling the squeeze on decaf coffee. “Swiss water decaf, in particular, has gotten very expensive,” he said. “We’ve raised prices three times on Amazon and twice on our website.”

For now, 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada have been delayed until April 2. However, brands still don’t have clear insight into exactly what tariffs will take effect on April 2, as Trump has gone back and forth on his trade policies since he took office.

Terminology around importing policy is currently vague, complicating matters further, according to Klein. For instance, it’s not always clear whether coffee should be classified by the country where it was grown or where it was processed, such as beans grown in Brazil but decaffeinated in Mexico.

“Decaf coffee is already expensive to produce and transport,” he said, as it’s often transported across complex supply chains across North America and the European Union.

The family-owned Cafe Aroma, which has been in business since 1961, has recently been buying coffee opportunistically when the market dips or avoiding committing to longer-term futures contracts in case prices come down, the company’s vp Bernadette Gerrity told Modern Retail.

Similarly, Klein’s buying strategy has been focused on meticulous planning and not over-ordering coffee to bring into the U.S. “But obviously the margin for me to make a mistake is a lot smaller than it was a year ago,” he said.

Changing consumer behavior

As coffee prices remain elevated, Leslie expects consumers to shift more of their habits home. “I think people are going to stop spending $4 or $5 at a coffee shop and brew more at home,” he said.

That shift is already playing out on a larger scale. J.M. Smucker, which owns brands like Folgers and Café Bustelo, hiked its prices last summer, and again in October. But instead of seeing a drop in demand, the company saw its net sales in the U.S. coffee side of the business rise 2% in the most recent quarter, driven by higher prices and steady demand.

“Overall, at-home coffee remains a strong and resilient category that provides value to consumers in all economic environments,” Mark Smucker, the company’s CEO, told investors on an earnings call last month.

All told, coffee companies are bracing for more volatility — and trying to plan ahead, even amid the uncertainty.

As Klein put it, “I need to pay closer attention to the market circumstances and have a good understanding of what the next six months or a year could look like.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/glossy_coffee.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 12:11:23.821537

WARNING LETTER

Mr. Santamarta:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Unipharma, LLC, FEI 3011079709, at 10200 NW 67th Street, Tamarac, Florida from April 22 to May 7, 2019.

This warning letter summarizes significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211.

Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).

In addition, your firm manufactures “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” that is an unapproved new drug in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d). Additionally, “CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” is misbranded under section 502(c) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(c). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). These violations are described in more detail below.

We reviewed your May 28, 2019, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence.

During our inspection, our investigator observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.

CGMP Violations

1. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or not the batch has already been distributed (21 CFR 211.192).

You use (b)(4) water to manufacture over-the-counter (OTC) drug products. Several drug products that you manufacture are intended for infant and pediatric use. You released multiple batches of OTC drug products manufactured with (b)(4) water although test results indicated an adverse trend of Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia) in your water system. Objectionable microbiological contamination of water used in manufacturing could lead to contamination of your drug products and pose a hazard to patients.

Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate the persistent adverse trend of objectionable microorganisms identified in your (b)(4) water samples during qualification that you commenced in late 2018, as well as during routine monitoring. Your firm initiated an investigation to address the microorganisms identified during system qualification.

Some of the microorganisms identified by your water sampling are known to contribute to biofilm formation in (b)(4) water systems and can be a source of objectionable contamination of drug products.

While the investigation was ongoing, you approved the performance qualification for your water system on December 1, 2018, which included a corrective action that improved the (b)(4) water sample collection process. (b)(4) water system testing continued to find low levels of B. cepacia at points-of-use and in the pretreatment portion of the (b)(4) water system. The pretreatment portion also had too numerous to count (TNTC) levels of microorganisms on multiple occasions.

At the end of the inspection, you stopped manufacturing your OTC drug products, placed the (b)(4) water system in a quarantine status, and recalled all your distributed drug products in an abundance of caution.

In your response, you started a new investigation, which has identified (b)(4) sanitization issues, sampling method errors, and preventive maintenance deficiencies. You implemented a corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) plan and are taking additional actions including revisions to standard operating procedures before restarting the (b)(4) water system.

Your response is inadequate because you have not comprehensively investigated all potential root causes for your water system control deficiencies. For example, you did not provide an investigation of the pretreatment sample location, PWI, where microbial analysis results were deemed as TNTC. Your investigation also did not include a sufficient assessment of equipment design deficiencies and system weaknesses, including but not limited to point-of-use attachments (such as transfer valves and piping), potential dead-legs, and preventive maintenance frequencies for system components. Your response also failed to address how you will ensure investigations in the future will be thorough, carefully reviewed by management, and the effectiveness of CAPAs determined.

In response to this letter, provide the following:

• A comprehensive, independent assessment of your overall system for investigating deviations, discrepancies, complaints, OOS results, and failures. Provide a detailed CAPA plan to remediate this system. Your action plan should include, but not be limited to, significant improvements in investigation competencies, scope determination, root cause evaluation, CAPA effectiveness, quality assurance oversight, and written procedures. Address how your firm will ensure all phases of investigations are appropriately conducted.

• A comprehensive, independent assessment of your laboratory practices, procedures, methods, equipment, documentation, and analyst competencies. Based on this review, provide a detailed plan to remediate and evaluate the effectiveness of your laboratory system.

• A comprehensive, independent assessment of your water system design, control, and maintenance.

• A thorough remediation plan to operate a suitable water system. Include a robust ongoing control, maintenance, and monitoring program to ensure the remediated system design consistently produces water adhering to (b)(4) Water, USP monograph specifications and appropriate microbial limits. Also include your plan for approving your remediated water system for use in production, and ensuring appropriate quality assurance oversight of both reintroduction of this system as well as oversight of its ongoing state of control

• Validation report for the water system obtained after all identified design issues have been fully corrected and any maintenance repairs have been completed. Include the system validation protocol, the complete test results, and the final validation report.

2. Your firm failed to establish adequate written procedures for production and process control designed to assure that the drug products you manufacture have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess (21 CFR 211.100(a)).

You failed to adequately perform process qualification for each of your OTC drug products. Your qualifications did not include appropriate acceptance criteria for all significant variables. You approved a process qualification report containing a Cpk value (process capability index) of (b)(4) for fill weight during (b)(4) operations.

Your results suggest that your process is not robust. You did not adequately demonstrate that your manufacturing processes are reproducible and controlled to consistently yield drugs of uniform character and quality.

In your response, you stated that Process Performance Qualification for Acetaminophen 160mg/5ml Bulk Solution Protocol, PV-18-0080 was not completed and that you “inadvertently released” acetaminophen 160mg/5ml lot 80061 to the U.S. market. You also stated that you will establish process validation protocols for each product, and will include predetermined critical process parameter specifications in the revised protocols.

Your response is inadequate because you failed to provide detailed process performance qualification protocols and an overall program for assuring ongoing maintenance of a validated process.

See FDA’s guidance document Process Validation: General Principles and Practices for general principles and approaches that FDA considers appropriate elements of process validation at https://www.fda.gov/media/71021/download.

In response to this letter, provide the following:

• A detailed summary of your validation program for ensuring a state of control throughout the product lifecycle, along with associated procedures. Describe your program for process performance qualification, and ongoing monitoring of both intra-batch and inter-batch variation to ensure a continuing state of control.

• A timeline for performing appropriate process performance qualification for each of your marketed drug products.

3. Your firm failed to establish and follow an adequate written testing program designed to assess the stability characteristics of drug products and to use results of stability testing to determine appropriate storage conditions and expiration dates (21 CFR 211.166(a)).

You did not have adequate stability data to demonstrate that the chemical properties of your OTC drug products remain acceptable throughout their labeled two-year expiry period. For example, you had failing assay results for your accelerated stability studies and have not completed long-term stability studies. You lack assurance that each of your drug products can maintain its stability through its expiration period.

In your response, you stated that prior to initial release of commercial OTC drug products, (b)(4) batch will be placed on accelerated stability and be required to have (b)(4) of acceptable data before a two-year expiry can be assigned.

Your response is inadequate because you did not include a stability protocol or test results to demonstrate that your drug products met specifications throughout the labeled expiration period.

In response to this letter, provide a comprehensive, independent assessment and CAPA plan to ensure the adequacy of your stability program. Your remediated program should include, but not be limited to:

• Stability indicating methods.

• Stability studies for each drug product in its marketed container-closure system before distribution is permitted.

• An ongoing program in which representative batches of each product are added each year to the program to determine if shelf-life claims remain valid.

• Detailed definition of the specific attributes to be tested at each station (timepoint).

• All procedures that describe these and other elements of your remediated stability program.

CGMP Consultant Recommended

Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant, qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34, to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements.

Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.

Unapproved New Drug and Misbranding Charges

“Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution”

“Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because it is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, this product is intended for use as a nasal moisturizer1 and nasal decongestant.

Examples of claims observed on the product labeling that establish the intended uses (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the product include, but may not be limited to, the following:

“Nasal decongestant . . . For dry irritated nasal passages . . . Moisturizer . . . Provides natural instant, soothing relief to dry, irritated nasal passages due to cold, allergies, dry air”

OTC drug products intended for use as nasal decongestant drug products, such as “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” are subject to the final rule for Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator, and Antiasthmatic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (cough/cold final rule). See 21 CFR Part 341. However, this product is not labeled or formulated in accordance with this final rule for the reasons explained below.

The product label for “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” does not distinguish active ingredients from inactive ingredients. Therefore, all of the product’s labeled ingredients (water, glycerin, Himalayan salt, and benzalkonium chloride) are deemed to be represented as active ingredients as defined in 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2). However, none of these labeled ingredients are permitted nasal decongestant active ingredients described in the cough/cold final rule. See 21 CFR 341.20.

Thus, as formulated and labeled, “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” does not comply with the final rule described above. Furthermore, we are not aware of sufficient evidence to show “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” as formulated and labeled, is generally recognized as safe and effective. Therefore, this product is a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). As a new drug, “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). “Dr Kids Himasal Natural Nasal Saline Solution” is not the subject of an FDA-approved application, and therefore, the current marketing of this product violates section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d).

“CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer”

“CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because it is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, this product is intended for use as a nasal moisturizer.

Examples of claims observed on the product labeling for “CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” that provide evidence of the intended uses (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the product, and include, but may not be limited to, the following:

“Saline Nasal Moisturizer . . . provides natural instant, soothing relief to dry, irritated nasal passages due to colds, allergies”

The labeling for such drugs, like all OTC drugs, must comply with all of the applicable requirements of section 502 of the FD&C Act and all pertinent regulations found in title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR). However, your product does not meet these requirements for the reasons described below.

“CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” is not labeled in accordance with the “Drug Facts” labeling requirements described in 21 CFR 201.66. Specifically, the product label fails to include a Drug Facts panel. Therefore, this product is misbranded under section 502(c) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(c), because the information that is required to appear on the labeling is not prominently placed thereon with such conspicuousness and in such terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.

The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). Therefore, the marketing of “CVS Health Children’s Nasal Saline Drops Saline Nasal Moisturizer” violates this provision of the FD&C Act.

B&Q owner Kingfisher has revealed its yearly profit dropped by more than a third, flagging weaker demand for big purchases and rising costs following government budgets in the UK and France.

The DIY giant, which also owns Screwfix, said it was expecting around a £145 million hit this year from higher wages, taxes and inflation.

Shares in FTSE 100-listed Kingfisher plunged by more than 12% on Tuesday morning following the update.

The business made a statutory pre-tax profit of £307 million for the year to the end of January – 35% lower than the year before.

On an adjusted basis, which strips out what it views as one-off costs, pre-tax profits were down 7% to £528 million.

Sales edged 0.2% higher in the UK and Ireland, compared with the prior year, but were down 1.7% across the group led by a 6.2% decline in France.

So-called “big-ticket” items – referring to costlier things like kitchen and bathroom ranges, or larger home renovations – declined 4.4% year-on-year.

Kingfisher has consistently flagged that many consumers have delayed buying big-ticket items as they tightened their belts amid the higher cost of living.

Sales nonetheless picked up over the final three months of the financial year, which it attributed to new ranges and campaigns at B&Q.

Screwfix sales were stronger in the UK and Ireland, reflecting demand from its trade customers, although slowed towards the end of the year thanks to milder weather affecting demand for electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling products.

Meanwhile, Kingfisher said it was preparing to reduce costs to help offset the impact of higher wages, taxes and inflation.

The higher rate of national insurance in the UK, and equivalent tax in France, was set to add £45 million to the group’s expenses next year – with about £30 million of that coming from the UK.

London-based Kingfisher, which had about 57,600 staff around the world at the end of the financial year, has also forecast that higher wage costs will add about £90 million to bills over the year ahead.

As part of efforts to mitigate these costs, the group is planning to reduce the size of some of its warehouses around the world, including the UK.

It is aiming to cut space by around 12% by the 2027-28 financial year. It did not give details on how many jobs could be affected by these changes.

Furthermore, the firm wants to focus on growing its share of the wider DIY market, which it said will partly be achieved by converting Homebase stores into B&Qs.

Kingfisher bought eight Homebase shops in the UK and Ireland at the beginning of the year after its rival collapsed into administration.

Thierry Garnier, Kingfisher’s chief executive, said: “It is never great to see a competitor disappearing but for us it should deliver a small benefit.

“We need to keep some caution – there is some short-term uncertainty around employment and mortgage rates but overall we feel resilience and some reasons to feel a bit more optimism this year.”

Mr Garnier added: “Looking to the year ahead, the recent government budgets in the UK and France have raised costs for retailers and impacted consumer sentiment in the near term.”

He said this means the company was “focused on what is in our control” like managing costs and growing its share of the DIY market.

“Kingfisher is in its best operational shape for years, and we remain confident about the growth opportunities in our business,” he said.

The group said it was expecting to report an adjusted pre-tax profit of around £480 million to £540 million in the year ahead. Last year, it made £528 million.

As the debate rages on, this controversy brings to light the difficulties many face when trying to break into the tech industry.","A Reddit user recently dropped a bombshell that's causing quite a stir online. The user claimed that they received a confidential internal hiring memo from a recruiter. The document, which surfaced two days ago, is allegedly revealing details about a company's stringent candidate selection process and has sparked concerns over elitism and exclusion in tech hiring.

List of Blacklisted Companies In US Tech Company:

One of the most controversial elements of the memo involves the exclusion of candidates from certain companies. According to the leaked document, the company has a ""blacklist"" of companies like Intel, Cisco, HP, TCS, Tata, Mahindra, Infosys, Capgemini, Dell, Cognizant, and Wipro. The memo states that individuals who have worked at these firms are ""not the right fit"" for their hiring standard.

Restrictions For International Professionals:

The document also mentions nationality-based hiring restrictions, explicitly stating that no visa sponsorships will be offered. This means only U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and Canadians are eligible to apply, effectively shutting out a wide pool of talented international professionals.

Strict Selection Criteria Favoring Elite Universities:

According to the leaked memo, the company has very specific criteria for the ideal candidate. It states that candidates must hold a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science from only top-tier institutions like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Caltech, UIUC, and the University of Waterloo.

The memo goes further to mention that while exceptions could be made for graduates from other schools, only those who achieved a perfect 4.0 GPA would be considered. This immediately raised questions about the fairness and inclusivity of such strict standards.

Additionally, candidates are required to have between four and ten years of software development experience. The memo also specifies that expertise in modern JavaScript frameworks, such as TypeScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, and familiarity with AI/LLMs, is essential.

Viral Reaction and Industry Backlash

The Reddit user who leaked the memo expressed their frustration with the hiring policies, calling them ""pretentious and elitist."" Despite meeting most of the criteria listed in the document themselves, the user found the company's approach troubling, feeling it was exclusionary. The post quickly went viral, with many others sharing their own experiences of being overlooked due to similar hiring practices.

One user commented, ""I work for a big company and have been trying to move into tech for years, but they only hire from certain universities."" This comment struck a chord with many, further fueling the outrage.

Adding to the conversation, an ex-L7 Facebook engineer weighed in, suggesting that this type of selective hiring is not unusual in the tech industry. They explained that top-tier Computer Science schools continue to be the main pipeline for early-career tech jobs.

Is Hiring Memo Fake or Real?

While many users were outraged by the revelations, some remained skeptical about the authenticity of the memo. They accused the Reddit user of fabricating the guidelines. However, Michael Novati, a moderator of the subreddit ""codingbootcamp"" and a former Facebook employee, came to the Reddit user's defense, confirming that the original post had provided additional confidential evidence supporting the document's legitimacy.

Novati said, ""If I had to guess, I'd say it's more likely real than fake,"" although he acknowledged that absolute verification was impossible.

Biased Hiring Practices In Tech Industry?

As the debate rages on, this controversy brings to light the difficulties many face when trying to break into the tech industry. The backlash highlights concerns about biased hiring practices and the increasing exclusivity within the sector, which has long been criticized for favoring elite schools and companies.

While it is impossible to verify the exact details of the leaked memo, the conversation it has sparked is making it clear: the tech industry's hiring practices may need a serious reevaluation to become more inclusive, fair, and transparent for everyone.",https://images.goodreturns.in/img/2025/03/images1-1742891839.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 06:01:07.536609

SPINEWAY

Consolidated 2024 annual results

Annual revenue of €12 million (+14%)

Operating income close to breakeven

Reduction in net loss

The Board of Directors of Spineway, meeting on March 24, 2025 under the chairmanship of Stéphane Le Roux, approved the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The Spineway Group, a specialist in innovative implants for the treatment of severe spine disorders reported annual revenue of €12 million in FY 2024, representing organic growth of 14% (excluding changes in the scope of consolidation) compared with FY 2023. This acceleration benefited from the successful integration of the Distimp and Spine Innovations acquisitions, which have strengthened the Group’s premium ranges and boosted sales in this segment.

Improved results in 2024

The increase in revenue, also driven by the various presentations and surgeon training sessions on ESP2 prostheses, was accompanied by a significant improvement in FY 2024 results.

Good control of purchasing allowed the gross margin to be maintained at 69%. Similarly, the Group’s cost optimization plan, particularly with regard to personnel and operating expenses, paid off in full over the year, with these two items down 14% and 28% respectively compared with FY 2023. Over the period, Spineway continued its regulatory and clinical investments to obtain new export approvals and CE/MDR certifications.

The careful management of operating expenses, combined with the increase in revenue, was reflected in a €3.6 million reduction in the operating loss to €0.9 million in FY 2024, compared with a loss of €4.5 million in FY 2023.

Financial expense was penalized by the recognition of an exceptional financial expense of €1.5 million in the first half due to the compensation mechanism of the Negma financing agreement, and thus amounted to €2.5 million. Over the full year, the Group recorded an exceptional loss of €0.5 million, mainly linked to the reduction in headcount.

As a result, the net loss improved significantly to €3.9 million in FY 2024, compared with a loss of €6.5 million in FY 2023. Adjusted for the exceptional expense related to the Negma agreement, the Group’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was €2.4 million.

Strengthened cash position of €4.5 million as of December 31, 2024

Between the start of the convertible bond (OCA) issue and subscription agreement concluded with Negma3 and December 31, 2024, 4,341 bonds were converted into 1,690,241,419 shares. After the reverse stock split in February 20244 and the reduction of the par value of the shares in December 2024, Spineway’s share capital as of December 31, 2024 was €57,584.57, consisting of 28,792,276 shares with a par value of 0.002 euros each. To date, 90 OCA bonds remain available for subscription prior to the expiration of this agreement, scheduled for May 2025.

At the end of December 2024, Spineway’s cash position was €4.5 million, i.e. a net cash position of €2.7 million (after deduction of financial debt).

Acceleration of strategic investments to drive future growth

This strong financial performance confirms the relevance of Spineway’s strategic focus on premium ranges and the success of the synergies implemented with Distimp and Spine Innovation, which are enabling the company to strengthen its position in the market for medical devices for the spine.

Following delays, the in-house ESP prosthesis production line is now scheduled to come into service in H1 2025. Once operational, in-house production will enable the Group to be more agile and generate higher margins. In addition, Spineway plans to step up its marketing activities and increase its regulatory investments in order to expand its international presence and access new markets.

These regulatory (product approvals, certifications, etc.) and marketing (training, trade shows, etc.) investments are long-term growth drivers. By combining targeted expansion and controlled cost management, Spineway aims to maintain solid organic growth in order to regain sustainable profitability and a sound financial base in the medium term.

Our team's unparalleled reach and unique capabilities have protected the health of 1.4 billion people, conserved water equivalent to the drinking needs of nearly 800 million people, safeguarded a third of the world's processed food production, and supported more than a fifth of the world's power production. And we delivered our best year ever the right way, being named the most admired company in our industry and one of the world's most ethical companies for the 19th consecutive year.

Ecolab's performance was impressive and broad-based:

• Industrial accelerated its performance, generating strong new business wins

DELIVERING FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS

A s we reflect on another outstanding year for Ecolab, the Board of Directors would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the company's 48,000 associates. Under the capable leadership of Christophe and his executive team, Ecolab has consistently met high expectations, delivered positive impacts for our customers, and provided sustained returns for its shareholders.

By the end of the year, the company achieved record sales, adjusted earnings per share, operating income margins and free cash flow. This performance underpinned the Board's confidence as we approved a 14% increase in our quarterly cash dividend - the 33rd consecutive annual dividend increase.

We have made positive changes to the Board, adding new directors with a range of perspectives and expertise to support the company's growth ambitions.

In February 2024, we welcomed Judson Althoﬀ as an independent director and member of the Audit and Finance Committees. With Ecolab building a new global high-tech business and furthering our digital programs, Judson's global executive and technology experience at Microsoft has proven to be a valuable addition.

In February 2025, we welcomed Michel Doukeris, Chief Executive Oﬀicer of AB InBev, as an independent director. Michel's experience leading a major global company and his deep knowledge of complex operations, world-class branding of innovative products and winning in consumer industries will make him a tremendous asset to the Board.

We also look forward to welcoming another independent director in Marion Gross, currently Executive Vice President and Global Chief Supply Chain Oﬀicer at McDonalds. Marion has extensive international business expertise with specialist knowledge of global supply chains and the foodservice industry. Marion plans to retire from her current executive role prior to her election to the Ecolab Board.

Together, these directors will oﬀer a wealth of knowledge and insights that will help guide Ecolab's growth strategy.

In February 2025, Arthur Higgins informed the board that he would not stand for re-election at the annual meeting. Arthur has provided so much to our Board and to Ecolab, consistently oﬀering independent advice based on his knowledge of the healthcare and life sciences sectors. He has been a valued colleague, and we thank him for his many significant contributions to the company.

As Lead Independent Director, I work to serve the best interests of Ecolab's shareholders by ensuring that your independent directors provide critical oversight and are closely involved in the company's major strategic decisions.

On behalf of the Board, I have also worked to represent your interests by actively seeking and responding to feedback from our investors to align Ecolab's strategies with their interests and expectations.

Finally, the Board would like to thank you for your continued confidence in our company. We have the privilege of witnessing firsthand the many reasons why that confidence is well placed. Ecolab has a history of delivering innovation and high performance, even in uncertain times. The company has the right strategy, leadership and structure to build on its record year and deliver continued shareholder returns.

Artificial Intelligence: Driving water demand, delivering water solutions

The AI revolution is driving demand for data center capacity, and with it, the demand for natural resources. Water plays an essential role in data center cooling, transferring heat 23.5 times more eﬀectively than air. This growing sector has created an urgent need for sustainable solutions that disconnect AI's rapid growth from the strain it traditionally places on natural resources.

In 2024, Ecolab collaborated with Digital Realty, a leading global provider of data center co-location and interconnection solutions, to pilot AI-driven solutions that help minimize water use, maintain system performance and protect data center operations from water-related risks.

Our collaborative eﬀorts are helping Digital Realty evaluate water practices across its sites and implement digitally enabled monitoring and measurement tools to help track and manage progress.

Ecolab is proud to innovate AI-powered water solutions with Digital Realty, showcasing how next-generation technology can elevate water stewardship across industries.

It oﬀers high productivity, lower aggregation and reduced processing time, increasing manufacturing eﬀiciencies and a lower cost per gram of the commercial drug product. DurA Cycle™ resin is the latest addition to Ecolab's Purolite Resins toolbox, addressing the complex purification of modern biologic drugs.

HELPING LOTTE CHEMICAL CLEAR THE AIR TO ACHIEVE ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT GOALS

Insights

Annual Savings

Lotte Chemical, based in Seoul, South Korea, is one of the world's largest chemical companies. It manufactures synthetic resins and other chemical products used in materials such as polystyrene, a versatile plastic commonly used in food packaging, appliances, toys and other goods.

Actions

As part of its eﬀorts to create a better, more sustainable future, Lotte Chemical wanted to source more environmentally conscious chemistry solutions. They chose the dual-component PRISM™ antifoulant program developed by Nalco

Water, Ecolab's water and process management business.

Testing and a rigorous technical evaluation demonstrated that the Ecolab solution performed as well as hazardous alternatives, with a significant reduction in nitrogen oxides. As a result, Lotte Chemical implemented the antifoulant program to help protect critical assets and increase the eﬀiciency of its manufacturing process.

Outcomes

In addition to the environmental benefits that resulted from the switch to the Ecolab program, Lotte Chemical avoided a large capital expenditure that would have been required to meet the stronger emission standards being set for alternative chemistries by the Korean Ministry of Environment. Additionally, it enhanced operational eﬀiciency by substantially reducing the need for urea, a raw material used in the chemistry manufacturing process.

Ultimately, the new approach helped Lotte Chemical reduce costs, pursue a more sustainable solution, and enhance plant and operator safety.",https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,N,,2025-03-24 22:59:12.411732

And patience isn't a virtue that many investors possess.","Nike has warned that sales will drop by a double-digit percentage in its current quarter as the sneaker giant contends with new tariffs, sliding consumer confidence, and a slower-than-expected turnaround. In a conference call with analysts, finance chief Matt Friend said Nike expects its sales decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is set to end in May, to be at the “low end” of the “mid-teens range.” It also anticipates its gross margin will fall between 4 and 5 percentage points as it ramps up efforts to liquidate excess inventory and stale styles that are no longer resonating with consumers — a process it expects to continue into fiscal 2026.

Total Retail's Take: Economics headwinds, highlighted by import tariffs (nearly a quarter of Nike's manufacturers and suppliers are located in China) and declining consumer confidence, are taking a toll on Nike's turnaround efforts. The athletic brand's CEO, Elliott Hill, who left Nike in 2020 and returned last year, is focused on several core areas as he looks to turn around the business, including re-establishing relationships with wholesale partners (think Foot Locker, for example), reigniting innovation in its product lines, and wooing back athletes that have fled to new competitors.

U.S. manufacturing slowed this month and business expectations slumped to the second lowest level since October 2022 as companies, citing tariffs and other Trump administration policy shifts, grew increasingly worried that customer demand will falter in coming months, S&P Global said Monday.

The S&P Global flash manufacturing index fell from 52.7 last month to 49.8 in March, a three-month low, S&P Global said. A reading below 50 signals contraction. Another index showed that service industry growth hit a three-month high of 53.5 even as the sector’s expectations for the future slumped for a third consecutive month.

Business confidence has “darkened, souring further from the buoyant mood seen at the start of the year to one of the gloomiest readings seen over the past three years,” S&P Global Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson said in a statement. Executives most frequently cited tariffs and cuts in federal spending, he said.

Dive Insight:

With manufacturing cooling, the economy will likely slow to just 1.5% annualized growth during the first quarter from a 2.3% pace during Q4, S&P Global predicted.

Economists at several private- and public-sector organizations have marked down their 2025 growth forecasts in recent weeks.

Gross domestic product will probably expand 1.5% during the first half of the year, according to Bank of America economists, a markdown from their 2.5% growth forecast.

Business capital expenditure “is suffering from a lack of clarity on tariffs while aggressive tariff implementation, consumer weakness in January and Department of Government Efficiency cuts also detract” from first half 2025 GDP growth, Candace Browning, head of global research at Bank of America, said Friday in a note to clients.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday downgraded its forecast for economic growth in 2025 to 1.7% from 2.1% in December, with policymakers noting that “uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased.”

The Atlanta Fed last week forecast that gross domestic product will likely shrink at a 1.8% annual rate during the first quarter. The regional bank on March 7 predicted a 1.6% contraction during Q1.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic on Monday echoed the view of policymakers that the outlook is unusually murky.

“What we've heard, and what I've heard, is that we don't really know where the economy is going to go,” Bostic said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “Business leaders don't know, families don't know and local policymakers don't know either.”

“People are taking on board information as it occurs,” he said, noting an increasing expectation that price pressures will rise in coming months. Bostic predicted that policymakers will not restore inflation to their 2% goal until early 2027.

“I think we're going to see inflation be very bumpy and not move dramatically and in a clear way to the 2% target,” he said.

Inflation in both goods and services prices accelerated in March to the fastest pace in 23 months, hitting a 31-month high in manufacturing and an 18-month high in services, S&P Global said.

“Higher costs were first and foremost attributed to tariffs, though increased staffing costs were also widely reported,” S&P Global said.

Policymakers may need to postpone reductions in borrowing costs beyond current forecasts, Bostic said. He predicted that the central bank will trim the federal funds rate just once this year.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/rY_PPbvJ11spyOy81Xv6E0v-f1HaHAfeEuGITQ62npw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ccm93c2VyUHJldmlld190bXAuanBn.webp,N,,2025-03-24 17:02:26.547754

The company licensed software from Empower Delivery, a company that helps operators obtain more control over their delivery options. Starbucks also hired the firm’s six engineers. Meredith Sandland, who served as Empower Delivery CEO for nearly three years, was announced earlier this year as Starbucks’ new chief coffeehouse design and development officer.

The Empower Delivery team will help the coffee giant achieve its four-minute wait time goal and modernize technology in stores.

“Empower Delivery software is, at its core, a timing and coordination engine that gets the right product to the right person at the right time,” Sandland said in a LinkedIn post. “Starbucks was among the very first restaurant brands to have an app. The app’s incredible success has also made Starbucks among the very first restaurant brands to feel the operational impacts of digital sales. The Empower Delivery team’s efforts will be focused on streamlining the Starbucks omnichannel operations, contributing to improving order to handoff speed in the café and drive-thru, while ensuring app customers get their orders on time.”

The brand’s “Back to Starbucks” plan was formulated by Brian Niccol, who became CEO in September. The strategy is focused on reintroducing Starbucks to the world, delivering the customer experience to win the morning and peak periods, reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse, and ensuring Starbucks is a competitive employer.

On January 27, Starbucks shops nationwide began serving beverages in ceramic mugs for guests who choose to sit inside and offering those same customers a free refill of hot and iced brewed coffee and tea. In addition to those amenities, the chain brought back the condiment bar and started writing messages on cups with Sharpie markers like it once did.

Consumers have responded positively. Over the past three weeks, the number of customers who choose ceramic mugs and glassware to sit and stay in cafes has increased by more than 3X on average in the U.S. The company also changed its code of conduct policy so that guests must place an order to stay in the dining room or use the bathroom.

Starbucks released an advertisement called “Stay Awhile” on March 17 that highlights the new benefit of free refills and dining inside.

Additionally, Starbucks will cut its menu by 30 percent, add 3,000 labor hours, pilot a more efficient staffing model, and bring structure to the mobile ordering process. The brand wants its employees to be happy while serving guests as well. The chain doubled paid parental leave for eligible U.S. workers and committed to promote from within for 90 percent of retail leadership roles in the next three years.

In the longer term, Starbucks is testing store redesigns—including more comfortable seating and spaces—to create a better environment for guests who want to sit, work, and meet. The brand is also considering more power outlets to encourage longer stays, dedicated areas for mobile pickup and new risers and pickup shelves for better distinction between in-store and mobile customers, abundant food displays to entice guests to try new items, and a redesigned espresso bar to add a sense of theater to the ordering experience.

The strategy has come with growing pains. In late February, Starbucks announced it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees and remove several hundred unfilled corporate positions to create more versatile and adaptable decision-making.

Starbucks’ U.S. quick-service share recovered in Q1 following two quarters of declines. And it did so despite reducing the frequency of discount-driven offers—there were 40 percent fewer such transactions in the period, year-over-year. Through the quarter, the brand saw a shift in sales mix toward coffee and espresso-based beverages, which over-delivered and compensated for lower-than-expected performance across holiday promotions.

Same-store sales declined 4 percent (8 percent drop in traffic and 4 percent rise in ticket) in the North America and U.S., yet improved over the course of three months, and non-Starbucks Rewards traffic grew, quarter-over-quarter. Members and spend lifted versus Q4 and year-over-year, and price parity for non-dairy milk customizations brought back lapsed Rewards users.",https://www.qsrmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/starbucksrestaurant.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 17:02:34.706487

Less than four years ago, Nike’s market valuation was more than $280 billion. Now, with its share price at a five-year low of $66.97, it dropped to $99.16 billion.

But analysts and Nike's CEO are urging investors to hold tight and be patient during the decline.

After Nike reported earnings Thursday afternoon, Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser encouraged investors to buy Nike’s dip, and reminded them that “the cleanup now underway was the result of consultant-like strategy by Nike's prior administration,” in a Friday letter.

Poser’s poke at consultants was a reference to Nike’s former CEO John Donahoe, who was only the second outsider to run the company.

Donahoe continued the aggressive direct-to-consumer strategy pushed by his predecessor CEO Mark Parker that slashed its retail partners.

In a report immediately following Nike’s March 20 earnings call, Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets reminded his investors that “turns take time.”

“Nike's working to return to what made it special: outspending competition with compelling storytelling, R&D and partnering with others for distribution (a playbook we've seen them execute before),” wrote Siegel.

“This is clearly not for everyone as turns take time but we expect troughing-then-improvement to kick in over the next several quarters, suggesting opportunity for those with duration.”

That patience is something Nike CEO Elliott Hill is banking on from investors and analysts alike.

On the earnings call, Hill said Nike will achieve growth through reducing orders for classic silhouettes it over-invested in the last several years, like Air Force 1s and Dunks, and move the discounts on its digital platforms to its outlet stores to ensure its digital business is no longer relying on discounted sales.

Digital revenue next quarter will likely take a hit as a result, Hill noted, but added that he hopes it will improve by the second quarter of next year.

""Success for Nike has never been about protecting our turf. We force others to play our game. We drive trends, grow markets and we lead,"" Hill told analysts. ""What we're asking of our teammates right now is to keep up the intensity, to move with focus and urgency, to have passion and take pride in all that we do to win as a team.""

BYD closes out record 2024 with over $100 billion in sales

BYD set all kinds of records in the fourth quarter and the full year in 2024. In a filing on Monday, BYD announced 2024 revenue reached 777.1 billion yuan, or about $107 billion.

Despite undercutting rivals in China’s ongoing EV price war and launching several lower-priced models, BYD’s revenue was up 29% compared to 2023. In comparison, Tesla reported 2024 revenue of $97.7 billion, up 1% year-over-year (YOY)

In the last three months of 2024, BYD’s revenue hit a record 274.85 billion yuan ($38 billion), up 53% from the year prior. Fourth quarter net income reached 15.02 billion yuan ($2.07 billion), up 52% YOY and another record.

BYD’s impressive performance was largely due to a record-breaking 1.5 million new energy vehicle (PHEV and EV) sales in Q4.

Although Tesla held its lead with 1.79 million EVs delivered in 2024 (compared to BYD’s 1.76 million EV sales), BYD slipped past Tesla with 1.778 million EVs produced.

Although BYD’s gross margins slipped from 21.9% in Q3 2024 to 17% in the fourth quarter, auto sales held a 22.3% gross profit margin for the entire year.

Even more growth on the way?

After dominating its home market, China’s largest EV maker is now aggressively expanding overseas to drive growth. BYD is now considering a third manufacturing plant in Europe. This time, it has its eyes on Germany, the heart of Europe’s auto industry and home to Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW.

According to S&P Global Mobility, BYD’s sales are poised to double in 2025 to around 186,000. Over the next four years, that number could reach 400,000 as the company introduces a full lineup.

And that’s just Europe. BYD is already a leading EV brand in overseas markets like Brazil, Mexico, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia.

With new smart tech rolling out and its recently revealed 1000V Super E fast charger, BYD could put up even bigger numbers over the next few years.

Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX, ETR:SRB) is encountering significant challenges as it navigates a complex turnaround, according to analysts at Jefferies.

In a note repeating their ‘Underperform’ rating on the coffee chain, the analysts cited Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol's tone during the March 12 Annual Shareholder Meeting, saying the CEO appeared cautious, reflecting ongoing difficulties in revitalizing the business.

The broker highlighted that foundational changes, including investments in staff and restructuring efforts, are proving costly and may take longer than expected to yield results.

“We believe the difficult reality in a turn of this magnitude is beginning to set in,” the analysts wrote.

The analysts also see coffee price sensitivity as a further potential headwind for Starbucks.

“Although near-term pressure noted as only $0.01 per share in US retail business, these pressures could build and sustain through fiscal 2025 and 2026,” they wrote.

“A sensitivity analysis suggests a 25% increase in coffee bean prices could result in 7% to 8% headwinds to earnings per share (EPS) in fiscal 2025 to 2026.”

Overly optimistic recovery timeline

While supply chain efficiencies and menu adjustments may help offset some costs, the company's Channel Development business remains vulnerable to these pressures, analysts added.

They awarded the stock a $76 price target, implying downside of approximately 22% at the time of writing.

Analysts expressed concern that despite recent share price declines, the stock’s valuation may still be pricing in an overly optimistic recovery timeline.

“While we acknowledge long-term investors own this stock predicated on two to three years or more of expected recovery, we think the road ahead will be bumpier than expected, upside is already overly-embedded in valuation, and further believe the long-term growth algorithm will likely come down closer to global asset-lite peers,” Jefferies wrote.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzAzXC9zaHV0dGVyc3RvY2stMTA3Mjg2Mzc0Ni5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,,2025-03-24 15:02:44.727431

In 2025, a record 15,000 stores are projected to close, doubling last year's number. Inflation and online shopping trends are hurting brick-and-mortar retailers, notably in pharmacies and fashion. Macy's is closing many stores due to financial struggles, while discount retailers thrive. The retail landscape is shifting, demanding adaptation from businesses.

The American high street is vanishing. In 2025, a staggering 15,000 stores are expected to close—nearly double the 7,325 that shut their doors last year, according to Coresight Research. That number eclipses even the record set during the COVID-19 pandemic. While retailers will open 5,800 new locations, it’s a weak counterbalance to the mass exodus of brick-and-mortar businesses.

Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig put it bluntly: “Inflation and a growing preference among consumers to shop online to find the cheapest deals took a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers in 2024. We continue to see a trend of consumers opting for the path of least resistance. Not only do they want the best prices, but they also have no patience for stores that are constantly disorganised, out of stock, and that deliver poor customer service.”

Pharmacy Deserts Are Emerging

Few sectors have been hit as hard as the pharmaceutical industry. CVS Health led the way in closures last year, shutting down 586 stores, with Rite Aid not far behind at 408. Walgreens Boots Alliance eliminated 259 locations. The result? Communities across the country are now facing “pharmacy deserts,” where residents have fewer options for essential prescriptions. Big-box stores with pharmacy departments—such as Walmart and grocery chains—are filling some of the gaps, but not everyone has easy access to them.

The Fall of Fashion Retailers

The apparel industry isn’t faring much better. Clothing, footwear, and accessory stores have accounted for nearly a third of all store closures this year. The bankruptcies of Rue21 and Express saw the shuttering of 543 and 105 stores, respectively. Foot Locker, already struggling, closed 118 locations in 2024 and has eight more planned for this year.

Yet not everyone sees this as a catastrophe. GlobalData’s Neil Saunders believes this is more of a shakeout than a collapse: “This is a healthy thing, and it does not follow that all of retail is in a bad way. At the end of this process, the vast majority of sales will still be made through physical stores. I see this as an adjustment rather than some kind of calamity.”

Live Events

Macy’s: A Legacy in Decline

Few closures have hit as hard as Macy’s. Its Brooklyn Downtown store, a fixture for 160 years, has closed for good. Once known as Abraham & Straus (A&S), the store was a beloved shopping destination before Macy’s acquired it in 1995. The Fulton Street location was famous for its innovative ""live mannequin modeling"" in the 1970s, where high school students posed in designer outfits in the shop windows, drawing crowds that sometimes brought traffic to a halt.

For longtime resident Vince Ross, the store’s closure is deeply personal: “I can't believe this place is going away,” he told BKReader, recalling its A&S days.

Tony Spring, Macy’s chairman and CEO, explained the decision: “Closing any store is never easy, but as part of our Bold New Chapter strategy, we are closing underproductive Macy’s stores to allow us to focus our resources and prioritise investments in our go-forward stores.”

Brooklyn isn’t alone. Macy’s is shutting 150 underperforming locations, slashing its total store count by a third to 350. That’s a far cry from the 1,100 stores it operated in 2008. The company still plans to open 15 new Bloomingdale’s stores and 30 Bluemercury locations, but the department store giant is undeniably shrinking.

To make matters worse, an internal accounting scandal rocked the company last year when an employee concealed $150 million in delivery expenses. The scandal cost Macy’s $79 million in its full-year outlook, adding yet another blow to its struggling finances.

Bargain Hunting in an Inflationary Era

While department stores flounder, discount retailers are thriving. Inflation-weary shoppers are prioritising affordability, and discount chains are benefiting. According to Forbes, online shopping has also surged, now accounting for 29% of retail sales (excluding motor vehicles, fuel, and food service). That’s up from 21% in 2019.

As the middle market crumbles, luxury brands and budget-friendly stores are widening their customer bases. Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, and Target are among the retailers expected to weather the storm.

The Next Five Years: More Closures to Come

Retail’s decline isn’t stopping anytime soon. UBS predicts the US will lose 45,000 stores by 2030, dropping from 958,000 to 913,000 locations. Sectors most at risk include clothing, electronics, books, music, and home furnishings.

Kohl’s has already announced it will close 27 underperforming stores by April. “We always take these decisions very seriously,” said former CEO Tom Kingsbury. “As we continue to build on our long-term growth strategy, it is important that we also take difficult but necessary actions to support the health and future of our business for our customers and our teams.”

Meanwhile, Dollar General is preparing to close nearly 100 locations, and Big Lots is shutting stores following its 2024 bankruptcy. One store in Somerset, Kentucky, recently marked its final day with clearance sales offering up to 95% off.

A Shifting Retail Landscape

Despite all the doom and gloom, retail isn’t disappearing—it’s evolving. Some brands will adapt, others will fade away. But the days of sprawling department stores dominating city centres may be coming to an end.

For consumers, that means fewer in-person shopping experiences, but more digital convenience. For retailers, it’s a stark reminder: evolve or die. The question now is, which businesses will survive this retail reckoning?

In 2025, a record 15,000 stores are projected to close, doubling last year's number. Inflation and online shopping trends are hurting brick-and-mortar retailers, notably in pharmacies and fashion. Macy's is closing many stores due to financial struggles, while discount retailers thrive. The retail landscape is shifting, demanding adaptation from businesses.

The American high street is vanishing. In 2025, a staggering 15,000 stores are expected to close—nearly double the 7,325 that shut their doors last year, according to Coresight Research. That number eclipses even the record set during the COVID-19 pandemic. While retailers will open 5,800 new locations, it’s a weak counterbalance to the mass exodus of brick-and-mortar businesses.

Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig put it bluntly: “Inflation and a growing preference among consumers to shop online to find the cheapest deals took a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers in 2024. We continue to see a trend of consumers opting for the path of least resistance. Not only do they want the best prices, but they also have no patience for stores that are constantly disorganised, out of stock, and that deliver poor customer service.”

Pharmacy Deserts Are Emerging

Few sectors have been hit as hard as the pharmaceutical industry. CVS Health led the way in closures last year, shutting down 586 stores, with Rite Aid not far behind at 408. Walgreens Boots Alliance eliminated 259 locations. The result? Communities across the country are now facing “pharmacy deserts,” where residents have fewer options for essential prescriptions. Big-box stores with pharmacy departments—such as Walmart and grocery chains—are filling some of the gaps, but not everyone has easy access to them.

The Fall of Fashion Retailers

The apparel industry isn’t faring much better. Clothing, footwear, and accessory stores have accounted for nearly a third of all store closures this year. The bankruptcies of Rue21 and Express saw the shuttering of 543 and 105 stores, respectively. Foot Locker, already struggling, closed 118 locations in 2024 and has eight more planned for this year.

Yet not everyone sees this as a catastrophe. GlobalData’s Neil Saunders believes this is more of a shakeout than a collapse: “This is a healthy thing, and it does not follow that all of retail is in a bad way. At the end of this process, the vast majority of sales will still be made through physical stores. I see this as an adjustment rather than some kind of calamity.”

Live Events

Macy’s: A Legacy in Decline

Few closures have hit as hard as Macy’s. Its Brooklyn Downtown store, a fixture for 160 years, has closed for good. Once known as Abraham & Straus (A&S), the store was a beloved shopping destination before Macy’s acquired it in 1995. The Fulton Street location was famous for its innovative ""live mannequin modeling"" in the 1970s, where high school students posed in designer outfits in the shop windows, drawing crowds that sometimes brought traffic to a halt.

For longtime resident Vince Ross, the store’s closure is deeply personal: “I can't believe this place is going away,” he told BKReader, recalling its A&S days.

Tony Spring, Macy’s chairman and CEO, explained the decision: “Closing any store is never easy, but as part of our Bold New Chapter strategy, we are closing underproductive Macy’s stores to allow us to focus our resources and prioritise investments in our go-forward stores.”

Brooklyn isn’t alone. Macy’s is shutting 150 underperforming locations, slashing its total store count by a third to 350. That’s a far cry from the 1,100 stores it operated in 2008. The company still plans to open 15 new Bloomingdale’s stores and 30 Bluemercury locations, but the department store giant is undeniably shrinking.

To make matters worse, an internal accounting scandal rocked the company last year when an employee concealed $150 million in delivery expenses. The scandal cost Macy’s $79 million in its full-year outlook, adding yet another blow to its struggling finances.

Bargain Hunting in an Inflationary Era

While department stores flounder, discount retailers are thriving. Inflation-weary shoppers are prioritising affordability, and discount chains are benefiting. According to Forbes, online shopping has also surged, now accounting for 29% of retail sales (excluding motor vehicles, fuel, and food service). That’s up from 21% in 2019.

As the middle market crumbles, luxury brands and budget-friendly stores are widening their customer bases. Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, and Target are among the retailers expected to weather the storm.

The Next Five Years: More Closures to Come

Retail’s decline isn’t stopping anytime soon. UBS predicts the US will lose 45,000 stores by 2030, dropping from 958,000 to 913,000 locations. Sectors most at risk include clothing, electronics, books, music, and home furnishings.

Kohl’s has already announced it will close 27 underperforming stores by April. “We always take these decisions very seriously,” said former CEO Tom Kingsbury. “As we continue to build on our long-term growth strategy, it is important that we also take difficult but necessary actions to support the health and future of our business for our customers and our teams.”

Meanwhile, Dollar General is preparing to close nearly 100 locations, and Big Lots is shutting stores following its 2024 bankruptcy. One store in Somerset, Kentucky, recently marked its final day with clearance sales offering up to 95% off.

A Shifting Retail Landscape

Despite all the doom and gloom, retail isn’t disappearing—it’s evolving. Some brands will adapt, others will fade away. But the days of sprawling department stores dominating city centres may be coming to an end.

For consumers, that means fewer in-person shopping experiences, but more digital convenience. For retailers, it’s a stark reminder: evolve or die. The question now is, which businesses will survive this retail reckoning?

""China is not only a major country in terms of population and economy but also an innovation hub. With such a huge economic base, China's economy continues to grow steadily. A growth rate of 5 percent means an annual increment equivalent to the economy of some European countries. This steady and sustained growth is impressive,"" he said.

""The best proof of our confidence in China's economy is our continuous investment. Danone is not only investing in research and innovation in China but also expanding our production bases. These investments serve not only the Chinese market but also the global market,"" he added.

When asked about Danone's investment layout in China by 2025, he revealed that Danone has an open research center in Shanghai, where they continuously conduct academic and clinical empirical research. In the future, Danone plans to further expand its research investment in China and establish a brand-new innovation center to serve not only the Chinese market, but also its broader global needs.

De Saint-Affrique also emphasized that China's innovative applications in fields such as artificial intelligence have brought many insights to Danone, and the company is driving the development of the entire industry based on its cutting-edge innovations in China.

In addition, the Danone CEO also stated that they will continue to expand production scale in China, making it an export base for Danone's high-end medical nutrition products.

""The Chinese government has taken a series of positive measures to boost consumption and stabilize foreign investment, which is undoubtedly good news for multinational companies like us. All policy initiatives to boost consumption and expand openness will help promote common prosperity and benefit global development,"" he mentioned.

J&J said the North Carolina plant will employ 5,000 people in construction and create 500 permanent positions.","Dive Brief:

Johnson & Johnson is planning a major U.S. expansion, announcing Friday it will spend $55 billion over the next four years on manufacturing, research and development and technology in its domestic market.

The investments will support three advanced manufacturing facilities and expansion of other sites in its pharmaceutical and medical technology businesses, J&J said. The company officially broke ground Friday on a new 500,000-square-foot biologics manufacturing facility in Wilson, North Carolina.

J&J’s announcement follows splashy releases from Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Amgen emphasizing their investment in U.S.-based manufacturing. The companies are hoping their effort will ease the burden of tariffs as well as persuade the Trump administration to extend tax cuts enacted in his first term and soften the blow of Medicare price cuts.

Dive Insight:

J&J said the U.S. expansion plan will represent a 25% increase in its investment compared to the past four years. In its annual reports, the company said it spent around $4 billion each year between 2021 and 2024 on “additions to property, plant and equipment,” a measure that largely captures the company's capital expenditures.

The Trump administration has pushed corporations to open more facilities in the U.S., emphasizing its “America first” policies that seek to discourage imports and increase manufacturing employment.

Big pharmas say their decision to reshore manufacturing has been enabled by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 — which, in addition to cutting the base corporate rate, also lowered taxes on profits that are earned by overseas subsidiaries and paid back to the U.S. parent.

Rising demand for their products, as well as the risk of tariffs from overseas production, is driving manufacturing expansions. Lilly has struggled to meet the appetite for its GLP-1 product tirzepatide, sold as Ozempic in diabetes and Zepbound in obesity. Sales of the drug tripled between 2023 and 2024. J&J also has fast-growing biologic medicines like Darazalex and Carvykti in cancer and Tremfya in psoriasis, underscoring the need to build production facilities close to their biggest-selling markets.

J&J said the North Carolina plant will employ 5,000 people in construction and create 500 permanent positions. The remaining manufacturing sites will be announced at a later date, as will expansions of R&D facilities and “increased technology investments to help make drug discovery and development faster, support workforce training and enhance our business operations.”

Before these expansions are accounted for, J&J claims its benefit to the U.S. economy exceeds $100 billion a year.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hz6IWgD-gbeF_h7yG-J5gJ73MfPYfD8RZ5qYsbdSwSk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xOTk1NjExNTUwXzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-03-24 17:02:22.881077

The report, based on data from more than 1,300 hospitals, provides a snapshot of hospital revenue, expenses, and margins at the start of the year.

Despite a continued rise in drug and supply costs, inpatient revenue grew at a faster rate than outpatient revenue, signaling a shift in hospital utilization patterns.

""The growth in volumes and inpatient revenue in January may be related in part to seasonal factors from the flu and other respiratory illnesses,"" Erik Swanson, managing director and group leader of data and analytics at Kaufman Hall, told HealthcareFinanceNews.

Cost growth slows, expenses remain high

One of the key findings of the report is that cost growth has slowed compared to previous years, offering some financial relief to hospitals. However, expenses, particularly in labor and pharmaceuticals, remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels.

""Hospitals are seeing some relief from extreme cost spikes, but drug and supply chain expenses continue to be a major concern,"" Swanson said. ""Many organizations are joining group purchasing organizations, seeking generic substitutions, or exploring biosimilar drugs to control spending.""

Hospitals are also optimizing their workforce to reduce costs while maintaining quality care.

""Some health systems have developed in-house staffing agencies to meet changes in patient demand without relying on third-party agencies,"" Swanson said.

He added other organizations are focusing on workforce optimization techniques to better align staffing levels with patient demand.

Uncompensated care rises amid Medicaid disenrollments

A growing concern for hospitals is the increase in uncompensated care, which includes bad debt and charity care. The report noted the recent uptick may be linked to Medicaid disenrollments in 2023 and 2024.

""Recent increases in bad debt and charity care may be related in part to Medicaid disenrollments,"" Swanson said. ""Hospitals need to prepare for potential further increases depending on changes in Medicaid policy.""

Hospitals that manage all their departments close to financial performance benchmarks tend to fare better.

""High-performing hospitals tend to manage their departments efficiently, suggesting that focusing on departmental performance and simplifying administrative processes can help mitigate financial risks,"" Swanson explained.

Strategies to improve hospital margins

With hospitals still facing tight margins, shared services allocations are becoming an area of focus.

Managing these costs is challenging for hospitals of all sizes, with wide variations in how systems allocate expenses.

""The total spend for shared services functions is substantial and growing, and hospitals must take a proactive approach to cost control,"" Swanson said.

Hospitals are also working on improving clinical documentation to ensure accurate coding and reimbursement.

""Organizations are investing in clinical documentation improvement programs to make sure they are coding patients appropriately and getting reimbursed correctly,"" Swanson said.

As hospitals move forward, balancing cost containment with the need to expand services will be critical.

While inpatient revenue growth is encouraging, high labor costs, supply expenses, and rising uncompensated care remain key challenges.

""Hospitals must continue to refine their financial strategies,"" Swanson said. ""Managing labor efficiently, leveraging group purchasing, and optimizing shared services will be crucial in maintaining financial stability.""",https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Patientusingtablet.inbed_.JohnFedele_2.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 11:04:44.344167

Analyst Crossfire:

Classic Shoe Inventory Cleanup Timeline (Lorraine Hutchinson – BofA): The company emphasized that NIKE is rightsizing classic franchises (Air Force 1, Dunk, AJ1) rather than eliminating them. By the end of Q4, their contribution to the overall footwear mix will be reduced by 10 percentage points, with further reductions planned for FY26. The cleanup in NIKE Direct will be quicker, while wholesale will take the first half of FY26 (Elliott Hill – CEO, Matthew Friend – CFO).

Wholesale Channel & Order Book Trends, Innovation & Product Pipeline (Lorraine Hutchinson – BofA, Brooke Roach – GS): Wholesale partners are seeing growth in performance categories and new sportswear, almost offsetting declines in classic franchises. NIKE is making strategic investments in digital and wholesale channels, ensuring Air Force 1 inventory stabilizes first. NIKE is balancing long-term innovation through the LeBron James NIKE Sports Research Lab and short-term product refreshes. Recent successes include 24/7 apparel, Vomero 5, P-6000, Shox, and Air Max Muse. The Spring ’26 product review generated excitement among wholesale partners, signaling strong momentum (Matthew Friend – CFO, Elliott Hill – CEO).

Performance vs. Classics Inflection Point, Gross Margin & Inventory Liquidation Impact (Aneesha Sherman – Bernstein): NIKE expects performance categories to offset classic footwear declines by Spring ’26. The key factor will be how quickly the marketplace is cleaned up and repositioned for innovation. Company is resetting digital and physical channels to maximize sell-through and drive future order growth. NIKE anticipates Q4 to be the most impacted by Win Now actions, with revenue and margin headwinds moderating from FY26 onwards. While full-price sales in digital and wholesale will improve, inventory liquidation efforts will continue for several quarters but will be managed through familiar value channels (Elliott Hill – CEO, Matthew Friend – CFO).

Promotions & Inventory Management, SG&A & Demand Creation Strategy (Simeon Siegel – BMO): NIKE is transitioning both digital and physical retail channels to full-price presentations while using value stores for excess inventory clearance. Running products like Peg Premium and Vomero 18 exemplify the strategy of driving premium sell-through while clearing old stock. NIKE is tightly managing overhead while increasing demand creation investment. Recent spending on Super Bowl, NBA All-Star Weekend, and key product launches has been impactful.

Chicago, IL – March 24, 2025 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Nike NKE, FedEx FDX, Lululemon LULU and Paychex PAYX.

Making Sense of Early Q1 Earnings Reports

We are not fully in the Q1 reporting cycle yet, as that will get going when the big banks report their March-quarter results on April 11th. However, we have been seeing some of the early results in recent days, which are mixed at best. These results are from companies reporting for their fiscal quarters ending in February, which we and other data vendors count as part of the official March quarter tally.

Through Friday, March 21st, we have seen February-quarter results from 14 S&P 500 members, including bellwethers like Nike, FedEx and others. We have another five index members on deck to report results this week, including Lululemon, Paychex and others. By the time the big banks come out with their quarterly results about a month from now, we will have such Q1 results from almost two dozen S&P 500 members.

The market has been unimpressed with the results we have seen in recent days. Nike investors initially bid the stock up following the better-than-expected quarterly results, but it eventually lost all of those earlier gains and then some as they realized that Nike still had a long and bumpy recovery ahead of it. The market’s initial optimism about the Nike release most likely reflected relief that the numbers weren’t as bad as many appeared to fear.

Nike’s top- and bottom-line beats were reflective of depressed expectations; FedEx didn’t have that advantage and came up short on both counts. What’s more, FedEx guided lower, reflecting the third straight quarter of a downgraded outlook. Both companies are dealing with multi-year company-specific issues that have yet to be fully sorted out, resulting in the stocks being big-time laggards. The challenging macroeconomic and policy backdrop adds to the headwinds.

One would think that Nike’s troubles will have read-through for Lululemon, as the athletic footwear and athleisure apparel categories depend on healthy consumer spending trends and are vulnerable to trade/tariff uncertainties. Lululemon shares haven’t performed much better than Nike shares over the past year, as the chart below of the one-year performance of Lululemon, Nike, and FedEx relative to the S&P 500 index shows. But that’s where the similarities end.

Lululemon shares really lost ground at the time of its year-earlier quarterly release on March 21st, which had ignited worries about the sustainability of the company’s growth momentum.

Lululemon had provided an upgraded outlook for this quarter back in January, which followed raised guidance at its preceding quarterly release on December 5th. A Closer Look at Earnings Expectations for Q1 and Full Year 2025

One would think that Nike’s troubles will have read-through for Lululemon, as the athletic footwear and athleisure apparel categories depend on healthy consumer spending trends and are vulnerable to trade/tariff uncertainties. Lululemon shares haven’t performed much better than Nike shares over the past year, as the chart below of the one-year performance of Lululemon, Nike, and FedEx relative to the S&P 500 index shows. But that’s where the similarities end.

Lululemon shares really lost ground at the time of its year-earlier quarterly release on March 21st, which had ignited worries about the sustainability of the company’s growth momentum.

Lululemon had provided an upgraded outlook for this quarter back in January, which followed raised guidance at its preceding quarterly release on December 5th. You can see the effect of the favorable January preannouncement in the revisions trend for the period, with the current $5.85 per share earnings estimate up from $5.80 two months ago and $5.65 three months back.

Same-store sales are expected to be up +5.16% for the quarter, up from the preceding period’s +4% increase (vs. estimates of +2.37% increase). In the aforementioned year-earlier quarterly release, following which the stock had gotten on a sustained downtrend, Lululemon had come out with comps of +12% vs. estimates of +11.63%, but they had guided towards a lower comp trajectory for the following quarters. The low- to mid-single-digit comp growth in the three quarterly releases after the March 2024 quarterly report followed many quarters of consistent double-digit comp growth, explaining the growth worries that have weighed on the stock.

LULU shares have lost ground this year, reflecting the all-around tariff worries and renewed macroeconomic headwinds, with the stock down -15.6% in the year-to-date period vs. the -4.2% decline for the S&P 500 index. While a stronger comp showing in this quarterly release will help the stock, the key catalyst will be guidance for the year. The expectation is that earnings and revenues for the coming fiscal year will increase by +6.8% and +7.5%, respectively.

Early Q1 Earnings Scorecard

As noted earlier, we have already seen February-quarter results from 14 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 14 index members are up +10.5% from the same period last year on +5.9% revenue gains, with 57.1% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 71.4% beating revenue estimates.

These early companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus estimates, with the EPS beats percentage for this group of companies the lowest in the preceding 20-quarter period. This is disconcerting, but we want to caution against reading too much into these early results, given the sample size.

Q1 Earnings Estimates Under Pressure

The expectation is that Q1 earnings will be up +5.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues, which would follow the +13.8% earnings growth on +5.4% revenue gains in the preceding period.

We have been experiencing a relatively elevated magnitude of negative revisions to estimates for the current period (2025 Q1) even before the more recent signs of weakness in data that drove the recent run of soft guidance from a number of companies.

As noted earlier, this is more negative revisions to Q1 estimates since the start of January compared to the comparable periods of the preceding few quarters. Not only is the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates more pronounced relative to the last few quarters, but it is also more widespread.

Since the start of the period in January, estimates have come down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines for the Conglomerates, Autos, Basic Materials, Aerospace, Consumer Discretionary, and others.

The three sectors whose Q1 estimates have moved up since the quarter got underway are Medical, Utilities, and Construction.

The Tech sector, whose estimates have consistently been positive over the past year, is also suffering negative revisions to Q1 estimates. Optimism about the AI investment cycle suffered a psychological blow following China’s DeepSeek announcement. The resulting shift in market sentiment has weighed on the space ever since, causing the underperformance of AI-focused stocks this year.

The sector still remains a key growth driver in Q1 and beyond, with 2025 Q1 earnings for the Tech sector expected to be up +12.4% on +10.1% higher revenues. A lot will be riding on the evolving earnings expectations for the Tech sector, which has been a pillar of growth over the last two years.

The recent underwhelming guidance releases are coming at a time of growing anxiety about the macroeconomic backdrop, with many in the market starting to worry about the U.S. economy’s near-term growth momentum. Uncertainty about the Trump administration’s tariff policies is beginning to show up in business and consumer confidence measures. Some have started to worry if the ongoing public sector job cuts will eventually seep into the private sector as well.

While we acknowledge that near-term risks have increased for the economy, we remain sanguine in our outlook and see the ongoing market weakness as a buying opportunity. The U.S. economy defied skeptics during and after the extraordinary Fed tightening cycle and remains resilient enough to withstand the current bout of tariffs-centric uncertainty.

Importantly, for the first time in a long time, the U.S. economy enjoys the backstop of the Fed with more than enough ‘dry powder’ to jumpstart growth should investors’ worst fears come to fruition.

Depending on where the emerging tariff regime settles, earnings estimates will need to come down in response. But we all need to look past the daily noise around tariffs and remind ourselves that the overall corporate earnings picture has been steadily improving in recent quarters.

We believe that these favorable growth trends will remain in place in the current and coming quarters, with the sectors contributing to the growth momentum expanding beyond the Tech core of the last couple of years.

FedEx Corp. and Nike Inc., two giant companies with broad views into the global economy, served as the latest warning signs that tariff confusion, currency swings, inflation and other macroeconomic forces are making it harder to come to business decisions, plan for the future and communicate financial expectations with investors.

Nike signaled further revenue declines and said Trump’s tariffs on China and Mexico would contribute to a sharp decline in profitability. Nike imports 18% of its Nike-branded footwear from China, which Trump has levied an additional 20% tariffs on. The company also makes products in Mexico and other countries expecting more tariffs in April. FedEx cited higher-than-expected inflation and softening demand in lowering profit guidance for a third consecutive quarter.

Nike sank as much 9.3% on March 21, falling below $100 billion market value for the first time since the pandemic. FedEx’s drop hit nearly 12%. The S&P 500 Index was on its way to another down trading day, with the measure on pace for a fifth straight weekly decline.

It’s “a warning signal,” Citi analysts said of the FedEx report, highlighting “the depth of concern over the economic outlook.”

Weakening Demand

Some analysts covering Nike said the company was on the right track under new CEO Elliott Hill, but that the brewing trade war would make a comeback harder.

Two of the biggest U.S. airlines, American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc., last week slashed their forecasts, stoking worries of a bigger consumer pullback. Major retailers, including Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., have also warned of weakening demand.

That’s coincided with economists increasing the chances of a U.S. recession as the U.S. barrels toward an April 2 promise by Trump to impose so-called reciprocal tariffs on countries that export more to the U.S. than they import from it.

Many companies were initially reticent earlier this earnings season to pin cloudy outlooks specifically on Trump’s tariffs, preferring to speak more obliquely about economic uncertainty. But the sentiment has shifted in recent weeks, with more executives specifically calling out the levies.

There were roughly 2,000 mentions of tariffs on earnings calls and other financial disclosures among companies in the S&P 500 in the most recent quarter, up from more than 600 in the previous quarter.

“The update extends the recent streak of cautious commentary that have become commonplace during the month of March,” wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Brian Ossenbeck about FedEx’s guidance cut. “Management had expected a stronger industrial economy in its original guidance, which has clearly not played out as anticipated and merits a weaker outlook.”

It’s not just U.S. companies.

Beneteau SA, a French maker of sailing yachts and powerboats that generates about 20% of its sales in the U.S., said it wouldn’t provide an annual profit forecast because of the uncertainty. chief executive officer Bruno Thivoyon referred to “trade risks” and “talks that may go one way one day and the other way the next day.” Shares in the company dropped 10% following the financial release.

Kevin McCarthy, a portfolio manager for the Neuberger Berman Connected Consumer ETF who holds Nike shares, said the tariff situation is “a moving target.” He said his team is sticking to “quality assets” they think will “weather the storm a little bit better.”

“The currency headwind we can quantify,” he added. But with tariffs, “it’s not something that you can really point to specifically what the impact is because I don’t think they know, and a lot of people that have a much higher pay grade than I have don’t know the answer to that question either.”",https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2023/02/01/FEDEX-PACKAGE-DELIVERY-BLOOMBERG.jpg?height=635&t=1675315138&width=1200,N,,2025-03-24 03:00:22.465609

I'm Marcus. Today we'll be discussing Walgreens. For the conversation, I'm joined by two people, both senior analysts, one of them covers digital health. Based in New Jersey, it's Rajiv Leventhal.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Hey, Marcus. How you doing? Good to be here.

Marcus Johnson:

Hello, sir. Good to see you. And the other covers retail for us, living in the Chicago area, it's Zak Stambor.

Zak Stambor:

Hey, guys.

Marcus Johnson:

Hello. Today's fact. So I did the most walkable cities recently, and Paul Verna started talking about bikes for some reason because he's a nightmare, but then I got curious. I was like, ""Well, what are the most bikeable cities in the world?"" So I found an article from WIRED and they have it in here.

So the research was done, let's see. So there's a lot of ingredients that go into ranking the most bikeable cities in the world. Share of trips taken by bike, reducing car speed limits to make it safer for bikes, car/bicycle bridges, better bike signage, protected cycling lanes, bike parking, et cetera, et cetera.

So it's not just how much do people get on their bike per day, or how many people do that, it's a bunch of things. Number one in the world, any guesses, gents?

Zak Stambor:

Amsterdam?

Marcus Johnson:

Number two, Amsterdam falls to second. I think in terms of the number of trips taken by bike, it might be first. It's hard to get clear data on the number of trips taken across different cities.

But in terms of all of the things that go into it, because two thirds of trips to work or school are by bike, are very bikeable. But in terms of all the other elements, infrastructure, et cetera, it's second. It's close to it though, geographically.

Zak Stambor:

Copenhagen?

Marcus Johnson:

Yes.

Zak Stambor:

Okay, there we go. Yeah.

Marcus Johnson:

Well-played.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Nice job.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. Copenhagen in Denmark, nine out of 10 people own a bike, and there are five times as many bikes as cars on the street, according to the Cycling Embassy of Denmark. Copenhagen, number one, Amsterdam, number two, Utrecht in the Netherlands, number three. Then it goes Antwerp, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Oslo, Paris, Vienna, and Helsinki round out the top 10.

And this is in the world, they just all happen to be in Europe. New York made the top 20 back in 2011, so it's been a while. God knows how, but never again. Yeah, not even close. I think Vancouver, Montreal, 18th in 2019, so that's the highest in terms of North America. Vancouver, right behind that. Well-played, Canada. Anyway, today's real topic, Walgreens identity crisis.

So Walgreens Boots Alliance says it has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm, Sycamore Partners, as the struggling retailer looks to turn itself around after years of losing money, notes the Associated Press. Its shares are down 45% in the last 12 months. Rajiv, you were noting that that makes it the worst performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024.

If you look at the last five years, the stock's down 76%, which might be surprised to learn, because Walgreens stores are everywhere so it seems like they're doing okay. Walgreens started back in 1901 when Charles R. Walgreen, Sr. purchases a Chicago drugstore, where he worked as a pharmacist to start the Walgreens chain.

A Reuters PASS.PA notes, ""Within 25 years, they had 100 stores, and the year after that, 1927, they went public. By 2015, they were valued at $100 billion."" That number now sits closer to just 10, down 90%, over 90% since its peak in 2015. Walgreens net loss in fiscal 2024, was nearly $9 billion. That's a loss of 180% year-on-year increase, so things are not going well.

We're going to figure out why. Rajiv, I'll start with you, blame pie. Make a pie chart of reasons, three max, why Walgreens went from pharmacy behemoth to distressed retailer, as Reuters puts it?

Rajiv Leventhal:

I'm assigning 60% blame to Walgreens failed investments in retail health.

30% blame goes to declining front-of-store sales. And then 10% on assigning to just the pharmacy-only business, so 60%, 30%, 10%.

Marcus Johnson:

Okay.

Rajiv Leventhal:

So I'll start with the 60%, because obviously the biggest one. I feel like the average consumer and maybe even the average listener of this podcast, might not be too familiar with all of the healthcare delivery and primary care type investments and acquisitions Walgreens has made over the last several years.

But it's contributed to its downfall, I think, more than any other single element. So shortly after COVID, Walgreens and other retail pharmacies too, but Walgreens got this impression that they could be a medical care service destination for patients. And I think a big part of that was because they were a go-to location for COVID-related medical services.

A lot of people got tests and vaccinated, COVID vaccines at Walgreens Pharmacy. So people started to become a little bit more comfortable with the idea of, ""Well, if I'm getting a COVID test and a COVID vaccine, maybe I'm good with going to a retail pharmacy location for other non-emergent type medical care.""

So what Walgreens did right after that, was invest about $6 billion into a primary care company called VillageMD. And its plan for VillageMD was to open a bunch of primary care clinics around the country, but co-locate a lot of them either in Walgreens stores or adjacent to Walgreens Pharmacy stores as well. It did not work out.

VillageMD badly struggled to attract patients and recruit doctors to work for them, and the investment just ended up being a disaster. Last year, just to give you some numbers. Last year, Walgreens, which was the majority owner of VillageMD but not the whole owner, they recorded a $6-plus billion loss related to the VillageMD investment.

Walgreens healthcare services segment lost, recorded a $14 billion loss last year, much of that related to VillageMD. And I think it's the biggest reason why Walgreens was forced to sell itself to a private equity firm. Because it invested so much money into the retail, healthcare, medical care concept, that it just could not execute on. So I'm giving that one 60%.

Marcus Johnson:

So is this a referendum on retail clinics? So could you quickly define a retail clinic for our listeners?

Rajiv Leventhal:

I think so, yeah. So since CVS, like many clinics and Walgreens has had similar type of initiatives, they've been around for years.

And the idea is to stick them in the back of a drugstore and just provide really low-acuity type care for patients.

Whether that's someone coming in for a cough or wanting to get a throat culture, something like that. Some of these locations hire nurse practitioners, some hire actually physicians.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. Our numbers are suggesting that retail clinic patients are going in the wrong direction, so they had doubled from 44 million to 84 million, 2017 to 2023.

Obviously, it was the pandemic in there, which Rajiv's been talking about giving people more of an incentive to go get the vaccinations and then, ""Oh, I'm here, I can do other things.""

But since then, they've been on a staircase downwards, falling to $73 million next year, we believe. That would be $10 million less than its peak.

Rajiv Leventhal:

And when you consider all the closures that are expected and will probably ramp up with the sale, I think those numbers are going to go down even more. Because you mentioned that the top markets that Walgreens still does have all these stores everywhere, but they're on track to close about 15% of them.

And I think after this sale goes through, assuming it does, Sycamore Partners, the private equity company, is probably going to close even more and probably accelerate the timeline. What do we know about PE firms?

They want to chop down what's unprofitable, and Walgreens CEO last year said that about 25% of its drugstores in the US are not turning a profit.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. Yeah, they've been closing stores for a while already. 1,000 stores they've closed in recent years. You mentioned that 14% of their stores they're planning to close still, that's about over 1,000.

I think 1,200 of their 8,500 US locations, so it's a lot of closures. When you look at the industry as a whole though, I saw a study from USC and UC Berkeley, they were saying about one-third of US retail pharmacies have closed since 2010.

Independent ones twice as likely to close as chains, but between 2019 and 2021, the number of drugstores declined in 41 of 50 states. So this has been an industry-wide thing that Walgreens obviously is a massive part of.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Definitely. I think that's a good segue into the rest of the blame pie.

Marcus Johnson:

Okay.

Rajiv Leventhal:

So I'm giving 30% to decline in front-of-store sales, and I'm sure Zak is more well-versed in this than I am. So what we do know is that people have started to turn to online channels for their everyday household items, for snacks, for greeting cards.

The things that companies like CVS and Walgreens were used to selling and successfully selling for so long. So people are cost-conscious consumers, they're going to find the best deal and they're going to online merchants like Amazon.

And those declining front-of-store sales, I think, and reduced foot traffic, I think, is certainly affecting all retail pharmacy chains, but Walgreens for sure.

Marcus Johnson:

So Zak, what's going on there? Because there's this age-old line about 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store.

Last year, nearly 80% of Americans lived within five miles of a Walgreens-owned pharmacy. You'd think that would be a good thing for sales.

Zak Stambor:

So Walgreens are very convenient, but at this moment in time when people are feeling super pressed and cost conscious, they're pulling back on discretionary spend.

So they're not going to Walgreens, because you don't go to Walgreens for a deal, you go because it's convenient. So they're just deciding to go online to Amazon or go to Walmart, or go someplace where you can get stuff for cheaper.

Marcus Johnson:

The other part of this as well is people complain about everything being locked up when you go to some of these pharmacies, and I found some research. I was thinking, ""Okay, how big of a deal is that statistically?""

I did some research from Joe Budano, CEO of anti-theft tech company, Indyme. Secured cases can cause sales to drop 15% to 25%, so a very big deal it would seem.

Zak Stambor:

Also, it makes it so it's not convenient. So Walgreens whole value proposition is that it's convenient, that everybody is so close to a Walgreens. I looked on a map and I have six Walgreens stores within three miles of my house, so they're very convenient.

But if the stuff is locked up and I have to wait for somebody to open up the case that I can buy body wash or deodorant or whatever it is, then it isn't convenient. I could just as easily pull out my phone and buy it online.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, yeah. They're looking for convenience and they're also looking for it not to be too expensive. It's obviously a very inflationary-driven climate at the moment.

And you mentioned people going online, people buying from big-box retailers instead. So yeah, the prices as well, I think, have been turning people off somewhat. So Rajiv, sorry, 10% left. What do we have?

Rajiv Leventhal:

Okay. So that's just the pharmacy business, and I'm separating pharmacy from retail pharmacy here, so retail is front-of-store. Pharmacy is just behind the pharmacy counter. 10% for the pharmacy behind the counter, separate from retail front of the store. So for years, pharmacy benefit managers, which are the middlemen in between drug manufacturers and pharmacies.

They negotiate the deals that pharmacies get for when they dispense medication to a patient, and pharmacies get paid when they do that. So they've been lowering the reimbursement rates to pharmacies such as Walgreens, but independent pharmacies even more, but bigger chains too including Walgreens. And that's made it difficult for Walgreens to turn a profit on certain medications.

Some, they've acknowledged this, they're too expensive to stock because they don't get reimbursed enough for dispensing it, so that's been a little bit of a headwind, for sure. But to me, not quite as much as what's going on in the front of the store, and what's going on with their healthcare delivery investments and acquisitions.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, yeah. So there they're getting paid less by pharmacy benefit managers payers every year to dispense the same amount, same prescription.

Zak Stambor:

Yeah. So I have a very similar pie, but I used much bigger buckets.

Marcus Johnson:

Okay.

Zak Stambor:

So 50% is just the business model itself. So the pharmacy benefit managers being a prime example of, I think the lower reimbursement rates is one of the reasons that Walgreens has looked for growth elsewhere via these acquisitions. So that's the big piece, and you've seen their gross margins just go straight down to the right.

COVID was a brief reprieve, but then once we went back to normal, it went straight back down, down and to the right. So the business model is just not working. And it goes back to what you were saying just a few moments ago, where the drugstore or pharmacy business model overall is really under pressure.

I think it's 3,000-plus pharmacies have closed since 2019, which is just a clear indication that the old ways of operating no longer work, so I think that's half. The other half are just store-related challenges, so one big piece of that is they're just overstored. Like I said, I have six stores within three miles of my house.

That's way too many. It just doesn't make any sense. Some of them you can explain, ""This is why this one's here and this is why this one's there."" But by and large, you just have way too many stores to operate.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. Some people might be thinking, ""Oh, well, how much does it matter, because people I'm sure buy a lot of this online anyway?"" Not so much the case.

M3 MI Kantar Media Healthcare Research data, where US adults purchased their prescription medications, this is from last year.

88% said in-store pharmacy, compared to 34% who said online pharmacy. So having a pharmacy nearby is important.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Yeah, it's interesting. You could select obviously multiple answers that don't equal 100, but the fact that 34% have tried an online pharmacy in the last year, whether that's Amazon, whether it's CVS online or Walgreens online, I think is pretty significant.

So that's a large number and I think a growing one in terms of the people who are at least familiar with, and are trying out an online pharmacy for their medications.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, this is a lot different. Please, please.

Zak Stambor:

Oh, I totally agree. I think especially for those medications that are recurring prescriptions, once you go online, you're almost never going to go back.

It's the one-offs where, yeah, you want to go somewhere close where you can just pick it up on your way home or whatnot.

But those recurring prescriptions are obviously shifting online, and I think that's only going to accelerate.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah.

Zak Stambor:

I agree. Just the one caveat is I think there is still a large cohort of people who like to talk to the pharmacist. They walk into the pharmacy, they have a question. And this doesn't, by the way, always have to apply to prescription medications, and we'll get into what the future could look like, but over-the-counter medications too.

You ever walk into a pharmacy and you have some symptoms, but you're not exactly sure what medications to take? You ask the pharmacist, ""Hey, what do you recommend? These are my symptoms."" So a little trickier to conduct some of those conversations through digital channels.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. I feel like more and more people are probably doing that, especially as they become disillusioned with the healthcare system overall, and trying to get an appointment with the primary care physician.

Yeah, I'm sure that's happening even more so now than it ever has done. Zak, you said there are a few in-store challenges?

Zak Stambor:

Oh, yeah. Yeah, so the other piece is just the customer experience. So one is locked up inventory, another is just staffing.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah.

Zak Stambor:

So if there's a long line to talk to the pharmacist, you're not going to be able to talk to the pharmacist, and so there's no value in going to the store.

So if it's a frustrating experience, people are just going to go elsewhere.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, so let's have a look at what's next. We talked about the overall industry struggling, and it's true, CVS Health shares down 43% last year, but they've spiked this year. They're up like 50%, so it's been quite the rebound for them.

But then Rite Aid, they obviously filed for Chapter 11 recently as well, so not a lot of folks in this space doing phenomenally well. What's next for Walgreens, Rajiv, in your opinion? Where do they go from here?

Rajiv Leventhal:

So I think Walgreens Pharmacy business, again, pharmacy only, not pharmacy plus retail, is going to be just fine. People always will need their medications. Now, they might not always need to go into a Walgreens store to fill them, but they will always need their medications.

The prescription drug market is a massive market in the US. CVS and Walgreens are one and two respectively in prescription drug sales. Walgreens generated over $100 billion in prescription drug sales last year. Okay, so there's a lot of money to be made. The model just has to change.

The retail plus pharmacy model as we know it, which relies heavily on customer traffic in the front of the store. That needs to be tweaked or modified, or overall pick the word you want.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah.

Rajiv Leventhal:

But I think that as consumers do turn to online channels, fewer need to go to Walgreens to get their household items and snacks. I think that we're going to see a changing store format, and we actually saw this just last week. CVS said that it's piloting a new concept where they're only going to sell medications, which is prescription medications behind the pharmacy and over-the-counter medications.

And they're not going to sell any snacks. They're not going to sell any of the front-of-store items, and so what this means is much smaller stores. It requires much less real estate to only have medications and health and wellness type products. So I think that could end up being an efficiency driver for retail pharmacies in the future. Walgreens has quietly been testing something similar over the last couple of years.

And they said last year that they're going to expand the number of these smaller format stores that are really designed around medications and healthcare products, instead of the front-of-store items. I just think that's a clear indicator that they know they can't compete in the world of convenience or retail convenience brick and mortar like they used to.

Marcus Johnson:

And these are much smaller stores. These are less than 5,000 square feet, so that's less than half the size of the typical CVS.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Right, right. And whether this model specifically takes off or it's a mix of this and something else, we'll see. Moving a lot of their services online, I think that's got to be a big part of it, improving the online experience for customers.

But I think this is an acknowledgement of what we've been saying a little bit, that medications are the steadier business compared with the front of the store.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. It's 80% of the company's sales last year from the pharmacy department, so that makes a lot of sense.

Small store formats, Zak, is that where Walgreens goes from here or somewhere else?

Zak Stambor:

Well, I think there's going to be a lot of experimentation, so I think that's one path. I could see them experimenting with beauty and those sorts of personal care stuff because that has been a pretty solid area.

I also just think what's ahead is probably this company does not look like this company. It's going to be broken up into pieces. A private equity company is going to do what a private equity company is going to do.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah, yeah. There's some talk that they want to go private, obviously helps takes a lot of the pressure off from shareholders and they can focus on what they want to focus on without a bunch of other voices in the room. There are the three parts to it we've been talking about all episode.

You've got the US pharmacy chain, you've got the US healthcare services part. That's the specialty pharmacy business, Shields Health Solutions. And then VillageMD, their primary care provider that they bought then or invested in that Rajiv was talking about, and then home care company, CareCentrix.

And that's the second part of those pieces. And then the third part is their international UK-based health and beauty retailer, Boots, which is huge in the country, the biggest one by far. So they've got those three pieces that they could play with/break up.

Rajiv Leventhal:

I think they're going to hold on to the US pharmacy business. They've made some comments that indicate they've got to rightsize this business segment and figure out, as we've discussed, experiment with a couple of different concepts or formats or tests that some will work, some might not work.

But the retail pharmacy business, I'd be very surprised if they didn't hold onto that. Whereas VillageMD and the healthcare services side, that's a distressed asset that I think is just going to be sold off. As I mentioned, they're losing billions on that. So I think that's where the private equity company will come in and get rid of it.

Marcus Johnson:

But then the knock-on effect from that, Rajiv, which I was reading one of your articles about, patient care could get a lot worse. Jenny Guadamuz, assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health said, ""Our findings suggest that closures of pharmacies may widen health disparities in access to prescription and other essential pharmacy services.

""Such as vaccinations and pharmacists-prescribed regimens, including contraceptives, medications for HIV prevention and treatments for opioid use disorder."" This has to have a knock-on effect into if you got to get rid of a lot of pharmacies, some people have a lot in their area, others don't. So this could have a significant effect on the health of society, no?

Rajiv Leventhal:

Yeah, and that's why I think a big question is where are these closures occurring? But if you look at what CVS did with these, again, only a few for right now, but they're opening a few of these smaller format stores that are focused on medications. They specifically said they're going to focus on areas where there isn't as great pharmacy access.

And specifically in areas where they've done their research and they see that people are actually going to Walmart or online for everyday household items, front-of-store items, but there isn't as much of access to pharmacies. And that's where some of these smaller format, medication-focused stores could open up, and could hopefully prevent the issue that you bring up.

Marcus Johnson:

Yeah. You'd cited, you were saying there's some studies that have found patient care, patient safety suffers when private equity companies acquire hospitals, nursing homes, medical centers, et cetera, so it's not a good sign.

The deal from Sycamore Partners, the acquisition of Walgreens expected to close in Q4, if everything runs according to plan for them. That's all we've got time for this episode. Thank you so much to my guests for hanging out with me today. Thank you first to Rajiv.

Rajiv Leventhal:

Thanks, Marcus. I had a good time.

Marcus Johnson:

Yes, sir. Thank you to Zak.

Zak Stambor:

Yeah, thanks for having me.

Marcus Johnson:

Yes, indeed. And thank you to the whole editing crew, Victoria, John, Lance, and Danny Stewart runs the team, and Sophie does our social media.

Forbes reported that in 2019, online shopping represented 21% of retail, excluding motor vehicles and motor parts, gasoline stations and food service.
Additionally, apparel, footwear and accessories sector experiences have accounted for a third of the store closures this year.
In 2024, the bankruptcies of Rue21 and Express led to 543 and 105 store closures, respectively.","Things have become more dire for brick-and-mortar retail stores as it was announced that nearly double the number of stores is expected to close this year compared to last year. It was reported by Coresight Research that 15,000 stores are expected to close this year which is nearly double the 7,325 locations that closed in 2024.

It was also stated that the store closures broke the record set in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number is slightly offset by the projection that retailers will open 5,800, which is only slightly less than the 5,970 stores opened in 2024.

“Inflation and a growing preference among consumers to shop online to find the cheapest deals took a toll on brick-and-mortar retailers in 2024,"" Coresight CEO Deborah Weinswig said in a statement. ""We continue to see a trend of consumers opting for the path of least resistance. Not only do they want the best prices, but they also have no patience for stores that are constantly disorganized, out of stock, and that deliver poor customer service.""

Forbes reported that inflation-weary customers are attempting to shift their priorities in order to stretch their dollar to the most. The outlet reported that discount stores have seen a rise in openings as the average American seeks to make the most of their money.

Other shoppers have turned to online shopping in order to take more advantage of deals. Forbes reported that in 2019, online shopping represented 21% of retail, excluding motor vehicles and motor parts, gasoline stations and food service.

In 2025, it was reported that the number has gone up to 29%, which is also up from last year's 28%. One area that has seen a substantial decline in physical establishments is the pharmaceutical sector. Last year, CVS Health with 586 closures accounted for the second-largest number of closings.

Rite Aid also reportedly shuttered 408 stores, and Walgreens Boots Alliance closed 259. The vast amount of closures has prompted Coresight Research to issue a warning of “pharmacy deserts” emerging in parts of the country to the benefit of mass merchants and grocery chains with pharmacy departments.

Additionally, apparel, footwear and accessories sector experiences have accounted for a third of the store closures this year. The number of closures is now down from the 1,383 stored that were forced to shutter their doors. In 2024, the bankruptcies of Rue21 and Express led to 543 and 105 store closures, respectively. Footlocker was also forced to shut down 118 stores last year, and it has announced eight more planned closures this year.

While many people have rumbled about a possible retail apocalypse. GlobalData’s Neil Saunders said it’s too soon to officially call it one. ""This is a healthy thing, and it does not follow that all of retail is in a bad way,"" Saunders stated. ""At the end of this process the vast majority of sales will still be made through physical stores.

This hecatomb continued in the spring of 2024 with the closure of the North Face store in Union Square, and will continue in the coming weeks with the closure of the store at 250 Post Street. To make matters worse, there are also rumours of the potential closure of Sak's store, which has already switched to an appointment-only model at its Union Square store and laid off some employees.

Among the reasons for these multiple closures, the proliferation of fentanyl since 2020 and the death of over 800 people in 2023 are thought to be partly responsible for the moribund business in this part of the city. Nordstrom's management cited “a dramatic change in the Downtown market,” as the reason for its closure.

Hard hit by the Covid crisis and the departure of employees from offices to their homes, the office vacancy in San Francisco climbed by 0.3% at the end of 2024 to reach 37.3 percent, setting a new record. According to real estate experts, this recent evolution is linked to the departure of Elon Musk's company, X, which preferred to relocate its headquarters to the Palo Alto and San José area.

As a direct consequence, tourism in San Francisco is not in good health. Whereas the city welcomed 26.21 million visitors in 2019, only 23.01 million were expected in 2024. Fewer visitors and, therefore, fewer consumers. A decline that could nevertheless be halted in 2025, with predictions betting on an upturn to 23.55 million visitors.

This situation is also affecting the hotel industry, which is experiencing one of the most serious crises in its history. In Downtown, the Hyatt Regency Hotel, a 17-storey, -room liner with a neo-futuristic decor, has been given up by owner Highgate at the end of 2024 to Mortgage Trust lender amid $290 million debt. Less dramatic but worrying, the Proper Hotel located at 1100 Market Street has defaulted on a $28 million loan and could be foreclosed or change ownership.

In the last three weeks, the share of U.S. customers who have chosen to remain in the cafes and enjoy their beverages in ceramic mugs and glasses has risen more than threefold, Axios reported Friday (March 21), citing figures shared by the company.

The uptick in what the company calls “sit and stay” visits come as Starbucks has been trying to reverse a drop in foot traffic and dwindling sales. By purchasing a beverage in a mug or glass, customers can get a free refill, which the Axios report says is encouraging some shoppers to hang around.

Tressie Lieberman, the company’s chief brand officer, told the news outlet that Starbucks is “leaning into our coffee culture.”

“We’re reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse and reintroducing Starbucks to the world,” Lieberman added.

She said the company is also investing in marketing with commercials on TV and streaming platforms to “evoke the feeling that ‘I want to go to Starbucks.’”

According to the report, Starbucks told Axios it also plans to bring back “more comfortable seating and spaces to ensure our stores are a place where customers want to sit, work, and meet” and “more separation between the cafe and mobile order experience.”

The report noted that Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol last week told shareholders he was “pleased at the early reaction to changes we’ve made from both customers and partners.”

The company is in the middle of a larger transformation, updating its branding to “Starbucks Coffee Company” and refocusing on its core identity via its “Back to Starbucks” program. That initiative also includes a recent rule change: People who hang out at Starbucks without buying anything will be asked to leave.

As PYMNTS reported in January, the Back to Starbucks is designed to improve the customer experience by prioritizing coffee quality and supporting baristas, while also simplifying the menu and positioning Starbucks as a community gathering space.

“Starbucks has runway … with analysts still seeing strength and opportunity in the brand,” Scott Stuart, CEO of the Turnaround Management Association, told PYMNTS at the time.

“While it’s too early to say on the timing of its turnaround, the challenges it faces are certainly concerning, but not yet alarming to a point of urgency.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starbucks-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 18:59:52.066822

Hewlett-Packard (HP) is doubling down on its India expansion strategy, with a strong focus on local manufacturing and AI-powered innovations. CEO Enrique Lores has emphasized India’s growing importance in HP’s global operations, citing the country as its second-largest talent hub worldwide.

India: A Key Market for HP’s Future Growth

According to Lores, India has already emerged as a major PC market for HP. Citing a report from International Data Corporation (IDC), he highlighted that HP continues to dominate as India’s largest PC manufacturer. The company has been actively investing in the region, particularly under the Make in India initiative.

Local Production Gains Momentum

HP’s local manufacturing efforts have taken a significant leap forward. In collaboration with Dixon Technologies, the company began manufacturing laptops and desktops in India. Now, the next big step is notebook manufacturing, set to launch in April 2025. By ramping up domestic production, HP aims to lower product costs, enhance competitiveness, and offer high-quality, affordable devices to Indian consumers.

Geopolitical Shifts Drive HP’s Strategy

The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China have prompted multinational companies to rethink their supply chains. HP is no exception. With US tariffs on Chinese imports affecting costs, HP is accelerating its India-first approach for manufacturing. Expanding production in India will not only reduce expenses but also grant HP greater access to India’s vast consumer market.

The Rise of AI-Powered PCs in India

HP is also at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) integration in personal computers. The company is developing AI-driven PCs designed to meet the needs of corporates and small businesses. The demand for AI-powered computing solutions is rapidly rising, and HP sees India as a key market for this next-generation technology.

Leveraging Indian Engineering Talent for AI Innovations

India is home to a large pool of software engineers, and HP is set to tap into this expertise. The company has already been working on localized AI models in countries like Spain and Saudi Arabia, and similar efforts are now planned for India. By collaborating with universities and research institutions, HP aims to build India-specific AI models to enhance productivity and user experience.

Summary

I previously rated HPQ as a sell due to high debt and potential reduction in shareholder yield; the stock has since dropped 19%.

I have now upgraded the stock to a hold due to Windows 10 discontinuation, which will result in more PC sales to the commercial sector.

HP still has an overhang of over $1 billion in current debt it must cover before the end of this fiscal year. A revenue boost could ease that pressure.

Both Amazon and Walmart offer influencer programs, which enable well-known internet personalities to curate shoppable digital storefronts.","Although it feels like doom and gloom in the retail industry right now, it's far from it in the right places.

If you know where to look, you can find plenty of deals.

Shoppers are increasingly picky about where they spend their dollars — and how many of them they're willing to part with.

They're far less loyal to any given store or brand. Instead, they largely want to find the best possible deals and put in the least amount of effort in procuring them.

So retailers like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) , both of which offer rock-bottom prices on a bounty of millions of items and offer fast shipping, are poised for more success in the short term.

Walmart and Amazon have winning models

Walmart and Amazon are both highly successful companies because they both have a long reach.

Walmart is the king of brick-and-mortar. With at least one location within 10 miles of 90% of the American population, Walmart is many shoppers' go-to store for everything from groceries to tech.

These many locations have also doubled as fulfillment centers, enabling Walmart to offer rapid delivery to online customers who expect service as fast as Amazon's.

And of course Amazon reigns supreme in the American e-commerce space. Amazon Prime is the gold standard of free and fast shipping, and the retailer continues to ramp up efforts to fulfill same-day deliveries on more items every quarter.

Best Buy takes on Walmart, Amazon

Now, Best Buy is trying to get in on those winning models.

Both Amazon and Walmart offer influencer programs, which enable well-known internet personalities to curate shoppable digital storefronts.

These storefronts can be promoted on social media, for instance, and influencers with large followings can bring big numbers to their storefronts and drive sales for retailers.

Now, Best Buy is offering a similar model.

“Influencers and creators will be able to build their own branded digital storefronts on Best Buy’s website, which we expect to drive increased traffic, engagement, and sales,” Chief Executive Corrie Barry said on the early-March earnings call.

They are famous personalities on the internet and social media whose large followings often convert into sales for platforms and retailers if they agree to partnerships or promotional advertising.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTcwNzYwNDI2OTgyNzQ1NzUx/the-entrance-of-a-best-buy-store-location-with-a-tree-in-front-lead.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 10:59:09.683065

McDonald's sees value as a key driver Kempczinski says McDonald's may have lost its way and ceded an important part of its brand identity to rivals.
""As we have said before, we view good value as including both entry-level items and meal bundles at affordable price points,"" he added.
""This means offering Every Day Affordable Price menus ... in our markets,"" he offered.
""We will pair EDAP platforms with strong meal bundles to provide our customers with entry-level meals at affordable price points,"" he added.","McDonald's' business is very resilient where the economy is concerned.

The chain has a high perceived value based on its relatively low costs compared with other food. McDonald's (MCD) also serves as comfort food.

In times of economic hardship, that makes it an affordable luxury. You might not be able to afford a steakhouse or even a sit-down meal, but most people can scrape together enough money for a Big Mac or a Value Meal.

The chain also did well during the Covid pandemic because it had invested in the technology needed to pivot from an eat-in model to delivery and takeout. McDonald's did not build out that capacity because it expected the pandemic, but its investments served it well.

The fast-food giant's resilience, however, does not mean it's immune to struggles. Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski addressed this matter during McDonald's' third-quarter-earnings call.

""Let's turn now to the update on our performance in Q3. On our last call, we shared that the [quick-service restaurant] sector had meaningfully slowed in many of our markets, with industry traffic declines in several major markets and that consumers, especially those in the low-income category, were choosing to eat at home more often,"" he said. ""This trend continued in the third quarter.""

McDonald's worried about consumer behavior

Kempczinski is not happy with his chain's performance.

""QSR traffic has remained pressured, reflecting industrywide challenges. And while we anticipated a challenging environment in 2024, our performance so far this year has fallen short of our expectations,"" he said.

The CEO made clear that he was unwilling to use market conditions as an excuse for underperformance.

""While the QSR industry has slowed, we recognize that there are still many factors within our control to impact performance, guided by our Accelerating the Arches strategy,"" he added.

""We're encouraged by signs of progress in the third quarter and the more consistent market-share traction we are seeing, especially in the U.S., which included strong, compelling value platforms, which is fundamental to the McDonald's brand promise; menu innovation, which excited our customers with great-tasting food; and strong marketing prowess that drove engagement on higher-margin core items,"" he said.

McDonald's sees value as a key driver

Kempczinski says McDonald's may have lost its way and ceded an important part of its brand identity to rivals.

""We have spoken before about our customers recognizing us as the value leader versus our key competitors, but our value leadership gap has shrunk,"" he said.

""In response, we have moved with urgency in partnership with our franchisees to improve our value offerings in most of our major markets.""

McDonald's has been increasing value offerings worldwide, he said.

""Some examples that launched in the quarter are the 4-euro ($4.38) Happy Meals in France, three for 3 pounds ($3.90) in the U.K.; and in Canada, we're providing value to our customers through price-pointed coffee, starting at just $1 (US$0.70),"" he said.

Kempczinski sees value not as a gimmick but rather part of a broad strategy.

""[To] provide our customers with simple, everyday affordability they can count on, we're employing strategies that are designed to work together to generate sustainable guest-count-led growth and increased market share,"" he said.

""As we have said before, we view good value as including both entry-level items and meal bundles at affordable price points,"" he added.

McDonald's has a name for this strategy.

""This means offering Every Day Affordable Price menus ... in our markets,"" he offered. ""At McDonald's we define EDAP as a platform with an assortment of items all priced at compelling entry-level price points, generally including breakfast, beef, and chicken sandwich options.""

The chain has committed to delivering strong value.

""We will pair EDAP platforms with strong meal bundles to provide our customers with entry-level meals at affordable price points,"" he added.

""Blending EDAP and meal bundles under a branded value platform allows us to invest in and build recognition and affinity with our customers. So when they're thinking about an affordable option for food, we're top of mind.""",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgxOTE0MDY0ODY2MjU2MDAz/mcdonalds_2.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 09:57:59.806175

The retail chain has strengthened its collaboration with Nozzleman Pizza, adding 17 new locations within its stores. This expansion covers six states, including Arizona and Nevada, with plans for growth nationwide.

The alliance not only expands Walmart's food offerings but also aims to attract more customers. Costco has been successful with its popular food area, offering pizzas and hot dogs at low prices. Walmart now wants to replicate that strategy but with a different focus: quality, brand identity, and a stronger social commitment.

Walmart: A Strategy to Differentiate

Nozzleman Pizza is not just another pizzeria. The brand was founded by Jesse Corletto, a former firefighter, and maintains a strong connection with the first responder community. Part of its profits are donated to local fire stations, reinforcing its image of social responsibility.

Additionally, the chain has influential investors like Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi, a former television star, and the foundation of actor Jeremy Renner. This media backing can help Walmart differentiate itself from Costco and other competitors.

The goal is clear: to improve the shopping experience. Integrating food into its stores not only prolongs customers' stay but also encourages spending. Walmart wants its consumers to see its stores as a place where they can shop and, at the same time, enjoy a quality meal.

Advantage Over Its Competition

Costco has managed to build customer loyalty with its affordable food. Its $1.50 pizza and hot dog are almost a company icon. However, there is a barrier: a membership is required to access these benefits.

Walmart wants to break this limitation. Its strategy allows any customer to enjoy a good pizza without paying for a membership. Additionally, Nozzleman Pizza offers a product with its own identity, far from the generic fast food found in other supermarkets.

Walmart, Expansion, and Future

There are no exact dates for the new openings yet, but Walmart has made it clear that it plans to take this idea nationwide. If the project is successful, we may see more partnerships with food brands in the future.

Retail is changing. Supermarkets are no longer just places to buy products but spaces where customers seek convenience and experiences. Walmart is betting on gastronomy as a new way to attract consumers and surpass the competition.

If Nozzleman Pizza manages to win over Walmart's customers, Costco might be forced to improve its food offerings. The battle for the best food in retail is just beginning.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-tienda-exterior-walmart-chico-dinero-feliz_1200_800.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 22:00:22.815748

The maker of Cheerios and Pillsbury saw its shares drop about three percent in early trading following the announcement.

The company joins other packaged food giants—including Conagra Brands, Campbell's, and Kraft Heinz—in warning of a challenging retail environment. Price-conscious shoppers are increasingly opting for store-brand snacks while also cutting back on dining out.

Analysts reacted to the forecast revision with concern. Emarketer analyst Blake Droesch said General Mills is facing an ""uphill battle,"" as economic uncertainty and potential tariffs continue to weigh on consumer spending.

""Even if tariffs don't materialize and consumer confidence improves, those who have turned to private label or other lower-cost alternatives are not certain to return to national brands,"" Droesch added.

General Mills now expects full-year organic sales to decline by 1.5 percent to two percent, a downgrade from its previous projection of flat to 1 percent growth.

The company also stated that its revised outlook does not account for any impact from the Trump administration's latest tariff actions, as their implementation timeline and scope remain unclear.

Adjusted full-year profit is now forecast to decline by seven percent to eight percent, compared to the earlier expectation of a one percent to three percent drop.

To counteract slowing sales, the Minnesota-based company said it is planning cost-cutting measures to save at least US$100 million in fiscal 2026.

For the quarter ended February 23, General Mills reported net sales of $4.84 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations of $4.96 billion, according to LSEG data.

The company attributed the weaker results to retailers' ""unexpected"" inventory reductions in its retail and pet food segment.

NIKE, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.54, expectations were $0.3007.

Operator: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE, Inc. Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Conference Call. For those who want to reference today’s press release, you’ll find it at investors.NIKE.com. Leading today’s call is Paul Trussell, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell.

Paul Trussell: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE Inc’s Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Results. Joining us on today’s call will be NIKE Inc. President and CEO, Elliott Hill; and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE’s reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE’s earnings press release or NIKE’s website, investors.NIKE.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations.

All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral, unless otherwise noted. We will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I’ll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. President and CEO, Elliott Hill.

Elliott Hill: Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start by saying I’m proud of the progress we made against the key actions we committed to 90 days ago. While we met the expectations we set, we’re not satisfied with our overall results. We can and will be better. For the quarter, the big takeaway for me was clear. When we lead with sport, we create impact for NIKE. We told inspiring athletes stories, we brought more energy to sports biggest moments, and we introduced performance product across an integrated marketplace. We delivered something new to the consumer week after week and that’s exactly the kind of sustained pace we need to strengthen our business. Last quarter, I shared my initial observations and where we need to focus.

The last 90 days only reinforced my early assessment of the areas that are most important. Since our last call, I continued to meet with wholesale partners to discuss the distinct role each can play with NIKE. I also had an incredibly inspiring trip to visit factory partners and NIKE teammates in Asia to see how we’re executing in our supply chain with a focus on production for our new innovation. Most importantly, I continue to spend meaningful time with our NIKE teammates. We focused in two areas: strengthening our culture; and committing to our top priorities. In fact, right after my first call with you in December, we met with our teams and shared the five priority actions we outlined on the call, with a sharp focus on five fields of play, three countries, and five cities.

We call these strategic priorities Win Now. We have a clearer picture on our path forward, and despite the global economic uncertainty, I believe our priority actions will continue to drive progress. The first action is to ignite our winning culture. As I mentioned, our teams are building momentum. We’re hustling and being opportunistic. The next action is shaping our brand for distinction. This is about lining up storytelling power of NIKE to celebrate the passion and emotion of sport. In February, I attended the Super Bowl and the NBA All-Star weekend to see firsthand the kind of impact we make when we line up all of our advantages towards one moment. Our third action is to accelerate a complete product portfolio. We’re fully committed to creating a more breadth and depth season after season.

While we added innovation across our five key fields of play this quarter, it’s not enough to offset the continued headwinds of our classic franchises. Elevate and grow the marketplace, the fourth action is a balanced approach where we’re supporting wholesale partners to drive healthy growth and returning NIKE Direct to a premium destination. We’re in the early stages of repositioning NIKE Digital and we’re restoring our sales organization and go-to-market processes. The final action, Win on the Ground, is where we celebrate local athletes, make cultural connections, and support grassroots communities. A big reason for our running product success this quarter was the resources we put into building energy through the ground game. Of all the priority actions, we knew we could move quickest on investing in our brand.

You saw that in several defining moments this quarter. I’ll start with the Super Bowl in New Orleans. It was a course. It starts with our close partnership with the NFL and our high performance uniforms, cleats, and gloves that everyone sees on the field. Our product visibility goes well beyond four quarters. From Jalen Hurts wearing his red and black unbannable Jordan cleats during warm-ups, to Kendrick’s halftime show wearing Deion Sanders’ Retros, and Serena Williams and SZA wearing Chuck Taylors. Our three iconic brands were front and center. We, of course, also debuted So Win, our first Super Bowl ad in 27 years where we celebrated the winning mindset of the top athletes in the world. We also showed up on the ground in New Orleans to support flag football with a sharp focus on girls and a commitment to increasing their participation in the game.

We created pop-up retail spaces across the city with partners like Dix, Sneaker Politics, and Hibbett, and built NIKE and Jordan houses to connect with athletes, influencers, partners, and wholesale retailers. After the win, we followed up with strong, reactive campaigns. The NIKE brand created it’s Good to Be Green for the Eagles win, and for Jaylen’s MVP, the Jordan brand aired its first Super Bowl ad in history, Love Hurts. That is how we create impact and that is NIKE being NIKE. We transitioned from one amazing weekend right into another for the NBA All-Star weekend in the Bay area. Our brands, in one word, dominated. On both sides of the Bay, NIKE, Jordan, and Converse owned performance and the culture of the game, connecting with young athletes and fans through unique experiences.

NIKE celebrated the future of basketball, hosting games with top high school prep stars. At the Alameda Navy Yard, the Jordan Fam Fest celebrated the brand’s biggest moments for its 40th anniversary with thousands of fans. And Converse unveiled the first signature shoe for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Shai 1, designed by Shai himself as the new creative director for Converse basketball. His shoe will launch this fall. All told, NIKE Inc. lit up the marketplace on the ground. Our NIKE San Francisco flagship store had its best commercial day in 10 years. And just down the street, we created energy and buzz with our wholesale partners, Foot Locker and Shoe Palace. One thing it was great to see, for the right product drops, like the NIKE Black Label collection, the Kobe Protro’s, Jordan Red Wands, and Jordan [Forest Cements] (ph), the passion of sneaker culture is alive.

I saw lines down the block all weekend. An important part of our strategy moving forward will be to harness the full power of our portfolio of brands. We made significant progress in elevating the voices and distinct position of our brands at the Super Bowl and All-Star weekend. Shifting to products, we’re beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio. It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over-indexed on. But our approach is simple. Help consumers fall in love with something new from NIKE, and that something is not replacing one icon for another. It’s about building a supporting cast of multiple styles, some that are gaining interaction with men and others with women’s. Segmenting and differentiating our wholesale partners across the integrated marketplace, investing in the presentation of our products at point of sale, digital and physical, and having an intentional ground game in influential cities.

And we will lead with performance, with a disciplined approach that balances product that’s seeding with product that’s scaling. Running with the standout field of play for the quarter, growing mid-single digits, the PEG-41 is continuing to drive healthy volume in all geos. And two innovations that have just begun to seed are the Pegasus Premium and the Vomero 18. The Peg Premium is NIKE bringing something totally unique to the market, a full, visible air zoom unit that, for the first time, we sculpted to the foot so it springs back for better energy return. It’s a great ride and a beautiful looking shoe. Early seed pairs nearly sold out across the North America marketplace, and the Peg Premium will scale through fall 2025. This quarter, we launched the Vomero 18, created for the everyday runner.

We aligned the storytelling of the Vomero 18’s big foam and maximum cushioning across over 1,800 doors in the integrated marketplace, RSG, sporting goods, NIKE Direct, the results have been outstanding. We plan to build on the momentum and double the distribution of a Vomero 18 by mid-April, supported by a large-scale running campaign. You can expect new additions to the franchise to release in our next fiscal year. In running, we’re on the path to meeting our high standards of execution end-to-end. Turning to sportswear, our life’s largest icons, NIKE and Jordan Streetwear, are in different states of transition. With Air Force 1, Donk, and Air Jordan 1, it’s about right sizing, not sun setting. Each franchise will always have a place in our stable of products.

They’re timeless staples with loyal fans. Our best example of healthy diversification in sportswear, footwear right now is our look of running. The Vomero 5 doubled its revenue this quarter. NIKE Shox has grown its revenue by over 10 times in the last three quarters. And while in the seeding stage, recently released shoes like the Air Superfly and the LD1000 are getting a lot of positive interest in the media and on social channels. Air Max, a brand in itself, is a platform that consumers expect us to reinvent. This quarter we brought fresh energy with the new DNA, which is resonating well with consumers in Japan and Korea, and women’s silhouette in the Air Max Muse. Look for another new innovation platform with Air Max in FY 2026. Diversifying our sportswear apparel offense is equally important.

We want to minimize our reliance on fleece and push the edges to build new businesses. And that doesn’t have to fit neatly into the sportswear category either. This quarter’s new 24/7 collection brings performance materials to high-style training apparel. The new impossibly soft and perfect stretch fabrics gave us the opportunity to tell a deep technical apparel story. The first month of sales in 24/7 had exceeded our expectations and were ramping up capacity to meet the demand. We also made some noise with the announcement of a new brand this quarter, NIKESKIMS. Together we identified a consumer need and are creating a new market of style-led product that sculpts and performs. Our first comprehensive collection launches next quarter in North America through both NIKE and SKIMS Direct channels and we will scale globally over multiple seasons.

The apparel space is right for fresh thinking, and I’ve asked our team to keep innovating across the spectrum of performance and style, and to seek out white space in the market to complement our brands and product portfolio. Our responsibility is to grow the overall market, and one of the most powerful ways we do that is through a relentless flow of coveted and innovative product through our powerful brands in both performance and sportswear for men, women, and kids across footwear, apparel, and accessories, and up and down price points. We’re moving with focus and urgency to get back into a rhythm of delivering across all dimensions. The final topic I’d like to discuss in detail is the integrated marketplace, where we create consumer-led experiences across NIKE Direct or our wholesale partners, physical or digital.

In the almost 190 countries in which we do business, we have over 40,000 points of distribution and a digital business with massive reach. Our footprint is an unbeatable competitive advantage. That means that a lot of change is in motion, because we want to be great at all touch points. And I’m playing an active role in this one, leveraging my years of experience and relationships in the marketplace. Here’s what we’re going to prioritize. First, I mentioned, we’re restoring our sales organization and go-to-market processes. Partnering with NIKE must feel like a world-class experience. That means, building growth plans together, creating distinct consumer positions and consumer-right assortments, engaging way earlier in the process and asking for product feedback, delivering our assortments at the right time, right place, and at the right depth.

Educating their teams on new innovations, providing marketing support, and making certain their NIKE presentation is premium so we capitalize on every sale opportunity. In NIKE Direct, Digital will feel the changes more quickly. We’re already reducing the promotional days and discounting at lower rates. In fact, comparing last year’s January and February to this year’s, NIKE Digital in North America went from over 30 promotional days to zero. In our ecosystem, the consumers are already seeing a more elevated content and storytelling with a greater focus on our performance fields of play. Now that I’ve had the opportunity to visit each geography, we’re clear where we will focus to make an immediate impact. Through our Win Now strategic priorities, we’ll start with three key countries, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom, and five key cities, New York, Los Angeles, London, Beijing, and Shanghai.

We’ll invest to make sure each has innovative and coveted products, a loud and proud locally relevant brand voice, a consumer-led and balanced integrated marketplace, and passionate NIKE teammates on the ground. Each country has unique dynamics and is in a different state of development. China specifically is where we’re being the most proactive and cleaning up the marketplace. And we’ll get back to inspiring the Chinese consumer in a more meaningful way. To close, our consumers and partners felt a different pace from NIKE this quarter. We’re off to a solid start. And where we are making progress in our five priority actions, it’s mostly through serving athletes, through the lens of sport and performance. That’s exactly where we want to be.

The bottom line is we are looking for opportunity on all fronts. Now, it’s up to us to be consistent. Some of the bigger shifts I have covered will take multiple seasons of excellent execution. Our teams are moving with focus and urgency and are up to the challenge of writing the next great chapter for NIKE. I’ll pass it to Matt to provide initial thoughts on the building blocks to return to sustainable and profitable growth, and I’ll be back to close out the call.

Matt Friend: Thanks, Elliott, and hello to everyone on the call. The team is moving aggressively to reignite brand momentum through sport and stabilize our business. Our third quarter financial results reflect the headwinds from the Win Now actions we identified for you last quarter. Today I will review our third quarter results and provide context on the progress we have made. Then I will share additional insight for how we expect our Win Now actions to shape our business performance over the near term. This quarter, revenues were down 9% on a reported basis and down 7% on a currency neutral basis. The quarter benefited from strong holiday results in December, including a non-comp benefit from Cyber Monday, followed by double digit declines in January and February.

NIKE Direct was down 10% with NIKE Digital declining 15% and NIKE Stores declining 2%. Wholesale was down 4% largely due to declines in Greater China. Gross margins declined 330 basis points to 41.5% on a reported basis, due to higher markdowns on NIKE Direct, higher wholesale discounts, inventory obsolescence, and product costs and channel mix headwinds. SG&A was down 8% on a reported basis, as increased investments in brand marketing and sports marketing were more than offset by declines in operating overhead. Our effective tax rate was 5.9% compared to 16.5% for the same period last year, primarily due to a onetime tax benefit from US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses. Earnings per share was $0.54. Now let me provide additional insight into our progress against our Win Now actions this quarter.

Let’s begin with our product portfolio. Our performance business grew in the third quarter, led by improving brand and business momentum in training and running, with new product launches, strong sell through of innovation, and a more complete offense across price points in footwear and apparel. This momentum is encouraging since these two sports represent our largest performance businesses. For Q3, this momentum was more than offset by declines in NIKE sportswear and the Jordan brand, led by a double-digit decline in our classic footwear franchises. These franchises again decelerated faster than the overall business, with a more pronounced impact on NIKE Digital. Turning to our marketplace, our teams have taken the initial steps to reposition NIKE Digital as a full-price business.

We remained competitive and promotional in December, finishing with strong holiday results. However, in January and February, we significantly reduced days of promotion in North America and EMEA. This resulted in a several percentage point improvement in demand at full price. With regards to wholesale, since Elliott has returned, we are working as closely with our partners as ever. We are creating confidence through the investments we are making in product engagement, commercial terms, and rebuilding the scale, talent, and capabilities of our sales organization. Within our fall order book in North America, EMEA, and APLA, we see the declines in classic footwear franchises almost being offset by growth in performance dimensions of our portfolio, such as running, training, and basketball, as well as newness in sportswear.

Now let’s talk about the health of our brands. Elliott mobilized our teams this quarter to go bigger and bolder in sports biggest moments. As a result, we supported several new product launches across all three brands. And also delivered outsized brand impact with emotional storytelling in the air and on the ground in key cities. And you felt it. To support this action demand creation expenses grew high single digits versus the prior year. Last, let’s discuss inventory. Inventory declined 2% versus the prior year. But as I said last quarter, inventory remains elevated across all geographies as we implemented our Win Now actions after inventory was purchased and in transit. While we are seeing some increases in customer cancellations, the larger driver of our inventory is the buys for NIKE Direct.

In addition, across the marketplace, we are beginning to see Air Force 1 inventory stabilized with current retail sales, while Air Jordan 1 and Dunk remain elevated with continued actions planned ahead. With that, let me turn to our operating segments. I will focus my commentary on the progress we have made in each of our geographies on our Win Now actions. In North America, Q3 revenue declined 4%. NIKE Direct declined 10%, with NIKE Digital down 12%, and NIKE Stores down 6%. Wholesale increased 3%, due primarily to favorable shipment timing and increased shipments to our value partners in the third quarter. EBIT declined 21% on a reported basis. Throughout the quarter, we delivered bold and inspiring storytelling and key sports moments, as Elliott mentioned, which drove heat and energy for our brand.

Training led performance growth this quarter, and running grew high single digits. In Q3, we hosted dozens of key partners for product engagement and future growth planning, including a summit for partners serving core price points. We have taken initial steps to expand distribution to support our expanded core product offering, which is a meaningful market opportunity for NIKE. In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 6%. NIKE Direct declined 12%, with NIKE Digital down 25%, and NIKE Stores up 9%. Wholesale declined 3%. EBIT declined 35% on a reported basis. In Q3, performance dimensions continue to build momentum, fueled by the Mercurial and Global Football and new product launches in running. We celebrated Zinni Jr’s Best FIFA Men’s Player Award with a short video, Can’t Stop the Dance, featuring the Chrome Mercurial, and we amplified the Peg Premium launch with a unique activation at the London Eye featuring NIKE athletes.

In the marketplace, in addition to taking steps to reposition NIKE Digital, we also started a journey with JD Sports, Sports Direct, and [indiscernible] to elevate our brand physical retail with improved product positioning and visual merchandising. In Greater China, Q3 revenue declined 15%. NIKE Direct declined 11%, with NIKE Digital down 20%, and NIKE Stores down 6%. Wholesale declined 18%. EBIT declined 42% on a reported basis. In Q3, traffic declined double digits, and retail sales underperformed our plan. While the macro environment is challenging, sport is growing in China, and we must accelerate our pace. The market continues to be promotional, especially in consumer moments and in the digital channel. And we are taking aggressive steps to clean up the marketplace, with the priority being the health of our partners.

These steps had a negative impact on our revenue and gross margin this quarter. At the same time, our team is focused on creating brand distinction through sport and serving consumers with new innovation and hyper local product. We saw strong consumer response to the Peg Premium and Vomero 18 in running. And in basketball, we launched the year of the Mamba with strong growth in Kobe Protro. We continue to see locally designed Express Lane product resonate with strong sell-through of our Chinese New Year product. The opportunity in Greater China continues to be significant for NIKE, notwithstanding the highly competitive and fast-moving dynamics in this marketplace. Our brand remains strong, but our actions to energize the marketplace will take some time.

In APLA, Q3 revenue declined 4%. NIKE Direct declined 4%, with NIKE Digital down 8% and NIKE Stores up 1%. Wholesale was down 4%. EBIT declined 27% on a reported basis. While we saw mixed performance across territories in APLA, Japan and Latin America each returned to growth this quarter. In Q3, we created energy on the ground in running communities. We launched the After Dark Tour with incredible response from female runners and executed disruptive race takeovers at the Hakone Ekiden in Japan, the Mumbai Marathon, and the Thailand Marathon. This fueled continued momentum in running with growth across footwear and apparel. Now let’s look forward. Elliott said earlier that we are even more confident that the five Win Now actions are the right moves to create better balance in our business and reignite brand momentum.

So as we begin to have greater clarity and confidence in the steps that we are taking, I will provide some additional thoughts on our path forward over the next several quarters. First, we are accelerating our product portfolio transition. We expect sport performance dimensions to lead our growth with a relentless flow of newness across each field of play. We are focused on increasing the contribution of newness as a percentage of our overall seasonal assortment, including new models, new colors, and new materials. At the same time, we are moving fast to right-size the contribution of our classic footwear franchises. In regards to this transition, we are making progress. In the last quarter of this fiscal year, we expect our classic footwear franchises will be down by more than 10 points as a percent of our total footwear mix.

We intend to drive this mix lower in fiscal 2026 with total units planned down double digits with the most aggressive actions on the Dunk. Second, we are repositioning NIKE Digital within an integrative marketplace. To do this, we are reducing promotional days, reducing markdown rates, and shifting closeout liquidation to our NIKE factory stores. Due to these actions, and as we continue to reduce investment in paid media, we expect digital traffic to be down double digits in fiscal 2026. Gradually, we expect organic traffic to stabilize and grow with new product launches and our increased brand marketing investments. Third, we are cleaning up the marketplace. For NIKE Digital, we are tightening our buys to support a full-price business model.

For NIKE factory stores, we are increasing markdowns to drive velocity of higher volumes of closeout inventory. And for our wholesale partners, we are making investments in sales-related returns, reducing forward supply, and providing higher wholesale discounts to liquidate aged inventory. We expect these actions will continue through the first half of fiscal 2026. Last, when we get back to a steady flow of new product at scale, improve brand engagement, reposition our NIKE Digital business to complement our wholesale partners, and return to a healthy and clean marketplace. We expect our wholesale business to return to growth. Each of our geographies have made varying levels of progress on each of these actions, and as a result are working against different timelines.

But when taken all together, these are the building blocks for NIKE to return sustainable, profitable growth. Now, I’ll turn to our fourth quarter guidance. Our second half plan is in line with what we communicated last quarter, with some shifts occurring between Q3 and Q4. Looking ahead, we believe that the fourth quarter will reflect the largest impact from our Win Now actions and that the headwinds to revenue and gross margin will begin to moderate from there. We are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates, and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.

Our fourth quarter guidance includes our best assessment of these factors based on the data we have available to us today. We expect Q4 revenues to be down in the mid-teens range, albeit at the low end. This includes several points of unfavorable shipment timing in North America, as well as 2 points of negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We expect Q4 gross margins to be down approximately 400 basis points to 500 basis points, including restructuring charges during the same period last year. We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. We expect Q4 SG&A dollars to be up low to mid-single digits, including restructuring charges in the prior year. We will continue to tightly manage expenses, while we increase investment to fuel our win now priorities, most notably demand creation.

We expect other income and expense, including net interest income, to be $45 million to $55 million for Q4. And we expect the tax rate for the full year to be in the mid-teens range. We are focused on what we can control. And for NIKE at this moment, serving athletes with new product innovation and reigniting brand momentum is what matters most. Our collective experience, as well as the early signals we are seeing with consumers, gives us confidence in the path ahead. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Elliott.

Elliott Hill: Thank you, Matt. I’ll close by taking a minute to talk about my teammates at NIKE. Look, it’s been a tough couple of years. We’ve been through a lot of change, but what’s encouraging is that in the 150 days since I’ve been back, we’ve reclaimed our identity. We know who we are. NIKE Inc. is a sports company. We inspire through iconic brands and create innovative products for all athletes. It may seem like an obvious direction, but we needed to say it out loud to reawaken the fire in our teams and I have been unrelenting in that message. One of the things that makes it special to work at NIKE is we invite athletes, coaches, and teams to our business meetings to spend time with our teammates. One conversation that stirred something up in me this quarter was with Coach Ryan Day, coach of the National Champions, the Ohio State Buckeyes.

He had an answer to the question that really connected with how I’m thinking about our team right now and the tone we’re setting. The question to him was, how do you stay on the offense and what’s the key to keeping your program moving forward? His answer was that Ohio State applies pressure constantly in all three phases of the game, no matter who he’s playing. Get vertical down the field on offense. Play suffocating man coverage so no throw is easy, go after punts, and have his best athletes returning kicks. He just painted this picture of a team that is relentlessly pushing and challenging, being aggressive and making it uncomfortable to play against. I love that attitude. And that’s how I think about NIKE when we’re at our best. Success for NIKE has never been about protecting our turf.

We force others to play our game. We drive trends, grow markets we lead. Coach Day made it clear that it takes complete buy-in to be a championship team. That’s exactly what we’re asking of our teammates right now, to keep up the intensity, to move with focus and urgency, to have passion and take pride in all that we do, and to win as a team. With that, I’ll turn it over for questions.

Q&A Session

Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open.

Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you, good afternoon. Elliot, can you provide a timeline on when you think classic shoe inventories will be clean in the wholesale channel? And then same question for the direct channel as well.

Elliott Hill: Thanks for the question Lorraine. Before I dive too deeply into the specific question, I do want to start really quickly because I think it’s important to set the tone here on the call for these types of questions, that 90 days ago, we declared five actions to return to growth. And what we’ll say 90 days later, I’m even more convinced that these are the right actions to move our brand and business forward. And these Win Now actions really start with our culture, our product portfolio, which is a question that you’re asking here, and I’ll dive into that here in just a second, shaping our brand for distinction, elevating and growing the marketplace, and winning on the ground. And what we did add to our teams after coming off the call was providing them a sharp focus on which sports.

We have five sports, running, basketball, football, training and sportswear, three key countries I outlined for you, and then the five cities. So the teams are really rallying around this Win Now priorities and even calling it the [5535] (ph). So now let me let me jump more specifically into product for you and I will also start a little higher level before I dive into the specific question around the key franchises. We are going to run a balanced and complete portfolio. I want to make sure everybody on the call hears that. We’re going to run that through all three brands, NIKE, Jordan, Converse, across performance and sportswear, men’s, women’s, kids’ footwear, pair of accessories, and up and down price points. And we’re going to be sharper on specific sports.

And I’ve touched on those already, so I won’t dive too deeply on those five sports, but we have set teams up against each of those, sport times gender, and we have small teams, cross-functional teams taking the insights from those sports and those consumers and driving innovative products. So I feel good about where the team’s heading on the performance side of the business. And we’re starting to see some great success and I’m sure we’ll hit on that here in a moment. What I’d say about franchise management to answer your question specifically is that, we have decade long experience of managing franchises. And I will also say this, we have the three, Air Force 1, Dunk, A.J. 1, they are still beloved silhouettes. So it’s not about sun setting these, it’s about right sizing them.

And we asked our teams to accelerate our actions, as Matt spoke to in his prepared remarks of right sizing that inventory so that we can get back to running that complete and balanced portfolio. And so we’re confident that we’re making the right moves from a performance perspective and we’re seeing some wins there, running and training that Matt touched on. And we’re right sizing the three key franchises. And at the same time, starting to plant some newness in the sportswear side of our business with the Vomero 5, P6000, Shox. We touched on some of these Superfly, Air Max Muse, and Air Max 95. So, I feel like the teams are taking all the right actions against those key footwear franchises, right sizing the inventory, and getting back to running a relentless flow of innovative and coveted products.

Matt Friend: Hey Lorraine, I’ll just add that what I said in my prepared remarks was that, we intend to drive — we’ve made really good progress over the past year and as Elliott came in, he challenged the teams to increase the pace at which we reduce the supply of those three franchises in the marketplace. And as a result of that, it had some impact on our Q4 headwinds that we talked about, but it will continue to be a headwind in fiscal year 2026. By the time we execute Q4, we expect that we will have reduced the contribution of those franchises by 10 percentage points as a percent of our overall footwear mix. And we intend to drive that down more in fiscal year 2026. When I think about it through the lens of channels, what I would say to you is that on the NIKE Direct side and the Digital side in particular, we’re already taking action, as Elliott and I both outlined, to reduce the number of promotional days and to reducing the discounts that we see in the marketplace.

The challenge we have in the near term is that, we were buying against a different plan. And so we’ve tightened the buys against NIKE Digital, but we really did that towards the end of summer and heading into fall. That inventory will not end up in the digital channel. We will directly transition it to our factory stores and we will clean it in a value channel like we typically do as we clean up the season. On the wholesale side, we’re making investments and I talked about us needing to use the first half of fiscal year 2026 in order to be able to clean up the marketplace. And what I would tell you there is that, the combination of the actions that we’re taking in digital, plus the actions that we’ve communicated and worked through with our partners, we’re already starting to see fruit.

And what I mean by that is, one, inventory of Air Force 1 is beginning to stabilize with retail sales for Air Force 1. But secondly, when you look at the order book in wholesale for our partners in North America, Maine, and APLA, we’re seeing growth in the performance dimensions of our business plus newness in sportswear almost offset the declines we’re managing in the classic footwear franchises. And that gives us a lot of confidence that our partners are coming behind us and that we are moving down the right path to affect the cleanup.

Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Brooke Roach: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. Elliot, I was hoping to get your latest thoughts on innovation within NIKE. How do you feel about the strength of your innovation team and the pipeline ahead? And how are you thinking about innovating into some of the sportswear franchises as we look into fiscal 2026? Thank you.

Elliott Hill: Yes, thank you, Brooke. Let me first start on innovation. When we think about innovation, we think about it really in two forms. We have long term, let’s call it three to plus five years, and we have a dedicated team against that over at our LeBron James NIKE Sports Research Lab and what I would say a really confident in the team that we have there and not only the team but the work that they are doing long-term creating new innovation for our team. So that’s a little longer term. I spent a lot of time with [John Hoke] (ph) and his team over there and excited about some of the products that are coming through the NIKE Sports Research Lab. Shorter term and more near term, again, I touched on it in my first answer and it’s really coming back to driving newness and freshness against Performance and sportswear, men’s, women’s, kids, footwear, apparel, and accessories, not just footwear.

We’ve got some really interesting innovation coming from apparel. I touched on it briefly in my prepared remarks around 24/7. And it comes out of our training line, but it is also viewed as sportswear. And there’s some innovation there. And I’m really pleased with the sell through on 24/7 and the reorders that are coming on that from an apparel perspective. And then on a footwear perspective, we’ll continue to right size the three franchise that I touched on. We still believe all three of them are meaningful products. And then you’ll see us continue to invest in innovation around sportswear. And I touched on some of those products. The Vomero 5, P6000, Shox. Shox is having a really built into momentum. Air Max 95, etc. And I’ll just close out here, Brooke.

This week we had our Spring 26 product review where we bring all of our Geo partners here to the campus to go through our Spring 26 line. And what I’ll tell you is, we are all excited about the products that are coming for Spring 26. We’re starting to see our Win Now focus on accelerating our product portfolio against these five sports, running, basketball, football, training, and sportswear, paying dividends. I’m really excited about the work I saw there. And while I have you, I’ll just add one other thing that I saw that I was excited about. We are also working on elevating the marketplace and the retail team’s done some phenomenal work around elevating our presentation at both wholesale and physical retail. And so excited about some of that work.

So overall, I’m confident that our innovation pipeline is there. We just now have to flow through it to get back to building the brand and the business.

Operator: And to our next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. Your line is open.

Aneesha Sherman: Thank you so much. Elliot, I just want to follow up on the comment that you just made about the Spring 26 product review. Based on some of the comments earlier from Matt around performance growth almost offsetting classic declines, do you expect that inflection point to be in Spring 26? I know you don’t have the orders yet, but is that when you expect performance growth to more than offset classics in your total wholesale order book to grow? And then, Matt, a follow-up on your comments on gross margins. You talked about wholesale liquidations at H1. I know you’re not giving margin guidance for next year, but are you generally expecting gradual progression of gross margins through the year as some of those liquidations roll off and then you get a stronger order book in the second half? Thank you.

Elliott Hill: Let me — here’s — we’re absolutely gaining confidence in the product pipeline. In the fall, Matt already touched on some of the order book on fall in North America, APLA, and EMEA. So definitely gaining confidence around the order book fall holiday and then like I said this sneak peek into 2026. The key here though is how quickly we can clean up the marketplace. That’s why you see some of the results that we have in Q4 and then resetting both the digital and physical marketplaces to receive this innovation, making certain that we present it in the way that we believe we need to present the product at point of sale, digital, physical, so that we drive the sell through. And so that’s where we have the team’s focus right now.

The brand, I believe we’ve already started to invest in, we did that early. I see product coming now and that excites me and so I feel good about that. Now we’ve got to reset the marketplace and make sure that we get the sell through and it’s that sell through that’s going to continue to drive the order book and get us back to profitable sustainable growth.

Matt Friend: Yes, and I just would add that, last quarter we said that the fourth quarter was going to have the largest, the greatest impact from the Win Now actions that Elliott outlined. And we continue to believe this is true and it’s on our plan. But what we can also tell you is that we now expect Q4 to reflect the largest impact from these Win Now actions. And that the headwinds to revenue and margin we expect to moderate from there. And so, how I think you translate that, Aneesha, as you start to look forward is, we’ve tried to lay out each of these actions and the implications that they have as we start to think about heading into 2026. And we expect that these headwinds will continue in 2026. And as Elliott referenced, while we’re going to have positive things beginning vis-a-vis greater full price selling in digital, and we’re going to have a clean and full price order book with our wholesale partners, we are going to continue to be liquidating inventory.

And we expect that that’s going to take us several quarters to work through. But the reason why we’re confident in it is because we know we’ll be liquidating it through the channels where we’re used to liquidating that inventory. So we will continue to be transparent as we’ve got greater visibility as we get into fiscal 2026. But we’re still in the early days of executing against these partnerships. And I’m sorry, we’re still in the early days of executing against these priorities. And we remain committed to providing guidance and financial updates every 90 days.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO. Your line is open.

Simeon Siegel: Thanks. Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Elliott, I’m curious, how are you going to balance the promotional, just like as you think about the presentation and bringing out promotions at the same time that it’s clear we can hear your excitement around the new product and your amplifying storytelling, just from a consumer’s perspective, how do you tell them this exciting story while still clearing the product? So how are you going to protect that and maybe segment that? And then Matt, it seems operating overhead versus demand creation trajectory flipped in recent years. So as you’re re-embracing wholesale, as you’re re-embracing elevating, any thoughts as to just the right level, long-term of overhead versus demand creation as the rate of sale. Thanks, guys.

Elliott Hill: Yes. Simeon, I think I’d be fairly brief here. Matt touched on some of the headwinds to the P&L, and one of them is us taking products — we’re returning products from our wholesale partners. So we’re bringing the product that’s not selling out of the market and then we will liquidate that to our value stores, NIKE value stores, to make room for the new innovation. And so — and it’s already starting — and by the way, we’re doing the same thing not only in a physical space, but we’re also doing it — excuse me, we’re doing it in a digital space as well. We touched on how we’ve already moved NIKE Direct, Digital to a full price presentation, really elevating the assortment, the presentation, the user experience.

And so, we’re moving the — both digital and physical owned and partnered retail floor sets to full price as quickly as possible. And then we’ll use the value channels to move through the excess inventory. I think the last — I’ll just kind of finish here, the best example of that is how we’re going to reset running. We’ve had some great examples of Peg Premium this quarter, Vomero 18 this quarter, both new innovations with great storytelling, great presentation. And we’ve had wonderful sell-throughs on those. And then you’ll see that Simeon continue to flow into fall and holiday of Q1, Q2 of 2026 with a full range of product in running across three different silos of running, Vomero, PEG, Structure, three different price points, trail running, and then of course our racing flats.

And that was one of the floor sets that I saw over at the Spring 26, And again, it looks amazing. So we’re trying to get our marketplace to full price as quickly as possible and feel like the teams are moving with a sense of urgency.

Matt Friend: Yes. And on the SG&A side, I’ve said for a couple quarters that we continue to manage our expenses and what I meant by that specifically was overhead tightly. While we accelerate investment in demand creation and so our demand creation being up high single digits, 8% this quarter, is truly a reflection of Elliott coming in and challenging the team to elevate our storytelling with impact. And it’s the easiest lever for us to pull. And the team mobilized around the Super Bowl and the All-Star weekend and the product launches for Peg and Vomero, but also the way that they executed on the ground those activities in the cities in which we were focused. As we look forward, I think we’re going to continue to manage expenses tightly.

I think that part of what you’re seeing this quarter in the double digit decline in operating overhead is some of the variable expense from Direct coming down, flowing through the P&L. You’re also seeing the great work our teams have done from a productivity perspective in managing against some of the productivity goals that we had set several quarters ago. If you look at our operating overhead growth, excluding the restructuring impact in the prior year, it was down 3%. And we’re focused on ensuring that we invest behind our sales organizations, our key city teams on the one end and on the other end making sure that we’ve got the right resources and product and in innovation. And so we’ll continue to do that and we’ll continue to try to do it while we manage expenses tightly as we look forward to returning to growth.

Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Alex Straton: Thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to focus on wholesale here. And maybe for Elliott, as you’ve kind of returned to that channel and gotten back in the mix, I’m just curious, your biggest learnings there, any surprises of the upside or downside versus how you’ve historically operated there with all your knowledge? And maybe then for Matt, you just mentioned wholesale discounts as a headwind, which should continue. Are historical wholesale margins still in view? Are those structurally lower? Just curious for your latest thoughts there. Thanks a lot.

Elliott Hill: Yes, thank you, Alex. It’s maybe a surprise. We were probably working probably two siloed, direct versus wholesale. And again, I think to really drive the potential of our brand and our revenue and to meet consumers’ needs, it’s got to be integrated. It’s got to be an aligned approach to both direct and wholesale, digital and physical. It all has to work together in a consistent ecosystem. And so, I’m really driving hard [indiscernible] integrated consumer-led marketplace, let the consumer decide where they want to choose to shop. May 2 moves, Craig Williams and I, we’ve put in place two new leaders, one in NIKE Direct, Shannon Glass, and then the other one in sales, Erica Bullard, both long-term industry veterans and NIKE veterans.

In fact, we put them sitting next to up on our floor together. They have offices right outside of one another and they walk hand-in-hand and making certain like literally almost physically. So I told them those two have got to walk together everywhere they go and make certain that we stay aligned. And I think they’re doing a tremendous job of really making certain that we have an integrated approach to the overall marketplace. So I’d say that’s probably number one. Number two, we just got out of a rhythm of working closely with our wholesale partners. That was a bit of a surprise, and we are quickly getting back to — we’ve got cross-functional teams, we’re having key account planning meetings now with our wholesale partners. We’re working through unaligned growth plans.

We’re working on consumer right assortments in the right depth. We’re working now to elevate the presentation of our brand. And you know all too well when we have beautiful, innovative product and we elevate the presentation, it really helps sell through the product and marketing support. So again, I’m confident in the progress we’re making. It’s going to take time to build back all of the teams around the world. And that’s why we have the three key countries where we’re trying to focus, United States, China, and the UK, so that our teams know where we’re going to focus our investments and resources. So all in all, the wholesale partners, they want and need us to get back to be a NIKE.

Matt Friend: And from a margin perspective, what I would say is that, over the past several years, Alex, the profit pool in wholesale has been relatively volatile. There’s been a lot of things that have happened with supply chain disruption, ocean freight rates moving, the supply demand imbalances. And as a result of that, we’ve all navigated through many things in order to be able to manage the profitability of the channel. I think one of the things that we did a couple of years ago as we were seeing a significant demand versus supply imbalance, meaning an incredible amount of demand and less supply, is we actually lowered our wholesale discount rates in order to offset other headwinds that we were dealing with from a freight and transportation perspective.

And so we are investing in commercial terms, but we’re putting them back to historical levels. And so — and we believe that by doing that, we’ll be competitive. It will enable us and our partners to have mutually profitable businesses and also have the capacity that we need in order to be able to invest in the presentation of our brand at retail, which is ultimately what wins at the end of the day.

Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Randy Konick with Jeffries. Your line is open.

Randal Konik: Yes, thanks a lot and good evening. I guess Elliott, maybe give us some perspective. I think you spoke about a lot of things you’re doing with urgency in China, but maybe give us a progress report on where you see the different geos from all these strategies you’re undertaking. Give us some perspective where you’re furthest along — we’re furthest along. That’d be very helpful. Thanks.

Elliott Hill: Yeah. I think the key here, Randy, is as we think about our overall portfolio, is that we have 190 countries that all roll up to four different geographies. And we’re working closely with the leaders of each of the geos and countries to implement the Win Now strategy. Because again, the strategy works no matter if you’re in the United States or in Japan. It all goes back to putting the consumer at the center, right products, storytelling, marketplace. And so, Matt in his prepared remarks touched on APLA, EMEA, and North America being where they are in almost — in terms of futures in performance and looks of sportswear offsetting. And so, we’re, I think, making progress in each of those three geos. In terms of China, here’s what I’d say about China.

We remain committed to China. We see the long-term opportunity there. There’s 1.3 billion consumers, and it’s our opportunity. And what we’ve always done there is to invite and inspire those 1.3 billion consumers into sport, fitness, and the lifestyle of sport. And our team is doing a good job there. We’ve also made some significant investments in China, whether it’s around some of the big teams like the national basketball team, the track and field team, and the football team. So we’ve made big investments there. We’ve got now a product creation arm that we call Geo Express Lane in China. So overall, I think we’ve made the right investments. What I will say, I spent some time over there in December. I hadn’t been over there in a while. The competition is a bit more aggressive than I had — when I remembered it four and a half years ago.

And so we’ve just got to accelerate our pace. Good news is, we’re starting still as the number one brand there. We’re working closely with Angela and her team to implement these Win Now strategies. We’re cleaning up the promotional marketplace just like we’re doing everywhere to make room for new innovation. We’re getting back to elevating NIKE Direct and Digital, and then working closely with our two big partners to make certain that we’re investing in consumer-led concepts with a focus on performance, running, training, basketball, Jordan, ACG, put the right assortments, depth, presentation, all the things that I’ve talked a lot about. But in the end, I believe we’re taking all the right actions and we’re confident in the long-term opportunity in China.

Matt Friend: And when you look at the financial performance for China in the quarter, what I tried to highlight was the amount of actions that we took in the quarter between marketplace returns, rebates, and also some investments that we’re making to liquidate inventory. And given that it’s a mono-brand market, as Elliott mentioned, it’s going to take us time to execute the Win Now in China. So we went aggressive because the faster we can clean up the marketplace and create the capacity and the space to present the new product stories, the new product assortments that we’re excited about that are coming, the quicker we’re going to create energy with consumers, that’s when we should see traffic start to improve and we should start to build more momentum in that marketplace. So as we look at that, we just expect it’s going to take us some time to be able to execute this.",https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20141443/NKE-insidermonkey-1695233681388.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 03:58:55.193636

Shares for Nike fell on the day, as investors brought the stock price down 5.4 percent.","Nike is still struggling.

The iconic shoe company just reported a shocking sales collapse that has fans worried about the store's future.

It's a bleak update in a saga that has seen arguably America's most legendary athletic fashion brand struggle to put popular products on its shelves.

'To me it seems that the only thing Nike has going for them is brand image to justify outrageous prices,' one customer recently complained on Reddit.

'$200 for a sneaker? Yeah right.'

Nike's sales dropped 9 percent, a staggering $1.16 billion fall in the value of shoes, tracksuits, and t-shirts.

Executives said the slowdown was likely because Chinese consumers are cutting back on spending. There are several reasons for Nike's struggles.

For years, conservatives have criticized Nike for its partnerships with political activists and athletes, such as Colin Kaepernick, who protested during the national anthem, viewing it as a shift toward 'woke' culture.

The company's stance on social issues and commitment to diversity and inclusion have led some to accuse it of prioritizing activism over traditional American values.

In particular, conservatives spoke out against the company's all-female Super Bowl ad.

Caitlin Clark, the dominant WNBA player, was a central figure in the ad campaign.

And now, Nike is also facing stiff competition from rising competitors in the US.

Hoka, Brooks, and Saucony are all gaining sales in the athletic sneaker industry after spending millions of dollars on branding deals with running clubs and community events.

These brands are more nimble, often offering trendy designs at lower price points and delivering a more eco-conscious message.

Nike, by contrast, has struggled with inventory numbers in its stores.

The company rarely offers major discounts on its top-end shoes, including its iconic Air Jordans brand.

Sales fell the most in China, one of its largest markets., where they fell 17 percent.

Before the sales dip, Nike was already in the middle of a revolutionary change, headed by new CEO, Elliott Hill.

Hill, who took over the top spot in the company in late 2024, has warned that the company needs to endure a rocky period before righting the ship.

During the earnings call, Hill said he expects sales to continue to dip in the next quarter.

He also explicitly said that tariff policies from the Trump White House will hurt Nike's bottom line.

But more recently, Americans have taken to cutting back on alcohol.

Part of that shift may relate to a broad pullback in spending.

Consumers are being more mindful of where their dollars are going given a years-long stretch of rampant inflation. And with interest rates unlikely to come down anytime soon, Americans are limiting what they buy to avoid needless debt.

There are also growing health concerns about alcohol consumption. Earlier this year, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a warning about the long-term risks of drinking.

A 2024 Gallup poll found that more Americans are acknowledging the negative effects of alcohol. Many are now turning to beverages with a lower alcoholic content as a middle-ground solution.

Pre-made cocktails are grabbing consumers' attention

At a time when consumers may be avoiding bars and their overpriced menus, a growing number are turning to pre-made cocktails for the convenience as well as the novelty.

Many pre-made cocktails are, by nature, lower in alcohol -- though not necessarily in calories. But for consumers who are trying to be more mindful about the former than the latter, they're an easy solution and alternative to happy hour.

A growing number of beverage companies are jumping on the pre-made cocktail bandwagon. SunnyD Vodka Seltzer debuted in 2023, and more recently, Kraft Heinz introduced Crystal Light Vodka Refreshers.

Coca-Cola has never been a company to sit on the sidelines when a new trend in beverages emerges. Now, it's rolling out a new concoction that fans might swoon over.

Coca-Cola goes all-in on canned cocktails

Cola-Cola hasn't been shy about getting into the alcohol game. It already has a partnership with Brown-Forman that produces Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola, as well as a partnership with Constellation Brands on Fresca Mixed. And its Minute Maid spiked line features flavors like Strawberry Daiquiri.

Now, Coca-Cola is bringing a new vodka cocktail into the mix. Dubbed Minute Maid spiked, it's a mix of vodka and lemonade (both classic and pink).

Coca-Cola's new drinks, which will be released through the company's Red Tree Beverages subsidiary, have 5% alcohol by volume. They also don't contain carbonation.

In recent years, beverage brands have enjoyed success by focusing on the quality of their spirits in pre-made drinks. Surfside, the maker of non-carbonated vodka-infused tea and lemonade, was the second-best-selling canned cocktail made with spirits in 2024.

As Americans take a more cautious approach to spending, focusing on spirit quality is a smart move for beverage-makers, as is veering away from carbonated beverages. Coca-Cola’s new offerings may prove to be a smoother, more sophisticated version of the pre-packaged cocktails today’s Gen Xers drank when they were younger (Zima, we’re talking to you).

More Food + Dining:

Starbucks announces bittersweet change you will soon see in stores

Costco confirms major change to its food court menu

McDonald’s menu change sparks sharp criticism from customers

Still, Coca-Cola may want to tread lightly at a time when Americans are rethinking their relationship with alcohol.

The company already has a number of pre-made cocktails in its lineup. And at a time when consumers may be looking to cut back on booze as well as calories, it may not want to put too many eggs into this particular basket.

A 2025 NC Solutions survey found that 49% of Americans plan to drink less alcohol in 2025. So what Coca-Cola may want to do following its latest move is expand into the mocktail space.

It’s clear that consumers are still willing to spend money on fun beverages, and they’re eager to stock their own fridges rather than pay a premium to drink outside the home. As beverage companies dive headfirst into the world of pre-packaged cocktails, they should keep a pulse on the growing mocktail trend.

Nike’s stock price dropped 7% after projecting a double-digit revenue decline due to shipment delays, exchange rate issues, and looming tariffs. Concerns about a potential universal tariff on April 2 are adding to Nike’s woes. Despite the challenges, CEO Elliot Hill remains optimistic, focusing on digital growth, product innovation, and athlete engagement. While consumer spending increased by 6% in 2025, uncertainty surrounding tariffs continues to create tension for Nike’s future. The upcoming April 2 decision could significantly impact Nike’s financial outlook.

Nike’s stock price nosedived 7% after the company projected a double-digit revenue decline due to challenging market conditions, supply chain disruptions, and looming tariffs. CFO Matthew Friend outlined these concerns during an earnings call, highlighting the impact of shipment timing issues in North America and a 2% negative hit from foreign exchange rates. Adding to this pressure, tariff threats from the Trump administration are raising fears of further losses.

Why did Nike’s stock plunge so sharply?

Nike’s shares dropped significantly after predicting a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue for the next quarter. Several factors are contributing to this decline:

Shipment delays in North America affecting timely deliveries.

Foreign exchange headwinds accounting for a 2% revenue loss.

Tariff concerns linked to key trading partners, particularly China and Mexico.

Are tariffs from Trump administration hurting Nike’s bottom line?

Yes, Nike has already factored tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods into its projections, but there’s a much larger storm brewing. A potential universal tariff expected on April 2 could escalate costs even further, putting additional strain on the company’s supply chain and pricing strategies.

What’s Nike’s ‘Win Now’ strategy to bounce back?

Amidst the challenges, Nike’s new CEO Elliot Hill remains confident about the company’s future. He is doubling down on a ‘Win Now’ strategy that focuses on:

Revitalizing the brand through cutting-edge product launches.

Boosting digital engagement by strengthening its e-commerce presence.

Connecting with young athletes to enhance grassroots loyalty.

Is consumer spending helping or hurting Nike’s prospects?

Surprisingly, consumer spending remains strong, offering a glimmer of hope for Nike. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, reported a 6% increase in consumer spending during the first few months of 2025 compared to the previous year. This robust spending pattern suggests that Nike could still capitalize on consumer resilience despite mounting uncertainties.

Live Events

Are other companies facing similar tariff headwinds?

Nike is not alone in its tariff woes. Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture, pointed out in the company’s Q2 2025 earnings call that tariffs and trade uncertainties are global concerns affecting various industries. Many corporations are preparing for potential disruptions that may arise after the April 2 tariff announcement.

Can Nike weather the storm of trade policy changes?

As Nike navigates through a turbulent economic landscape, its focus on innovation and digital growth may serve as a buffer against further financial hits. However, the April 2 tariff decision remains a looming threat that could reshape Nike’s financial future dramatically.

FAQs:

Why did Nike’s stock price drop by 7%?

Nike’s shares fell due to revenue decline, shipment delays, and looming tariff concerns.

How is Nike responding to tariff challenges?

Nike is focusing on digital expansion, innovation, and grassroots engagement.

But he said his company is open to making more acquisitions along the lines of the Softchoice deal.
“We are a big partner with Nvidia on the infrastructure side, helping with data center and AI purpose-built data center buildouts,” he said.","‘We found the build-out of Softchoice in the SMB space and the midmarket and commercial space, both in Canada and in the US, to be very attractive, because that's a big market that we haven't necessarily gone after, and we don't necessarily have the, I would say, muscle memory. We haven't built out the go-to-market around that space. So instead of trying to invent that ourselves, we thought Softchoice could be a very good acquisition to accelerate that,’ says WWT CEO Jim Kavanaugh.

This week’s Nvidia GTC 2025 conference brought together hundreds of companies looking to grab a piece of the AI action spearheaded by Nvidia by means of its industry-leading GPU and DPU technology.

Among the exhibitors at the conference in San Jose, Calif., was St. Louis-based solution provider World Wide Technology (WWT), which just recently closed its $1.25 billion acquisition of Softchoice, a Toronto-based software and cloud-focused IT solution provider.

Kavanaugh said that 99.9 percent of WWT’s growth over the last 35 years has been organic, and that his company continues to see enormous opportunity for organic growth. But he said his company is open to making more acquisitions along the lines of the Softchoice deal.

“Those acquisitions, from our perspective, could be ones that complement and synergize what we do today, and it could be technology-based acquisitions focused on AI, cloud or cyber,” Kavanaugh said.

“Or it could be a combination of technology-based synergies along with geographic capabilities that would help accelerate our capability to expand domestically and in North America and globally. So we put together an acquisition team about a year and a half ago and started building a pipeline of different companies that we were potentially interested in.”

The first acquisition from that pipeline was Softchoice, which Kavanaugh said had the synergies and complementary capabilities WWT was looking for.

“We found the build-out of Softchoice in the SMB space and the midmarket and commercial space, both in Canada and in the US, to be very attractive, because that’s a big market that we haven’t necessarily gone after, and we don’t necessarily have the, I would say, muscle memory,” he said. “We haven’t built out the go-to-market around that space. So instead of trying to invent that ourselves, we thought Softchoice could be a very good acquisition to accelerate that.”

WWT also found Softchoice’s focus on the cloud and cybersecurity to be very complementary to what it was doing, Kavanaugh said.

“And we liked their focus on AI, specifically around Microsoft, them being a big Microsoft partner in the SMB space,” he said. “I would say 90-plus percent of their focus has been in the SMB space. All of those things were very attractive to World Wide, and we felt very complementary to what we're doing. And we also felt very, very good about their CEO and their leadership team. We really liked them. We liked their mindset and the culture of the organization.”

Softchoice CEO Andrew Caprara (right, in photo), told CRN that, while Softchoice was a very profitable independent company, its growth was attracting a lot of attention in the industry. The temptation to become part of a larger company like WWT was also fueled by the consideration that the company had to make a move to meet its responsibility to its shareholders.

“As we started going through the process, it just became really clear that the combination of Softchoice with World Wide would really stand out in the marketplace,” Caprara said. “When you think about some of the combinations in our space in the past, it’s usually more like-for-like M&A. It’s a hardware-focused company buying another one, or somebody buying something at a low multiple. This is really one of the first times where you’re seeing one of the premier Microsoft and software solution providers joining forces with one of the premier infrastructure and AI and cybersecurity solution providers.”

The acquisition felt like a good fit from a solution and a people perspective, Caprara said.

“It felt like now is the time to take advantage of the opportunity, because, as you know, there’s a lot of change for our customers right now and they’re really looking for somebody that can help them with an end-to-end solution. And I think we can do that now like no one else can.”

WWT At Nvidia GTC 2025

When asked what WWT was doing at Nvidia GTC 2025, Kavanaugh said his company has built multiple AI use cases based on its 10-year relationship with Nvidia and found that having a presence at the conference was a great way to show them off to clients and potential clients.

These include use cases around WWT’s unique ability to design, engineer and build out AI purpose-built data centers around Nvidia technology and the other components that go into the architectural build, he said.

“And then we have also use cases that we have built for our customers, and some of them for ourselves internally, like an AI-generated RFP [request for proposal] assistant that we have designed and built internally and have deployed for customers,” he said. “And there are some things around computer vision that we’re doing, some digital twins that we showed.”

WWT has been working with Nvidia on the data science, natural language processing and machine learning side, Kavanaugh said. The emergence of GenAI and ChatGPT and related technologies put WWT in a great position with Nvidia given its established data science group along with software development and infrastructure expertise.

“We are a big partner with Nvidia on the infrastructure side, helping with data center and AI purpose-built data center buildouts,” he said. “We’re working with them domestically, in Europe and in the Middle East on that. And we’re working with them also on the inference, the outcome side. With our management consulting software development group, we’re working with them and our customers to help build out different capabilities, whether it’s a digital twin or some type of computer vision capabilities around AI use cases.”",https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2025/media_1c4baf2e305e58f419006e454467c9bb38c20c9f6.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2025-03-22 11:03:23.845859

The company recently reported a 9% year-over-year revenue decline in its Q3 2025 earnings, with total revenues falling to $11.3 billion. While earnings per share of 54 cents beat analyst expectations, the underlying trends point to deeper concerns for the brand’s long-term trajectory.

The declines were broad-based: North American revenue dropped 4%, while Greater China saw a dramatic 17% fall. Even Nike’s previously strong direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment took a hit, with Nike Direct revenues down 12% and Nike Digital falling 15%. Net income also declined sharply—down 32% year-over-year to $0.8 billion—and gross margins dropped 330 basis points to 41.5%. Investors responded swiftly, with Nike’s stock tumbling nearly 8% following the earnings call and subsequent downward revisions of future guidance.

The company attributed the results to a challenging retail environment and slower consumer demand in key markets. But the picture is becoming increasingly clear: Nike’s traditional playbook is being disrupted.

Rising Competition from Emerging Brands

As Nike battles to maintain its footing, new-generation brands are rapidly gaining traction with consumers seeking innovation, authenticity, and purpose-driven products.

On Running, the Swiss-based brand formally known as On Holding AG, is a clear standout. In its latest full-year earnings, On reported net sales of CHF 1.8 billion (approx. USD $2.1 billion), a 55% increase in constant currency terms. The company also posted a gross profit margin of 59.6%, a strong contrast to Nike’s margin contraction, and reported net income of CHF 79.6 million.

On’s success is tied to a mix of high-performance product design, minimalist branding, and carefully curated celebrity partnerships—including tennis icon Roger Federer and actress Zendaya. The brand’s appeal cuts across performance runners, lifestyle wearers, and younger demographics, offering an image of modern athleticism with a premium feel. As a result, On is rapidly eating into market share once dominated by Nike.

The Rise of Sustainable Disruptors

Nike is also facing pressure from emerging, sustainability-focused brands like Tarkine, an Australian company gaining traction with eco-conscious runners. Tarkine uses recycled materials, certified processes, and ethical labor—appealing to consumers seeking purpose-driven products.

While not yet matching Nike’s scale, brands like Tarkine reflect a broader shift toward companies built around sustainability from day one, not as a marketing add-on.

Market Signals

The broader market is responding to these shifts. Investors and analysts alike are beginning to question whether Nike can continue to rely on its historical brand power and marketing spend to maintain leadership. With legacy infrastructure and slower agility, Nike faces a growing gap in product innovation and consumer connection compared to its leaner, more adaptive competitors.

Looking Ahead

While Nike remains a powerful player, the latest financial results and market reactions suggest a changing of the guard may be underway in segments of the athletic footwear market. The rise of performance-lifestyle hybrids like On and sustainability-first brands like Tarkine indicates that consumers are rewarding differentiation over tradition.

Nike’s next steps will be closely watched. It can no longer afford to assume loyalty will carry it through disruption. The landscape is evolving—and fast.",https://runnerstribe.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gen-Nike-2_008.jpg,N,,2025-03-22 19:00:19.394102

Nike's turnaround effort is hitting snags as the company tries to clear out old inventory while feeling the effects of a growing trade war.

The sportswear maker signaled further declines in revenue and profitability due to an ongoing merchandise reset that the company says is necessary to renew growth. Nike also expects gross margin to decline sharply in the current quarter from a year earlier, in part due to US tariffs on products from China and Mexico.

Chief executive officer Elliott Hill, a longtime Nike executive who came out of retirement to take the top role in October, is looking to guide the company back to growth after a difficult year of falling sales and corporate layoffs. He's reshaping Nike by refocusing on sports and mending relationships with its retail partners.

Advt

Nike is in the midst of clearing out stale merchandise through heavy discounting as demand fades for some of its biggest sneaker franchises, including Air Force 1s and Dunks. Inventory fell 2 per cent in the period but Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said those levels remain ""elevated across all categories.""

The company is trying to turn things around against a backdrop of weak consumer spending and fallout from President Donald Trump's escalating trade war. China also remained a weak spot, with sales missing analyst expectations amid a prolonged consumer slump in the market. But performance in North America and the region that includes Europe, Africa and the Middle East came in better than expected.

In the company's call with analysts, Friend said ""geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations"" are among factors creating uncertainty.

In fiscal 2024, China produced 18 per cent of Nike-branded footwear, according to company reports. A company website shows Nike has 117 manufacturing locations in China and eight in Mexico.

Friend added that Nike will see a double-digit drop in digital traffic in the company's next fiscal year as the company transitions to a new mix of products.

Revenue fell 9 per cent to $11.3 billion for the company's fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28, better than the 11 per cent drop that Wall Street predicted.

The performance shows that ""a turnaround is beginning to unfold,"" said Poonam Goyal, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""But the company still has a lot of work to do to reduce inventories.""

In December, Hill outlined a plan to invigorate Nike by reorganizing around departments that focus on sports such as running, basketball and soccer. The company is also reallocating marketing funds from clicky digital ads to more anthemic sports campaigns. It spent 8 per cent more on marketing in the latest quarter.

""It's been a tough couple of years,"" Hill said during the call. ""But what's encouraging is that in the 150 days since I've been back, we've reclaimed our identity.""

Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said the results showed Nike is having ""a good start to a two-year journey.""

On the company’s third quarter earnings call on Thursday night, Hill told analysts about its “Win Now” strategy Nike execs developed back in December.
According to the CEO, who joined the company in October, these new priorities are centered around five fields of play, three countries and five cities.

On the company’s third quarter earnings call on Thursday night, Hill told analysts about its “Win Now” strategy Nike execs developed back in December. According to the CEO, who joined the company in October, these new priorities are centered around five fields of play, three countries and five cities.

Hill noted that the fields of play that Nike is focused on in this strategy include running, basketball, football, training and sportswear. The CEO added that he is “confident” that the company is “making the right moves” as he’s already seeing improvements in both the running and training business segments. Ultimately, though, it’s about running a “balanced and complete” portfolio, Hill said.

“We’re going to run that through all three brands – Nike, Jordan and Converse – across performance in sportswear, men’s, women’s, kids, footwear, apparel, accessories and up and down price points,” Hill said. “And we’re going to be sharp on specific sports.”

This is where the new product comes into play. As discussed for months now, Nike has been working to clean up its distribution of the oversaturated Air Force 1, Jordan 1 and Dunk models.

Now, the CEO is touting some newness in the sportswear side of the business with Vomero 5, P-6000, Shox, SuperFly, Air Max Muse and Air Max 95. “I feel like the teams are taking all the right actions against those key footwear franchises, rightsizing the inventory and getting back to running a relentless flow of innovative and coveted products,” Hill said.

As for where this is all happening, Nike’s three key countries in play under the “Win Now” strategy include the United States, China and the United Kingdom; and the five key cities are New York, Los Angeles, London, Beijing and Shanghai.

“We’ll invest to make sure each [location] has innovative and coveted product, a loud and proud locally relevant brand voice, a consumer-led and balanced integrated marketplace and passionate Nike teammates on the ground,” Hill noted. “Each country has unique dynamics and is in different states of development. China, specifically, is where we’re being the most proactive and cleaning up the marketplace and we’ll get back to inspiring the Chinese consumer in a more meaningful way.”

Going forward, Hill said that Nike is aiming to prioritize restoring its sales organization and go-to-market processes. “Partnering with Nike must feel like a world-class experience,” the CEO said. “That means building growth plans together, creating distinct consumer positions and consumer right assortments, while also engaging way earlier in the process and asking for product feedback, delivering our assortments at the right time, right place and at the right depth. [We will also be] educating their teams on new innovations, providing marketing support and making certain their Nike presentation is premium, so we capitalize on every sale opportunity.”

In Nike Direct, digital will feel the changes more quickly, Hill said. This is already in the works as Nike is reducing the promotional days and discounting at lower rates. In fact, comparing last year’s January and February to this year’s, Nike Digital in North America went from over 30 promotional days to zero, the exec noted.

Hill added that consumers and partners “felt a different pace” for Nike this quarter. “We’re off to a solid start and where we are making progress in our five priority actions, it’s mostly through serving athletes through the lens of sport and performance,” the CEO said. “That’s exactly where we want to be. The bottom line is we are looking for opportunity on all fronts. Now it’s up to us to be consistent.”",https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nike-air-max-muse.jpg?w=650,N,,2025-03-22 11:03:35.024026

Similar to J&J, Eli Lilly cited tax cut legislation passed in 2017 as factors in its U.S. investments.","Johnson & Johnson plans to boost its U.S.-based research and development, technology and manufacturing investments to more than $55 billion over the next four years.

In a March 21 press release unveiling the initiative, the New Brunswick-headquartered health care giant said the sum represents a 25% increase compared with the previous four years. The company estimated the U.S. economic impact will total more than $100 billion a year. J&J also noted it will build upon “already elevated U.S. investment levels resulting from the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.”

The announcement came the same day that J&J broke ground on a $2 billion, state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing site in Wilson, N.C. The new outpost aims to expand the company’s capacity to produce next-generation medicines for cancer, immune-mediated and neurological diseases.

Once fully operational, the 500,000-square-foot location will directly employ over 500 specialized employees and contractors, including process technicians, laboratory analysts, engineers and microbiologists. J&J also estimates the Wilson facility will generate a $3 billion impact across North Carolina during its first 10 years of operation.

Along with creating an estimated 5,000 jobs during construction, the site will bring new community partnerships to the area, including continued collaboration with the Smithsonian Science Education Center and Wilson County Schools, to bring additional STEM programming to local schools.

Johnson & Johnson will also support the implementation of the BioWork certificate program in all Wilson County high schools, in collaboration with the North Carolina Biotechnology Center and Wilson Community College. Through BioWork, students in Wilson will have an accelerated pathway to gain skills necessary to begin a career at Johnson & Johnson and other life sciences manufacturers across the state, the company said.

Other investments

With nearly two dozen facilities across the country, J&J has the biggest footprint in the U.S. when it comes to pharmaceutical manufacturing.

By 2029, the company expects to develop three new advanced manufacturing facilities and expand several existing sites across its innovative medicine and medtech businesses. However, J&J did not disclose specific details about the expansion plans or the location of its other planned facilities in its statement.

The company will also deploy technology upgrades “to help make drug discovery and development faster, support workforce training and enhance our business operations,” it said.

Additionally, “significant” resources will go toward investing in “extensive R&D infrastructure aimed at developing lifesaving and life-changing treatments in areas such as oncology, neuroscience, immunology, cardiovascular disease, and robotic surgery.”

Commenting on the campaign, J&J CEO and Chairman Joaquin Duato said it “accelerates our nearly 140-year legacy as an American innovation engine tackling the world’s toughest health care challenges.”

Reuters noted that the Trump administration’s threat of a 25% tariff on pharmaceutical imports has prompted other pharmaceutical companies, like Eli Lilly, to begin expanding domestic manufacturing operations.

The transportation and logistics giant has now lost 12.48% of its value since the beginning of the year.

The sharp decline followed the company’s announcement that it had lowered its revenue and profit forecasts for fiscal 2025, citing weaker-than-expected shipping demand and persistent economic uncertainty, reports Business Insider.

The news also weighed on the broader shipping sector, with shares of United Parcel Service (UPS) slipping 1.92% in premarket trading on Thursday. Investors remain wary of slowing business activity and weaker consumer spending, which have begun to take a toll on the transportation and logistics industry.

FedEx Revises 2025 Financial Outlook

During its earnings call, FedEx executives pointed to inflationary pressures and a sluggish U.S. industrial economy as major challenges. ""Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy, which is constraining demand for our business-to-business services,"" said John Dietrich, FedEx's executive vice president and chief financial officer.

The company now expects fiscal 2025 revenue to be slightly lower than last year, reflecting the impact of slowing demand. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are now projected to range between $18 and $18.60, down from the previous estimate of $19 to $20.

Additionally, FedEx lowered its capital expenditure outlook to $4.9 billion, signaling a more cautious approach to spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.

Broader Economic Concerns

FedEx’s revised forecast highlights growing concerns over the health of the U.S. economy. Recent economic data points to softer consumer spending, as indicated by this week’s weaker-than-expected retail sales report. Consumers appear to be cutting back on purchases amid trade war uncertainties and fears of an economic downturn.

The Federal Reserve also acknowledged these concerns this week, choosing to keep interest rates steady on Wednesday as policymakers monitor inflation and economic conditions. With FedEx seen as a bellwether for global trade, its profit warning may signal further economic turbulence ahead.

Below, Hypebeast has rounded up the top fashion stories of the week so you can stay up to date on trends in the industry.

Loewe Confirms Jonathan Anderson Is Stepping Down as Creative Director

Rumors of Jonathan Anderson‘s departure from Loewe have colored discussions around the brand for months, but now the move is confirmed. In a rather quiet exit, Loewe opted out of the Paris Fashion Week runway schedule to host a curated exhibition reprising some of Anderson’s iconic pieces like the Puzzle bag. At the time, the designer also posted a highlight-style reel reminiscing on his 12 years at Loewe, prompting further speculation of his coming departure. It wasn’t until a week later on March 17 that the brand made the news official.

As for the next creative lead for Loewe, speculation has arisen that Proenza Schouler designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez may take the helm, after having stepped down from their New York-label. However, as of the time of writing an official successor to Anderson has not been confirmed by Loewe. Whoever is appointed will have big shoes to fill — Anderson is largely credited for the historic Spanish fashion house’s rejuvenation, elevating the brand with his contemporary cache and affinity for surrealism.

Nike Expected to Post Worst Revenue Drop Since 2020 Pandemic

Nike expects the worst revenue fall since the COVID-19 pandemic that rocked the industry in 2020. According to a report from Business of Fashion (BoF), falling foot traffic, app downloads, and inventory crises are heavily impacting the brand’s performance. BoF cites data from LSEG, sharing that Nike is poised to report an 11.5% revenue decline, making it the company’s sharpest decline since the 38% drop reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Key data points that indicate Nike’s declining performance include an 11% drop in foot traffic at Nike stores (Raymond James) and a 35% drop in Nike app downloads (Sensor Tower).

Nike’s consistent struggle to get back on its feet after the pandemic prompted the recent C-Suite shake-up aimed at rehabilitating the brand. The appointment of Nike veteran Elliot Hill as CEO late last year sparked a more optimistic outlook following former CEO John Donahue’s departure. With Hill’s initiatives, including the announcement of the NikeSKIMS line, a joint venture with Kim Kardashian‘s shapewear brand aimed at offering solution-oriented activewear for women, and early 2025 sneaker drops like the Pegasus 41 and Pegasus Plus and the Vomero 18, time will tell if Nike’s reinvigorated initiatives will show on its bottom line.

Bernard Arnault Wants To Run LVMH Until He Is 85

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault has proposed a second resolution to increase the age limit of his company’s CEO seat. The 76-year-old executive, who is is currently the fifth richest man in the world, aims to hold onto his position for another he is 85. In 2022, shareholders already voted in favor of a resolution that extended the age limit from 75 to 80.

Recently, sons Alexandre Arnault and Frédéric Arnault joined the board of directors with siblings Antoine and Delphine Arnault (Head of communication, image and environment at LVMH and chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, on the board, respectively). Alexandre has been promoted to deputy CEO of Moët Hennessy, LVMH’s wines and spirits division while Frédéric got onboarded to Loro Piana as CEO. Lastly, the youngest sibling, Jean Arnault, is the director of watches at Louis Vuitton. Whether or not Bernard will stay at the helm of LVMH until he is 85 will be determined at the AGM next month.

Exclusive Jacquemus Pajamas Come With Air France’s New First-Class Amenities

A first-of-its-kind pajama collaboration with French designer Jacquemus has been unveiled in Air France’s updated La Première first-class cabin experience. Passengers flying on Air France’s La Première in Spring 2025 will receive the complementary Jacquemus-designed loungewear to wear in-flight and at home. The cotton sets are also offered in both red and blue variants, representing the classic French palette. Air France’s equestrian La Première emblem is embroidered on the breast, while dual Jacquemus and Air France tags are showcased inside the neck.

The partners have produced four different sizes and two different necklines, giving passengers the option to choose the most comfortable option. For a playful touch, the pajamas come with a red poplin bag adorned with the maison’s signature “round-square” buttons. The pajamas accompany the full revamp of the La Première cabin experience in a forthcoming selection of Boeing 777-300ERs, featuring 4 suites of 3.5 square meters.

UNIQLO’s Tate Modern Pop-up Will Celebrate the London Gallery’s 25th Anniversary

UNIQLO has been announced as an official partner for the renowned Tate Modern gallery’s 25th-anniversary celebrations to administer special programs and hold a season-long pop-up.

Some analysts also worry that Nike's big discounts on classic sneakers might harm the brand

Nike Inc.'s stock fell sharply Friday, putting it on track for a five-year low, as Wall Street grappled with the sneaker giant's warning that higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico will eat into its profit margins in the coming quarter.

Moreover, some analysts worried that Nike's (NKE) efforts to run big discounts on its classic lifestyle sneakers - like Air Force 1s, Air Jordan 1s and Dunks - could tarnish its image as it tries to clear the way for newer products and compete with the likes of On and Hoka.

While many companies are taking more of a wait-and-see approach to tariff costs, Nike said it expects gross margins to drop by 400 to 500 basis points in its fourth quarter, due partly to trade-policy factors. Wall Street analysts had expected a gross margin decline of about 360 basis points.

""We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico,"" the company said. Nike said it expects headwinds to revenue and gross margin to moderate afterward.

Nike's stock fell about 5.5% on Friday on the heels of the company's quarterly results, putting it on track for its lowest close since March 23, 2020, assuming the losses hold.

J.P. Morgan analyst Matthew Boss, who has a neutral rating on the stock, lowered Nike's price target to $64 from $73 and said the company faces headwinds in greater China, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

""We see an elongated timeline for Nike to re-accelerate revenue growth in the midst of a franchise product lifecycle transition with the global macro backdrop (notably headwinds in Greater China & EMEA) further complicating the path forward,"" Boss said.

Raymond James analyst Rick Patel reiterated a market-perform rating on Nike and said it ""remains a company in transition with low visibility on when or how much revenue, margins, and earnings will rebound.""

Higher costs of living over the past few years have kept consumers focused on paying for the basics, which has weighed on demand for things like sneakers. Elliott Hill, Nike's new chief executive, has said he wants to refocus the company on athletes' needs and revive shoppers' enthusiasm for new products, after a period in which Nike rolled out too many lifestyle sneakers, which are less geared toward sports.

The company is also revamping its own physical and online stores to be a destination for higher-priced shoes and other gear. And it plans to sell off many of its older lifestyle sneakers, which it wants to rely on less for sales.

Patel said that in the months ahead, many of those older sneakers would likely be cleared at a steep discount through liquidations and sales at off-price stores and elsewhere. But he said those markdowns might clash with Nike's higher-end ambitions.

""While we agree that [Nike] needs to lean more aggressively into innovation, we also worry [that] the significant discounting for classics could damage the brand,"" he said.

""Consumers seeing classics on sale for a multi-quarter period could think twice about transacting at full-price for other products (i.e., why not wait for Nike's discount?),"" he added.

BofA analysts were more upbeat. They reiterated a buy rating for Nike and said that the company's order books are beginning to draw optimism from retailers, and that its performance and innovation efforts are starting to yield green shoots.

""Retail partners are seeing pockets of improved sell-through and have confidence in the upcoming product pipeline,"" the analysts said.

For the third quarter, Nike reported a decline in gross margins of 300 basis points, to 41.5%, due to channel-mix headwinds, higher wholesale discounts, markdowns on Nike Direct, inventory obsolescence and product costs, the company said.

Including Friday's moves, Nike's stock is down 10.3% in 2025, while the S&P 500 SPX has fallen 4.5%.

Nike is facing challenges in its turnaround effort as it deals with old inventory, the impact of a trade war, and declining consumer spending. The company is striving for growth by refocusing on sports, improving retail relationships, and adjusting marketing strategies.

Nike's turnaround effort is hitting snags as the company tries to clear out old inventory while feeling the effects of a growing trade war.

The sportswear maker signaled further declines in revenue and profitability due to an ongoing merchandise reset that the company says is necessary to renew growth. Nike also expects gross margin to decline sharply in the current quarter from a year earlier, in part due to US tariffs on products from China and Mexico.

Chief executive officer Elliott Hill, a longtime Nike executive who came out of retirement to take the top role in October, is looking to guide the company back to growth after a difficult year of falling sales and corporate layoffs. He's reshaping Nike by refocusing on sports and mending relationships with its retail partners.

Nike is in the midst of clearing out stale merchandise through heavy discounting as demand fades for some of its biggest sneaker franchises, including Air Force 1s and Dunks. Inventory fell 2% in the period but Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said those levels remain ""elevated across all categories.""

The company is trying to turn things around against a backdrop of weak consumer spending and fallout from President Donald Trump's escalating trade war. China also remained a weak spot, with sales missing analyst expectations amid a prolonged consumer slump in the market. But performance in North America and the region that includes Europe, Africa and the Middle East came in better than expected.

Live Events

In the company's call with analysts, Friend said ""geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations"" are among factors creating uncertainty.

In fiscal 2024, China produced 18% of Nike-branded footwear, according to company reports. A company website shows Nike has 117 manufacturing locations in China and eight in Mexico.

Friend added that Nike will see a double-digit drop in digital traffic in the company's next fiscal year as the company transitions to a new mix of products.

Revenue fell 9% to $11.3 billion for the company's fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28, better than the 11% drop that Wall Street predicted.

The performance shows that ""a turnaround is beginning to unfold,"" said Poonam Goyal, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""But the company still has a lot of work to do to reduce inventories.""

In December, Hill outlined a plan to invigorate Nike by reorganizing around departments that focus on sports such as running, basketball and soccer. The company is also reallocating marketing funds from clicky digital ads to more anthemic sports campaigns. It spent 8% more on marketing in the latest quarter.

""It's been a tough couple of years,"" Hill said during the call. ""But what's encouraging is that in the 150 days since I've been back, we've reclaimed our identity.""

Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said the results showed Nike is having ""a good start to a two-year journey.""

With its “Win Now” strategy firmly in place, Nike’s turnaround efforts are in full swing — and its sales are suffering in the meantime. Revenue in the third quarter fell 9% year over year to $11.3 billion, with Nike’s DTC business down 12% and wholesale declining 7%, according to a company press release.

In Nike’s direct business, most of the sales declines came from digital, which fell 15% in the quarter. Stores, by contrast, were down just 2%. The retailer continues to reduce the number of promotions on its website and rebuild its relationship with wholesalers to improve both channels long term.

CEO Elliott Hill, who took on the role almost six months ago, said the retailer is also making progress on diversifying its product assortment, which was overindexed with classics like the Air Force 1, Air Jordan and Dunk.

Dive Insight:

Nike is hoping its short-term pain will lead to long-term gains, with Hill noting many of its turnaround efforts will require “multiple seasons of excellent execution.” One of those is the rightsizing of some of its biggest franchises.

Nike has accelerated its work to reduce the supply of Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1 and Dunk styles, and CFO Matt Friend said by Q4, those franchises will be down by 10 percentage points as a percent of its footwear mix. However, Hill was quick to clarify that the retailer is not sunsetting those styles, describing them as “beloved silhouettes” with strong fandoms. Rather, the retailer is “building a supporting cast” of styles to complement those.

That surprised some analysts, with BMO Capital Markets’ Simeon Siegel writing in emailed comments that many believed its Dunk franchise would be reduced to zero.

“We see this as a critical counterpoint,” Siegel said. “Yes, Dunks, AF1s and AJ1s are overstretched, but they are important and will have a recurring place in the business.”

Even as Nike focuses on revamping its footwear offerings, Hill has his eyes on the brand’s apparel assortment as well. The executive has instructed employees to look for more opportunities to innovate in apparel, a dictate that comes shortly after the retailer announced a sculpting and performance brand in partnership with Kim Kardashian’s Skims.

Hill acknowledged missteps in Nike’s relationship with wholesale partners, calling it “a bit of a surprise” that Nike was no longer working closely with them. The brand has since then moved swiftly to establish teams focused on key partners and is actively discussing growth plans and product presentation with wholesalers, Hill said.

“Partnering with Nike must feel like a world-class experience,” Hill said. In his view, that also includes consulting wholesale partners on product feedback.

With so much to work through, the retailer is prioritizing the U.S., the U.K. and China in the first stages of its turnaround. And it may be a while before results show. Needham analyst Tom Nikic noted that the retailer’s Q4 guidance was worse than expected, with revenues planned to be down in the mid-teens, and that headwinds are likely to remain through the first half of the retailer’s next fiscal year.

“While the ‘Win Now’ plan to turn around [Nike]'s flagging business appears sound, the deep-seated issues mean it will take longer to recover than expected,” Nikic said in emailed comments. “We continue to have confidence in CEO Elliott Hill, but it will take time for the bull thesis to play out.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aV6OIjq5VpEY6TabWdDzibDWFrCe7M9y5vT7euSPlh0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05ODUxNzY5Mi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-03-22 02:00:38.637587

As a result, Starbucks has increased its marketing in 2025 to strengthen its connection with both new and loyal customers. Looking ahead, the company plans to add more comfortable seating and better-designed spaces in order to make stores more appealing for people to relax, work, or meet up with others.

On the investor side, Deutsche Bank said that its recent survey showed more people plan to visit Starbucks over the next few months compared to a year ago. While the company’s turnaround is still in the early stages, the analyst noted that Starbucks is slightly more affordable than independent coffee shops for popular items like cold brew and drip coffee, even if it’s more expensive than Dunkin’ Donuts. It is also worth noting that so far in 2025, Starbucks stock is up 6.3%, which has outperformed much of the retail sector.

Is Starbucks a Buy or Sell?

Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on SBUX stock based on 17 Buys, six Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average SBUX price target of $111.64 per share implies 15% upside potential.

What We Thought of Nike’s Earnings

Although Nike NKE reported large declines in sales and earnings in its fiscal third quarter, the results were better than expected, and new CEO Elliott Hill outlined a solid plan to get the firm back on track. His “win now” plan includes actions to grow through wholesale partnerships, use e-commerce as a premium channel, increase product innovation, and strengthen ties to sports.

The strategy is being implemented in all of Nike’s key regions. It will require some significant inventory cleanup and is unlikely to pay immediate dividends in a tough global sportswear market, but we already anticipated this in our model. Thus, we do not expect to make any material change to our $112 fair value estimate and think there is an opportunity for patient investors. After an initial spike after the earnings report, Nike’s shares fell 5% during March 20 postmarket trading, likely due to its dim near-term outlook.

Nike’s sales decline of 9% in the quarter was slightly better than our estimate for an 11% fall. Nike brand sales in North America (45% of the total) slid 4%, but Greater China sales (16% of the total) missed our 9% decline projection by plummeting 17%. Nike has had sales declines in the latter region in three of the last four years, but is aggressively liquidating inventory and implementing its other win now plans to improve customer traffic in its thousands of franchised Chinese stores. We project a return to double-digit percentage sales growth in Greater China in fiscal 2027.

Despite its current challenges, Nike continues to manage its costs well and outperform on profitability. Its 7% operating margin in the quarter was poor by its usual standards, but beat our estimate by 260 basis points, nonetheless.

On Thursday, the company reported a 9% sales decline during the all-crucial holiday season quarter,— including a 17% slump in quarterly sales in China — and forecast a steeper-than-expected drop in fourth-quarter revenue.

Nike said sales will be down in the “mid-teens range” for the quarter that ends in May in an earnings call. Wall Street had expected sales to be down by 11.4%.

Hill — who took on the role in October to help the company regain lost market share — has laid out what he called a “Win Now” strategy, which includes boosting on-the-ground presence in five key cities such as Shanghai and Beijing.

“The plan is there, (but) they are just not seeing results yet,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at investment banking firm Freedom Capital Markets.

Nike stock fell as much as 9% after Friday’s opening bell — hitting its lowest level since the pandemic. Shares were down 5% in midday trading.

The Beaverton, Ore.-based company has lost 5% of its value so far this year — following a 30% plunge in 2024.

“Nike is working to return to what made it special,” wrote BMO analyst Simeon Seigel in a research note. “This is clearly not for everyone as turns take time.”

The company’s year-long struggle to reverse sliding revenues and reignite growth are deepening this year, with Nike honchos blaming weak consumer demand, a turnaround that hasn’t turned the corner yet and the impact of a 20% tariff on goods from China that went into effect at the start of March.

Nearly one quarter of Nike’s merchandise is produced in China.

“We are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence,” chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday.

Over the past several years, the company slashed the number of retailers selling its sneakers, including discounter DSW, and apparel, betting that it could sell more products in its own stores and online. It’s also facing stiff competition from newcomers, Hoka and On.

The company is bringing back some of those traditional retailers.

“Nike took it too far and underestimated the importance of third-party retailers,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients in June.

Hill has fast-tracked certain sneaker launches such as Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 that helped the company post a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue and profit.

Financial Condition/Capital Resources

During the three months ended January 31, 2025, the Company recorded a net loss of $669,216 and, as of January 31, 2025, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $50,021,874 and working capital of $2,198,641. The Company is maintaining its Woxna Graphite Mine on a ""production-ready” basis to minimize costs and is conducting ongoing research and development to produce higher value specialty products. The Company is also evaluating a potential restart of production at the Woxna Graphite Mine. The Company anticipates that it has sufficient funding to meet anticipated levels of corporate administration and overheads for the ensuing twelve months however, it will need additional capital to provide working capital and recommence operations at the Woxna Graphite Mine, to fund future development of the Norra Karr Property or to complete exploration activities in Romania. There is no assurance such additional capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. In the longer term the recoverability of the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets is dependent upon the Company’s ability to preserve its interest in the underlying mineral property interests, the discovery of economically recoverable reserves, the achievement of profitable operations and the ability of the Company to obtain financing to support its ongoing exploration programs and mining operations.

Outlook

In today’s world, one message rings clear for critical raw materials—security of supply is paramount. With rising geopolitical tensions and the increasing weaponization of trade through tariffs and export restrictions, the urgency to establish short, regional supply chains has never been greater.

Woxna stands at the forefront of this shift, positioned for a potential production restart—a move that aligns with possible forward integration opportunities. Importantly, the Company believes this restart could be financed with Green Transition funding.

Momentum for Swedish graphite is also growing. In October, Talga Group secured a €70 million EU Innovation Fund grant for its Luleå Anode Refinery, a key component of its Vittangi Anode Project. Adding further support, Sweden’s Minister for Energy, Business, and Industry, Ebba Busch, has in recent months underscored the importance of domestic graphite, stating:

""We have large graphite deposits in Sweden that could account for much of what we [Sweden] and Europe need for our cars and batteries.""

Woxna has been maintained in production-ready status for years, and now, the Company is growing in confidence that its strategic investment in care and maintenance could be about to pay off. The future is looking brighter.

Considering Norra Kärr, before the end of March, the Company expects a decision by the EU on Strategic Project status; a designation that would set a clear 27-month permitting timeline and facilitate access to finance. Given today’s geopolitical landscape—including the U.S. President’s push to secure critical raw materials like rare earth elements—it is hard to envision a scenario where Norra Kärr is not recognized as vital to Europe’s supply security. With or without Strategic Project status, Norra Kärr will remain the most advanced HREE project in Europe and a significant part of the solution for the EU’s supply overdependence on China.

Meanwhile, the Company is advancing a Rapid Development Plan to meet Europe’s urgent demand for HREEs. Fast-tracking development is no longer an option—it’s a necessity.

By separating extraction from downstream processing, operations at Norra Kärr have been streamlined. The project now functions much like a quarry, with on-site extraction and physical processing producing two high-value products: a HREE magnetic concentrate and nepheline syenite, an industrial mineral previously explored at Norra Kärr by Boliden in the 1970s.

The Company remains committed to accelerating progress, engaging key stakeholders, and exploring all avenues to bring Norra Kärr into production as swiftly as possible.

To accelerate the programme at Bihor Sud, since the start of the year, the Company has hired four new geologists, and in February, a new drill contractor started drilling in gallery G2. The Contractor has been given an initial 1,500 m programme, with the Company’s geological team mapping G2 and taking channel samples for assay to provide the necessary data to validate each drillhole location.

Woxna Graphite Mine

Security of Supply

The drive for secure and stable supply chains is shaping the European natural graphite market, bringing existing production assets like Woxna into focus. Woxna is free to serve both the anode and industrial markets and could be positioned as a key regional supplier.

On 9 February, the IEA published a commentary ‘Growing geopolitical tensions underscore the need for stronger action on critical minerals security’. In the coverage, the IEA commented that ‘Today's markets may be relatively well supplied, but security of supply is far from guaranteed. Trade restrictions affecting critical minerals have proliferated, notably in the form of export controls applied by China’ and in the case of natural graphite ‘Reliance on a small number of suppliers increases vulnerability to shocks and disruptions, even in a well-supplied market’.

Rising Demand

On January 30, 2025, Benchmark Minerals Intelligence published research highlighting the 140% projected growth in natural graphite demand by 2030, requiring an additional 1.7 million tonnes. Their calculations suggest that at least 31 new mines must come online worldwide. However, while anode, cathode, and cell capacity can be developed in less than five years, establishing a new raw material supply chain can take up to 25 years, underscoring the need for immediate action.

Policy Momentum in the European Union

Last year marked a turning point for European raw materials policy, with the EU taking decisive steps to secure domestic supply chains. On March 18, 2024, the European Council adopted the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), a key initiative aimed at developing and supporting critical raw materials projects across the region. This policy shift strengthens the case for utilizing existing, permitted graphite resources within Europe.

Woxna’s Strategic Positioning

Woxna is among the few fully built and permitted natural graphite mines in the region. With its established infrastructure, resources, and strategic location, Woxna is well-positioned to play a significant role in regional natural graphite production.

Pathway to Production Restart

In recent months, interest in restarting Woxna’s production has grown. An in-house study conducted in early 2022 evaluated processing plant upgrades to produce high-quality flake graphite concentrate for the market. This study will be updated in the second quarter. The Company believes the updated business plan could support discussions around project financing, customer pre-payments, and potential Swedish or European public funding.

Opportunities for Forward Integration

Beyond production, the Company sees potential for moving downstream and collaborating with off takers to add value through further processing. Such agreements would provide offtakes with a secure and stable graphite supply, reinforcing their ability to meet end-user demands.

Anode Project 2021 – A Future Option

While the Anode Project 2021 remains a viable long-term opportunity, it is not currently being pursued. The Company’s primary focus remains on a sustainable restart of Woxna’s production and securing the mine’s role in the European natural graphite supply chain.

Norra Kärr Heavy Rare Earth Element (""HREE”) Project

A decision on the Company’s application for Strategic Project status under the Critical Raw Materials Act (""CRMA”) is expected before the end of March. Pre-feasibility study (""PFS”) work for the upstream and downstream will commence in the second quarter. The Company expects a decision on its application for a new Exploitation Concession (""Bearbetningskoncession”) 25-year mining lease later in the year.

Testwork is being carried out on nepheline syenite and aegirine to determine their mineralogy, chemical composition, and leachate chemistry. The results will support further assessment of the market opportunities for nepheline syenite, and possibly aegirine, and the potential environmental impact of any waste materials.

Company has started discussions with nepheline syenite market participants to identify attractive market segments, volumes and pricing. In the Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in 2021 (""PEA 2021”), three nepheline syenite markets were selected, those requiring the least amount of additional processing and product qualification, with pricing ranging from US$12-65 per tonne. These assumptions were conservative, and the Company is now investigating higher value markets such as functional filler products with comparable prices at the time of US$100-500 per tonne. In the PEA2021, nepheline syenite contributed 11% of the total revenues when using conservative prices. There is the potential for significant upside in pricing and revenue contribution to the overall project economics.

As part of the PFS, the Company will evaluate the business case for a Rapid Development Plan (""RDP”), whereby Norra Kärr can be in production in the shortest possible timeframe to be supplying REE concentrates to the market in advance of the completion of the downstream processing facility and selling nepheline syenite. This will generate cashflow and mean earlier delivery of REE concentrates onto the European market. Capacity for processing REE concentrates in the region is being developed and this gives the Company options for the downstream.

Bihor Sud Nickel-Cobalt Exploration Project

To accelerate the programme at Bihor Sud, since the start of the year, the Company has hired four new geologists and, in February, a new drill contractor started drilling in gallery G2. The Contractor has been given an initial 1,500 m programme, with the Company’s geological team mapping G2 and taking channel samples for assay to provide the necessary data to validate each drillhole location.

Bihor Sud remains a very exciting brownfield exploration project. It’s a historic mining area with tens of kilometers of underground galleries, or tunnels, developed in the licence area. Between the 1960-90s the responsible division of the Romanian State only targeted what was then called ‘strategic metals’, principally uranium, and explored for nothing else.

The Company’s objective at Bihor Sud, is to define a large-scale, mineable mineral resource. Initially, we are following-up on the work done in gallery G7 last year, and the extensive Cobalt-Nickel-Gold mineralized zone that was identified, and in the new year started to drill in gallery G2 which has shown its potential for extensive Zinc-Lead-Copper-Silver mineralization. We are encouraged by the findings to date, which highlight the strong potential for discovering a significant polymetallic deposit.

Financial Information

The report for three months ending April 30, 2025, is expected to be published on or about June 20, 2025.

The company is working to bring back the café atmosphere by encouraging customers to stay longer in its stores.
As a result, Starbucks has increased its marketing in 2025 to strengthen its connection with both new and loyal customers.
On the investor side, Deutsche Bank said that its recent survey showed more people plan to visit Starbucks over the next few months compared to a year ago.

One big shift has been a rise in customers choosing to sit and enjoy their drinks using ceramic mugs or glasses (up over 300% in recent weeks), according to data shared with Axios. The company is working to bring back the café atmosphere by encouraging customers to stay longer in its stores.

Niccol’s strategy also includes simplifying the menu, speeding up checkout times, reintroducing condiment bars, and offering free refills for customers who dine in. As a result, Starbucks has increased its marketing in 2025 to strengthen its connection with both new and loyal customers. Looking ahead, the company plans to add more comfortable seating and better-designed spaces in order to make stores more appealing for people to relax, work, or meet up with others.

On the investor side, Deutsche Bank said that its recent survey showed more people plan to visit Starbucks over the next few months compared to a year ago. While the company’s turnaround is still in the early stages, the analyst noted that Starbucks is slightly more affordable than independent coffee shops for popular items like cold brew and drip coffee, even if it’s more expensive than Dunkin’ Donuts. It is also worth noting that so far in 2025, Starbucks stock is up 6.3%, which has outperformed much of the retail sector.

Is Starbucks a Buy or Sell?

Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus rating on SBUX stock based on 17 Buys, six Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average SBUX price target of $111.64 per share implies 15% upside potential.

At the company's recent annual meeting, CEO Brian Niccol shared that initial feedback to the Back to Starbucks changes has been positive.

On the analyst side, Deutsche Bank reported that interest in returning to Starbucks has grown. A proprietary survey showed stronger purchase intent among respondents for the next three to six months compared with early 2024.

Still, analyst Lauren Silberman noted that while progress is evident, the turnaround is just beginning, and broader economic pressures remain. Interestingly, Starbucks' prices for cold brew and drip coffee are lower on average than those at independent cafes, though they still exceed prices at Dunkin'.

One visible shift: more customers are choosing to stay in-store. Starbucks told Axios that the number of U.S. patrons opting for ceramic mugs or glasses has jumped over 300% in recent weeks.

Niccol's strategy includes simplifying the menu, speeding up checkout, reintroducing condiment bars, and offering free refills to customers who linger. The company has also increased marketing efforts this year, targeting deeper engagement with new and returning customers.

$11.3 billion — Nike’s Q3 2025 year revenue, down 9% year-over-year. Revenues for the flagship Nike brand were down 9% to $10.9 billion.

$6.2 billion — The sneaker giant’s wholesale revenue, which decreased 7% year-over-year.

$4.7 billion — Direct sales. These were down 12% year-over-year primarily due to a 15% decrease in Nike DTC revenues and a 2% decrease dollars derived from its stores.

$405 million — Converse’s revenue for the quarter. This declined 18% year-over-year.

Watercooler talk

This was Nike’s first full quarter under chief executive (CEO) Elliott Hill, who returned to the brand to take on the top role in October 2024.

Hill has orchestrated a turnaround plan, “Win Now,” to return Nike to growth amid stiff competition from newer competitors such as On and Hoka, as well as declining sales in North America and China.

Since joining he’s been focused on rebuilding relationships with Nike’s wholesale partners, debuted a highly-lauded return to the Super Bowl with an ad squared towards women, and announced a buzzy partnership with Kim Kardashian’s Skims brand.

Nike’s wholesale strategy was frequently brought up during its Q3 2025 investors call, with Hill saying that while Nike’s direct and wholesale businesses have been siloed, he is focused on bringing them together in an “integrated consumer-led marketplace.”

On the marketing front, Hill pointed to Super Bowl 59 and NBA All-Star Weekend as having boosting product visibility across Nike’s brand portfolio.

Nike ran its first Big Game spot in 27 years, expanding its “Win Now” marketing strategy, while Jordan Brand ran a Super Bowl ad victory ad, “Love Hurts,” celebrating ambassador and Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts.

“That is how we create impact, and that is Nike Beyond Nike. We transitioned from one amazing weekend right into another for the NBA All-Star Weekend in the Bay Area. Our brands, in one word, dominated,” Hill claimed.

The CEO also shared that while sales were down generally, he remained confident in Nike’s performance wear. He said revenues from running products grew mid-single digits, but didn’t disclose a figure.

Chief financial officer (CFO) Matthew Friend said he expected fourth-quarter revenue to decline in the mid-teens percentage range, predicting a steeper fall than analysts had anticipated for the remainder of the fiscal year.

However, Hill was optimistic about the long-term vision.

“The progress we made against the ‘Win Now’ strategic priorities we committed to 90 days ago reinforces my confidence that we are on the right path,” he said. “What’s encouraging is Nike made an impact this quarter leading with sport – through athlete storytelling, performance products and big sport moments.”

The brand’s latest results followed two big leadership exits revealed this week. First was chief strategy and transformation officer Daniel Heaf, whose role was eliminated. Elsewhere, 20-year Nike veteran and chief communications officer (CCO) KeJuan Wilkins, who was promoted to that role in 2023 under former CEO John Donahoe, also left.

Key quote

“We’re working closely with the leaders of each of the geos and countries to implement the ‘Win Now’ strategy because, again, the strategy works. No matter if you’re in the United States or in Japan, it all goes back to putting the consumer at the center [of our] products, storytelling, and marketplace,” said Hill.",https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/nike-hq.jpg?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2025-03-21 16:01:20.262755

The company announced the plan in conjunction with breaking ground on a new 500,000-square-foot biologics plant in Wilson, North Carolina. In October of last year, J&J revealed its plan to spend more than $2 billion to build the facility, which will create more than 500 jobs and will produce treatments for cancer, immunology and neuroscience disorders.

In a press conference in Washington, D.C. which it called, “Lilly in America,"" the company said it would start construction this year on the new plants, dubbed “mega-sites,” by CEO David Ricks.

The spending pledges come as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to ramp up tariffs on certain foreign imports and pushes American companies to boost domestic investment. Last month, tech giant Apple touted a $500 billion U.S. investment plan over four years.

“So we think those types of losses will affect pricing going forward for the upcoming renewals,” he said. “But we think, based on our conversation with some major players, that potentially will mostly affect US renewals, not the global renewals.”

He added, “I think the next one is the Japanese renewal. I think we’ve been hearing in the market that those rates could be under pressure, maybe up to 10% or so. But given the size of the losses in California, we believe that it will firm up rates, at least in the US going forward.”

Gharib also emphasised that, despite the wildfire’s size, S&P still views it as an earnings event since it occurred early in the year.

“Granted, it consumed up to 40% of the annual cat budgets. But it’s still an earnings event for the year,” he said.

Global reinsurer Swiss Re confirmed recently that its wildfire losses accounted for about 35% of its full-year 2025 natural catastrophe budget of €2 billion.

Gharib continued, “I think for the quarter, we may see some reinsurers producing losses from an underwriting perspective, just given that the California wildfire losses and other events would be booked in the first quarter, but still, for the year, we still believe companies would generate strong earnings.”

S&P echoed this sentiment in a report, stating that the impact will be manageable for global reinsurers, with losses largely remaining within their natural catastrophe budgets for first-quarter 2025.",https://www.reinsurancene.ws/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sp-logo-new.png,N,,2025-03-21 14:02:40.517549

Johnson & Johnson is planning a major U.S. expansion, announcing Friday it will spend $55 billion over the next four years on manufacturing, research and development and technology in its domestic market.

The investments will support three advanced manufacturing facilities and expansion of other sites in its pharmaceutical and medical technology businesses, J&J said. The company officially broke ground Friday on a new 500,000-square-foot biologics manufacturing facility in Wilson, North Carolina.

J&J’s announcement follows splashy releases from Eli Lilly, Merck & Co. and Amgen emphasizing their investment in U.S.-based manufacturing. The companies are hoping their effort will ease the burden of tariffs as well as persuade the Trump administration to extend tax cuts enacted in his first term and soften the blow of Medicare price cuts.

Dive Insight:

J&J said the U.S. expansion plan will represent a 25% increase in its investment compared to the past four years. In its annual reports, the company said it spent around $4 billion each year between 2021 and 2024 on “additions to property, plant and equipment,” a measure that largely captures the company's capital expenditures.

The Trump administration has pushed corporations to open more facilities in the U.S., emphasizing its “America first” policies that seek to discourage imports and increase manufacturing employment.

Big pharmas say their decision to reshore manufacturing has been enabled by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 — which, in addition to cutting the base corporate rate, also lowered taxes on profits that are earned by overseas subsidiaries and paid back to the U.S. parent.

Rising demand for their products, as well as the risk of tariffs from overseas production, is driving manufacturing expansions. Lilly has struggled to meet the appetite for its GLP-1 product tirzepatide, sold as Ozempic in diabetes and Zepbound in obesity. Sales of the drug tripled between 2023 and 2024. J&J also has fast-growing biologic medicines like Darazalex and Carvykti in cancer and Tremfya in psoriasis, underscoring the need to build production facilities close to their biggest-selling markets.

J&J said the North Carolina plant will employ 5,000 people in construction and create 500 permanent positions. The remaining manufacturing sites will be announced at a later date, as will expansions of R&D facilities and “increased technology investments to help make drug discovery and development faster, support workforce training and enhance our business operations.”

A tough quarter for FedEx (FDX.US)

Investor concern is intensifying around U.S. consumer strength and the broader industrial sector. The sharp declines in shares of FedEx and Nike reflect weak market sentiment toward cyclical stocks. In FedEx’s case, the outlook is becoming more fragile after the company cut its earnings forecast for the third time since December. Current analyst consensus projects FedEx’s EPS to grow by 6% to $18.93 in 2025, with revenue expected to reach $87.59 billion, essentially flat compared to 2024.

Persistent weak demand in the U.S. industrial economy, especially in the higher-margin B2B segment.

Ongoing declines in freight volumes and shipment weights, though slightly improved from the previous quarter.

Rising macroeconomic uncertainty—CEO Raj Subramaniam noted that “the current environment increases uncertainty around future demand.”

Updated Fiscal 2025 Guidance:

EPS: now forecast at $18–18.60 (previously $19–20; initial guidance in December: $20–21 (FactSet consensus: $18.93)

Revenue: expected to remain flat or slightly decline year over yea (previously projected to grow modestly)

Capital Expenditures (CAPEX): cut to $4.9 billion (from $5.2 billion

Focus: fleet & infrastructure modernization, automation, network efficiency

Fiscal Q3 2024 Results:

Adjusted EPS: $4.51 (+17% YoY): Expectations: $4.56

Revenue: $22.2 billion (+2% YoY): Expectations: $21.87 billion

FedEx admitted that it operated in a challenging environment last quarter, facing a shortened holiday season, extreme weather events, an early Chinese New Year, and a shift in sentiment from “Trump Trade” optimism to recession fears. CFO John Dietrich commented: “The downward revision in guidance reflects weakness in the U.S. industrial economy, but we remain confident in our transformation initiatives to deliver long-term value for shareholders.”

Like its rival United Parcel Service (UPS.US), FedEx is highly cyclical, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. Growing concerns over weaker consumer activity, industrial softness, and potential U.S. tariffs are shaking investor confidence.

Analysts at Evercore ISI warned that structural uncertainty about the company’s ability to grow earnings in this environment will continue to weigh on valuation. As forecasts get revised lower and economic visibility remains cloudy, investor trust is fading—reflected in the stock’s recent decline.

FedEx and Nike (D1) chart

FedEx shares (FDX.US) are now trading nearly 30% below their 200-day EMA, signaling a technical bear market. With mounting concerns over the consumer sector, exemplified by Nike’s (NKE.US) weakness, investor sentiment toward cyclical sectors remains clearly negative. Both FedEx and Nike stocks are oversold now, looking at the daily RSI level.

Johnson & Johnson says it will invest more than $55 billion within the United States over the next four years, including four new manufacturing plants.

A number of companies have highlighted investments in the U.S. in recent months, a focus of the Trump administration. J&J rival Eli Lilly and Co. announced in late February that it planned to build four new factories in the U.S. Both Lilly and J&J cited tax cut legislation passed in 2017 as factors in their U.S. investments.

Johnson & Johnson said Friday that it is a 25% increase in investment compared with the prior four years and estimates the U.S. economic impact will be more than $100 billion a year.

“Our increased U.S. investment begins with the ground-breaking of a high-tech facility in North Carolina that will not only add U.S.-based jobs but manufacture cutting edge medicines to treat patients in America and around the world,” Chairman and CEO Joaquin Duato said in a statement.

The North Carolina plant is in Wilson, just east of Raleigh. The locations of the other three facilities were not disclosed.

Aside from building four new plants, Johnson & Johnson said that it will expand several existing sites. The company is also planning to make investments in research and development infrastructure and technology.

Johnson & Johnson’s efforts are among several companies pledging to enhance their manufacturing in the U.S. Earlier this month chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said that it plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S., on top of $65 billion in investments the company had previously announced.

In February Apple announced that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, including plans to hire 20,000 people and build a new server factory in Texas.

Apple outlined several concrete moves in its announcement, the most significant of which is the construction of a new factory in Houston — slated to open in 2026 — that will produce servers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features.

Simultaneously, he’s trying to rebuild its reputation among consumers by investing in brand marketing, with spend up significantly.
Nike’s turnaround will take time and it’s important for the team to continue to focus on the company’s long-term growth.”","At the heart of its problems was Donahoe’s hyper-focus on growing direct-to-consumer sales. Before Nike, he was a leader in the tech space (eBay, PayPal and ServiceNow) and came in with a vision to have more shoppers buy directly from Nike.com. As part of that process, he cut ties with as many as 50% of its wholesale partners. It was the wrong bet; people continued to shop with the likes of Macy’s and Footlocker and simply purchased from the brands that had replaced Nike on shelves.

“Nike’s direct-to-consumer strategy shifted marketing spend away from brand advertising and instead towards lower funnel performance marketing,” says Brad Jashinsky, director analyst in the Gartner Marketing Practice. “The Nike team has publicly talked about how an overreliance on lower funnel marketing hurt the company.

“There were many other factors that contributed to Nike’s sales decline. Nike focused on sneakerheads and spent less time catering to the growing womenswear and running market. Competitors took advantage with new product innovation and marketing focused on those markets. At the same time, Nike had to deeply discount inventory that wasn’t selling, which hurt profit margins.”

This turnaround will be a marathon, not a sprint. But Hill is off to a slow start. Yesterday (March 20) marked his first full quarter at the helm and the first chance to update investors on how his ‘Win Now’ plan is faring. Revenue was dn 9% for the third quarter, totaling £9.1bn ($11.3bn). In North America, Nike’s largest market, revenue decreased by 4%, while EMEA and Greater China were down 10% and 17%, respectively.

Hill said the company is still trying to shift old stock and reforge partnerships with wholesalers. The previously separate direct and wholesale businesses are being integrated into a marketplace ""where we create consumer-led experiences across Nike Direct, wholesale partners, physical or digital."" Simultaneously, he’s trying to rebuild its reputation among consumers by investing in brand marketing, with spend up significantly. Here’s where it’s going.

Partnership with Kim Kardashian

Product innovation has been a pain point for Nike. It’s fallen behind rivals Adidas, On, New Balance and Hoka, especially in the womenswear sector. To improve that would take years and heavy investment into development, production and marketing to achieve the kind of scale it would need. Little surprise then that one of Hill’s first moves as CEO was to ink a partnership with Kim Kardashian’s brand Skims to piggyback on its popularity among young women and put it in direct competition with brands such as Alo Yoga, Lululemon and Vuori

It can’t be stressed enough how critical a successful launch of this product line will be to Nike’s U-turn. Dubbed NikeSkims, it will include apparel, footwear and accessories, the range will be for women and geared towards fitness and activewear to strengthen its commitment to refocusing on sports, not lifestyle.

“Nike’s renewed focus on expanding its womenswear offerings is essential to its turnaround. Nike can continue to grow its market share in womenswear through a combination of new products, athlete sponsorships and brand marketing,” adds Gartner’s Jashinsky.

In addition to the Skims partnership, Nike recently released the new 24.7 apparel collection that emphasizes comfort and features two new technical materials. Nailing the messaging for this over the coming months will be a priority.

Big ticket ads

Nike had been slowly returning to headline-making marketing. Around the Summer Olympics, it launched the ‘Winning isn’t for Everyone’ campaign and later the ‘Winning isn’t Comfortable’ work, which focused on running.

Testament to Hill’s plan to invest more in the female consumer and marketing, it made a triumphant return to the Super Bowl in February after a 27-year hiatus with a campaign directly targeting the demographic. Called ‘So Win,’ it was voiced by Doechii and featured talent including Caitlin Clark, Sha’Carri Richardson and A’ja Wilson. The Wieden+Kennedy work was widely praised, with people celebrating Nike’s return to creative excellence.

Meanwhile, Jordan Brand’s timely ‘Love Hurts’ work put the spotlight on Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts immediately after the team’s win.

“That is how we create impact and that is Nike beyond Nike,” said Hill on an investor call. “We transitioned from one amazing weekend right into another for the NBA All-Star Weekend in the Bay Area. Our brands in one word, dominated.”

Despite the optimism, Hill warned that the fourth-quarter revenue would continue to show a decline.

Jashinsky adds: “Nike’s new CEO is only a few months into his tenure. Nike’s turnaround will take time and it’s important for the team to continue to focus on the company’s long-term growth.”",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/news/355501/screenshot_2025-03-21_143545.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-03-21 16:01:25.262947

On March 21, 2025, FedEx's stock plunged by an alarming 11% after the company substantially lowered its profit expectations for fiscal 2025 amid ongoing uncertainties regarding the U.S. industrial economy.

The company's decision marked the third consecutive quarter it had adjusted its guidance downward, with CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighting that the firm is navigating a particularly ""challenging operating environment"". He noted that weakness in the industrial economy is placing considerable strain on FedEx's higher-margin business-to-business volumes, resulting in fewer shipments and lower weights in their freight business. As Subramaniam put it, ""Weakness in the industrial economy was weighing on its higher-margin business-to-business volumes."" These developments raise alarms for investors, as diminished demand could signal a broader economic slowdown.

Despite reporting a 17% increase in quarterly earnings per share to $4.51, FedEx's sales totaled $22.2 billion only increased around 2% compared to the previous year, which fell short of analyst expectations who had projected earnings of $4.56 per share. This underperformance exacerbated existing concerns about maintaining profitability amidst price pressures and stronger competition from rivals like United Parcel Service (UPS).

The declining performance in stock values indicates that FedEx’s shares have fallen by about 12% since the year began, leading to fears that the overall industrial outlook could worsen. With investor sentiment already shaken, many major stock brokerage firms, including at least ten, have slashed their price targets for FedEx in light of these struggles.

Analysts from Morgan Stanley have described the current situation as indicative of possible structural issues impacting small-package deliveries, which could complicate FedEx's cost-cutting programs. They emphasized, ""FedEx's Q3 print and full-year forecast cut will likely exacerbate concerns of structural pressures in the parcel business."" The firm has been reducing costs as demand patterns shift, struggling to manage the increasing competition, and uncertainty triggered by ongoing tariff policies from the Trump administration, which economists warn could lead to recessionary effects.

Both FedEx and UPS share a reputation for serving as economic bellwethers—often seen as sentiment indicators for broader economic activity due to their extensive involvement across various industries. Economists today are scrutinizing their results closely. The logistics sector hinges crucially on the health of manufacturing production, and any signs of stagnation could lead to significant declines in shipment volumes and revenues.

Investors are now keeping a close eye on FedEx's share price, particularly concerning critical support levels. Stock analysts have pointed to $223 as a key resistance point; failure to defend this number could pave the way for a decline toward the psychological level of $200. Conversely, should the stock bounce back, $267 general capitulation might serve as a threshold to monitor before any substantial corrective moves are attempted.

As of now, FedEx’s outlook remains uncertain, with many industry watchers advising that investors manage their expectations regarding the potential recovery of share value and future earnings. The company's lowered fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share forecast is now set between $18.00 and $18.60, sliding from the previous estimate of $19 to $20. This revision signals that FedEx may struggle to regain confidence amidst varying factors impacting its operational efficiency.

The recent actions taken by FedEx serve as a stark reminder of the volatility within the logistics market, plagued by external conditions often beyond a single company's control. As the industry awaits further updates and economic shifts, stakeholders remain alert to how global trade tensions and the ever-evolving landscape of U.S. tariffs will ultimately influence freight demand and overall logistics profitability in the foreseeable future.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/_uY_25hgT81ngB9wkC8JkaOsDnU=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F47833b4f-de4f-4079-8183-4731177f01f9.jpeg,N,,2025-03-21 13:04:40.434723

Part of these reforms include: the Nigeria Insurance Industry Reform Bill, 2024 aimed to consolidate outdated laws to provide a more robust regulatory environment, increased capital requirements, focus on deepening penetration, and claims management and consumer protection.

These reforms represent a significant shift, aiming to modernize the industry and increase its contribution to Nigeria’s economic growth. However, the proposed changes require careful implementation to balance industry development with inclusivity and fairness.

All right, a lot to continue to track throughout the trading session and going forward during this quarter.","Shares of Nike moving lower today as the company warns about the impact of tariffs, expecting sales to decline in the current quarter. This despite beating modest expectations for the third quarter. Yahoo finances Brooke DiPalma joins me now with a closer look at Nike's exposure to China here. Brooke, we were breaking this down right after the close yesterday, right after the report dropped, we saw an initial pop on the report, but once the call got started, seems like investors and analysts started pricing in a few more things.

Yeah, investors certainly spooked about that Q4 guidance that they said on the call. But let's kick off this conversation with really where their exposure is to China. If you take a closer look based upon the company's annual reports, the amount of footwear that the company manufactures in China is down from back in 2016 when Trump initially took office from 29% back then to 18% in their last year annual report. Now apparel, also a significant decrease in just the amount of apparel that's manufactured in China. That number from 26% down to 16%. Now despite this limited exposure, it was not enough to convince investors that they won't be hit by tariffs and the company certainly warning of that on the call that 20% of tariff on China, the 25% tariff on Mexico will impact their Q4 earnings. In the call CFO Matthew Friend laying out quote, we are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates, and tax regulations as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence. All these headwinds up against the company. While Nike is also leaning into this turnaround strategy, what they're calling this win now strategy, it also expects the biggest impact from that to cause headwinds to Q4 revenue and gross margin. In Q4, the company expects to see revenue down in the mid teens range, albeit at the low end, fourth quarter gross margins also expected to be down approximately 400 to 500 basis points. Now a big thing here is the CEO echoing on the call that these headwinds are expected to increase, or rather continue into fiscal year 2026. All this certainly spooking investors this morning. Shares down now nearly 9% an early open.

All right, a lot to continue to track throughout the trading session and going forward during this quarter. Brooke, thanks so much.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/99s11TzofSWhv5QKKPKLvA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/2d4f0050-065e-11f0-bcda-3fc76f5613b3,N,,2025-03-21 15:03:15.545999

In a bid to reverse declining sales, Starbucks disclosed last month their plan to cut over 1,000 jobs and streamline their menu.
However, the strategy hasn't seemed to yield the desired results, as the coffee giant recently relinquished its title as the world's most valuable restaurant brand to McDonald's.
Meanwhile, Luckin Coffee is on an aggressive growth trajectory.
Since mid-2023, the Chinese coffee empire has been launching an astonishing average of 16 new stores daily.","Starbucks has been grappling with a slump in sales after shedding millions of customers last year, and now the coffee giant faces a new challenge from a Chinese rival gearing up for an American expansion.

Luckin Coffee, a rapidly expanding enterprise that has already dethroned Starbucks as the largest coffee chain in China, is plotting to break into the US market by opening a store in New York City where it will offer coffee at half the price of its competitor. The Chinese contender aims to charge $2 to $3 per cup, in stark contrast to Starbucks' typical $6 to $7 per beverage.

This move comes at an inopportune moment for Starbucks, which disclosed another dip in sales for the period from October to December in January. This downturn represents the fourth straight quarter of losses for the company.

""Despite our heightened investments, we were unable to change the trajectory of our traffic decline, resulting in pressures in both our top-line and bottom-line,"" expressed Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Rachel Ruggeri regarding the preliminary financial report for 2024.

She continued: ""While our efficiency efforts continued to produce according to plan, they were not enough to outpace the impact of the decline in traffic. We are developing a plan to turn around our business, but it will take time. We want to amplify our confidence in the business, and provide some certainty as we drive our turnaround. For that reason, we have increased our dividend.""

Starbucks has recently welcomed ex-Chipotle chief Brian Niccol as its new head, and he's ringing in major changes, cautioning that Starbucks must ""fundamentally change"" to stay afloat.

In a bid to reverse declining sales, Starbucks disclosed last month their plan to cut over 1,000 jobs and streamline their menu. However, the strategy hasn't seemed to yield the desired results, as the coffee giant recently relinquished its title as the world's most valuable restaurant brand to McDonald's.

Meanwhile, Luckin Coffee is on an aggressive growth trajectory. Despite being founded only in 2017 and suffering a catastrophic collapse due to a $300 million sales fraud scandal, Luckin has bounced back impressively since exiting bankruptcy in 2022.

The brand has skyrocketed from a mere 10,000 stores two years ago to a whopping 22,340 locations today, dwarfing Starbucks' presence in China by threefold.

Luckin Coffee's CEO Jinyi Guo shared with investors the company's plans to implement ""flexible and tailored operational models to build our overseas experience.""

New York Fed President Williams said, ""The current modestly restrictive stance of the Fed's monetary policy is entirely appropriate given the solid labor market and inflation still running somewhat above our 2% goal.""

Chicago Fed President Goolsbee signaled he favors steady Fed policy when he said there's a lot of strength in the hard economic data and the Fed needs to be a steady hand and take the long view.

Market volatility may increase, and volume could be higher than normal today due to the expiration of nearly $4.5 trillion of March options and futures contracts tied to stocks, indexes, and exchange-traded funds in an event known as ""triple-witching.""

The Houthi rebels said they would respond by attacking US vessels in the Red Sea.

Stocks have been under pressure over the past two weeks due to fears that US tariffs will weaken economic growth and corporate earnings.

The company's CFO highlighted that these factors are limiting demand for FedEx's business-to-business services.

In pre-market trading, FedEx shares fell by 9.0%, while its competitor, United Parcel Service (UPS), saw a 1.1% decline. Both companies are considered global economic indicators due to their extensive business operations across various sectors.

The demand for low-margin e-commerce deliveries from companies like Temu and Shein has surpassed the high-margin freight demand between businesses, prompting both FedEx and UPS to implement cost-cutting measures. The industrial sector, which is crucial for these delivery giants, has not met expectations for growth this year, partly due to new and potential tariffs.

Experts warn that these import tariffs could trigger economic downturns and trade wars, further reducing transportation and delivery demand. FedEx, based in Memphis, has adjusted its full-year profit expectations to a range of $18 to $18.60 per share, down from previous estimates.

For the 12 months ending in May, FedEx anticipates revenue will remain flat or slightly decline compared to the previous year. In its third quarter ending February 28, FedEx reported adjusted earnings of $4.51 per share, up from $3.86 per share last year, but below analysts' expectations.

FedEx's CEO noted the challenging operational environment, including a shortened peak season and severe weather events. Both FedEx and UPS are fiercely competing for market share, raising concerns among analysts about a potential price war.

FedEx ended its air cargo contract with its largest customer, the U.S. Postal Service, in September, with UPS taking over the business. However, UPS announced plans to reduce its delivery business with Amazon, its largest customer.

In December, FedEx announced plans to spin off its profitable freight division. The company remains on track to achieve $2.2 billion in permanent cost reductions by fiscal year 2025. The CFO also mentioned an agreement to purchase eight new Boeing 777 freighters at attractive prices.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C000007LB.png?20,N,,2025-03-21 11:06:37.827573

Launched in March 2024, Curious Orange has already gained a foothold as a strong competitor in the Irish and international digital marketing landscape.

The agency now boasts a team of 15 professionals located across Dublin, Paris, Barcelona, New York, Austin, and San Francisco.

Its founders say that this global network validates the agency’s founding principle of leveraging remote work and AI to access the best talent worldwide. This distributed structure also allows it to offer a global perspective and a diverse skill set; capabilities typically associated with much larger network agencies.

According to founder, Emmet McCaughey, the last 12 months have been very busy for the agency and it has built up an impressive roster of clients, including international sporting goods retailer Decathlon (US), Google, YouTube, AIB Life and Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail).

“It’s been an incredible first year for Curious Orange. We set out to build a different kind of agency, one that embraces the future of work and puts partnership at the heart of everything we do,” according to McCaughey.

“Seeing that vision realised, with such a dedicated team and the trust of fantastic clients, is incredibly motivating. We’re focused on building on this momentum and continuing to deliver impactful work in the years to come.”

With the addition of new accounts, he adds that the agency is continuing to expand and is actively seeking a client services lead for the USA as well as additional talent for its European operations.

According to McCaughey, the agency’s success in it first year in business is attributable to its “core strengths of strategy, creative, project management and performance marketing – all delivered with a modern, agile approach.

Revenues at the McDonald’s franchise operator, Aarval which operates three outlets in Galway city, increased by 16pc from €40.27m to a record €46.93m in 2023.

However, increased costs at Aaron Byrne’s and Valerie Byrne’s Aarval Ltd contributed to pre-tax profits dipping marginally from €1.645m to €1.635m.

Revenues at the Byrnes’ franchisee McDonalds business — which is the largest in the west and midwest — have grown exponentially in recent years and the 2023 revenues of €46.93m are a four-fold increase on pre-Covid 19 revenues of €11.7m in 2019.

Numbers employed by the Byrne husband and wife team in 2019 totalled 245 and by the end of 2023 had increased to 937.

Aarval initially operated a McDonald’s outlet in Galway’s Shop Street, along with two other outlets in Galway City at Westside Shopping Centre and the Headford Road Retail Park.

In December 2020, the Byrnes expanded their Aarval business when acquiring four McDonalds restaurants in Limerick at Cruises Street in the city centre; at Jetland shopping centre, Caherdavin; at the Crescent Shopping Centre at Dooradoyle and at the Castletroy Shopping Centre at Castletroy, Limerick.

The couple further expanded their Aarval business when acquiring McDonalds outlets in Co Clare at Shannon and in Ennis in May 2021 while they scaled back their Limerick operation in August 2023 with the closure of the McDonalds on Cruises Street.

The directors’ report for 2023 states that they are satisfied with the results for the year and look forward to growth in the company’s activities in the coming year.

2023 was another year for expansion for the company as numbers employed increased by 89 from 848 to 937 with staff costs rising from €13.42m to €15m.

The pre-tax profit for 2023 takes account of non-cash depreciation charges of €1.45m, non-cash amortisation costs of €459,459 and interest costs of €241,547.

Profits were also hit by a loss of €491,240 on the disposal of intangible assets.

The company recorded net cash of €5m generated from operating activities in 2023 which compared to €3.11m under that heading in 2022.

At the end of December 2023, the company’s accumulated profits totalled €8.48m while its cash funds more than doubled from €2.38m to €5.1m.

Pay to directors increased in 2023 from €259,808 to €271,612 made up of €199,612 in emoluments and €72,000 in pension contributions.

Mr Byrne is also a director of McDonald’s Marketing Company of Ireland Ltd and in 2023, the company provided marketing services to Aarval totalling €1.9m on an arm’s length basis.

The company also saw its revenue rise to Rs 4,008 crore in FY24, a 2.3% increase from Rs 3,920 crore in the previous year as per data accessed by Tofler. This marks a strong recovery for the sporting goods retailer, which had been grappling with losses despite consistent revenue growth.

Decathlon, a French multinational sporting goods retailer, is one of the largest sports retailers in the world. Founded in 1976, the company designs, manufactures, and sells a wide range of sports equipment and apparel across multiple categories. In India, Decathlon has established a strong presence with large-format stores and an extensive e-commerce platform, making sports accessible and affordable to millions. Known for its private-label brands catering to various sports, the company has positioned itself as a leader in the affordable sports retail segment.

In FY22, Decathlon India recorded a net profit of Rs 36 crore, but it swung to a loss in FY23 despite increasing its revenue from Rs 2,897.77 crore in FY22 to Rs 3,920 crore in FY23. This loss was largely due to a sharp increase in total expenditure, which exceeded revenue for the first time. The company reported an expenditure of Rs 3,974.81 crore in FY23, compared to Rs 2,892 crore in FY22. However, in FY24, Decathlon reversed its losses by managing expenses more efficiently while maintaining revenue growth.

What led to Decathlon’s profitability in FY24?

One of the primary reasons for Decathlon’s profitability in FY24 was better control over operating expenses. While the company had suffered from high operational costs in FY23, strategic cost-cutting and operational efficiencies helped it improve margins. Through strategic cost management across areas such as utilities, rent, maintenance, fuel, advertising, IT, logistics, franchise fees, and professional services, the company reduced its overall expenses by 4.5%, lowering them from Rs 3,975 crore in FY23 to Rs 3,797 crore in FY24.

Furthermore, Decathlon continued its upward revenue trajectory, surpassing the Rs 4,000 crore mark in FY24. The company’s dominance in the sports retail sector, supported by its extensive product range and affordable pricing, contributed to sustained sales growth.

In FY23, Decathlon had a high tax outflow, which significantly affected its bottom line. The company had reported a deferred tax credit of Rs 50.92 crore that year. In contrast, FY24 saw a more stable tax situation at Rs 11.70 crore, allowing the company to report profits. Decathlon’s revenue growth was driven by the continued expansion of its retail footprint and an increase in demand for sporting equipment. Its primary revenue-generating category remained ‘Other Sports Equipment,’ which contributed a significant portion of the Rs 3,985 crore turnover in FY24. According to media reports, The company operated efficiently, spending Rs 0.95 to generate every rupee of revenue, while its ROCE improved to 17.79% and EBITDA margin reached 14.49%.",https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Decathlon-1200-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 12:05:49.253548

The company, which at its peak had more than 800 stores worldwide, couldn't compete against the new generation of digital retailers, led by Shein and Temu.

Shein's rise has been meteoric. Its business model is based on direct sales from factories in China without intermediaries. This has allowed it to offer extremely low prices and renew its catalog with thousands of new products every week.

This approach has displaced traditional brands like Forever 21, which couldn't match the speed or costs of the competition.

The Decline of Forever 21

During the 2000s and early 2010s, Forever 21 was a benchmark in affordable youth fashion. Its stores in shopping malls attracted millions of customers looking for trendy clothes at low prices. However, the rise of e-commerce and changes in consumer habits gradually weakened its business model.

The first major warning sign came in 2019, when the company declared bankruptcy for the first time. At that time, it closed hundreds of stores and reduced its international presence. Despite these efforts, it couldn't adapt to the digital competition.

Shein and the New Era of Fast Fashion

Meanwhile, Forever 21 was trying to restructure, Shein was establishing itself as the most popular fast fashion platform among young people. Its strategies were devastating:

Ultra-low prices: Thanks to the de minimis exemption in the United States, Shein can import products without paying tariffs, allowing it to maintain much lower prices than its traditional competitors.

Real-time production: Shein uses artificial intelligence to analyze trends and produce small quantities of new designs. If a product sells well, they make more; if not, they quickly discard it.

Direct-to-consumer sales: Without intermediaries or large warehouses, Shein reduces logistical costs and can offer constant discounts.

Social media marketing: The brand has dominated platforms like TikTok and Instagram, collaborating with influencers to attract a young audience.

Forever 21, with its model based on physical stores and mass production of collections, couldn't compete with this flexibility.

The Final Blow

In 2024, Forever 21's situation became unsustainable. Inflation and low traffic in shopping malls reduced its sales. At the same time, Shein and Temu continued to capture customers with aggressive promotions and fast shipping.

Finally, in March 2025, Forever 21 announced the liquidation of all its stores in the U.S. The brand will continue to operate online under the management of Authentic Brands Group, but its physical presence will disappear from the country.

The collapse of Forever 21 marks the end of an era in fashion retail. While Shein continues to dominate the market, other traditional brands face similar challenges. The industry has changed, and only those companies that adapt to digital commerce and new consumer trends will survive.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/shein-popup-espana_1200_800.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 08:00:21.176570

… For Nike Digital, we are tightening our buys to support a full-price business model.
In fact, comparing last year’s January and February to this year’s Nike Digital and North America [sales] went from over 30 promotional days to zero,” Hill said.
China sales plummeted 15%, as Nike Digital sales there were off 29% and Nike store sales slumped 6% as traffic declined double digits.","Nike’s fiscal 2025 third quarter results offered up a snapshot of just how biting the trade war and tariffs may be. They offered a snapshot of waning consumer demand.

And above all else the numbers — though not as bad as Wall Street might have feared — show that Nike’s turnaround will take time, a marathon and not a sprint.

As for those numbers released after the markets closed on Thursday (March 20), for the quarter that ended last month: Revenues were down 9% year over year to $11.3 billion, while the Street had expected a double digit-drop to the $11 billion level.

But looking forward, and as noted by CFO Matthew Friend, tariffs on imports from China and Mexico will hit margins by 4% to 5%. And revenues will decline in the midteens range, as management said on the call.

The stock slumped 4% in after-hours trading.

Full-Price Digital Model

Within the consolidated top line, Nike Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9% on a reported basis, amid declines seen across all geographies. Nike Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12%, and driven by a 15% decline in Nike digital sales, and a 2% dip at the companies stores.

Said Friend on the call, with discussion of the digital sales: “We are repositioning Nike Digital within an integrated marketplace. To do this, we are reducing promotional days, reducing markdown rates and shifting closeout liquidation to our Nike factory stores.”

Digital traffic is expected to be down “double digits in fiscal 2026,” he said, adding that “gradually, we expect organic traffic to stabilize and grow with new product launches and our increased brand marketing investments. … For Nike Digital, we are tightening our buys to support a full-price business model. For Nike factory stores, we are increasing markdowns to drive velocity of higher volumes of closeout inventory.”

During the call with analysts, CEO Elliott Hill, discussing the second quarter of his relatively new tenure at the helm of the company, said, “While we met the expectations we set, we’re not satisfied with our overall results. We can and will be better.

“For the quarter, the big takeaway for me was clear. When we lead with sport, we create impact for Nike. … We’re beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio. It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over-indexed on.”

Those actions will include diversifying sportwear apparel, he said. And across the brand, “We’re already reducing the promotional days and discounting at lower rates. In fact, comparing last year’s January and February to this year’s Nike Digital and North America [sales] went from over 30 promotional days to zero,” Hill said.

CFO Friend’s commentary on product lines and consumer demand were marked by declines in Nike sportswear and the Jordan brand, “led by a double-digit decline in our classic footwear franchises. These franchises again decelerated faster than the overall business with a more pronounced impact on Nike Digital.”

North America revenues slipped by 4%; in the EMEA region, revenues slipped 6%, and in that segment Nike Direct was off 12% and digital sales declined 25%. China sales plummeted 15%, as Nike Digital sales there were off 29% and Nike store sales slumped 6% as traffic declined double digits.

Navigating Uncertainty

“The market continues to be promotional especially in consumer … and in the digital channel,” Friend said of the China market.

Overall, he said, “We are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.”

Moving through those headwinds, Hill said, “We are going to run a balanced and complete portfolio. That’s why I want to make sure everybody on the call hears that. We’re going to run that through all three brand — Nike, Jordan, Converse — across performance, sportswear, men’s, women’s, kids, footwear, pro accessories, and up and down price points.”

Elsewhere, as Hill said, “We’ve been through a lot of change, but what’s encouraging is that in the 150 days since I’ve been back, we’ve reclaimed our identity. We know who we are. … Nike Inc. is a sports company.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Nike-earnings-2.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 02:32:34.668008

Nike’s (NKE-1.43%) turnaround plan is beginning to show results, thanks to a renewed focus on sports, its new CEO Elliott Hill said while unveiling better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings.

The company posted $11.27 billion in revenue and 54 cents per share in profit, beating analysts’ consensus forecasts of $11.01 billion and 29 cents, respectively. The stock rose almost 3% in after-hours trading.

It was still a difficult quarter: Overall sales dropped 9% primarily due to a 17% plunge in China, amid new tariffs and softer consumer. Margins remain under pressure as the company works to clear old inventory and introduce new styles as Hill shifts its focus back to its athletic roots.

Hill, who has reorganized corporate teams by sport and secured major sponsorship deals with the NFL, NBA and WNBA, is refocusing the brand away from fashion. This strategy was prominently showcased on the world’s biggest sports stage – the Paris Olympics.

Nike has made significant strides, particularly with female customers. A new partnership with Kim Kardashian’s Skims brand aims to expand Nike’s appeal to women and compete with brands like Lululemon (LULU-1.85%) and Alo Yoga.

Despite these moves, analysts still expect a sales decline for the current quarter, driven by multiple factors, including the departure of top strategy and communications executives, Bloomberg reported.

Since Nike’s last earnings report in December, it’s faced additional pressure from Donald Trump’s trade war. The new 20% U.S. tariff on goods imported from China affects about 24% of Nike’s suppliers, which could hurt margins if Nike can’t offset the costs or raise prices. Retailers including Costco and Walmart have demanded that Chinese suppliers absorb the tariffs.

Weaker consumer sentiment has slowed discretionary spending, affecting demand for apparel and footwear. Nike’s largest brand partner, Foot Locker (FL-2.30%), has blamed the shoemaker for its declining sales, citing the effects of sneaker markdowns.

This compares to loss of $0.04 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 57.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this women's apparel retailer would post earnings of $0.03 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.01, delivering a surprise of -133.33%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.

Torrid Holdings , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $275.56 million for the quarter ended January 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.16%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $293.54 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Torrid Holdings shares have added about 7.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -3.5%.

What's Next for Torrid Holdings?

While Torrid Holdings has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Torrid Holdings: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.14 on $276.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.24 on $1.1 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Apparel and Shoes is currently in the bottom 47% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the same industry, Levi Strauss (LEVI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended February 2025.

This jeans maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Levi Strauss' revenues are expected to be $1.54 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter.

(Reuters) -FedEx Corp lowered its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Thursday, as the parcel delivery firm battles stubbornly soft demand and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on trading partners.

""Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy, which is constraining demand for our business-to-business services,"" Chief Financial Officer John Dietrich said in a statement.

FedEx shares fell 5.3% to $232.29 in after-hours trade, while rival United Parcel Service stock shed 1.1%. Those companies are seen as barometers for the global economy since their business touches so many types of businesses.

Both companies have been slashing costs as less lucrative e-commerce delivery demand from companies like Temu and Shein outperforms that of higher-margin shipments between businesses.

(Reuters) -FedEx Corp lowered its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Thursday, as the parcel delivery firm battles stubbornly soft demand and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on trading partners.

FedEx shares fell 5.3% to $232.29 in after-hours trade, while rival United Parcel Service stock shed 1.1%. Those companies are seen as barometers for the global economy since their business touches so many types of businesses.

Accenture shares dropped 7.3% after the firm warned of cuts in contracts with the U.S. government.

Trump in January said he would ""demand that interest rates drop immediately,"" though he didn't follow through on the threat.","The Trump administration's radical overhaul of the federal government and economic policy is bleeding into corporate numbers.

Nike reported earnings Thursday, and cautioned that it expects sales in its current quarter to plunge because of tariffs and sliding consumer sentiment. Accenture, meanwhile, said its numbers have been hit by a reduction in contracts with the U.S. government as the latter reins in spending.

Those are warnings of the economic damage that countries could suffer — on a wider scale — when U.S. President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs come into effect April 2, as he had warned. Across the Atlantic, the European Union is trying to insulate its economy from such blows, postponing its tariffs on the U.S. as it hopes to negotiate a new deal with Trump.

Markets fail to sustain gains

U.S. markets lost momentum Thursday. The S&P 500 lost 0.22%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was mostly flat and the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.33%. Accenture shares dropped 7.3% after the firm warned of cuts in contracts with the U.S. government. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.43%, its first loss in five days. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed unchanged as the Bank of England on Thursday held its benchmark interest rate at 4.5%.

Prices in Japan ease

Japan's headline inflation rose 3.7% year on year in February, easing from a two-year high of 4% seen in January. Core inflation, which excludes prices of fresh food, was at 3%, lower than January's figure of 3.2%. However, the figure was higher than expectations of 2.9% from economists polled by Reuters. The inflation figures come shortly after the Bank of Japan held interest rates steady Wednesday.

Trump's interest rate demands

Hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced it was keeping interest rates unchanged, President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that ""The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy."" Trump in January said he would ""demand that interest rates drop immediately,"" though he didn't follow through on the threat.

EU postpones U.S. tariff

The European Union will delay implementing its first set of tariffs on goods from the U.S. until the middle of April to allow for additional time for discussions with Washington, an EU spokesperson told CNBC Thursday. ""The change represents a slight adjustment to the timeline and does not diminish the impact of our response, in particular as the EU continues to prepare for retaliation of up to EUR 26 billion [$28 billion],"" they noted.

Sales weighed down by tariffs: Nike

Nike on Thursday warned that sales in its current quarter will drop by a double-digit percentage as the sneaker giant contends with ""geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations,"" Matt Friend, Nike's finance chief, said in a conference call with analysts. Pessimistic guidance aside, Nike beat Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal third quarter.

Those recent indicators illustrate the long road ahead for Nike and its new CEO Elliott Hill, who assumed the top job in October. Nike shares have slid 19% since September 20, following Hill’s appointment. Rival Adidas, meanwhile, has seen its stock tick up slightly over the same period.

A turnaround in progress

Under Hill, Nike began an ambitious turnaround, though Morningstar analyst David Swartz said one or two snazzy new styles will not be enough to get the sportswear giant back on track for sales growth.

“It needs to create a whole new franchise, like a family of products that add billions in sales,” Swartz said. “That takes years.”

Nike is expected to post a revenue decline of 11.5% to $11.01 billion in the third quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG. It would be the steepest fall since the 38% decline Nike reported in fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 during the pandemic.

Its earnings per share is expected to come in at 29 cents, down sharply from 77 cents a year earlier. Investors told Reuters they were keen for details on Nike’s efforts to rebuild relationships with retailers and clear out unsold inventory.

“It continues to be a ‘show-me’ story,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at investment banking firm Freedom Capital Markets. “The question is, do investors have the patience?”

Nike’s inventories were $8 billion in the quarter ended November 30, according to the company.

Some of Hill’s moves so far—including the launch of running shoes Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 in January and February; a new partnership with womenswear company Skims; and its first Super Bowl ad in 27 years – drew praise from John Nagle, chief investment officer of Kavar Capital Partners LLC, which holds Nike shares.

Getting in step with Kim Kardashian

The planned women’s line with Kim Kardashian-owned Skims “would be pretty good for the business,” said Nagle, “if they can even just step into that market and be a significant player alongside the Lululemons and Vuoris.”

The Super Bowl commercial, conceived with ad agency Widen + Kennedy, was intended to reach women shoppers, and to demonstrate Nike’s marketing prowess and regain its pop culture relevance.

The spot featured top female athletes like Caitlin Clark, the basketball superstar who has been central to the newfound surge in popularity of the Women’s National Basketball Association.

FedEx: Cost Cutting Mode

At the end of fiscal Q2 in late December, FedEx announced intentions to separate FedEx Freight, creating a separate publicly traded company in about 18 months. FedEx has implemented several cost-cutting initiatives in recent months, including combining its ground, air and other operations in a single company. The goal is to reduce costs by $4 billion before the end of its current fiscal year, ending in May.

Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker in early March wrote that it is an ""important time for the Parcel space as a whole, and FDX in particular, with structural question surrounding the growth/earnings power of the business.""

""The stock has seesawed around earnings in recent quarters though we go into this print at a more reasonable starting point,"" Shanker added. The firm remains underweight on FDX with a 200 price target.

On Tuesday, Citi analysts lowered their price target on FedEx stock to 317 from 347, keeping a buy rating on the shares. The analysts wrote that based on conversations with investors, the big debate was over whether FedEx would further lower its fiscal 2025 earnings outlook.

The firm added that investors seem fearful of the potential impact of tariffs and increasingly concerned about downside risk to consumers and industrial activity.

FedEx Stock

FedEx stock dropped 4% in after-hours stock market action Thursday. It ended the regular session down 0.4% to 246.25. FDX is down more than 6% in March and is trading below both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.

In September, the stock gapped down sharply on Sept. 20, after reporting that cost cuts did not offset weakness in lucrative priority services. Fiscal Q1 earnings missed expectations and FedEx also lowered its full-year earnings outlook.

FedEx stock has declined around 11% in 2025 while United Parcel Service (UPS) has dropped nearly 7%. Collectively, the six stocks in the IBD-tracked Transport-Air Freight industry group are down 9.5% on the year.

FedEx stock has a 21-day average true range of 2.55%. The ATR metric is available on IBD's MarketSurge charting tool. It gauges the characteristic breadth of a stock's behavior. Stocks that tend to make large jumps or dives in daily action, the kind that can trigger sell rules and shake investors out of a stock, have a high ATR. Stocks that tend to make more incremental moves have lower ATRs.

In the current, unpredictable market, IBD suggests stocks with ATRs of 3 or below. UPS stock has a 21-day average true range of 1.89%.

FedEx stock has a 30 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Shares also have a 28 Relative Strength Rating and a 52 EPS Rating.

Auchincloss explained that a series of global changes since 2020 influenced bp’s strategy shift.
“In each and every nation, they’re talking about more oil and gas.
During the interview, Auchincloss noted the company’s investments to boost oil and gas production in the Gulf of America, and onshore through its bpx business.
Answering a question about the challenges involved with carrying out bp’s new strategy, Auchincloss emphasized that process safety remains top of mind for the company.","Speaking on the main stage at the recent CERAWeek conference in Houston, bp CEO Murray Auchincloss discussed the company’s recent strategy shift and its plans to grow value in the coming years.

bp posted a short of overview of the discussion on its website.

In an interview with Dan Yergin, chairman of CERAWeek and vice chairman of S&P Global, Auchincloss explained the rationale for bp’s renewed focus on increasing oil and gas production, disciplined investments in the energy transition and driving efficiency across businesses globally. “I’m absolutely thrilled about what’s possible and look forward to growing our cash flows and growing our businesses,” Auchincloss said.

Auchincloss explained that a series of global changes since 2020 influenced bp’s strategy shift. “It became clear that the two priorities in all countries where we operate is affordable energy and reliable energy,” he said. “In each and every nation, they’re talking about more oil and gas. Yes, lower-carbon – but they need oil and gas. So that was the first thing we started to do, was strengthen the upstream portfolio, and we’ve taken great strides in that.”

Auchincloss noted that bp has “gone back to the Middle East with vigor,” including by reaching an agreement in February 2025 with the Iraqi government to invest in the rehabilitation and redevelopment of several giant oil fields in Kirkuk.

Auchincloss also pointed to bp’s significant investments in America. In fact, the company has about 30,000 employees in the US – more than anywhere else in the world. During the interview, Auchincloss noted the company’s investments to boost oil and gas production in the Gulf of America, and onshore through its bpx business. “We see great growth out of the United States,” Auchincloss said.

In discussing bp’s low-carbon energy plans, Auchincloss said the company is using a “capital-light approach” to growing value, including forming joint ventures to keep investments in those businesses off bp’s balance sheet. “You still get the electron flow for your trading business,” he said. “So we're happy, and it enables you to scale these businesses much faster than you otherwise would have inside a constrained environment of a company like bp.” Auchincloss also noted that bp is focusing its capital investments for biogas and electric vehicle charging in places where the returns can compete with upstream.

Answering a question about the challenges involved with carrying out bp’s new strategy, Auchincloss emphasized that process safety remains top of mind for the company. “We always have to keep an eye on that as we drive change and scale up construction,” he said. “That’s the number one thing.”","https://img.offshore-mag.com/files/base/ebm/os/image/2025/03/67dca65f81044d5fda3965ca-bp_yergin_ceraweek.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-03-20 22:59:36.390868

The $200 Million Mistake The company spent upwards of $200 million on advertising for its new Arch Deluxe line, complete with a swanky launch at the Ritz Carlton in Chicago.
During the event, attendees were also treated to pours of a promotional (and low-alcohol) Deluxe Line Wine.
The Legacy of the Arch Deluxe By the late 1990s, the Arch Deluxe was pulled from menus.
So, here's to the Arch Deluxe — you may not have won the hearts (or taste buds) of many, but you sure did leave us with some cool memorabilia.","The '90s were wild. It was a time when frosted tips, Tamagotchis, and McDonald’s attempt at fine dining coexisted. In an era dominated by oversized jeans and boy bands, the brand experienced one of its biggest (and priciest) marketing flops when it sought to create a burger that would appeal to more sophisticated consumers.

The burger, known as the Arch Deluxe, was a bizarre creation marketed as an upscale burger for adults, and was even promoted with its own bottle of booze, dubbed the Deluxe Line Wine. And what's more grown-up than pairing your burger with a glass of wine? McDonald's — always keen to think outside the (Happy Meal) box — decided to go big or go home with this one.

A Burger Before Its Time?

In 1996, McDonald's tasked head chef Andrew Selvaggio with creating a burger that was ""unique and different to set [the brand] apart from everybody,"" Eater reports. According to Selvaggio, the Arch Deluxe was ""supposed to be the first entry into a better burger — premium burger — experience for McDonald’s.” The burger featured a quarter pound of beef, peppered bacon, lettuce, tomato, cheese, onions, and a ""secret"" mustard-mayo sauce, as described on a McDonald's fandom page.

The $200 Million Mistake

The company spent upwards of $200 million on advertising for its new Arch Deluxe line, complete with a swanky launch at the Ritz Carlton in Chicago. During the event, attendees were also treated to pours of a promotional (and low-alcohol) Deluxe Line Wine. Amid all the glamour and gourmet ambitions, one patron thought it would be a good idea to hang onto a bottle and save it for posterity.

According to a recent Instagram post from Consumer Time Capsule, the user ""recently acquired"" the commemorative bottle for an unknown amount — and people could be seen having a field day in the comment section. ""Looking a little brown in there,"" one user jokingly writes, while another says, ""I’ve heard ‘96 was an excellent year for McWine.""

Why Did It Flop?

Confusing Brand Identity: McDonald's had spent decades building a family-friendly image. Trying to pivot to an upscale market confused customers.

Pricing Problem: The burger was more expensive than a Big Mac, but not premium enough to justify the cost.

Marketing Misfire: Instead of making the burger aspirational, the ads made it seem exclusive in a way that pushed away loyal customers.

The Legacy of the Arch Deluxe

By the late 1990s, the Arch Deluxe was pulled from menus. Despite its failure, it remains one of the most infamous fast-food experiments ever attempted. Interestingly, McDonald's has flirted with reviving the concept, testing similar premium burgers in limited markets.

Would a modern version of the Arch Deluxe succeed today? With today's shift toward gourmet fast food, it's possible. But back in the 90s, it was a lesson in what no to do when rebranding a fast-food empire.

Though the Arch Deluxe has long been retired, and any remaining Deluxe Line wine bottles are likely gathering dust on some collector's shelf, we love reminiscing of a time when fast food brands tried to wine and dine us. So, here's to the Arch Deluxe — you may not have won the hearts (or taste buds) of many, but you sure did leave us with some cool memorabilia.

It marked a 9% decline from the previous year’s quarter, but handily topped Wall Street’s already pessimistic expectation of $11.03 billion, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. Earnings per share of $0.54 nearly doubled the $0.29 estimate.

The market expected a lousy quarter from the sportswear giant as it works to clear inventory and increase engagement with its wholesale partners. But the third quarter results offer some green shoots that the turnaround plan under CEO Elliott Hill are bearing fruit. In October, Hill returned to Nike to replace John Donahoe as CEO.

“We’re beginning to drive a more diversified portfolio,” Hill said during the earnings call. “It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over indexed, but our approach is simple, help consumers fall in love with something new from Nike.”

Nike did not address tariffs in its financial release or on the earnings call. Concerns might be overblown as they relate to Nike. In a recent investor note, Telsey Advisory Group expected a muted impact on Nike with the 15% of its products manufactured in China largely to serve the Chinese market and few imported to the U.S.

The earnings report comes a day after a Bloomberg reported Nike’s lead strategy and communications executives—Daniel Heaf and and KeJuan Wilkins—are both leaving the company. It adds to the list of senior leadership changes under Hill.

Greater China was the worst performing region for Nike with sales down 18%, while North America, which is the largest market at $4.9 billion, was down only 4%. The Nike and Jordan brands represent the bulk of the company’s revenue, but the firm also breaks out Converse revenue, which was $405 million, down 18% for the quarter with declines across all territories. NBA MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has helped raise the profile of that brand.

“Nike is getting back to being Nike again,” Jeffries analyst Randal Konik wrote in a quick reaction research note to the news. “We think this journey takes 2 years, but our call is for a V-shaped recovery in F27.”

Last month, Konik upgraded his rating from hold to buy and made Nike his current favorite pick. He sees an upside case for the stock at $140 based on 35x his 2027 fiscal year earnings per share estimate of $4.00. The base case has the stock at $115.

Nike’s stock was the second-worst performer among the 30 components of the Dow in 2024 with a 30% drop. Its 7.2% decline the prior year made it the third-worst stock in the Dow.

Third Quarter Income Statement Review

Revenues for NIKE, Inc. were $11.3 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis compared to the prior year and down 7 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

NIKE Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis and down 6 percent on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines across all geographies.

NIKE Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12 percent on a reported basis and down 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to a 15 percent decrease in NIKE Brand Digital and a 2 percent decrease in NIKE-owned stores.

Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7 percent on a reported basis and down 4 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues for Converse were $405 million, down 18 percent on a reported basis and down 16 percent on a currency-neutral basis, due to declines across all territories.

Gross margin decreased 330 basis points to 41.5 percent, primarily due to higher discounts, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher product costs and changes in channel mix, partially offset by restructuring charges in the prior year.

Selling and administrative expense decreased 8 percent to $3.9 billion.

Demand creation expense was $1.1 billion, up 8 percent, primarily due to an increase in brand marketing expense.

Operating overhead expense decreased 13 percent to $2.8 billion, primarily due to the restructuring charges of $340 million in the prior year and lower wage-related expenses.

The effective tax rate was 5.9 percent compared to 16.5 percent for the same period last year, primarily due to a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit provided by recently finalized US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses.

Net income was $0.8 billion, down 32 percent, and Diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a decrease of 30 percent.

February 28, 2025 Balance Sheet Review

Inventories for NIKE, Inc. were $7.5 billion, down 2 percent compared to the prior year, reflecting product mix shifts, partially offset by an increase in units.

Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $10.4 billion, down approximately $0.2 billion from last year, as cash generated by operations was more than offset by share repurchases, cash dividends and capital expenditures.

Shareholder Returns

NIKE continues to have a strong track record of consistently increasing returns to shareholders, including 23 consecutive years of increasing dividend payouts.

In the third quarter, the Company returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders, including:

Dividends of $594 million, up 6 percent from the prior year.

Share repurchases of $499 million, reflecting 6.5 million shares retired as part of the Company’s four-year, $18 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2022.

As of February 28, 2025, a total of 119.3 million shares have been repurchased under the program for a total of approximately $11.8 billion.

The quarterly results beat analyst expectations of $11.01 billion, sending shares up 3 per cent in after-hours trading.

It’s the first quarter since Nike CEO Elliott Hill revealed his “Win Now” strategy. Hill, a former Nike veteran, took over the role from John Donahoe in October to steer a turnaround for the company, which laid off more than 1,600 employees last year and has had a string of negative quarters, with shares falling 28 per cent in the past year. Sales also fell 9 per cent in Q2.

The “Win Now” strategy comprises refocusing on sport; moving quickly to clear the marketplace of outdated inventory and usher in new, innovative designs; revamping Nike’s marketing strategy; investing in new countries; and elevating the brand perception.

“The progress we made against the ‘Win Now’ strategic priorities we committed to 90 days ago reinforces my confidence that we are on the right path,” said Hill in a statement. “What's encouraging is Nike made an impact this quarter leading with sport – through athlete storytelling, performance products and big sport moments.”

For the third quarter, gross margin was down 330 basis points to 41.5 per cent as the company works to clear old inventory and make way for fresh designs; inventory was down 2 per cent for the quarter. Net income fell 32 per cent to $800 million in Q3. By channel, direct-to-consumer sales were down 12 per cent to $4.7 billion, while wholesale revenues fell 7 per cent to $6.2 billion. The brand reported an increase in marketing expenses of $1.1 billion.

Nike was hit especially hard by a 17 per cent sales plunge in China to $1.73 billion. North American sales were down 4 per cent to $4.86 billion, while EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) sales fell 10 per cent to $2.8 billion for the quarter.

The brand did not update its outlook for fiscal 2025. Tariffs loom large over the US retail industry. The Trump administration imposed 20 per cent duties on goods imported from China, one of Nike’s manufacturing countries, earlier this year. “The operating environment is dynamic, but what matters most for Nike is serving athletes with new product innovation and re-igniting brand momentum through sport,” said Matthew Friend, Nike’s CFO, in a statement.

New York (CNN) — Nike is in a major slump.

The company’s global sales dropped 9% last quarter, including a 17% drop in China, Nike said Thursday.

In North America, Nike’s largest market, sales dropped 9%.

But the results weren’t as bad as investors feared: Nike’s stock (NKE) inched up 4% during after-hours trading Thursday. Still, the company’s stock has dropped around 30% over the last year.

The largest shoemaker in the world faces a consumer slowdown and tough competition from upstart running brands like Hoka and On. Customers are changing their behaviors, passing up expensive sneakers and athletic clothing for basics.

Nike is also trying to recover from strategy mistakes. The company is cutting back supply on its classic sneaker lines Air Force 1 and Pegasus to try to juice demand and sell these sneakers at full prices. Nike also wants to push shoppers to buy new, higher-priced Air Max shoes and newer Pegasus products.

In recent years, the company has slashed the number of traditional retailers it sells to, including DSW. Instead, it shifted more of its inventory to its own channels, especially online. But the abrupt change hurt Nike’s sales, and Nike has since brought back some of those partnerships.

“Nike took it too far and underestimated the importance of third-party retailers,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients in June.

Nike is betting new CEO Elliott Hill, a former Nike executive who the company brought back last year, and partnerships with celebrity brands like Kim Kardashian’s Skims can help improve profits.

This has been certainly highly publicized, and so people know that there's not really going to be a turnaround that we're really going to see until probably at least fiscal year 2026.
Yeah I think Nike's inventory is in better shape than it was in the past.
Uh but you know Nike's inventory is not in, not in perfect shape because realistically its sales are declined.
So it's definitely going to take some time for Nike to get its inventory in better shape in every channel, and Nike sells into a lot of channels.","Well Nike shares are jumping after reporting third quarter earnings moments ago. For more reaction we're bringing in David Swartz, equity analyst at Morningstar. And David, it seems like people here are ready to just give, give them a little grace. Give them a little wiggle room when it comes to Elliot Hill and his turnaround efforts at the company. But what did you think of this quarter specifically?

Yeah expectations were definitely very low. I anticipated an 11% sales decline and it came in down about 9%. So it was a little bit better than expected, but of course that's still a very poor quarter by Nike standards with the sales and earnings down significantly. But as you said, people anticipated that and they're willing to give Nike a pass. Realistically we've been hearing bad news from Nike now for well over a year, really going back to probably December of 2023. And so it's been a string of difficult quarters and of course there was a CEO change. And if things were really great then there wouldn't have been a CEO change. So people know that there are problems at Nike. This has been certainly highly publicized, and so people know that there's not really going to be a turnaround that we're really going to see until probably at least fiscal year 2026.

Was there anything in this report that sort of showed any kind of green shoots in that regard, or do we have to kind of wait for the call? And if so, what do you want to know from them at this point?

Yeah we don't have a lot of information yet, but it looks like the North America sales were not too bad, just down about 4% or so. So you know, that's not too bad in comparison with some other athletic companies that have been reporting in North America. However, the sales in greater China were certainly very weak, um and Europe doesn't look very good either. So it's clear that Nike has significant problems in major geographic regions that are going to need to be addressed, and it's going to definitely take some time. We know that Nike has intentionally pulled back on a lot of its shoe franchises like Air Force and Dunk that had really become stale and oversaturated in the last few years. And there have been some new products including Pegasus premium, Vomero 18, that seem to be doing pretty well, but at this point we're really waiting for a lot of new products to come out, really starting probably in fall and winter of next year.

And what about the sort of inventory clean out that they had been undergoing, right? Where they had sort of the glut of inventory as sales slowed down a little bit, and they were trying to move that through the system.

Yeah I think Nike's inventory is in better shape than it was in the past. I don't think that it's it's perfect at this point. Nike's inventory got really out of control about two or three years ago, it was just way too much product and it wasn't entirely Nike's fault because there were Covid reasons and other problems that were going on at the time, shipping issues. Um and some of those problems, I think, have passed. Uh but you know Nike's inventory is not in, not in perfect shape because realistically its sales are declined. So it's hard to manage the inventory when you've got declining sales. It's much easier when your sales are increasing. So it's definitely going to take some time for Nike to get its inventory in better shape in every channel, and Nike sells into a lot of channels.

Well and Nike has its own specific problems and then there's the macro environment right now of course. So do you think that it is going to really be fighting even more of an uphill battle given what seems to be some really wavering consumer sentiment in the US right now?

I think Nike's really been fighting those issues for some time. We have seen, for example in China, youth unemployment has been high, and that's Nike's target demographic. We've seen similar problems in North America and Europe, where inflation has affected consumer spending, especially for younger adults, teenagers. And that's Nike's target market. So the economic environment has never been perfect, um and it will never be perfect. But I think it could be better than what it is now. Uh we don't know exactly when that will happen. So Nike needs to manage its business assuming that economic conditions will not be ideal. And Nike has been increasing its sales through the value channel to some degree, uh to the family channel as well as trying to increase sales of its higher performance and higher priced products too. So Nike really needs to address all parts of the market.

And then finally David I want to ask you about tariffs. We just heard from our Brooke DePalma that the company has reduced its reliance on manufacturing from China to some extent. How much exposure does it still have there that it is then exporting to the US? Um and how do you think it's managing the tariff risk?

Well the vast majority of Nike's products that are made in China are sold in China as well, so it wouldn't be affected by the tariffs directly. Nike actually imports a small percentage of its merchandise from China to the United States. Um however, the economic factors are still there. If the trade war causes recessions in the US and China then that's definitely very negative for for Nike. And there's also a risk that tariffs will be extended to other countries. If tariffs are extended to Vietnam, that would be very damaging to Nike because it is Nike's number one sourcing country, and it does a lot of importing from Vietnam. And so I don't think Nike can avoid those tariffs very easily. It would also affect Adidas which has a big manufacturing facility in Vietnam as well.

Interesting. So watch this space on that front. David, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wGnkNQ_i0xD8oPoHGGymQQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/6d77aec0-05cd-11f0-bbff-9a32f88785b1,N,,2025-03-20 19:00:57.779748

Fiscal Third Quarter Summary

Revenues for Nike, Inc. were $11.3 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis compared to the prior year and down 7 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

Nike Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis and down 6 percent on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines across all geographies.

Nike Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12 percent on a reported basis and down 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to a 15 percent decrease in Nike Brand Digital and a 2 percent decrease in Nike-owned stores.

Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7 percent on a reported basis and down 4 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues for Converse were $405 million, down 18 percent on a reported basis and down 16 percent on a currency-neutral basis, due to declines across all territories.

Divisional Revenues

Regional Summary

Income Statement Summary

Gross margin decreased 330 basis points to 41.5 percent, primarily due to higher discounts, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher product costs and changes in channel mix, partially offset by restructuring charges in the prior year.

Selling and administrative expense decreased 8 percent to $3.9 billion.

Demand creation expense was $1.1 billion, up 8 percent, primarily due to an increase in brand marketing expense.

Operating overhead expense decreased 13 percent to $2.8 billion, primarily due to the restructuring charges of $340 million in the prior year and lower wage-related expenses.

The effective tax rate was 5.9 percent compared to 16.5 percent for the same period last year, primarily due to a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit provided by recently finalized US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses.

Net income was $0.8 billion, down 32 percent, and diluted earnings per share was 54 cents, a decrease of 30 percent year-over-year, but easily above consensus estimates for 30 cents per share.

Balance Sheet Summary

Inventories for Nike, Inc. were $7.5 billion, down 2 percent compared to the prior year, reflecting product mix shifts, partially offset by an increase in units.

Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $10.4 billion, down approximately $0.2 billion from last year, as cash generated by operations was more than offset by share repurchases, cash dividends and capital expenditures.

Shareholder Returns

Nike continues to have a strong track record of consistently increasing returns to shareholders, including 23 consecutive years of increasing dividend payouts.

In the third quarter, the company returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders, including:

Dividends of $594 million, up 6 percent from the prior year.

Share repurchases of $499 million, reflecting 6.5 million shares retired as part of the company’s four-year, $18 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2022.

As of February 28, 2025, a total of 119.3 million shares have been repurchased under the program for a total of approximately $11.8 billion.

The company’s third-quarter results handily beat analyst estimates. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings per share of 29 cents in the quarter. Revenue also bested analysts’ expectations of an 11.5 percent drop, according to data compiled by LSEG.

By business segment, the company said Nike brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis, driven by declines across all geographies. Nike Direct revenues in Q3 were $4.7 billion, down 12 percent on a reported basis, primarily due to a 15 percent decrease in Nike brand digital and a 2 percent decrease in Nike-owned stores.

As for Nike’s wholesale channel, which the company has steadily worked on rebuilding, revenues in the quarter were $6.2 billion, down 7 percent on a reported basis. Revenues from Converse were $405 million, down 18 percent on a reported basis, due to declines across all territories.

As for footwear sales in the period, Nike said that sales in the category dropped 12 percent to $7.2 billion, down from $8.2 billion in the same time last year. Apparel sales in Q3 were $3.2 billion, down 3 percent from $3.3 billion, while equipment sales were down 2 percent to $477 million, down from $487 million.

Elliott Hill, who took on the role of president and chief executive officer of Nike, Inc. in October, said in a statement that the progress the company has made against its “Win Now” strategic priorities implemented 90 days ago reinforces his confidence that Nike is “on the right path.”

“What’s encouraging is Nike made an impact this quarter leading with sport – through athlete storytelling, performance products and big sport moments,” Hill said.

In October, Nike withdrew its guidance for fiscal 2025 in its first earnings call since announcing that John Donahoe would step down and be replaced by Hill.

Matthew Friend, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Nike, Inc., added on Thursday that the company’s outlook for the second half of fiscal 2025 remains “consistent” with what was communicated last quarter.

“The operating environment is dynamic, but what matters most for Nike is serving athletes with new product innovation and reigniting brand momentum through sport,” Friend said.",https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/nike-vomero-18-008.jpeg?w=650,N,,2025-03-20 20:59:20.565058

To take a closer look in those numbers, adjusted earnings coming in at 54 cents, revenue coming in at 11.27 billion dollars.
Yeah, analysts telling me today that despite the, the thinking around tariffs taking a hit on their China business, it actually has reduced their exposure to China since Trump took office back in 2016.
But their China business, lots of work needs to be done in order to continue to, uh, convince that consumer to buy as well.
Is Anta China based?","Nike third quarter earnings coming across moments ago. We got the whole team with us to break it down. Joining us, Yahoo! Finances, Brad Smith, and Brooke DiPalma. Brooke, first, give us the numbers here.

So adjusted earnings per share beat expectations. We also saw revenue beat expectations. To take a closer look in those numbers, adjusted earnings coming in at 54 cents, revenue coming in at 11.27 billion dollars. That was compared to what Wall Street had expected of 11.03 billion. Now, the Nike brand, that key segment of the business, did also beat expectations when it comes to revenue coming in at 10.89 billion dollars, compared to what Wall Street had expected of 10.6. Now these were pretty lowly expectations going into this report. Many analysts telling me on the phone today that Nike is getting a pass here for this quarter and two after this, in the midst of what is a turnaround under new CEO, Elliot Hill. Analysts and investors really looking for long-term strategic moves that Hill will make. Now, this also comes at a time when consumers are very choosy. They have to be convinced to buy with newness and innovation. We also have seen other competitors like On Holdings, Skechers, and Hoka also come into the picture during this turnaround plan at Nike.

Yeah. And Brad, you had a chance to talk to some folks at the company.

Yeah, some of the sources at Nike and ultimately just additional context around how you're going to hear, I think, the executives continue over the next few months in this transitory period for the product portfolio, for their wholesale relationships, really try to tell the story and sell the story, not just internally among folks that work at Nike, but also to some of those wholesale partners. And one of the huge things that I would be watching more for is something that we've already heard for the company, this Win Now program where it's really five actions that they're trying to take to the mindset of their customers, both the wholesale partners as well as some of the customers like you and I, Josh, going into store buying up all the most recent Jordans here on the day. Uh, but ultimately, igniting their winning culture, shaping their brand for distinction, accelerating a complete product portfolio, elevating and growing marketplace, plus winning on the ground with consumers. And I know we're going to talk about one of those key areas where they do need to win on the ground regionally. But if we think about the product portfolio here, just specifically, there was a lot of talk about how they had leaned too far into Dunks, how they had gone and looked at the retro Jordan brand and tried to figure out, okay, where can we make sure that we are milking that for all of the value that it potentially has. And there were some creative launches that certainly came forward, but now there's a larger question of how sustainable longer term that was, especially as analysts, who you and I have spoken to as well, are talking about, well, where's the newness? Where's the innovation that's really going to drive a lot more of that fanfare for the brand itself?

And there's so much going on with Nike, right? When we think about sort of the global brand and Brooke, I know you've sort of been tracking what's going on with Nike and their business in China. Their adjusted EBITDA coming in a little bit lower than expected in that region right now, but what's sort of the story with Nike and their China businesses?

Yeah, analysts telling me today that despite the, the thinking around tariffs taking a hit on their China business, it actually has reduced their exposure to China since Trump took office back in 2016. If you take a closer look, their footwear exposure, as far as manufacturing goes in China, has been reduced from 29% to 18%. Apparel business also down from 26% down to 16% in the latest year. But their China business, lots of work needs to be done in order to continue to, uh, convince that consumer to buy as well. We know that we saw on this report their business sales over there, Wall Street had expected them to drop roughly 9%, they dropped roughly 15%. So that was certainly way more than Wall Street had expected.

Yeah, no, that's a great point. And one of the huge things that we have to remember about China too is Elliot Hill, the new CEO who is a, of course, boomerang for the company, he's had a lot of experience operating and really revving back up their China business. 2014-2015, that was one of the main tasks that was on his desk. And ultimately what we saw back then was a period of time where there was more globalization. It's a far different period that they're operating through now. A lot of that consumer mind share, especially localized both US and in China has moved towards some of the more homegrown options. And so with that in mind, it's going to come back to how they're able to sell further into that region, which products are able to move through wholesale partners, and what price too, because this is a company that also has talked about in the past, wanting to make sure that much of their 65% of their inventory is selling at full price here. And so as you're working with those wholesale partners, they want to make sure that you're also not undercutting them and running massive promotions. And that's actually what we saw in the recent quarter, too. They cut back on some of those promotions. Anybody who was on the platform or on the website or on the Sneakers app, probably saw, probably saw sales, but less of the sales. That's what I was experiencing. I was like, where are the discounts? I need them here. I don't have as much to spend. And so that is something that we could see potentially going forward from here as well.

Meanwhile, this makes me wonder, what's the hot sneaker brand in China right now?

Well, Anta is doing really well. Um, so, so Anta, so Kyrie Irving, of course, ex-Nike athlete, is working with Anta, and he's been coming out with some pretty good shoes.

Is Anta China based?

Anta, I believe the, yes, I believe China based, but also one of the other massive things around them is they've now gotten into storefronts here in the US as well.

We have Hoka, we have On, we have Adidas, what, what's, now we have this brand.

Correct me in real time if I'm wrong.

They look kind of cool. I don't know where they're based. Who are they?

All right. Thanks, guys. Really appreciate the team coverage.

Consensus estimates from LSEG show Wall Street had expected sales to be down 11.4% in the current quarter.
That's largely because of the costs associated with Nike's efforts to clear out old inventory in favor of new, innovative styles.
During the quarter, sales fell 17% in the key region to $1.73 billion, falling short of expectations of $1.84 billion, according to StreetAccount.
Still, revenue in the region came in better than the $4.53 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.","Nike expects its sales decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is set to end in May, to be at the ""low end"" of the ""mid-teens range,"" far worse than analysts expected.

The company said its guidance is based on its ongoing restructuring efforts, plus tariffs and sliding consumer confidence.

During the sneaker giant's key holiday quarter, sales declined 9%, driven by weakness in China.

Nike on Thursday warned that sales will drop by a double digit percentage in its current quarter as the sneaker giant contends with new tariffs, sliding consumer confidence and a slower than expected turnaround.

In a conference call with analysts, finance chief Matt Friend said Nike expects its sales decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, which is set to end in May, to be at the ""low end"" of the ""mid-teens range."" It also anticipates its gross margin will fall between 4 and 5 percentage points as it ramps up efforts to liquidate excess inventory and stale styles that are no longer resonating with consumers — a process it expects to continue into fiscal 2026.

""We believe that the fourth quarter will reflect the largest impact from our ... actions, and that the headwinds to revenue and gross margin will begin to moderate from there,"" said Friend. ""We are also navigating through several external factors that create uncertainty in the current operating environment, including geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates and tax regulations, as well as the impact of this uncertainty and other macro factors on consumer confidence.""

The guidance is far worse than analysts had expected. Consensus estimates from LSEG show Wall Street had expected sales to be down 11.4% in the current quarter.

Shares fell more than 4% in extended trading and are down more than 5% year to date, as of Thursday's close.

Beyond guidance, Nike beat Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal third quarter.

Here's how the company performed during the quarter, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 54 cents vs. 29 cents estimated

Revenue: $11.27 billion vs. $11.01 billion estimated

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Feb. 28 was $794 million, or 54 cents per share, compared with $1.17 billion, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier.

Money Report

Sales dropped to $11.27 billion, down about 9% from $12.4 billion a year earlier. Like other retailers, Nike saw strong demand in December followed by ""double digit"" declines in January and February.

While Nike delivered a strong earnings beat, expectations were low headed into the release and profits fell 32% from the year-ago period.

During the quarter, Nike's gross margin fell by 3.3 percentage points to 41.5%, lower than expectations of 41.8%, according to StreetAccount. That's largely because of the costs associated with Nike's efforts to clear out old inventory in favor of new, innovative styles. In a press release, the company attributed its drop in gross margin to ""higher discounts, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher product costs and changes in channel mix.""

Meanwhile, sales were down 9%, driven by weakness in China. During the quarter, sales fell 17% in the key region to $1.73 billion, falling short of expectations of $1.84 billion, according to StreetAccount.

""I spent some time over there in December. I hadn't been over there in a while. The competition is a bit more aggressive than what I remembered,"" CEO Elliott Hill, who left Nike in 2020 and returned last year, told analysts. ""So we've just got to accelerate our pace.""

Thursday's release comes about five months into Hill's tenure as CEO and his efforts to turn around the business and get it back to growth. He has focused on winning back wholesale partners, reigniting innovation and wooing back athletes that have fled to new competitors, but the work has not yet yielded results.

""I'll start by saying I'm proud of the progress we made against the key actions we committed to 90 days ago. While we met the expectations we set, we're not satisfied with our overall results,"" Hill told analysts. ""We can and will be better.""

During the quarter, sales on Nike's direct channels dropped 12% to $4.7 billion. Wholesale revenue fell 7% to $6.2 billion.

Plus, since Hill took over, the company is now contending with a new set of dynamics that could make its comeback even harder to execute.

In the three months since Nike last reported earnings, President Donald Trump has put a new 20% tariff on goods imported from China, consumer sentiment has fallen, and retail sales in both January and February were weaker than expected.

Out of the hundreds of suppliers and manufacturers that Nike works with, about 24% of them are located in China, according to a manufacturing disclosure published in January. If the retailer doesn't raise prices to offset tariffs and can't push the cost entirely on to suppliers, Nike's margins are expected to take a hit from the new duties. On Thursday's call, Nike didn't say whether it would raise prices or how exactly the new duties would affect margins.

Further, when consumers aren't feeling confident and cutting back on spending, discretionary products like new clothes and shoes are one of the first things they cut out in favor of necessities. Over the last few years, the overall sneaker and apparel markets have been slow because consumers have cut back on clothes and shoes. But up until recently, strong companies were still performing well and taking market share from weaker competitors.

However, that trend began to shift over the last few weeks when even the strongest of companies started to sound the alarm about soft consumer spending when they reported first-quarter earnings, raising questions about the health of the economy.

During the quarter, sales in North America — Nike's largest market — fell 4% to $4.86 billion. Still, revenue in the region came in better than the $4.53 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.

Nike is widely expected to reclaim the market share it lost and reset its business, and some insiders say the company's problems have been overblown. Even so, the tariffs and economic fears could mean that the retailer's turnaround could take longer, and be more difficult, than expected.

What's key to Nike's turnaround plan is its ability to reignite innovation and create the type of industry-leading shoes and apparel that have long made it the market leader. During a call with analysts, Hill said early releases for the company's new Pegasus Premium ""nearly sold out"" across North America and will scale through fall 2025. Its Romero 18, created for the everyday runner, has seen ""outstanding"" results, and Nike plans to double distribution by mid-April.

""It will take time to reach the volume to replace the handful of classic franchises we over-indexed on, but our approach is simple,"" said Hill. ""Help consumers fall in love with something new from Nike, and that something is not replacing one icon for another.""

Nike has already made strides in its efforts to grow its female consumer base, another key component to boosting revenue and apparel sales. Last month, it announced it was teaming up with Kim Kardashian's intimates brand Skims to create a new product line dubbed NikeSKIMS that will include apparel, footwear and accessories. The buzzy partnership is expected to give Nike improved inroads with women and allow it to better compete with Lululemon, Alo Yoga and Vuori, which cater more to women than Nike currently does.

Further, Nike debuted a new ad campaign geared toward female athletes during the Super Bowl, its first big game advertisement in decades. The campaign showed that reaching female athletes and capturing the buzz around women's sports will be a center point of Hill's strategy.

If Nike can continue to show positive signs from new product launches and partnerships, the rest of its headwinds might just be drowned out as noise.",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2025/03/108077585-1734535741032-gettyimages-2188445202-img_1635_belsnmkl.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-03-20 20:01:49.080684

(Reuters) -Nike reported a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly results on Thursday, showing the first signs of recovery as its new Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 sneaker lines drive an uptick in demand.

Shares of the Air Jordan maker rose 4% in extended trading.

Newly launched sneakers, fast-tracked by new CEO Elliott Hill, have performed well enough to give the sportswear maker some breathing room after several quarters of weak demand.

Hill took the helm in October to lead a turnaround at a company that has lately struggled to design new, innovative shoes.

With rivals On and Hoka retaining their freshness in the eyes of consumers, analysts and investors heading into the quarter had struck a cautious tone, anticipating that Nike's turnaround could take a few more quarters.

In the five months since he took charge, Hill has stressed the need to turn Nike's focus back to its core business of sport and to repair its relationships with retailers, which suffered when ex-CEO John Donahoe shifted the company's focus to direct-to-consumer sales.

Nike also discounted key lifestyle franchises Air Jordan 1, AirForce 1 and Dunk during the quarter, as it looks to clear out old inventory and focus on innovation. That sweetened the pot for buyers, who had waited all year to splurge in the holiday season.

The company's third-quarter revenue fell 9% to $11.27 billion, compared with analysts' expectation of an 11.5% drop to $11.01 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Nike's $2 billion savings plan including job cuts, tightening the supply of some products and reducing management layers helped it report a quarterly profit per share of 54 cents, about a 30% fall compared to a year ago.

Analysts on average were expecting a 62.2% decline to 29 cents per share.

However, gross margin fell 330 basis points to 41.5%, with Nike primarily attributing it to higher discounts, an excess of outdated inventory and increased product costs.

References to EBIT and EBIT margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

2 Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expense, including product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology. Global Brand Divisions revenues include NIKE Brand licensing and other miscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segment.

3 Corporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. For the three and nine months ended February 29, 2024, Corporate includes the restructuring charges, recognized as a result of the Company's steps to streamline the organization. These charges primarily reflect employee severance costs.

2 Diluted earnings per share excluding the restructuring charges is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most comparable GAAP measure is Diluted earnings per share. The Company uses Diluted earnings per share excluding the restructuring charges to facilitate the evaluation of the Company’s performance. The Company believes that providing Diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the restructuring charges is useful to investors for comparability between periods and allows investors to evaluate the impacts of the restructuring charges separately. For the three and nine months ended February 28, 2025, there were no material restructuring charges.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YBX31d3FUn5GjcRqeaG4WQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD00MzE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business-wire.com/eaa4c06d952695c3be288615d6d342ce,N,,2025-03-20 19:01:19.469014
ID21,Kraft Heinz,2025-03-20 20:18:45+00:00,AgFunderNews,NotCo CEO on the road to profitability and its new GLP-1 booster - AgFunder News,Elaine Watson,,,,,https://agfundernews.com/notco-ceo-on-the-road-to-profitability-the-evolving-business-model-and-its-new-glp-1-booster,"Chilean foodtech firm NotCo is on course to be profitable in 2027, says cofounder and CEO Matias Muchnick.
But that doesn’t mean NotCo is focusing all of its attention on the b2b business, he said.
“The blend we have come up with so far is a combination of existing ingredients and ingredients created by us.
“And then we started to become the innovation partners of big QSRs and not just for a plant-based version of something.
And then in 2022, we had an incredible conversation with Kraft Heinz, which had everything we didn’t in North America… scale, commercialization, distribution.","Chilean foodtech firm NotCo is on course to be profitable in 2027, says cofounder and CEO Matias Muchnick. “However, I’m looking at profitability in Q2 2025 in our most mature operations in Chile, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru.”

Speaking to AgFunderNews at the Future Food-Tech summit in San Francisco last week, Muchnick said NotCo had made some “hard decisions” in late 2023 and early 2024 including laying off staff, de-listing underperforming SKUs, and closing its New York office and transferring responsibility for sales and marketing of its products in North America to joint venture partner Kraft Heinz.

However, the growth of the b2b business—whereby NotCo uses its AI tools to help industry partners develop better products—”is taking off faster than we thought and allowing us to get a P&L closer to a technology company than a CPG company,” he claimed.

“Therefore, there might be some opportunities for us to become profitable closer to the end of 2026.”

NotCo in North America

NotCo’s branded CPG products in North America (NotMayo, NotChicken, NotBurger) are now sold and distributed by its joint venture with Kraft Heinz, along with plant-based products co-developed by the partners such as Kraft Not Cheese and Oscar Mayer Not Hot Dog, said Muchnick.

But that doesn’t mean NotCo is focusing all of its attention on the b2b business, he said. “We need to preserve a CPG business as there are obvious synergies. We can also test our technology in our own CPG products. 20% of our business in Chile and Argentina is from [NotCo branded] snacks today, which is something that didn’t even exist even one year ago.”

As for the joint venture with Kraft Heinz, he said, “We are on budget. For Kraft Heinz, NotBurger and NotChicken are incremental to their business, plus they are not as strong in the natural channel, where we are very strong.” Conversely, Kraft Heinz has excellent distribution in conventional accounts such as Walmart and Kroger, which has helped get co-developed products such as Not Mac & Cheese in front of more consumers, he said. “The JV is operating really well and we will keep innovating.”

NotMilk, which was introduced in US retailers’ chilled cabinets in 2020 and then switched to their shelf-stable sets in early 2023, is still available in some retail outlets and on Amazon, he said. “But the focus has shifted to D2C. Why? Because it’s not synergetic to Kraft Heinz.”

The B2B business

Echoing comments made by cofounder and CTO Dr. Karim Pichara in a recent interview with AgFunderNews, Muchnick said that a large chunk of NotCo’s revenue in the coming years will come from partnerships with CPG companies that want to improve and speed up product development using NotCo’s proprietary AI platform ‘Giuseppe.’

In some cases partners want to create new products from concept to launch, while in others they want to reformulate existing products to reduce costs or comply with evolving regulations or consumer preferences, he said.

“Some big companies are skeptical about sharing their data. But the good thing is that we have enough data and different data than what they have to generate the value they’re seeking.”

He added: “We might find one day that they will be willing to share their data, but then the question is, do they have valuable data?

“Every company says it has incredible data, but the data is not always compatible because the protocols in which it was created 40 years ago don’t match the ones used 20 years later. Or the mass spectrometer isn’t calibrated in Germany the same way it is somewhere else. So you have a level of disparity or inconsistency of data that can impact whether that data is valuable or not.”

Ultimately, he said, “We never say that we can do something better than R&D teams with decades of experience could do in-house. What we sell is that we’re going to get there far more quickly and efficiently and come up with different ways of achieving the same goals.

“So say you want to improve the HFSS score [High in Fat, Sugar, and Salt] of a certain product [in the UK market]. It might not be just about removing sugar, it might be about re-imagining what that product is. And artificial Intelligence is incredibly clever at doing that because it doesn’t have any biases about what should be [in any given product].”

Giuseppe is well-known for coming up with unusual ingredient pairings and suggestions, such as cocoa in plant-based beef burgers or pineapple and cabbage in alt-milk. However, reformulation projects don’t always involve unexpected ingredients but might be about changing the ratio of existing ingredients or tweaking the production process, said Muchnick.

“It’s not always about novelty, because novelty has a risk. Plus all of the projects that we’re working on have the number one constraint of gross margin.”

GLP-1 booster

NotCo’s most recent project is a powdered ‘GLP-1 booster’ that can be added to foods that will help people regulate appetite and preserve muscle mass and metabolic function, said Muchnick.

“We’re not trying to replace GLP-1 drugs. This is for people that can’t access these medications or who are coming off these drugs and trying to avoid weight rebound or just looking for a natural alternative that isn’t going to have the same effect as a drug, but still provides meaningful benefits.”

Giuseppe has been collecting data on ingredients for 10 years and can also scour through peer-reviewed papers on ingredients claimed to stimulate the production of GLP-1, noted Muchnick.

However, its approach has been less about identifying an obscure ingredient that might boost GLP-1 than developing a combination of ingredients that “help support GLP-1 levels in the body through different mechanisms.”

“Algorithms don’t really care about the name of the ingredient,” said Muchnick. “They care about understanding the underlying patterns on how to create combinations to generate functionality, taste, texture, smell or color.

“It’s not just what you see on a product label. We’ve been diving way deeper into digestion, absorption, and bioavailability, and searching both what exists and what we can build. For example, we are really focusing on peptides and the engineering of probiotics and prebiotics that help boost GLP-1 more than any physical ingredient that already exists.”

He added: “It’s one thing to see what is the best combination of existing ingredients to generate the desired effect, and the other one is, how do we create new ingredients that will boost GLP-1 more than any other ingredient that’s exists today? So we’re doing both routes.

“The blend we have come up with so far is a combination of existing ingredients and ingredients created by us. As a disclaimer, we have already run some tests, but they’re not clinical trials, therefore we can only say that it will potentially help you, but we can’t say more until we get the results of human clinical trials.” He did not provide details of the timing or scope of the trials, but said: “We have moved ahead with human clinical trials.”

As for the business model, he said, “We are considering several options, from working with our CPG partners so they can incorporate this into their products to launching it as one of our own products in our foods business. But the product is designed to be applied to any food matrix from chocolate to beverages.”

One-stop-shop

Stepping back, Muchnick said: “We’ve had 10 years of data construction. We have more than 10,000 formulations with sensorial feedback from human beings. We’ve been testing digital twins [virtual representations of a physical object or system that are updated in real-time], which is now a buzzword in AI, since we started the company.

“It is the different dimensions of data and the training on the data sets that sets us apart. Then what comes next is that we’re not an AI company that builds AI without understanding the human angle of key problems facing people in the food industry, because we also make our own products.”

Critically, NotCo is not merely a concept generator, but enables partners to build products from concept to launch, said Muchnick. “There are lots of AI software startups solving parts of the problem now, lots of concept generators, social listening models, competitive analysis and so on.

“But our concepts are connected to a formulation. If you test a concept and you like it, you have a formulation already. Everything is connected.”

Speaking at a breakout session at the Future Food-Tech summit last Thursday, Muchnick told delegates: “NotCo started as a technology company 10 years ago when no one was talking about AI… we wanted to become an R&D powerhouse for many other companies.

“It didn’t work. No one understood what we were doing, and so we needed to show them what we could do with our technology through our own brands, so we created a plant-based portfolio, starting in Chile and then Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, the US, Canada.

“And then we started to become the innovation partners of big QSRs and not just for a plant-based version of something. And then in 2022, we had an incredible conversation with Kraft Heinz, which had everything we didn’t in North America… scale, commercialization, distribution. And all of a sudden, we were operating eight different categories of products in only one year and a half of commercial execution.

“After that, ChatGPT was coming out and AI was suddenly what every board member was talking about. Today, we are working with seven out of the top 10 CPGs in the world.”

Third Quarter Income Statement Review

Revenues for NIKE, Inc. were $11.3 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis compared to the prior year and down 7 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

NIKE Brand revenues were $10.9 billion, down 9 percent on a reported basis and down 6 percent on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines across all geographies.

NIKE Direct revenues were $4.7 billion, down 12 percent on a reported basis and down 10 percent on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to a 15 percent decrease in NIKE Brand Digital and a 2 percent decrease in NIKE-owned stores.

Wholesale revenues were $6.2 billion, down 7 percent on a reported basis and down 4 percent on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues for Converse were $405 million, down 18 percent on a reported basis and down 16 percent on a currency-neutral basis, due to declines across all territories.

Gross margin decreased 330 basis points to 41.5 percent, primarily due to higher discounts, higher inventory obsolescence reserves, higher product costs and changes in channel mix, partially offset by restructuring charges in the prior year.

Selling and administrative expense decreased 8 percent to $3.9 billion.

Demand creation expense was $1.1 billion, up 8 percent, primarily due to an increase in brand marketing expense.

Operating overhead expense decreased 13 percent to $2.8 billion, primarily due to the restructuring charges of $340 million in the prior year and lower wage-related expenses.

The effective tax rate was 5.9 percent compared to 16.5 percent for the same period last year, primarily due to a one-time, non-cash deferred tax benefit provided by recently finalized US tax regulations related to foreign currency gains and losses.

Net income was $0.8 billion, down 32 percent, and Diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a decrease of 30 percent.

February 28, 2025 Balance Sheet Review

Inventories for NIKE, Inc. were $7.5 billion, down 2 percent compared to the prior year, reflecting product mix shifts, partially offset by an increase in units.

Cash and equivalents and short-term investments were $10.4 billion, down approximately $0.2 billion from last year, as cash generated by operations was more than offset by share repurchases, cash dividends and capital expenditures.

Shareholder Returns

NIKE continues to have a strong track record of consistently increasing returns to shareholders, including 23 consecutive years of increasing dividend payouts.

In the third quarter, the Company returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders, including:

Dividends of $594 million, up 6 percent from the prior year.

Share repurchases of $499 million, reflecting 6.5 million shares retired as part of the Company’s four-year, $18 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2022.

As of February 28, 2025, a total of 119.3 million shares have been repurchased under the program for a total of approximately $11.8 billion.

Check out our latest analysis for Hewlett Packard Enterprise

The Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit

To properly understand Hewlett Packard Enterprise's profit results, we need to consider the US$602m gain attributed to unusual items. While we like to see profit increases, we tend to be a little more cautious when unusual items have made a big contribution. When we crunched the numbers on thousands of publicly listed companies, we found that a boost from unusual items in a given year is often not repeated the next year. Which is hardly surprising, given the name. If Hewlett Packard Enterprise doesn't see that contribution repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to drop over the current year.

That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.

Our Take On Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Profit Performance

We'd posit that Hewlett Packard Enterprise's statutory earnings aren't a clean read on ongoing productivity, due to the large unusual item. Therefore, it seems possible to us that Hewlett Packard Enterprise's true underlying earnings power is actually less than its statutory profit. But at least holders can take some solace from the 43% EPS growth in the last year. The goal of this article has been to assess how well we can rely on the statutory earnings to reflect the company's potential, but there is plenty more to consider. In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example - Hewlett Packard Enterprise has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.

Today we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.

A competitor from China is threatening to take the top spot as it begins its expansion to the U.S.

Last year, Starbucks suffered major financial losses, according to earnings reports.

Now, a swiftly-growing Chinese rival is aiming to challenge the longtime coffee giant's command over the U.S. coffee market.

In 2023, Luckin Coffee surpassed Starbucks to become the largest coffee chain in China.

This year, it plans to enter the American market with a new location in New York City.

The chain's pricing model includes coffee priced at around $2 to $3 per cup in the U.S., significantly undercutting Starbucks, which typically charges $6 to $7 in New York.

In January, Starbucks reported another decline in sales between October and December.

It was the company's fourth consecutive quarter of losses.

Luckin has expanded rapidly, growing from 10,000 stores just two years ago to 22,340 locations.

It currently outnumbers Starbucks in China three to one.

The chain's success has been driven by its extremely low prices and a mobile-first ordering system.

Luckin CEO Jinyi Guo recently told investors that the company is adopting ""flexible and tailored operational models to build our overseas experience.""

As Luckin prepares to enter the U.S. market, Starbucks is looking to correct past mistakes.

STARBUCKS CHALLENGES

The Seattle-based coffee giant recently appointed Brian Niccol, the former CEO of Chipotle, as its new leader.

Niccol has made sweeping changes, stating that Starbucks must ""fundamentally change"" its approach.

His reforms have included cutting several drinks from the menu and laying off more than 1,000 employees.

Niccol also reintroduced ceramic cups for in-store orders, hoping to encourage customers to spend more time in cafés and make additional purchases throughout the day.

According to a Q4 earnings call, Starbucks' same-store sales dropped by 4 percent, driven by a 6 percent decrease in in-store orders.

However, Starbucks’ stock has risen by about 7 percent this year, defying broader market trends, as the Nasdaq index has fallen over 8 percent since January.

LUCKIN ON THE RISE

Despite its rapid expansion, Luckin has had its share of challenges.

Founded in 2017, the company quickly rose to prominence, went public, and then collapsed in a massive fraud scandal.

Chinese regulators discovered that company executives had falsified approximately $300 million in sales, which led to its downfall.

But since emerging from bankruptcy in 2022 under new leadership, Luckin has significantly scaled its operations in China.

Since mid-2023, the company has been launching an average of 16 new locations every day.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/SC-Starbucks-Policy-Breaker-OP-copy.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-20 15:04:51.837480

It was clear in December that 2024 had been a hard year for many restaurant brands, which struggled from traffic declines, unit closures and outright bankruptcy. As chains reported their earnings for the last quarter of 2024 earlier this year, it became clear that those trends hadn’t changed. The environment may worsen as economic uncertainty — fueled by a waffling tariff policy, mass layoffs and government spending cuts of dubious legality — ramps up.

But even as trouble looms, a number of brands were able to win by exploiting consumer desire for strong value propositions, high-quality ingredients and experiential dining. The winners of this earnings season, generally, were brands that already did well. The losers too were no surprise, as turnarounds at chains like Applebee’s and Starbucks have yet to produce major shifts in consumer behavior.

Restaurant Dive identified three winning and three losing brands from publicly traded restaurant firms, based largely on same-store sales performance and the sense of momentum conveyed by earnings calls and analyst research notes.

Winners:

Texas Roadhouse

The steakhouse brand closed out a strong 2024 with 7.7% same-store sales growth at company restaurants and 6.3% at franchised locations in Q4, according to its earnings release. The brand also opened 14 restaurants in the quarter. Average weekly sales at company restaurants hit $153,867 — equivalent to an annualized $8 million sales volume in a 52-week year.

Looking forward, CEO Gerald Morgan said value would remain paramount for consumers in 2025, and the brand would take a measured approach to pricing, raising menu prices 1.4% in Q2 2025, according to an earnings call transcript.

As consumers seek alternatives to alcohol, Texas Roadhouse is addingseveral mocktails to its menu, Morgan said, and early results have been positive.

The chain is also continuing its tech deployments, Morgan said.

“We expect to complete the conversions of all locations to a digital kitchen by the end of the year,” Morgan told analysts.“These conversions are creating a more efficient kitchen and a less stressful environment for our Roadies.”

The chain will also continue upgrades to its guest management system used at the host stand, allowing employees to better predict wait times and improve seating.

Chili’s

Brinker’s fiscal Q2 2025 saw strong same-store sales growth for the casual dining chain: 31.4%, a staggering jump.

That increase was driven by the brand’s laser focus on value, as the brand marketed its Triple Dipper menu. But menu changes have played a role too. Brinker CEO Kevin Hochman said the chain has trimmed SKUs and raised the quality of a number of its ingredients.

“Fiscal year-to-date, we've been able to remove 13 menu items, 12 pantry SKUs and several prep sets, and we've reinvested time in doing fewer things a whole lot better,” Hochman said on the company’s earnings call. Other changes include guacamole made in-house, crispier bacon and chicken wings and higher-quality chicken breast.

But the brand isn’t resting on its laurels. Chili’s is working on a new prototype and will remodel about 200 targeted stores, some of which haven’t been updated since the 20th century.

Brinker CFO Mika Ware said the chain was “ramping up with the new prototype design, which will then lead us to our new reimage design,” and that atmosphere was a vital consideration. Chili’s emphasis on atmosphere, mentioned in the earnings call 11 times by Hochman and Ware, could signal the brand — like others in the restaurant industry — is looking to prioritize on-premise experience.

Cava

Cava has been growing rapidly since it went public in mid-2023, and that development continued in Q4 2024, with another quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth. The Mediterranean fast casual brand saw most of its sales increase come from rising traffic, a good sign for the brand, which saw its average unit volume rise from $2.6 million in late 2023 to $2.9 million in 2024, according to its most recent earnings call.

That strength is helping the brand enter new markets; just this week, Cava opened its first location in Indiana as part of its expansion into city markets throughout the Midwest.

Another winning factor has been the chain’s restrained approach to pricing. In January, Cava implemented 1.7% price increases on in-restaurant menus, and plans no further increases, CFO Tricia Tolivar said on its earnings call. In February 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food-away-from-home prices were 3.7% higher than in 2024.

Menu innovation helped Cava, too.

“Guest reception of grilled steak, which we introduced in the summer of 2024, exceeded our expectations, and incidence of this new main has remained strong,” CEO Brett Schulman said on the earnings call.

Losers:

Dine Brands

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a casual dining brand in possession of a shrinking store base must be in want of a turnaround plan.

Applebee’s has seen its same-store sales fall for seven quarters and its store base has eroded in recent years, down to 1,501 stores at the end of 2024 from 1,578 in 2021. Further losses are projected in 2025.

Dine has done what it can for the neighborhood bar and grill brand, with the Really Big Meal Deal driving some sales momentum, but not enough to overcome eroding spending by consumers making less than $75,000 a year. This demographic comprises two-thirds of Dine’s customer base, CEO John Peyton said on the company’s most recent earnings call. Because of this, Applebee’s has been unable to replicate the smashing success of Chili’s value plays, though Dine is set to launch a new value platform in the second half of 2025.

Then there’s the turnaround plan: Dine is launching a renovation drive at Applebee’s starting with 30 units the company acquired from a franchisee last year. Dual-branding with IHOP in new units could also help produce sales lifts for the chain.

IHOP, which outperformed Applebee’s for several quarters, has joined its sister brand in misery with four quarters of slipping comps and projected flat unit growth. In Q4, the chain had -2.8% same-store sales growth, its worst performance in years. Still, traffic improved over Q3 “primarily driven by the launch of our House Faves value menu,” Peyton said, accompanied by advertising that highlights the pricing and value of core breakfast items.

Starbucks

Six months in and Brian Niccol’s bold plan to remake Starbucks has yet to end its traffic problem. The brand saw an 8% traffic drop in North America during fiscal Q1 2025, offset by pricing action.

Yet the brand has made a number of changes Niccol said were vital: significant increases in advertising spend, in-store ceramic mugs, the return of the coffee condiment bar.

Starbucks also reduced the number of discounted orders by nearly 40% as it shifts away from a discounting strategy that may have hurt its brand positioning. The chain is working to cut roughly 30% of its menu, though significant customization may undercut the expected operational benefits of menu reduction.

More than 1,000 corporate Starbucks workers lost their jobs in February — 6.9% of its non-retail workforce — as corporate leadership moved to simplify structure.

The results of the coffee chain’s ad campaigns won’t be evident until the next round of earnings calls, but Starbucks has had a run of acute difficulty stretching back more than a year. With such a protracted slump, recovery will take time. It’s possible the changes Niccol has made will put Starbucks back in the winners category, but they didn’t this earnings season.

Pizza Hut and KFC

A notable absence from the winners are QSRs in general, and Yum Brands in particular. While Taco Bell turned in respectable same-store sales growth, the fast food conglomerate struggled in its home market.

KFC posted its fourth-consecutive quarter of same-store sales declines, with sales down 5% year over year. Despite efforts to turnaround sales at the brand, KFC has remained stagnant; Q4 was its sixth quarter without same-store sales growth in the U.S. KFC has been unable to find an effective value strategy, despite long running value meal promotions.

Yum is implementing a series of changes intended to strengthen the brand, promoting its chief marketing officer to president and shifting Scott Mezvinsky from Taco Bell’s presidency to KFC’s CEO post.

Pizza Hut likewise had trouble, with a 2% drop in same-store sales. But while chicken chains like Popeyes, Raising Cane’s and Chick-fil-A are challenging KFC, Pizza Hut’s brand competitors also saw disappointing sales, with Papa Johns’ sales down 4% and Domino’s same-store sales nearly flat.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/MvA7u9Bi8TphK2zV-Aq72ywa4DcWLxpNc3c3E47hDIs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CaWdfU21hc2hlcl9QUl9TdGlsbF9Ob19TdXBlcnMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-03-20 13:05:43.771226

This decision has left Albertsons in a difficult position, but the company hasn't remained idle. Instead of lamenting, it has decided to take swift action to adapt to market challenges.

One of the most notable steps has been the improvement of its website. Albertsons has updated its online platform to offer a smoother and more convenient experience to its customers. With this change, the company seeks to remain competitive and meet the growing demands of consumers in the digital world.

| Albertsons

Albertsons's website has been revamped to facilitate shopping and enhance customer interaction. One of the most outstanding features is the ability to create personalized shopping lists.

Users can organize their shopping efficiently, whether by week or specific needs. Additionally, the function allows for real-time adjustments, making the experience much more flexible.

Albertsons has also optimized its platform to improve the online shopping experience. Consumers can now navigate the site more easily, select products, and place orders without hassle. Additionally, home delivery is more accessible, allowing users to receive their products directly at their doorstep.

Improved Rewards Management

Another key improvement is rewards management. Albertsons has simplified this process, allowing customers to access their points, discounts, and promotions quickly and easily.

Now, shoppers can see available offers and their accumulated benefits in real-time. This enhances the shopping experience and encourages brand loyalty.

This improved rewards system is designed to bring customers back, offering them attractive incentives that can be leveraged in future purchases. All of this is managed from a single account, making rewards management easier and saving users time.

Promotion of Albertsons's Health and Wellness

Albertsons has recognized the growing consumer interest in healthy products. In response, it has incorporated health and wellness-related content on its website.

Users can now access recommendations on organic, gluten-free, and low-sugar products, among others. The company also offers information on balanced diets and healthy recipes.

This focus on health is a key strategy to differentiate Albertsons from its competitors. Additionally, the company shows its commitment to the well-being of its customers by providing tools and options to improve their lifestyle.

Response to the Merger Cancellation

Although the merger with Kroger didn't go as desired, Albertsons hasn't stopped. The company has decided to move forward and improve its digital platform. With these updates, it seeks to strengthen its relationship with customers and remain competitive in a rapidly changing market.

The improvement of its website and digital services shows that Albertsons is willing to innovate, adapt, and offer consumers a more convenient shopping experience.

Nike has already made strides in winning back market share and growing its female customer base, a key component to boosting revenue and apparel sales.","Nike will report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday and provide updates on its turnaround plan as it navigates new tariffs and soft consumer spending.

Here's what analysts are expecting from the world's largest sneaker company, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:

Earnings per share: 29 cents

Revenue: $11.01 billion

Expectations are low for Nike as it works to implement a turnaround under its new CEO Elliott Hill. Margins could face pressure as Nike moves to clear out old merchandise in favor of new, innovative styles and reset its relationship with wholesalers. The company is also contending with a new set of dynamics that could make its comeback even harder to execute.

Since Nike last reported earnings in December, President Donald Trump has put a new 20% tariff on goods imported from China, consumer sentiment has fallen, and retail sales in both January and February were weaker than expected.

Out of the hundreds of suppliers and manufacturers that Nike works with, about 24% of them are located in China, according to a manufacturing disclosure published in January. If the retailer doesn't raise prices to offset tariffs and can't push the cost entirely on to suppliers, Nike's margins are expected to take a hit from the new duties.

Further, when consumers aren't feeling confident and cutting back on spending, discretionary products like new clothes and shoes are one of the first things they cut out in favor of necessities. Over the last few years, the overall sneaker and apparel markets have been slow because consumers have cut back on clothes and shoes. But up until recently, strong companies were still performing well and taking market share from weaker competitors.

However, that trend began to shift over the last few weeks when even the strongest of companies started to sound the alarm about soft consumer spending when they reported first-quarter earnings, raising questions about the health of the economy.

Nike is widely expected to reclaim the market share it lost and reset its business, and some insiders say the company's problems have been overblown. Even so, the tariffs and economic fears could mean that the retailer's turnaround could take longer, and be more difficult, than expected.

Nike has already made strides in winning back market share and growing its female customer base, a key component to boosting revenue and apparel sales. Last month, it announced it was teaming up with Kim Kardashian's intimates brand Skims to create a new product line dubbed NikeSKIMS that will include apparel, footwear and accessories. The buzzy partnership is expected to give Nike improved inroads with women and allow it to better compete with Lululemon, Alo Yoga and Vuori, which cater more to women than Nike currently does.

Further, Nike debuted a new ad campaign geared toward female athletes during the Super Bowl, its first big game advertisement in decades. The campaign showed that reaching female athletes and capturing the buzz around women's sports will be a center point of Hill's strategy.

When Nike hosts its earnings call at 5 p.m. ET, analysts and investors will want to know how new product launches are faring as the company restarts its innovation engine. Some analysts say clues into the product pipeline will be the most important detail to listen for during the call because Nike's ability to innovate and put out the best products in the industry is what made it the market leader in athletic apparel and shoes.

If it can show positive signs from new product launches, the rest of its headwinds might just be drowned out as noise.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108077585-1734535741032-gettyimages-2188445202-img_1635_belsnmkl.jpeg?v=1734535821&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-03-20 14:02:16.450744

Recent footfall data reveals a sector buzzing with activity and significant growth potential. Burgers dominate, capturing over a third of all foot traffic in Irish chains, a trend reinforced by a robust 7.8% increase in traffic between 2023 and 2024.

Coffee and pizza shops follow, but the data reveals a deeper story: a 5% surge in overall fast-food visits in Ireland during Q4, 2024 compared to the previous year. This growth signifies increased customer frequency, with burger and pizza categories showing a 2% or greater like-for-like (L4L) growth per store.

This Irish appetite for fast food sharply contrasts with the UK, where the sector stagnated in 2024 and experienced L4L sales declines. This divergence is likely due to Ireland's stronger consumer spending, which rose 4% compared to the UK's 1%, according to Trading Economics.

This economic buoyancy fuels Ireland's quick-service dining sector.

While burgers and pizza drive the most growth, other segments, including chicken, bakery/sandwich, and ethnic cuisines, also contribute to the sector's overall expansion.

This dynamic landscape presents both opportunities and challenges. The growing burger segment and the emerging potential of chicken chains offer fertile ground for innovation. However, success depends on understanding evolving consumer behaviour and traffic patterns. As

The Shanghai-based company posted revenues of 110 billion yuan ($15 billion) in the three months to December 31, up 24 percent year-on-year.

The figure was down on the 44 percent growth recorded in the third quarter, continuing a slowdown following 86 percent growth in the second quarter and a 131 percent surge at the start of 2024.

As owner of overseas e-commerce platform Temu, PDD Holdings is expected to face further challenges as US levies against Chinese goods begin to bite.

US President Donald Trump this month doubled a blanket tariff on all Chinese imports from 10 to 20 percent.

The order came after Trump in February scrapped a customs exemption for goods valued under $800, long a vital part of the business model supporting platforms offering low-cost goods like Temu and rival Shein.

The companies send out tens of billions of dollars worth of clothes, gadgets and other items from their vast network of factories in China annually.

Since its September 2022 launch, Temu has become one of the most widely used online shopping sites in the United States.

PDD Holdings executives on Thursday remained optimistic in the health of its online mega-shops.

""Looking ahead, we will continue to prioritize investments in the platform ecosystem as the cornerstone of our long-term value creation strategy"", the company's vice president of finance, Jun Liu, said in a statement.

The firm reported net income of 27.4 billion yuan in the fourth quarter, up 18 percent compared to a year prior.

The results came in short of forecasts, causing US shares to fall 3.3 percent in pre-market trading, Bloomberg reported.

PDD Holdings also owns one of China's leading online retailers -- Pinduoduo -- which has achieved success in part by reaching consumers in rural areas with a diverse offering of low-cost products.

The filings of Chinese e-commerce firms have been closely watched by analysts and investors for signs of a resurgence in China's consumer spending.

The stock hit a record high of $179.10/share in 2021 and is currently trading near $72. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting:

Earnings Preview

The company is expected to report a gain of $0.28/share on $11.12 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $0.33/share. The Whisper number is the Street’s unofficial view on earnings.

A Closer Look At The Fundamentals

The company has seen up and down earnings over the last few years. In 2020, the company made $1.84/share. In 2021, earnings jumped to $3.56. Then, earnings came in at $3.75 in 2022. Then, earnings slid to $3.23 in 2023. In 2024, earnings grew to $3.95 and are expected to come in at $2.08 in 2025 and $2.36 in 2026. The stock sports a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 21 which is lower than the benchmark S&P 500.

A Closer Look At The Technicals

Technically, the stock is in a long downtrend and not acting very well. The stock is trading below its 50-day moving average line (DMA) and below its longer-term 200-day moving average line which are both not healthy signs.

Company History

Nike, originally founded as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS) on January 25, 1964, began as a small operation in Eugene, Oregon. Phil Knight, a track athlete at the University of Oregon, and his coach Bill Bowerman teamed up to import high-quality running shoes from Japan’s Onitsuka Tiger (now Asics) to sell in the U.S. market. Knight sold these shoes out of his car at track meets, while Bowerman contributed his expertise by experimenting with innovative shoe designs.

By 1966, BRS had opened its first retail store in Santa Monica, California, and expanded operations to the East Coast. However, disagreements with Onitsuka Tiger led the company to rebrand as Nike in 1971, adopting the now-iconic Swoosh logo designed by Carolyn Davidson.

The launch of Nike marked a turning point for the company. In 1972, Nike introduced its first original shoe featuring Bowerman's revolutionary ""waffle sole,"" inspired by a waffle iron, which enhanced traction and durability. The company gained momentum throughout the 1970s and introduced its patented Air technology in 1979, setting it apart from competitors.

The 1980s solidified Nike's dominance with high-profile endorsements, most notably Michael Jordan in 1984. The Air Jordan line became a cultural phenomenon, blending performance and style.

Nike also debuted its ""Just Do It"" slogan in 1988, further embedding itself into popular culture and sports. Today, Nike is a global leader in sportswear and innovation, headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. It has expanded beyond footwear into apparel, equipment, and digital technology like Nike+, which integrates fitness tracking with wearable devices.

With a focus on sustainability through initiatives like Flyknit technology and recycled materials, Nike continues to adapt to modern demands while maintaining its legacy as a brand synonymous with athletic excellence and innovation.

It’s the latest consumer food company to lower its sales outlook for the year. Campbell’s and Kraft Heinz expect business to slow down, as well. All this comes as some consumers continue to pull back on grocery store spending.

Inflation over the past couple of years has made trips to the grocery store a lot harder for many Americans — and a lot of folks expect prices will keep going up.

That’s influencing the choices they make when they shop for food, according to Ed Johnson, who focuses on consumer industries at Deloitte.

“The places where we’re seeing that choice manifest is only buying essentials, right, so maybe that’s — think about categories in the grocery store that are maybe seen as simple indulgences or as nice to haves,” he said.

So things like snacks or soda — some shoppers are skipping those, he said. Or they’re trading down from name brands to generic versions.

But those store brands aren’t immune either, cautioned executive editor of Supermarket News Chloe Riley. That’s because lower-income consumers are getting pinched by rising prices for basics like coffee and eggs.

“Consumers are cutting out even many of the cheaper items as well,” she said.

All these consumer choices are trickling up to corporate offices, per Craig Rowley, who consults with retail companies at Korn Ferry. He said that his clients are starting to ask, “What do our expenses look like? If our sales are going to be a little bit slight, what can we do to reduce our expenses?”

They could cancel planned investments, leave open jobs unfilled or even lay off workers. Rowley added that his clients aren’t making any of those moves just yet, but they are exploring their options.",https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2199176008-e1742439227209.jpg?w=1200,N,,2025-03-20 10:01:04.746572

The federal government isn’t even immune to these layoffs.

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who runs the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have been shrinking the federal government in an effort to “enhance accountability, reduce waste, and promote innovation,"" according to a Feb. 19 executive order signed by Trump.

Their controversial efforts have resulted in over 36,000 government employees being laid off by DOGE and over 113,000 federal departures, according to recent data from Layoffs.fyi.

Just last month alone, employers based in the U.S. announced 172,017 job cuts, a 103% increase from the number of job cuts announced in February last year, according to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

It is also the highest number of job cuts announced in any February since 2009.

As layoffs in corporate America continue to affect employees, employers are rethinking their workplace cultures.

Here are some of the top workplace news stories over the last two weeks that highlight the current state of corporate America.

Starbucks CEO says employees need to step it up

Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Brian Niccol has high expectations for employees after the company laid off 1,100 corporate employees worldwide last month and paused hiring for hundreds of open positions.

According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, Niccol told employees during an internal forum at Starbucks’ headquarters that they needed to adjust their decision-making process.

“We’re not effective on how things get to the store, and we’re not effective in making decisions and then holding each other accountable to those decisions,” said Niccol. “This is why we had to make the changes that we had to make.”

As Starbucks is facing declining sales, Niccol emphasized that stores need to show improvement to prevent future job cuts.

“We own whether or not this place grows,” he said.

He also highlighted that teams need to be more diligent in addressing customer complaints.

“We have way too many follow-up meetings to fix way too many surprises,” said Niccol. “We’ve got to stop it.”

Bank of America cracks down on overwork

While Starbucks is pushing employees to step their game up, Bank of America (BAC) is taking an extra step to make sure its employees aren’t overworking themselves.

According to a recent report from the Journal, Bank of America now requires its senior bankers to ensure that junior bankers aren’t working hours exceeding the company’s limits.

The company is also allegedly exploring different options to lighten the workloads of its junior bankers. One option is using artificial intelligence to assist in completing tasks such as preparing financial forecasts and pitch decks.

The move from Bank of America comes after it suffered backlash when its employee, Leo Lukenas III, who was 35 years old, died of a blood clot in his heart last year after working 100-hour workweeks at the company.

A few months after his death, the Journal found through an investigation that Bank of America employees often pull all-nighters working on projects, and some managers even instruct employees to lie about their work hours to avoid facing scrutiny from Human Resources.

Meta has a sneaky way of blocking employees from being rehired

If you’ve ever been laid off or fired from Meta (META) , and you’ve wondered why rejoining the tech giant has been impossible, you may be on a secret blocklist.

A recent report from Business Insider revealed that Meta secretly keeps blocklists that contain a list of former fired or laid-off employees who are not eligible for rehire, despite previously having a history of good performance at the company.

The blocklists don’t just apply to workers who have violated the company’s workplace policies or performed poorly, according to Insider.

""If a manager didn't like you, it wasn't hard to put someone on a list,"" said one former manager at Meta who spoke to Insider.

Allegedly, a manager can simply put an employee on a blocklist by filling out a form within minutes, and it is apparently extremely difficult for a former employee to get off of it.

In a statement to Insider, a Meta spokesperson said there are several reasons why a former employee may not be eligible for rehire.

""We determine, at the time of separation, the reason for the employee's departure — policy violation, performance termination, voluntary resignation, etc. — and that, along with the last rating prior to separation and any other recent performance signals, determines whether an employee is eligible for rehire or not,"" said the spokesperson.

Jamie Dimon fires back at return-to-office complaints … again

JPMorgan Chase (^JJQ) CEO Jamie Dimon is still irked by complaints over the company’s new return-to-office mandate, which went into effect this month. The new mandate requires employees to work in the office five days a week, which has heightened tensions at the company.

During a company town hall meeting last month, Dimon doubled down on the mandate (in a foul-mouthed rant) and said that employees should not be mad at him about it since they have the option to quit working for JPMorgan.

In a recent interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Dimon, once again, addressed the controversy. He told students that the “people in the middle” are often complaining about return-to-office mandates.

He also seemingly highlighted that during the COVID-19 pandemic, most Americans were working in person.

The Fed signaled that it will stick to a wait-and-see approach to further policy moves, as uncertainty around the effects of President Donald Trump’s tariffs clouds the wider economic outlook. Meanwhile, quarterly earnings from a range of companies, including FedEx (NYSE: ) and Nike (NYSE: ), are due out, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) CEO Jensen Huang tells the Financial Times that the semiconductor titan will shell out hundreds of billions of dollars on U.S.-made chips over the next four years.

1. Fed decision

The Federal Reserve chose to leave interest rates unchanged as expected at its latest policy meeting, noting that it will take a cautious approach to future decisions due to uncertainty around President Trump’s tariff plans.

The comments reiterated a wait-and-see attitude the central bank adopted earlier this year as policymakers fret about the potential impact of the levies on inflation and the broader economy.

The Fed slashed its 2025 growth projection and flagged that the tariff turmoil was starting to increase wider uncertainty.

“Inflation has started to move up,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, warning that “there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.”

Still, the Fed chose not to price in a prolonged surge in prices or a slowdown in growth. Powell also stressed that the outcome of Trump’s tariffs remains murky, suggesting that officials will likely move to calibrate monetary policy based on the impact of the trade tensions.

2. Futures lower

U.S. stock futures pointed lower on Thursday, reversing earlier gains, with markets gauging the Fed’s cautious policy stance.

By 06:38 ET (10:38 GMT), the contract had decreased by 257 points or 0.6%, had fallen by 42 points or 0.7%, and had ticked down by 167 points or 0.8%.

The main averages rose in the prior session, as traders lifted their bets for Fed interest rate cuts this year. Investors are now pricing in 68 basis points worth of reductions, up from 56 basis points — or about two quarter-point drawdowns — ahead of the Fed’s announcement.

The Fed also moved to slow down the pace of a drive to shrink the size of its balance sheet, which analysts interpreted as a sign that the central bank is keen to maintain market stability.

However, stocks have yet to claw back recent losses that were sparked by Trump’s tariff threats. The has shed 8% over the past month, and has erased all the gains it notched shortly after Trump was elected to a second term in the White House in November. The spreads between corporate and Treasury bond yields has widened as well, in an indication of the concerns markets have around the tariffs.

3. FedEx, Micron, Nike earnings ahead

On the earnings calendar, investors will have the chance to parse through quarterly results from a range of companies, including logistics group FedEx, chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ: ) and shoe seller Nike.

For FedEx, investors will be on the lookout for any commentary around the state of the U.S. and how it could hit revenue, analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.”

Micron, meanwhile, could provide a fresh glimpse into demand for its artificial intelligence data center chips, although concerns have swirled around its processors for consumer-centric products like personal computers and smartphones.

Fears over a tariff-driven downturn in consumer sentiment and rising inflation expectations have threatened sentiment around Nike, while the sportswear retailer is seen posting its steepest quarterly drop in revenue in almost five years, according to industry data cited by Reuters.

4. Nvidia CEO speaks on U.S. spending plans

Nvidia will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on U.S.-made chips and electronics components over the next four years, CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview with the Financial Times.

Huang said Nvidia will procure “probably half a trillion dollars worth of electronics in total” over the next four years, and that the company sees itself manufacturing “several hundred billion of it here in the U.S.""

Huang told the FT that Nvidia was now able to manufacture its latest systems through U.S. suppliers such as TSMC and Foxconn (SS: ), and that he saw a growing competitive threat from Chinese electronics giant Huawei.

His comments mirror commitments from several other major tech CEOs to spend more money in the United States. Earlier in March, Apple (NASDAQ: ) had vowed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster its U.S. operations.

5. Gold touches record high

Gold prices rose to record highs on Thursday, benefiting from a softer dollar after the Fed signaled at least two more interest rate cuts this year.

The yellow metal extended a run of recent gains, as it continued to receive a boost from heightened safe haven demand due to the collapse of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, roller-coaster Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, and increased uncertainty over the U.S. economy under Trump.

Richard Haigh, managing director, Brand Finance, said: “Many restaurants have increased prices over the past few years in response to the pandemic, inflation, and supply chain disruptions.

Starbucks contests a debated $50 million verdict awarded in California over hot beverage burns, sparking intense public and legal debate.

Growing national concern over increasingly large punitive damages raises critical questions about fairness, jury impartiality, and broader economic implications.

By Samuel A. Lopez – USA Herald

The American justice system delivered two dramatic and controversial verdicts recently, placing major corporate defendants Ford Motor Company and Starbucks Coffee Company at the center of heated discussions around punitive damages, jury impartiality, and economic fairness.

In an unprecedented courtroom outcome, Ford Motor Co. was slapped with a staggering $2.5 billion punitive damages verdict in a high-stakes wrongful death case involving a tragic rollover crash. Herman and Debra Mills lost their lives in 2022 when their Ford F-250 Super Duty truck rolled over, with jurors deciding the truck’s roof was defectively designed, leading to fatal injuries.

Ford immediately mounted an appeal, arguing significant jury misconduct had prejudiced the trial. The automaker claims that jurors improperly considered a prior, now-vacated $1.7 billion verdict from a similar rollover incident, despite explicit court instructions to disregard it. Ford presented compelling evidence, including juror testimonies revealing that discussion of the previous case significantly impacted deliberations.

According to court documents, “Juror 36” explicitly stated that knowledge of the earlier verdict unquestionably influenced the jury’s punitive decision. Another juror corroborated this claim, prompting Ford to demand either a retrial or a substantial reduction in damages. Ford argued that scientific evidence clearly demonstrated the Mills’ deaths resulted primarily from the frontal collision impact, not from roof failure.

Legal experts have emphasized the difficulty of Ford’s challenge. Georgia appellate attorney Scott Key commented, “While Ford has a strong factual basis for appeal, proving juror misconduct is extremely challenging, particularly due to the confidential nature of jury deliberations.”

Legal analyst Madeline Summerville added that Ford faces a significant hurdle: “Courts rarely penetrate jury deliberations unless clear misconduct can be conclusively proven. This appeal could set important precedents regarding how juries deliberate and the limits of punitive damages.”

Meanwhile, Starbucks confronts a controversial $50 million verdict awarded to Mr. Garcia, a delivery driver severely burned by hot tea spilled at a Starbucks drive-through in Los Angeles. Despite Starbucks proposing a settlement of $7.5 to $10 million, the jury awarded damages far exceeding expectations.

My initial reporting ignited significant public outcry questioning the scale of this award. Comments from readers frequently expressed disbelief, with one particularly vocal observer stating, “What? Did he lose a limb or something?”Critics widely described the $50 million verdict as disproportionate, labeling it “outrageous” and detrimental to businesses at large.

At trial, Starbucks contended that Garcia’s complications were heavily influenced by his pre-existing diabetic condition. Yet, jurors held Starbucks entirely liable.

Jaci Anderson, Director of Corporate Communications for Starbucks Coffee Company, reached out to USA Herald, providing the following statement:

“We sympathize with Mr. Garcia, but we disagree with the jury’s decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive. We plan to appeal. We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks.”

Both Starbucks and Ford’s cases underscore a critical national debate about the appropriateness of punitive damage awards. Legal and economic analysts alike express concerns over increasingly large jury awards, cautioning they may inadvertently cause economic harm, reduce corporate investment, and increase operational costs—ultimately passed onto consumers.

“Punitive damages should deter irresponsible corporate conduct but not jeopardize economic stability,” explained Scott Key. “These massive awards, if unchecked, may discourage innovation and growth, harming businesses and consumers alike.”

As courts deliberate these pivotal cases, their outcomes will reverberate far beyond their immediate circumstances, reshaping how American businesses operate and how jurors approach their profound responsibilities.

In a preview of Interpublic’s first-quarter financial results, Nomura Securities analyst Michael Nathanson is calling the company’s performance -- based on his research -- just “so-so” and is maintaining his “neutral” rating on the firm. The company will release its first-quarter results Thursday.

Nathanson predicts that IPG’s organic revenue growth for the quarter will be reported at just 2.6% -- below that of competitors. Omnicom Group for example, said its first-quarter organic growth rose 5.1%, Publicis Groupe and Havas reported comparable growth of 4.1% and 3.5%, respectively.

Nathanson also forecast an organic revenue decline of 2% for the company in the U.S., due to client losses including Microsoft and S.C. Johnson.

“While we don’t dislike IPG, we think its model is not optimal at this point of the business cycle,” Nathanson stated in a note to clients.

Predicting lower growth for the company in 2012 isn’t that tough a task. Earlier this year, IPG CEO Michael Roth said the company was targeting about 3% organic growth for the full year -- about half what it achieved in 2011. Roth said the slowing growth was due to lingering clouds over the macro economy -- particularly in Europe, the company’s poorest-performing geographic sector last year. He added that the company isn’t counting on a rebound in the region this year.

In its preview, stock analyst firm Zacks reported that it was “cautious on the upcoming [IPG] results, based on intense pricing pressures witnessed worldwide in a fiercely competitive ad world.”

The firm also noted that “fluctuating global [Gross Domestic Product] tainted with rigorous client spending cuts as well as rising operating expense may lead to uncertainty.”

Longer term, however, Zacks noted: ""We are likely to see impressive results from the company’s new business investments in the upcoming quarters.” The company said it was maintaining its “long-term Outperform” recommendation on IPG for now.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.mediapost.com/publications/images/mp-logo-fb.jpg,N,,2025-03-20 07:59:58.401014

The Oregon-based company that also makes athletic apparel has announced the departure of its top strategy and communications executives. This development adds to a series of leadership changes that have occurred since CEO Elliott Hill assumed the top role at the company last year.

Daniel Heaf, the Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer, is leaving the company after management decided to eliminate his role. The teams that were under his supervision will now be integrated into Nike’s finance department.

Internal Upheaval

Additionally, Nike’s Chief Communications Officer KeJuan Wilkins is leaving the company. Wilkins, who has been with Nike for nearly 20 years, was promoted to his current position in 2023 under previous CEO John Donahoe. A successor for Wilkins was not immediately announced by Nike.

The management changes at Nike come as Hill tries to turnaround the struggling retailer, which has seen its share price decline sharply since the Coivd-19 pandemic struck five years ago. Hill has said that his focus is on reviving Nike’s innovation pipeline and resetting its relationships with wholesalers. He has also pulled back on several of the company’s key sneakers, including the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1.

NKE stock has declined 3% this year and is near a 52-week low. The company is scheduled to report its latest financial results on March 20.

Is NKE Stock a Buy?

Nike’s stock has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 29 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 16 Buy and 13 Hold recommendations issued in the past three months. The average NKE price target of $87.62 implies 20.04% upside from current levels.

Despite Nike’s challenges in North America, Citi said the brand is still perceived as the “Most Innovative” brand, followed by Adidas, which gained ground on Nike relative to its December survey.
“Nike outranked Adidas (again) in terms of intent to purchase; however, Adidas continued to outrank Nike in terms of NPS.
Our survey results indicate the Jordan brand remains weak in China (similar to December).” Europe Summary In Europe, Nike retook the No.
1 spot in Net Promoter Score, and Nike continued to score slightly better than Adidas in intent to purchase.","Citi Research released its quarterly Global Sporting Goods Survey last week to assess the overall market with a close eye on perceptions of the Nike and Jordan brands. The company surveyed 1,600 North American consumers, 1,000 Chinese consumers and 900 European consumers in early to mid-February to gauge the momentum of many Western and Chinese brands in North America, Greater China and Europe (UK, France and Germany).

North America Summary

In North America, Citi found that the macro/promotional environment looks very similar to previous quarters, suggesting the overall athletic/active environment is still promotional but does not appear to be improving or degrading from past quarters. The firm pointed out that the survey timing was before most of the tariff and layoff talks increased in the media.

Citi noted that its February survey results indicated that Nike remains top-of-mind with the consumer, getting top ranks in Net Promoter Score (NPS) and intent to purchase. As expected, Nike was followed closely by Adidas in the No. 2 spot, moving up from the No. 4 in December. Despite Nike’s challenges in North America, Citi said the brand is still perceived as the “Most Innovative” brand, followed by Adidas, which gained ground on Nike relative to its December survey.

Citi said brand perception is evaluated best with the Net Promoter Score (NPS) it established, which is the difference between respondents who would recommend a given brand to their friends and family and those who would not recommend a given brand to their friends and family. Citi noted that it only includes scores from survey participants who recently purchased from the brands. A positive NPS score means that more respondents would recommend a particular brand to their friends and family versus respondents who would not recommend a brand to their friends and family.

The February survey saw Nike retaining the highest NPS of all the brands surveyed at +43 in February (vs. +46 in December), followed by Adidas in the No.2 spot (up from No. 4 spot in December) at +36 (vs. +39 in December) and New Balance at +34 (vs. +30 in December). Lululemon took the No. 4 spot (from the No. 7 spot in December) at +34 (vs. +25 in December). Hoka’s NPS was +24 in February, up from +17 in December. On Running’s NPS was +5 in February vs. +16 in December.

“Intent to Purchase” is another key brand strength and perception indicator. Surveyed respondents, when asked which athletic brand they considered purchasing next, Nike again topped the list. Twenty-six percent of respondents in February said they planned to buy Nike, down slightly from 29 percent in December. Adidas was next at 18 percent (up from 12 percent in December), followed by New Balance at 9 percent (down slightly from 10 percent in December). Hoka was at 1 percent in February (down from 3 percent in December), and On was at 1 percent in February (in line with December), suggesting that most survey respondents still do not consider these growing brands highly.

In “Most Innovative,” Nike again took the No. 1 spot at 25 percent, down from 28 percent in December, and is still “significantly above” Adidas in the No. 2 spot at 11 percent, followed by New Balance at 10 percent and Under Armour at 8 percent (vs. 9 percent in December). Adidas and New Balance were both flat to their December by respondents.

“On the earnings call, we don’t expect to hear a major revelation on product, but we will listen for early product wins, whether it’s in running with the Vomero 18 or Pegasus Premium, or basketball,” BofA wrote in its note. “Signs of product wins will be the singular most important catalyst to reengage investors on the stock, in our view.”

China Summary

In China, Citi said its survey results suggest the region remains very promotional, consistent with past quarters, and the macro environment appears stable relative to the firm’s December survey.

In Citi’s February survey, 55 percent of Chinese respondents said they expect their disposable income to get somewhat or significantly better over the next 12 months relative to today, which is down from the 72 percent of respondents that answered that way in December but higher than 45 percent who provided that response in Citi’s September survey.

“While Nike and Adidas ranked in the top spots in terms of NPS and intent to purchase, we saw both Anta and Li Ning regain ground, sitting in the No. 3 and No. 4 spots, respectively,” Citi wrote in its summary. “Nike outranked Adidas (again) in terms of intent to purchase; however, Adidas continued to outrank Nike in terms of NPS. Our survey results indicate the Jordan brand remains weak in China (similar to December).”

Europe Summary

In Europe, Nike retook the No. 1 spot in Net Promoter Score, and Nike continued to score slightly better than Adidas in intent to purchase. Nike continued to rank the highest among European respondents who perceived the brand as “Most Innovative.” Citi said Europe’s macro/promotional environment looks similar to last quarter.

The question over U.S. tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico and China has created uncertainty for partners at the event, prompting HP to talk up the resilience of its supply chain.

Nicolas joined HP in 2022 to revamp the company’s supply-chain operations, post-pandemic. A big part of that was diversifying HP’s footprint from both a manufacturing and distribution perspective.

“Over the last two years, we’ve opened operations in Mexico and Thailand as well as in Indonesia, we expanded in India, and are in the process of expanding here in the U.S., all of that in the name of resiliency. What that’s meant for us, specific to tariffs, is that we don’t have to revamp our strategy,” said Nicolas.

“I can tell you very comfortably that [I] and my peers are confident that we can aggressively compete in the marketplace because of the change that we’ve made relative to resiliency,"" said Nicolas.

The company has already said it expects to move 90% of the production of its products sold in North America away from China.

At HP Amplify, CEO Enrique Lores said the question over tariffs is difficult to answer, as ”we don’t know yet what the final plan is.” However, he said HP’s more flexible supply chain will “minimize the impact.”

However, new Canalys – now part of Omdia and Informa TechTarget, Channel Futures' parent company – data indicates the U.S. PC market faces challenges from volatile trade policies. These, it said, will likely result in higher prices for consumers and businesses.

Total PC shipments to the U.S. are expected to fall just shy of 2% growth in both 2025 and 2026 with volumes hovering between 70 million and 72 million units each year.

“President Trump’s ongoing trade war with Canada, Mexico and China has had swift negative repercussions for the stock market and pushed the US GDP growth forecast for Q1 2025 into negative territory,” said Canalys analyst Greg Davis. “In addition to the direct impact of tariffs, the stop-start nature of announcements and delays have cast uncertainty around pricing for consumer electronics this year. The tariffs have prompted mitigating actions across the PC industry, with vendors and channel partners engaging in some recent stockpiling of devices.”

(Reuters) – Nike is expected to post its steepest revenue decline in nearly five years in its quarterly results on Thursday, as its new products failed to open the wallets of Americans reluctant to snap up non-essential items like sporting goods and clothing.

Downloads of Nike mobile apps for the quarter were down 35% from a year earlier, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Foot traffic at Nike stores was down 11%, according to data compiled by Raymond James.

Foot Locker, a major Nike retailer, disclosed in its earnings March 5 that promotional pressures would hurt its profit margins in the year ahead. This signaled the impact of discounts imposed by Nike to clear out unsold inventory.

Nike products comprise more than 60% of Foot Locker merchandise.

Those recent indicators illustrate the long road ahead for Nike and its new CEO Elliott Hill, who assumed the top job in October. Nike shares have slid 19% since September 20, following Hill’s appointment. Rival Adidas, meanwhile, has seen its stock tick up slightly over the same period.

Under Hill, Nike began an ambitious turnaround, though Morningstar analyst David Swartz said one or two snazzy new styles will not be enough to get the sportswear giant back on track for sales growth.

“It needs to create a whole new franchise, like a family of products that add billions in sales,” Swartz said. “That takes years.”

Nike is expected to post a revenue decline of 11.5% to $11.01 billion in the third quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG. It would be the steepest fall since the 38% decline Nike reported in fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 during the pandemic.

Its earnings per share is expected to come in at 29 cents, down sharply from 77 cents a year earlier. Investors told Reuters they were keen for details on Nike’s efforts to rebuild relationships with retailers and clear out unsold inventory.

“It continues to be a ‘show-me’ story,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at investment banking firm Freedom Capital Markets. “The question is, do investors have the patience?”

Nike’s inventories were $8 billion in the quarter ended November 30, according to the company.

Some of Hill’s moves so far – including the launch of running shoes Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18 in January and February; a new partnership with womenswear company Skims; and its first Super Bowl ad in 27 years – drew praise from John Nagle, chief investment officer of Kavar Capital Partners LLC, which holds Nike shares.

The planned women’s line with Kim Kardashian-owned Skims “would be pretty good for the business,” said Nagle, “if they can even just step into that market and be a significant player alongside the Lululemons and Biores.”

The Super Bowl commercial, conceived with ad agency Widen + Kennedy, was intended to reach women shoppers, and to demonstrate Nike’s marketing prowess and regain its pop culture relevance.

The spot featured top female athletes like Caitlin Clark, the basketball superstar who has been central to the newfound surge in popularity of the Women’s National Basketball Association.

Under the new ""Surge Fee,"" millions of packages that meet select requirements will be subject to the $0.29 per pound surcharge.

The additional fee will apply to all US shipments coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau, UPS announced earlier this month.

The ""Surge Fee"" was first implemented on March 16 and will remain in effect until March 29.

It is applied based on the billable weight of the package and is also subject to the UPS fuel surcharge.

“Our goal is to ensure that we can continue to meet our customers’ shipping needs without compromising the quality or timeliness of service expected from us,” UPS stated.

The carrier also noted that the Surge Fee was subject to change, and shippers could reference ups.com/rates for updates.

The move comes as UPS works to manage increasing export demand from Asia.

However, it's not the first time that high demand has pushed the company to roll out a surcharge on Chinese shipments being sent to the US.

UPS implemented a Surge Fee last year, tacking on $0.50 per pound on packages from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

The fee was in response to the inundation of shipments from Chinese e-commerce platforms such as Shein and Temu.

The new $0.29 Surge Fee is just one of many surcharge changes consumers will face this year, such as a higher late payment fee and new charges for check and wire transfers.

RISING PRESSURES

As the new Surge Fee stacks on top of UPS' other surcharge changes, it is also exacerbating pressure on shippers and companies who send goods from China to US.

They are already facing higher tariffs under the new administration, which implemented a 10% tariff on Chinese imports on February 4.

One month later, the US rolled out another 10% levy on goods arriving from China, increased the tariffs to 20%.

The new Surge Fee is also an additional burden to shippers preparing for the impending end of the de minimis exemption for packages priced under $800.

Shipments below the threshold could enter the US free of duties or taxes thanks to the provision, which was heavily used by Chinese e-commerce companies to ship low-cost items.

In February 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order to eliminate the exemption for shipments originating from China to ensure that appropriate tariff revenues were collected.

However, the executive order has been temporarily paused as it would create logistical problems and disruptions.

The government needed time to implement the changes, pushing it to delay the exemption's elimination.

Trump's trade shifts have also pushed Temu to undergo a major switch as it sets out to become ""more like Amazon"" - and customers will see more products.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/cropped-shot-courier-person-standing-967651053.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-19 18:02:41.095362

In 2024, CVS reported total revenues of $173.6 billion for its health services segment, reflecting a 7.1% decline year over year. Fourth-quarter revenue stood at $47 billion.

The company’s financial difficulties are partially attributed to its 2023 acquisition of primary care company Oak Street Health for $10.6 billion, which has since been deemed a “money-losing asset,” according to The Wall Street Journal.

According to the Journal, shares in the company fell 24% in 2024, and CVS has cut its earnings guidance multiple times during the year. Rising costs within Aetna’s Medicare Advantage business have played a significant role in these cuts, with CVS anticipating up to a 10% decline in its MA membership in 2025.

In an effort to streamline operations, CVS announced a series of layoffs, which are part of CVS’ broader initiative to reduce costs by $2 billion.:

In September, the company laid off 2,900 employees, primarily in corporate roles.

An October WARN filing revealed 416 job cuts at Aetna’s Hartford, Conn., headquarters and 632 layoffs at CVS’ corporate headquarters in Woonsocket, R.I.

In March, CVS announced plans for laying off an additional 183 employees in Wellesley, Mass.

CVS Health’s board of directors has retained bankers to evaluate a potential company split, aiming to enhance shareholder value and improve financial performance, according to the Journal. The board has engaged hedge fund investor Glenview Capital Management to explore strategic options.

However, a split may present challenges, according to the Journal. CVS has invested over $88 billion in acquisitions over the last six years to transition from a traditional retail pharmacy to a comprehensive healthcare provider. Analysts warn that dismantling the company could leave some divisions struggling independently, risking customer retention and revenue streams.

CVS is adjusting its retail strategy to address financial difficulties and industry challenges:

The company is rolling out a dozen new pharmacy-focused stores while reducing retail offerings in response to declining retail sales.

The company exited its Medicare shared savings program, selling the business to Wellvana in March 2025.

In October 2024, CVS discontinued its infusion services business.

Other retail pharmacies, including Walgreens and Walmart, have struggled due to competition from discount retailers and increased theft.

Nike, which has been led by company veteran Elliott Hill since October, has made several moves in recent months to turnaround the business, which was struggling under its previous leadership.

Baird senior research analyst Jonathan Komp expects Nike to reach third quarter estimates on Thursday and will maintain a cautious sales and margin outlook for Q4.

Watch on FN

“While we have been encouraged by the leadership transition, early signs of successful new product introductions (in running, healthier Jordan releases), and more impactful branding and marketing, we now are modeling fiscal 2026 more conservatively given potential reinvestments and broader macro uncertainties (including tariffs),” Komp wrote in a note to investors last week. “Still, we believe the stock can work as investors gain confidence in the turnaround progress and pathway to much higher multi-year earnings potential.”

Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser agreed, adding in his note to investors last week that Nike should “come in as guided” in Q3. “Nike will continue to provide 90-day guidance until visibility improves enough to provide long term guidance,” Poser wrote. “As orders for October are due this month, we would not be surprised if fiscal year 2026 guidance is provided when Q4 2025 earnings are reported in June.”

Poser added that he expects the upcoming third quarter, as well as Q4, the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and the first month of Q2 2026 to “remain challenging but sequentially become less bad.”

“During aforementioned periods, Nike will take goods back from its wholesale partners, continue to promote to liquidate goods that were oversaturated in the marketplace, or should never have been made, and begin reestablishing a pull model,” Poser noted. “Nike is working to pull orders forward in order to offer compelling new product, especially for women.”

These sentiments follow Hill’s recent meetings with top industry analysts last month.

The overall consensus is that Nike management is making the right moves but still has a long way to go before the beleaguered brand returns to its glory days.

“I’m absolutely thrilled about what’s possible and look forward to growing our cash flows and growing our businesses,” Auchincloss said.
“It became clear that the two priorities in all countries where we operate is affordable energy and reliable energy,” he said.
“In each and every nation, they’re talking about more oil and gas.
During the interview, Auchincloss noted the company’s investments to boost oil and gas production in the Gulf of America, and onshore through its bpx business.","Speaking on the main stage at CERAWeek, the world’s most influential global energy conference in Houston, bp chief executive officer Murray Auchincloss discussed the company’s recent strategy shift and its plans to grow value in the coming years.

In an interview with Dan Yergin, chairman of CERAWeek and vice chairman of S&P Global, Auchincloss explained the rationale for bp’s renewed focus on increasing oil and gas production, disciplined investments in the energy transition and driving efficiency across businesses globally. “I’m absolutely thrilled about what’s possible and look forward to growing our cash flows and growing our businesses,” Auchincloss said.

Auchincloss explained that a series of global changes since 2020 influenced bp’s strategy shift. “It became clear that the two priorities in all countries where we operate is affordable energy and reliable energy,” he said. “In each and every nation, they’re talking about more oil and gas. Yes, lower-carbon – but they need oil and gas. So that was the first thing we started to do, was strengthen the upstream portfolio, and we’ve taken great strides in that.”

Auchincloss noted that bp has “gone back to the Middle East with vigor,” including by reaching an agreement in February 2025 with the Iraqi government to invest in the rehabilitation and redevelopment of several giant oil fields in Kirkuk.

Auchincloss also pointed to bp’s significant investments in America. In fact, the company has about 30,000 employees in the US – more than anywhere else in the world. During the interview, Auchincloss noted the company’s investments to boost oil and gas production in the Gulf of America, and onshore through its bpx business. “We see great growth out of the United States,” Auchincloss said.

In discussing bp’s low-carbon energy plans, Auchincloss said the company is using a “capital-light approach” to growing value, including forming joint ventures to keep investments in those businesses off bp’s balance sheet. “You still get the electron flow for your trading business,” he said. “So we're happy, and it enables you to scale these businesses much faster than you otherwise would have inside a constrained environment of a company like bp.” Auchincloss also noted that bp is focusing its capital investments for biogas and electric vehicle charging in places where the returns can compete with upstream.

Answering a question about the challenges involved with carrying out bp’s new strategy, Auchincloss emphasized that process safety remains top of mind for the company. “We always have to keep an eye on that as we drive change and scale up construction,” he said. “That’s the number one thing.”",https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/country-sites/en_us/united-states/home/images/features/bp-ceo-explains-renewed-oil-and-gas-focus-at-CERAWeek/dan-and-murray.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 18:02:35.707378
