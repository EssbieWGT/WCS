Cracker Barrel said Wednesday it expects lower sales and weaker customer traffic in the coming year as the controversy over its planned logo change continues to play out.

In a conference call with investors, Cracker Barrel said traffic at its restaurants was down 1% in early August, before it announced it was adopting a more simplified logo. The new logo dropped the image of an older man in overalls leaning on a barrel and removed the words “Old Country Store.”

But after the announcement on Aug. 18 and the outcry that followed from many longtime fans, restaurant traffic dropped 8%. Cracker Barrel said Wednesday that traffic will likely be down between 7% and 8% in the first quarter and could decline 4% to 7% for the full 2026 fiscal year.

Cracker Barrel’s shares dropped 9% in after-hours trading Wednesday.

Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino said the company conducted extensive research before releasing the new logo and launching a plan to remodel its 660 U.S. restaurants. The company has since scrapped the new logo and paused the remodeling.

Masino said the four restaurants that have been remodeled — with new paint, new lighting, more comfortable seating and other changes — will be transitioned back to their former decor. Remodels that had begun at 58 other restaurants will also be halted, she said.

“What can not be captured in data is how much our guests see themselves and their own story in the Cracker Barrel experience, which is what’s led to such a strong response to these changes,” Masino said during a conference call with investors Wednesday.

Masino said Cracker Barrel will continue other aspects of its plan to boost sales and attract new customers, including menu innovation and kitchen upgrades. She said marketing will lean into nostalgia and fans’ love for Uncle Herschel, the character pictured on the brand’s logo.

The company is also continuing to grow its loyalty program. Masino said the 2-year-old program now has 9 million members and gained 300,000 new members in just the last four weeks. Masino said one new loyalty perk will be the ability to give the company feedback after every restaurant visit.

“We’re moving ahead with a strong plan to regain traffic and the momentum we had a month ago,” Masino said. “There is a lot to be optimistic about.”

The Lebanon, Tennessee-based company said it expects total revenue of $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion in its 2026 fiscal year, which began Aug. 2. That is lower than the $3.48 billion Cracker Barrel reported in its 2025 fiscal year.

It expects a $25 million hit due to U.S. tariffs on imported goods in the 2026 fiscal year.

Competitors may develop innovative products or business models that could erode Carrier’s market share.","Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR), a leading player in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) industry with a market capitalization of $51.8 billion and annual revenue of $22.5 billion, has been navigating a complex market landscape characterized by strong demand, technological shifts, and geopolitical challenges. As the company continues to refine its strategy and capitalize on emerging trends, investors and analysts are closely watching its performance and future prospects. According to InvestingPro analysis, Carrier is currently trading slightly below its Fair Value, suggesting potential upside opportunity.

Company Overview and Recent Performance

has established itself as a top-three global HVAC leader, with a diverse portfolio that includes commercial HVAC, residential systems, and transportation refrigeration solutions. The company’s recent performance has been marked by strong execution and strategic focus, particularly following the divestiture of five non-core businesses in 2024.

In the first quarter of 2025, Carrier demonstrated robust performance, surpassing analyst expectations with an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.65, compared to estimates of $0.59 to $0.60. This outperformance was driven by solid sales growth of 9% year-over-year and improved operational efficiency. InvestingPro data reveals that management has been aggressively buying back shares, demonstrating confidence in the company’s future prospects. With 10+ additional exclusive insights available on InvestingPro, investors can gain deeper understanding of Carrier’s strategic moves and financial health. The company’s strong showing led to raised guidance for the full fiscal year 2025, reflecting management’s confidence in the business trajectory.

Strategic Focus and Growth Drivers

Carrier’s strategy centers on leveraging multi-year secular trends in the HVAC and building technologies sectors. Key focus areas include:

1. Heat pumps: The company is targeting mid-teens growth in the European residential heat pump market, capitalizing on the shift towards more energy-efficient heating solutions.

2. Datacenter cooling: Carrier is expanding its presence in this high-growth segment, including new liquid cooling capabilities through a partnership with STL/ZutaCore.

3. Smart and connected buildings: The company is investing in technologies that enhance building efficiency and connectivity.

4. Aftermarket and services: Carrier sees significant potential in this sector, with expectations of a 5x-10x revenue multiplier compared to equipment sales.

5. Refrigerant transition: The company is well-positioned to benefit from the industry-wide shift to A2L refrigerants, which is driving mix-uplift in the Americas residential and commercial HVAC markets.

These strategic initiatives align with Carrier’s medium-term financial goals of achieving 6-8% organic sales growth, mid-teens percentage growth in EPS, and approximately 100% free cash flow conversion over the medium term.

Market Position and Competitive Landscape

Carrier’s performance in the American Residential HVAC (RHVAC) sector has been particularly strong, defying bearish expectations. The company’s Applied Commercial HVAC business in the U.S. is performing on par with peers, alleviating concerns about potential market share loss.

However, challenges persist in the European Residential and Light Commercial (RLC) segment, where market conditions remain difficult. Despite these headwinds, analysts maintain a positive outlook on Carrier’s overall market position, citing its broad product portfolio and geographic reach as key advantages.

Financial Outlook and Guidance

Analysts have provided a range of price targets for Carrier’s stock, reflecting varying degrees of optimism about the company’s future performance. With a current trading price of $60.70, analyst targets range from $65 to $90, suggesting potential upside of up to 25%. According to InvestingPro metrics, the company maintains a FAIR financial health rating and operates with a moderate level of debt, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.81. Recent price targets from major firms include:

Barclays: $74.00 (as of September 12, 2025)

RBC Capital Markets: $87.00 (as of May 30, 2025)

The consensus EPS estimates for the upcoming fiscal years are:

FY1 (E): 2.98 to 3.04

FY2 (E): 3.48 to 3.54

These projections indicate expectations of continued earnings growth, supported by the company’s strategic initiatives and market positioning.

Challenges and Risks

While Carrier’s outlook remains generally positive, the company faces several challenges:

1. Tariff impacts: The implementation of Section 232 tariffs has raised cost concerns. However, management has outlined mitigation strategies, including pricing adjustments, productivity enhancements, localization, and dual sourcing, which are expected to offset approximately $300 million in costs.

2. Market competition: As a leader in the HVAC industry, Carrier faces intense competition from both established players and new entrants, particularly in emerging technology areas.

3. Economic sensitivity: The HVAC industry is cyclical and can be affected by broader economic trends, including changes in construction activity and consumer spending.

4. Regional variations: While Carrier’s American RHVAC business is strong, challenges in the European market highlight the importance of managing regional disparities in performance.

Bear Case

How might ongoing tariffs impact Carrier’s profitability?

The implementation of Section 232 tariffs presents a significant challenge to Carrier’s cost structure. While the company has outlined mitigation strategies, including pricing adjustments and supply chain optimization, there is a risk that these measures may not fully offset the impact of tariffs. If Carrier is unable to pass on increased costs to customers or find alternative sourcing options, profit margins could come under pressure. Additionally, prolonged trade tensions could lead to further tariffs or trade restrictions, potentially disrupting Carrier’s global supply chain and impacting its competitive position in international markets.

Can Carrier maintain its market share in the competitive HVAC industry?

As the HVAC industry undergoes technological transformation, particularly in areas such as smart building solutions and energy-efficient systems, Carrier faces the challenge of maintaining its market leadership. Competitors may develop innovative products or business models that could erode Carrier’s market share. The company’s ability to stay ahead in research and development, as well as quickly adapt to changing customer preferences, will be crucial. Moreover, the entry of new players, especially in emerging markets or niche segments like datacenter cooling, could intensify competition and potentially pressure Carrier’s pricing power and profitability.

Bull Case

How will Carrier’s focus on secular trends drive long-term growth?

Carrier’s strategic alignment with key secular trends in the HVAC and building technologies sectors positions the company for sustained long-term growth. The focus on heat pumps, particularly in the European market, taps into the growing demand for energy-efficient heating solutions driven by environmental regulations and consumer preferences. Similarly, the company’s expansion into datacenter cooling addresses the rapidly growing need for thermal management in the digital infrastructure sector. The transition to A2L refrigerants presents an opportunity for Carrier to lead in environmentally friendly HVAC solutions, potentially driving sales as customers upgrade to compliant systems. By capitalizing on these trends, Carrier can not only grow its market share but also command premium pricing for advanced, sustainable solutions.

What potential does the aftermarket/services sector hold for Carrier?

The aftermarket and services sector represents a significant growth opportunity for Carrier, with the potential to generate 5x-10x the revenue of equipment sales. This shift towards a more service-oriented business model could provide several benefits:

1. Recurring revenue streams: Service contracts and regular maintenance provide more stable and predictable income compared to cyclical equipment sales.

2. Higher margins: Service and aftermarket sales typically carry higher profit margins than new equipment sales.

3. Customer retention: Ongoing service relationships strengthen customer loyalty and create barriers to competitor entry.

4. Data-driven insights: Regular servicing of equipment allows Carrier to gather valuable data on product performance and customer needs, informing future product development and sales strategies.

5. Upselling opportunities: Regular contact with customers through service visits creates opportunities to introduce new products or upgrades.

By successfully expanding its aftermarket and services business, Carrier could significantly enhance its profitability and create a more resilient business model less susceptible to economic cycles.

Adding fuel to the story, Agilent received FDA approval for its MMR IHC Panel pharmDx, opening new doors as a companion diagnostic for colorectal cancer. It is a big moment, especially since these wins could attract fresh demand from the pharma and life sciences sectors, even as tariff and supply chain concerns remain in the background.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center will cut less than 2% of its workforce this fall as the system battles rising expenses.

The system said it’s cutting jobs to address a “structural deficit,” in which costs related to drugs, supplies and labor have outpaced revenue growth.

Details of the cuts are still being finalized, a health system spokesperson said. Impacted employees will be notified between late September and Nov. 15.

Dive Insight:

MSK said it has implemented program redesigns, decreased work with consultants and closed some open roles to cut costs. However, the health system does not plan to implement a full hiring freeze.

The health system said its decision to cut staff is due to broader industry headwinds.

“In recent years, unprecedented changes have reshaped the healthcare industry including the ballooning cost of drugs, supplies, and labor, which are outpacing revenue growth,” the system said. “These realities mean that MSK — like hospitals across the country — now faces an annual structural deficit that we will have to address on an ongoing basis.”

Memorial Sloan Kettering is the latest to conduct layoffs amidst an uncertain economic climate.

Layoffs and workforce restructurings have been on the rise this year, with Providence, NewYork-Presbyterian Health System, the University of New Mexico Hospital, Penn Medicine, Yale New Haven Health, Mass General Brigham, Jefferson Health and Lehigh Valley Health Network making changes to their teams in recent months, often citing concerns about growing financial challenges.

Analysts from Kaufman Hall and West Monroe told Healthcare Dive last month that they expect additional health systems to cut staff in the back half of 2025 as they contend with rising costs, reimbursement challenges and impacts from “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which includes cuts to healthcare programs.

Industry-wide, hiring was down last month compared to the past year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Healthcare added 31,000 jobs in August, below the 12-month average of 42,000, suggesting the job market may be cooling slightly.

Company (KHC) has embarked on a bold strategic transformation, splitting into two independent, publicly traded entities—Global Taste Elevation Co. and North American Grocery Co.—to unlock shareholder value and streamline operations. This move, announced in September 2025, reflects a calculated effort to address decades of operational complexity and reposition the company for growth in an evolving consumer landscape. For investors, the question remains: Does this strategic clarity translate into long-term value creation, or is the market skeptical of another corporate restructuring?

Strategic Rationale: Focus Over Complexity

The separation is framed as a response to

Heinz's historical struggles with profitability following its 2015 merger with . By dividing into two entities, the company aims to allocate resources more effectively. Global Taste Elevation Co. will target high-growth categories like condiments, sauces, and shelf-stable meals, leveraging iconic brands such as Heinz and Philadelphia. North American Grocery Co., meanwhile, will focus on staples like Oscar Mayer and Kraft Singles, emphasizing stable cash flowsThe Kraft Heinz Company Announces Plan to Separate into Two Scaled, Focused Companies to Accelerate Profitable Growth and Unlock Shareholder Value[ 1 ].

According to a report by Forbes, the split is expected to generate $300 million in dis-synergies, primarily through cost reductions in manufacturing, IT, and SG&A expensesKraft Heinz To Split Into Two Companies[ 2 ]. This operational simplification could enhance margins, particularly for Global Taste Elevation Co., which will bear 80% of these savingsKraft Heinz at Barclays Conference: Strategic Business Split Unveiled[ 3 ]. The tax-free nature of the spin-off also minimizes immediate shareholder dilution, a critical consideration for long-term value preservationKraft Heinz to Split into Two Independent Companies in Major Strategic Move[ 4 ].

Insider Confidence: A Mixed Signal

Insider transactions offer a nuanced view of confidence in the new strategy. While executives like Elio Leoni Sceti, a non-executive director, sold 50,000 shares totaling over $1.3 million in June and July 2025Kraft Heinz (KHC) Insider Trading Activity[ 5 ], recent award transactions suggest alignment with long-term goals.

Additionally, U.S. Congress Member Ro Khanna's purchases of

stock in July 2025Kraft Heinz Co (KHC) Insider Trading Activity[ 7 ] hint at external confidence in the company's strategic direction.

However, the mixed signals underscore the uncertainty surrounding the split. Insider selling could reflect short-term liquidity needs or skepticism about execution risks, while restricted stock units (RSUs) awarded to executives like Willis Angel SKraft Heinz Co (KHC) Insider Trading Activity[ 8 ] lock in long-term incentives tied to the success of the new entities.

The firm raised its price target to $29 per share, reflecting optimism about the new entities' ability to operate with greater agilityMorgan Stanley Upgrades Kraft Heinz After Split Announcement[ 12 ].

Long-Term Implications: Can Focus Drive Growth?

The success of this strategy hinges on two factors: execution and market dynamics. For Global Taste Elevation Co., growth in emerging markets (30% of its business) and high-margin categories like condiments could offset North American Grocery Co.'s reliance on stagnant staples. However, both entities face challenges, including shifting consumer preferences toward healthier options and the need to divest underperforming brandsThe Kraft Heinz Company Announces Plan to Separate into Two Scaled, Focused Companies to Accelerate Profitable Growth and Unlock Shareholder Value[ 15 ].

The separation also introduces governance risks.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet

Kraft Heinz's strategic split represents a high-stakes bet on simplification and focus. While insider transactions and market reactions reveal a mix of caution and optimism, the underlying rationale—unlocking value through tailored strategies—is compelling. For long-term investors, the key will be monitoring how effectively each entity executes its mandate, navigates cost synergies, and adapts to consumer trends.

These strategic drivers are supported by Ralph Lauren’s strengthened capabilities over the past three years, including advanced technology, artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and a robust balance sheet.

Ralph Lauren president and CEO Patrice Louvet explained: “Our Next Great Chapter: Drive plan is grounded in this meaningful progress — building on our brand’s distinctive positioning and desirability; the enduring power of our products across lifestyle categories; and our expanding presence in key cities around the world.

“Our execution is anchored in the strength of our teams, balance sheet and operational capabilities and underpinned by a culture of excellence and agility. We plan to drive our momentum forward, reinforcing our leadership as an inclusive luxury lifestyle brand to unlock sustainable, long-term growth and value creation.”

Ralph Lauren’s long-term financial guidance

Ralph Lauren has reiterated its fiscal 2026 guidance, which was shared in an earnings call on 7 August 2025 and it has introduced a three-year financial outlook.

From fiscal 2025 through to fiscal 2028, the company anticipates mid-single-digit revenue growth annually in constant currency.

Operating margins are projected to grow by nearly 100 to 150 basis points by fiscal 2028 in constant currency, powered by gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. This is expected to occur alongside continued investments in strategic priorities.

Capital expenditures are projected to account for about 4% to 5% of annual revenue through fiscal 2028.

The company also plans to maintain its practice of returning excess free cash flow to shareholders over the next three years.

It intends to return at least $2bn cumulatively through fiscal 2028 via regular quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases, contingent upon board authorisation and prevailing business and market conditions.

Ralph Lauren’s board of directors has also approved a 10% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend on common stock to $0.9125 per share at the start of fiscal 2026, amounting to an annual dividend of $3.65 per share.",https://www.just-style.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/09/Ralph-Lauren.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 09:06:11.114655

Long-term financial outlook

The company is reaffirming its fiscal 2026 guidance and has provided a new three-year financial outlook from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2028. Ralph Lauren expects revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate in the mid-single digits in constant currency.

The company also projects its operating margin to expand by 100 to 150 basis points by fiscal 2028 in constant currency. This will be achieved through a combination of gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage, balanced with continued investments in the company’s strategic priorities.

Ralph Lauren expects capital expenditures to be approximately 4 percent to 5 percent of revenue annually through fiscal 2028. The company plans to continue returning excess free cash flow to shareholders, with a goal of returning at least 2 billion dollars on a cumulative basis through fiscal 2028 through regular quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. In line with this, the company’s board of directors has already increased the regular quarterly cash dividend by approximately 10 percent to 0.9125 cents per share.

Strategic growth plan

The ""Next Great Chapter: Drive"" plan is based on three key strategic growth drivers:

Elevate and energise its lifestyle brand: The company will expand its brand positioning globally to attract and retain high-quality consumers, thereby increasing Customer Lifetime Value.

Drive the core and expand for more: Ralph Lauren will continue to grow its iconic core products while accelerating growth in high-potential categories that align with evolving consumer lifestyles.

Win in key cities: The company plans to scale its digitally-led ecosystem in its top 30 cities and begin developing its next 20 to sustain long-term growth.

According to CEO Patrice Louvet, this strategy is ""grounded in meaningful progress"" and will leverage the company's brand desirability, the power of its products, and its expanding presence in key global cities. Ralph Lauren, executive chairman and chief creative officer, added that he is proud of how the teams are carrying the company's vision into the future.",https://r.fashionunited.com/C-Bwoch8XSvHQ0Kglj8-7C7gAF0D3XH3A0GCIk0iopU/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjUvMDcvMjQvdW5uYW1lZC0yMDI1LTA3LTI0dDEwNTYyMy03NzMtbnNkemtubmEtMjAyNS0wNy0yNC5qcGVn.jpeg,N,,2025-09-17 09:06:27.125579

The recent earnings report highlighted mixed signals for the consumer goods giant. While adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.91 exceeded expectations, revenue fell short at $4.94 billion, down 0.1% year-over-year. Management projected ""roughly flat"" 2025 revenue due to foreign exchange challenges and a modest EPS growth outlook, prompting investor caution ahead of the earnings release.

Institutional activity added to the stock's volatility. HSBC's initiation of a ""Buy"" rating on September 22 initially supported sentiment, but insider sales by the CEO and CFO totaling $5.37 million raised concerns about internal confidence. Institutional investors also showed divergent moves, with some firms adding to positions while others reduced holdings, signaling fragmented market expectations.

Strategic initiatives aimed at sustainability and cost efficiency have drawn attention. The company reaffirmed its net-zero carbon emissions goal and announced a partnership with Erthos to develop biopolymer packaging, aligning with growing demand for eco-friendly products. However, these efforts may require upfront capital investments, potentially impacting short-term margins.

Broader market dynamics further pressured the stock. Rising oil prices and uncertainty around central bank policy created a cautious environment for consumer staples. While Colgate's essential product portfolio offers some insulation from discretionary spending shifts, energy costs and prolonged high interest rates could weigh on logistics expenses and consumer demand for non-essentials.

Analyst sentiment remains split, with six ""Buy,"" six ""Hold,"" and one ""Sell"" ratings as of late September. The average price target of $98.17 suggests moderate optimism, though execution risks around sustainability programs and cost discipline will be critical for long-term growth. Dividend stability, with a quarterly payout of $0.48, continues to appeal to income-focused investors despite a slightly declining yield.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/news/med-image/compress-1b5082aea94bc002.png,N,,2025-09-17 06:04:51.945429

While PBMs were initially created to contain costs and manage healthcare expenses, their opaque business models have contributed to ongoing spikes in drug pricing.

It’s worth taking a look under the hood at the key PBM revenue stream of rebates. PBMs are incentivized to engage in a “high price/high rebate” model with pharma and, since the big three PBMs (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx) process a majority of all prescription claims, they have significant influence over how drug manufacturers price their therapies.

So how does the industry effect true reform that contributes to a reduction in Rx costs? PBMs could implement a pass-through model for rebates and discounts. This would require them to be more transparent with their clients—insurance companies, employers and more—and provide National Drug Code-level data that shines a light on negotiated discounts. Instead of keeping a significant portion of manufacturer rebates, PBMs should be contractually obligated to pass 100% of them back to health plans or employers, who can then lower premiums or patient out-of-pocket costs.

Pharma can play a pivotal role as well, especially if it chooses to embrace alternative PBM models and direct contracting. Brand teams might consider engaging with market disruptors, like the so-called “transparent PBMs,” that operate without hidden fees and retained rebates. These teams should also be exploring direct-to-employer and direct-to-patient solutions that bypass the PBM entirely.

As more patient volume shifts from the Big Three into new access pathways, brand teams will want to make sure they provide easy access to their portfolio. Those who can credibly position themselves as leaders in accelerating savings, access and transparency will be the ones who thrive in the current landscape.","https://res.cloudinary.com/dotcom-prod/images/ar_4:3,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1200/v1/wt-cms-assets/2025/09/k26zydxrrzgwkfrqlwal/pharmacybenefitsmanagerpbmv3.jpg",N,,2025-09-17 03:58:56.303374

“For nearly sixty years, we have remained true to our vision of timeless style, authenticity, optimism and a life well-lived,“ said Ralph Lauren, executive chairman and chief creative officer.
Ralph Lauren anticipates low single-digit sales growth, “reflecting caution regarding the international environment.“ Margin will expand “modestly,“ including the impact of tariffs.","Ralph Lauren outlines the roadmap for its development over the next three years. The U.S. company has chosen to maintain continuity with respect to the previous strategy, focusing on the same “three growth drivers “ and anticipating mid-single-digit growth in constant currency over the next three years.

While the group’s previous strategic plan was called Next Great Chapter: Accelerate, the one presented today maintains the same spirit, choosing as its name Next Great Chapter: Drive.

“The three-year financial outlook includes revenue growth at a mid-single-digit compound annual growth rate and operating profit growth that will exceed gross revenue growth by fiscal 2028 in constant currency,“ the company said.

Ralph Lauren will maintain a focus on three thrusts. The first, “elevate and energize the brand,“ increasing brand positioning and winning new consumers. The second is to “drive core and diversify,“ focusing on iconic products and underpenetrated categories. The third, “win in key cities”, focusing on a channel ecosystem in thirty priority cities and starting to develop the next twenty.

“For nearly sixty years, we have remained true to our vision of timeless style, authenticity, optimism and a life well-lived,“ said Ralph Lauren, executive chairman and chief creative officer.

Ralph Lauren is betting on a plan called ‘Next Great Chapter: Drive’, after completing ‘Next Great Chapter: Accelerate’

“Our Next Great Chapter: Drive plan builds on this significant progress, leveraging the distinctive positioning and appeal of our brand, the enduring power of our products across all lifestyle categories and our growing presence in key cities around the world,“ said Patrice Louvet, Ralph Lauren chairman and CEO.

The U.S. company ended fiscal 2024 with sales up nearly 7% and net income up nearly 15% after a strong fourth quarter. At the close of fiscal 2024 (ended last March), sales stood at $7.07 billion, an increase of 6.76% over the previous year.

Ralph Lauren’s shares slipped more than 3% after the iconic fashion brand unveiled softer growth targets and pledged to return at least $2 billion to shareholders over the next three years.

What does this mean?

Ralph Lauren plans to increase revenue at a steady, mid-single-digit pace through fiscal 2028, with operating margins set to nudge higher by 100 to 150 basis points. For fiscal 2026, management sees revenue growth in the low- to mid-single-digit range and a modest 40 to 60 basis point margin expansion—a signal that the focus is on incremental gains, not rapid leaps. About 4–5% of yearly revenue will go toward revamping stores and boosting digital efforts. To sweeten the deal for investors, the brand is promising at least $2 billion in shareholder returns via dividends and buybacks, depending on board approval. Still, the measured forecast came in cooler than hoped, weighing on the stock.

Why should I care?

For markets: Weighing cautious gains against big returns.

Ralph Lauren’s careful growth plans stand out in a luxury industry where rivals are swinging for the fences. The promise of robust dividends and buybacks might soften the blow, but the stock could struggle to outperform as peers chase flashier sales growth or launch attention-grabbing collections. For some investors, slow and steady may not cut it in this race.

I think what we're looking at, back to the consumer point, is a consumer who's being mindful and choiceful.
Yeah, I do actually want to hit on that, because the housing market is something that I've been discussing with executives.
He said that a sub 6% mortgage rate may be a catalyst to get the housing market inflection really started here.
And then we can bring on some ancillary, um, um, um, products.","I do want to kick off with the retail sales number. We did see some softness within electronics sales last month. They were up about 0.3%. Describe to us exactly what you're seeing with the state, the demand of the consumer heading into the holiday, and are they pulling back a bit?

Well, we actually had a chance to release our earnings at the end of August, which is perfect timing. And we had said at that point, we were already running in low single digit positive comps. We were seeing strength in computing and gaming and headphones and wearables and mobile. So we actually were continuing to see that strength, especially through back to school. And then we forecasted that for the quarter. We'd probably end up similar to our last quarter in terms of comp growth. So it's a consumer who actually in our mind has stayed pretty steady in terms of demand.

For months now, we've been discussing the FOMC meeting out tomorrow. Markets are pricing in a quarter point cut. What are the headwinds up against consumers right now? And how do you expect perhaps a cut to impact the consumer behavior?

I mean, I think what's hard is the consumer is not a monolith, as you know. And we're seeing some different behaviors depending on the consumer. We see almost everyone looking for value. Now, people describe that differently, but very peaky events like back to school or our Black Friday in July event. And at the same time, when there's innovation, something new like the Switch 2, or like some of the new rev of computing that we're seeing. People are willing to spend on those higher price points for those items that they know they're going to have for multiple years. And so we actually are seeing a consumer, while bifurcated a bit, still willing to spend if they really feel like it's a great value.

And in your last quarter, you did say that third quarter same-store sales are expected to be in line with Q2. But, like you just said, we have this Nintendo. We also got those latest announcements from Apple around the iPhone, the Watch, AirPods. Do you think that it just won't be enough to really see a surge in growth here?

I think what we're looking at, back to the consumer point, is a consumer who's being mindful and choiceful. All of those innovations, especially for our model, that is what feeds our model. We consumerize new technology better than anyone. And so we're super excited about those things, and at the same time, very low housing turnover. So a challenge in some of the major appliances or TVs areas. So we're kind of trying to find that balance between super excitement about what's coming, and at the same time a consumer who's just being a little bit more choiceful.

Yeah, I do actually want to hit on that, because the housing market is something that I've been discussing with executives. I did speak to Low's CEO. And what he said was something really interesting. He said that a sub 6% mortgage rate may be a catalyst to get the housing market inflection really started here. You did see declines in appliances and home theater. But do you do you see a turning point to really get consumers back into those big ticket items? Does the housing market need to change here?

I think the housing market definitely helps. It's not the only thing. Innovation, large, large screen TVs, those are also things that make people just excited to want to, especially have entertainment at home when maybe they don't want to spend the money to go out. And so there's a real value prop there. However, having more turnover in the housing market definitely helps because you're more likely to outfit that uh entertainment room or your kitchen or any of those spaces. And I agree with Marvin, I think that if you could just get below kind of this catalyst number, you might start to see that turnover because I think people are really looking for just an affordable new home to buy.

Yeah, and when you think about appliances and home theater, these are pricier goods. Are the everyday consumer going for it? Do you see only high-income shoppers really willing to spend that sort of splurge?

I think what's great and unique to our model, all we do is consumer electronics. And all we think about is how can we provide the biggest, widest assortment at all the price points. So we have everything from a very opening price point. You can get a humongous 100-inch TV for sub $1,000. Um, or you can work your way all the way up to the most premium TV that you could want. And our goal is just whatever your budget is. Doesn't matter where you are on the income strata, wherever your budget is, we have something for you.

We did hear from Moody's this morning that the high-income consumer is really driving spending here in the US. Do you see that at your stores?

Uh, interestingly, we have actually seen all of our consumer cohorts continue to spend. Now, again, they're thoughtful about what. They might go for more of an entry point TV versus a really high-end one. But we have actually, when we've even seen some growth in the lower income consumer.

Oh, interesting. Well, and what are they going for? Are they going for those promotional deals?

I think there's a few things. Our model is really built on replacement and replenishment. Your technology does, it dies on you at some point. And, you know, we're four, five years out from the pandemic. There was a huge pull forward and install base, and whoever you are, you might need something new in order to do your job. Your phone might have broke, you need a new computer, those headphones you really need in order to do your job. And so that's when we want to be there. And it might not be you need the most expensive computer, you just need a good opening price point laptop and we have a huge assortment of those.

Yeah, AI has been driving the market rally. Has it been driving replacements as well? Yet?

I I I think it is part, it's part and parcel with replace. So our model works when you've got replacement cycles kicking in and some level of innovation. That is our sweet spot. And in this case, AI being just enough, I mean, it can be something as simple as the AI chips take your battery life from two hours to 24 hours. That can be a compelling feature for those of us who travel all the time. And so all we're trying to do is make sure we've trained 30,000 associates to help customers understand what really can they do that's different with AI, and a lot of customers just want to future proof themselves and make sure they have the right capacity for wherever AI takes them.

And these are things we've been hearing throughout all your quarterly results. Another thing that we've been talking about so much over the past 24 hours is President Trump's giving the idea that maybe companies would pull back and only report twice. We did ask Octa CEO just before about this. He said it's great to talk to investors, but there is this industry obsession about quarterly earnings. What's your take on maybe repor reporting, rather, only twice a year?

I mean, I think our focus has always been how can we get investors the most pertinent information at the right times to make the best decisions. Sometimes, I think when you're in a really volatile backdrop, you do want to be laying some of that groundwork quarterly. For me, that's less about the forecast and more just about providing color, just like what we're talking about about the business. That being said, I think we're all trying to find ways to free up capacity and make sure we're spending capacity in the most value-added areas.

Yeah. Now, one thing that does have investors excited next quarter is that marketplace launch. And so describe to me, how exactly does the Best Buy marketplace differentiate from what we see at some of your top competitors like Walmart and Amazon, and even maybe Target there as well?

Well, I think we are different. We're all we do is specialty retail and specialty consumer electronics. And we're approaching this, and the reason we started is we could see customers searching for things we didn't have. You might need that iPhone 12 case. We're on 17 now. I I can't carry all of those things in the store. I can't carry every color of blender. This gives us a chance to have this deeper assortment, sharper price points. We can bring on innovative, new, exciting technology vendors that may not otherwise be able to handle our scale. And then we can bring on some ancillary, um, um, um, products. And those are the kind where we can see people like curious about, do you carry a pool robot? Well, maybe not in store, but now we have this this broader assortment. And so I think we are also trying to do it in a way where you can bring back your product to the store, we'll help facilitate that return. We have universal return windows. We're trying to think about how to do this in a way that really aligns with our brand, and yet kind of opens the aperture on what's possible.

And one thing that you're opening the door to is I saw on your website, you have these release dates around Pokémon cards and all the collectibles. I mean, what sort of response have you gotten to these trading cards?

It's incredible. And this is where I think us really understanding our customers. Not just what's the technology they buy, but what are they interested in? And more importantly, what are they passionate about? And this is a space where people are passionate. Very passionate about it.

And so we want to, like, we want to bring that energy. We want to bring the energy to the stores. We want to be there for our customers. Um, and trust me, there are lines and people are passionate. And so we just want to we want to keep exploring this space because our biggest objective is to bring that fun and sparkle to what it is that we do.

And last question here, as you head into the holiday, what have you seen so far in terms of just the response? What are consumers really looking for right now in terms of products?

Yeah, we've seen growth really broad-based across a lot of different categories. And there's a bunch we're excited about. Handheld gaming is big and that's Switch 2, but it's also a lot of development from other manufacturers who are really entering that space. Computing continues to be strong. You have Windows 10 sunsetting, moving up into Windows 11, so there'll be a a big driver there. We continue to see strength in our mobile business where people are looking for at least the replacement of that phone, um, and some new form features there. Strength in headphones, strength in wearables, like there are a lot of different facets where we're seeing demand. And we are super excited to bring those to life for a holiday.

I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance.
Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for CVS Health (of which 1 is a bit concerning!)","For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) shareholders, since the share price is down 28% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 75%.

On a more encouraging note the company has added US$4.1b to its market cap in just the last 7 days, so let's see if we can determine what's driven the three-year loss for shareholders.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.

During the three years that the share price fell, CVS Health's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 17% each year. In comparison the 10% compound annual share price decline isn't as bad as the EPS drop-off. This suggests that the market retains some optimism around long term earnings stability, despite past EPS declines.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..

What About Dividends?

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for CVS Health the TSR over the last 3 years was -19%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

It's nice to see that CVS Health shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 8%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for CVS Health (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.

“Since our last investor day in 2022, we delivered on our long-term targets while strengthening our business and fundamentally elevating our brand. We have established multiple, diversified engines of growth that continue to gain momentum, rooted in the timeless values and authentic style that make Ralph Lauren unique,” said Patrice Louvet, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our Next Great Chapter: Drive plan is grounded in this meaningful progress — building on our brand’s distinctive positioning and desirability; the enduring power of our products across lifestyle categories; and our expanding presence in key cities around the world.”

Mr. Louvet continued, “Our execution is anchored in the strength of our teams, balance sheet and operational capabilities and underpinned by a culture of excellence and agility. We plan to drive our momentum forward, reinforcing our leadership as an inclusive luxury lifestyle brand to unlock sustainable, long-term growth and value creation.”

Long-Term Financial Outlook

The Company is reiterating its Fiscal 2026 guidance that was recently provided on its earnings call on August 7th, 2025 and introducing its three-year financial outlook.

Over the next three years, from a base of Fiscal 2025 through Fiscal 2028, the Company expects revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate of mid-single digits in constant currency. Operating margin is expected to expand approximately 100 to 150 basis points by Fiscal 2028 in constant currency, driven by a combination of gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage balanced with continued investments in the Company’s long-term strategic priorities.

In addition, capital expenditures are expected to represent approximately 4% to 5% of revenue annually through Fiscal 2028.

The Company expects to continue returning excess free cash flow to shareholders over the next three years, with plans to return at least $2 billion on a cumulative basis through Fiscal 2028 through its regular quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases, subject to the authorization of its Board of Directors and overall business and market conditions.

The Company’s Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock by approximately 10% to $0.9125 per share at the beginning of Fiscal 2026, representing an annual dividend of $3.65 per share.

The Company’s current share repurchase authorization enables it to repurchase up to $1.6 billion in shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to overall business and market conditions.

The Company's outlook is based on its best assessment of the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures, tariffs and other consumer spending-related headwinds, global supply chain disruptions and foreign currency volatility, among other factors. The Fiscal 2026 and long-range outlook exclude any potential restructuring-related and other net charges that may be incurred in future periods, as described in the ""Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this press release.

NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Because Ralph Lauren Corporation is a global company, the comparability of its operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which it transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on the Company’s reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), the Company’s discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. The Company presents constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to its reported operating results. The Company uses constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how its businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Management believes this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in the Company’s businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

This press release also includes certain other non-U.S. GAAP financial measures relating to the impact of charges and other items as described herein. The Company uses non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, among other things, to evaluate its operating performance and to better represent the manner in which it conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods. While the Company considers non-U.S. GAAP measures useful in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, nor act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-U.S. GAAP measures reported by other companies.

Please see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC for more information about the Company’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP.

Additionally, the Company’s long-term financial outlook excludes certain anticipated restructuring-related and other charges. The Company is not able to provide a full reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP because certain material items that impact these measures, such as the timing and exact amount of charges related to its restructuring plans, have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP based financial measure guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250915511547/en/304083/22/RL_Corporation_%28Black%29.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 11:12:42.496355

It’s a challenge—and opportunity—Donna Morris, chief people officer at Walmart, is navigating at scale, as she leads people operations for a workforce of 2.1 million associates worldwide.

Morris, announced last week as our HR Executive of the Year, says HR needs to play a pivotal role in designing and executing an AI integration strategy—and keep focused in a landscape where pressure to unleash AI quickly is pervasive. Morris draws insights from her own AI integration accomplishments—for instance, designing and rolling out an AI-powered mobile and desktop solution for store associates that has since scaled across the business, as well as a gen AI-driven assistant functioning as a “playground” to encourage associate experimentation with AI.

3 lessons from Walmart’s AI integration

Morris and her team continue to explore ways to drive efficiencies with AI, including in HR. Her AI integration experiences have highlighted a number of realities that Morris says HR should keep top of mind as they traverse their own AI journeys:

1. Know your destination.

As Walmart’s HR teams began exploring how AI would impact the workforce, it was critical to “position” the work around the broader leadership goal of creating a future Walmart that is “people-led, tech-powered,” she says. That “deliberate” choice to prioritize people has helped inform AI integration decisions.

Having those intentional conversations before any AI integration project is necessary.

“I would encourage my peers to engage with their leadership teams in terms of what role they want technology to play as part of their business as they go forward,” she says. “If you don’t know what you’re building toward, you’re never going to get there.”

That foundation will be important as HR faces pressure from all sides to drive value from AI. The C-suite, boards of directors and other stakeholders all have a “heightened desire” to “move fast,” she says. But HR needs to position AI integration as a true journey.

“If you don’t know your destination, you’re never going to get there.”

2. Step into the leadership role.

Apart from setting the pace, HR can use its seat at the table to keep the focus on the workforce impact during any AI integration project.

Ask questions like:

What are our internal capabilities?

Who are our external partners?

How are we thinking about data?

Where does AI make sense—and where does it not?

Be a core part of “framing the strategy and the role people will play,” she advises. That work should involve close, cross-organizational partnerships, particularly with tech functions.

“HR has to work really, really closely with digital,” she says. “There are certainly some companies deciding those two should merge; I’m not an advocate saying that needs to be the reality, but rather there needs to be a tight partnership—where you’re looking at, what role will people play, what role will technology play and what is the business really trying to accomplish?”

3. Avoid ‘AI for AI’s sake’.

Without such strategic forethought, organizations can end up with a tech landscape that Morris likens to the famed Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, Calif.—a sprawling mansion once home to a maze of 500 rooms, with doors and windows that led nowhere.

“If you don’t have a deliberate plan to how you’re going to leverage AI, your outcome won’t be as successful,” she says. “You’ll lose time and, frankly, credibility.”

Pursuing “AI for AI’s sake” is not an inexpensive venture either, she adds. Price tags are tied to every decision made along an AI integration journey—so, each step needs to be purposeful.

“We have to be really strategic about where we’re investing,” Morris says, “and how we’re investing.”",https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Walmart.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 08:06:31.749172

Health's stock has underperformed, declining by approximately 12% year-to-date as of September 2025. This divergence from the broader market raises critical questions about the company's strategic positioning and operational resilience. However, a closer examination of its recent initiatives, macroeconomic tailwinds, and competitive dynamics reveals a compelling case for near-term recovery.

Strategic Positioning: Reinforcing Healthcare Access and Innovation

CVS Health has positioned itself at the forefront of the U.S. healthcare transformation by expanding access to preventive care and leveraging digital innovation. A key example is its rollout of the 2025–2026 flu vaccination program, which includes a 3-in-1 diagnostic test for influenza A, influenza B, and COVID-19 at 38 U.S. states and the District of Columbia Updated flu vaccinations now available at CVS Pharmacy® and MinuteClinic®[ 3 ]. This initiative aligns with consumer behavior trends: a survey indicates that 63% of Americans plan to get a flu shot this season, with 28% favoring retail pharmacies like CVS Updated flu vaccinations now available at CVS Pharmacy® and MinuteClinic®[ 3 ]. By integrating diagnostic testing with vaccination services, CVS is not only addressing public health needs but also enhancing its role as a one-stop healthcare destination.

The company's strategic focus on proactive health management is further underscored by its digital health platforms, which aim to streamline patient engagement and chronic disease management. These efforts are critical in an industry where convenience and accessibility increasingly drive consumer choice.

Competitive Dynamics: Navigating a Fragmented Landscape

CVS faces intense competition from rivals such as Walgreens and Rite Aid, as well as emerging telehealth providers. However, its dual presence in retail pharmacy and clinical services (via MinuteClinic) creates a unique value proposition. The 3-in-1 test, for instance, differentiates CVS by offering rapid, integrated diagnostics—a feature that could attract both retail and clinical customers.

Macroeconomic factors also play a pivotal role. Global trends such as uneven economic growth and fiscal strains on governments are reshaping healthcare systems, with a growing emphasis on cost containment and preventive care Macroeconomics Overview - World Bank Group[ 1 ]. CVS's focus on affordable, accessible services aligns with these shifts, positioning it to capture market share in a sector increasingly prioritizing efficiency.

Operational Resilience and Near-Term Catalysts

CVS's operational resilience is evident in its ability to adapt to evolving consumer demands. The company's recent cost-cutting measures, while not detailed in public reports, are likely part of a broader strategy to maintain profitability amid margin pressures. Additionally, its expansion into underserved regions—driven by structural reforms in healthcare systems globally—could unlock new revenue streams Kenya Economic Update (KEU) - World Bank Group[ 2 ].

Near-term catalysts for recovery include the flu season, which historically drives foot traffic and ancillary sales. The 2025–2026 vaccination rollout, combined with the 3-in-1 test, could generate significant incremental revenue. Furthermore, CVS's alignment with global efforts to strengthen public health infrastructure—such as those seen in Kenya and Peru—positions it to benefit from long-term policy tailwinds Updated flu vaccinations now available at CVS Pharmacy® and MinuteClinic®[ 3 ].

Conclusion: A Compelling Buy Case

While short-term headwinds have pressured CVS's stock, its strategic initiatives and macroeconomic tailwinds suggest a path to recovery. The company's emphasis on preventive care, digital innovation, and operational efficiency positions it to outperform in a healthcare landscape increasingly defined by accessibility and affordability. For investors, the current valuation offers an attractive entry point into a business with clear near-term catalysts and long-term structural growth potential.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd24f7700bc002.png,N,,2025-09-16 01:03:22.329215

And as it turns out, the retail juggernaut's scale and reach are proving to be tremendous assets in the AI race.

That's because most top AI companies — like OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic, or Meta — operate in a primarily virtual space, processing unfathomably complex rivers of information into more digital information. AI-adjacent companies like Nvidia, Intel, and Oracle focus on providing the physical infrastructure upon which the AI machines function. Then there are the companies that are using digital intelligence to deliver physical results through automation and augmented experiences, like Tesla and Amazon.

Walmart, by contrast, has a vast and complicated set of physical challenges to solve as the largest retailer in the US — and the world. Those include everything from cleaning up spills in the dairy aisle to stocking shelves.

""We move billions of items around every month, every year,"" Walmart US CEO John Furner said Tuesday at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference. He said the company has been developing machine learning tools and other automation projects since around 2015.

Furner said that the company's AI models and supply chain automation help plan inventory to arrive at the right aisle at the right time, for example. One technique involves creating ""digital twins"" of each facility to model the movement of merchandise through the system on its way to customers.

Furner also said store associates increasingly have an AI chatbot handy via their handheld devices to help them better set priorities and help customers.

""It's a combination of people being powered by technology. There's a lot of judgment to retail and decision-making. And we're in a very dynamic industry,"" he said. ""We think this next phase of physical AI in combination with Gen AI is going to be really helpful.""

The company's head of e-commerce, David Guggina, told the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech conference last week how AI is helping his team run experiments and fulfill orders at an increasingly rapid rate.

Guggina said his team is now able to work at breathtaking speed behind the scenes, too.

""What took a data scientist days or weeks before can now be done in minutes,"" he said.

AI also helps ensure that each of the company's 4,700 stores has the kinds of products best suited to their local markets, slashing delivery times to minutes after a customer places an order.

""We've just completed the third inning,"" he said by way of the classic baseball game analogy. ""So we're still early with regard to our automation journey in the fulfillment network.""

These digital-to-physical uses of AI are also complemented by a myriad of ""micro agents"" that handle tasks like tracking local event calendars or monitoring inventory levels.

Walmart, of course, is still fine-tuning its AI approach, and there have been hiccups.

The proliferation of bespoke Walmart-made AI agents eventually started to confuse users, the company told the Wall Street Journal.

The company has rolled many of those micro agents into four ""super agents"" designed to assist shoppers, merchandisers, programmers, and third-party marketplace sellers.

Happy Labor Day Weekend! For me, this holiday brings a much-anticipated trip to the lake with loved ones—and I hope it brings rest and relaxation for you, too.

But before we clock out to enjoy the last few days of summer, let's reflect on the reason for the season. Labor Day recognizes workers' contributions to America's ""strength, prosperity and well-being,"" according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

In order to be strong, prosperous and well, we need health care workers—as reflected in the most recent data from the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA). The health care industry employed 17 million people in 2023, topping the charts as the largest employment sector in the U.S.

Still, it's no secret that the health care workforce is struggling. NCHWA predicts that by 2037, the country will be short 187,130 full-time equivalent physicians. In rural areas, the gap between supply and demand will be worse.

The greatest puzzle of the health care workforce shortage is that we can't just hire our way out of it. The U.S. population is rapidly aging and will require more services in the coming years than we're currently equipped to provide.

While there's no way to prevent the incoming crisis, there are some things that health systems can do to cushion the blow. And they're doing them. In the past several months, I've covered health care high schools that aim to start training the next generation early; a new medical school that is waiving tuition; virtual care initiatives that can extend the reach of a single physician across state lines; and AI tools that are working alongside (and in some cases, independent of) clinicians to lighten their load.

There is a lot to be hopeful about. But when I spoke to physicians about this topic in the spring, they pointed to a place where we could still do better.

Dr. Harry Severance, a member of the board of directors at Duke University School of Medicine's Collaborative Cardiovascular Society and Research Network and a member of the Tennessee Medical Association's wellbeing committee, told me that physicians will not remain in jobs where they do not feel respected. For many, the corporatization of the health care system has reduced their sense of agency. The current payer model has put checks and balances on hard-earned medical knowledge that many doctors find excessive. The administrative burden has contributed to record-high levels of burnout.

""You can recruit people in, but after a while—especially younger, more flexible people—they're going to turn around and leave,"" Severance told me. ""Why should they put up with all this abuse when they've got alternatives?""

I'll leave you with a quote from Dr. Laura Jett, a retired family medicine physician, who shared her reflections on the profession with me earlier this year.

""I've had time to think about what it means to be a doctor,"" Jett said. ""What is the service? What do we do with our lives? Nothing but work.

""It's a tremendous offering,"" she continued. ""It's devalued a lot. The mechanization or the industrialization of the medical practices, the delivery of health care, diminishes that sense of feeling like you're valued. ""

Pulse Check

Executive perspectives on key industry issues

Merriam-Webster doesn't release their ""word of the year"" until December, but if I had to bet on one, it would be ""tariff.""

President Donald Trump and his administration have been clear about their goal to shift manufacturing to the United States from overseas, placing tariffs on other countries' exports and sparking negotiations with a handful.

It has been less clear, however, how these plans could impact the health care industry.

That's why I spoke with Jeff DiLullo, CEO of Philips North America, for this week's Pulse Check feature. Philips announced a $150 million investment in U.S. manufacturing, research and development this month: including the expansion of its Reedsville, Pennsylvania, manufacturing facility, which produces AI-enabled ultrasounds systems.

I asked DiLullo about the timing of this announcement, exploring how Trump's ""America First"" policies could impact U.S. health care systems. Below, find a portion of our conversation:

Editor's Note: Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

What is it about this moment that inspired the $150 million commitment to U.S. manufacturing, research and development? Why now?

I'll take you on a very quick journey. Number one, [during] the first Trump administration, we saw localization was needing to be more of a thing, right? It was just very clear. So we started things in motion way back then, eight or so years ago.

Now, if you can think back that far, the pandemic had a pretty sizable impact across the industry, our supply chain. You saw health care systems really struggling to get supplies, and so all of us sort of had this massive wake up moment that we needed to be much more local in our sourcing. That takes time in an FDA-cleared environment, so we've been working toward these things for years.

I do think the current administration, their focus on investment in the U.S., their desire to get manufacturing back here, makes it very easy to reduce some hurdles, to get back into a larger [U.S.-based] footprint that we want to have.

Why now? The U.S. health care market is growing. The cost of health care is growing at twice the pace of inflation. So that's not good, but this is a growing health care market, the most [rapidly] growing market in the world in terms of health care delivery as a percentage of per capita [spending]. So we absolutely want to be growing here. And we want to invest and make sure we have more agile, shorter supply chains, easier response to customers and the health systems we serve. That's why we're doubling down here.

You mentioned that the current administration has reduced some of those hurdles to expansion in the United States. What are those hurdles, specifically?

First of all, I want to applaud the administration and recognize what they're doing to try and reshape balance of trade. I think that has been a major point of the administration from day one, and we support that effort to do it. Practically speaking, this medtech business is largely a U.S. industry. About 70 percent of manufacturing, broadly speaking, across our industry, is done here in the U.S. About 90-plus percent of the research and development is in the U.S.

We're not quite that way [at Philips]. Our roots are in in the Netherlands, but we've continued to grow and invest and expand here in the U.S., as we've seen this as a market. So the industry itself, is very much an American industry, and I think we're already accomplishing many things the administration wants to do. We're doubling down where the growth is. Investment is key, and I think the more you can invest, the more likely it is to be able to grow your business here in what I would consider a reasonably-friendly regulatory environment, very specific on the FDA side of that regulation, I'm just talking in terms of the ability to move quickly.

For example, we wanted to get this facility up and running in six months. Nobody thought we could do it [because of] the bureaucracy at the state level and some of the construction. We sat and talked with our partners, Congressman Dr. John Joyce, Senator Dave McCormick, other local officials that were instrumental in helping us move the paperwork and [have] the ability to get all the approvals we need so that we can construct. We got it done in the time we said—actually under budget, under time—and now we have a new facility in Reedsville that's shipping U.S.-made product to the U.S. and across the globe. That's how we clear barriers. We partner with the folks that want to help us get rid of the non-value added work and helps us speed the production.

One of the concerns I've heard coming out of other industries as they look to move more manufacturing to the United States is that prices could go up as a result of the higher labor costs here. How are you managing costs at Philips and in the med tech industry, while operating largely in the U.S.?

That's partly true, if everything stays the same as what we're doing today. Although, for example, at Philips, we have a huge software and AI part of our business. About 50 percent of the code that's written today for Philips is written by AI. So we're actually deploying capabilities within our own organization to lower our cost structure, to be able to be more competitive.

That doesn't necessarily mean we're taking away American jobs, but we're putting jobs where people need to do the thought work. We're putting jobs where people do the physical manufacturing. And I think from our standpoint, we we're finding a way to absorb the impact of tariffs today. We're also finding very creative ways to automate our own processes and systems so that we're allowing people to focus on things they're best utilized to do. So bringing manufacturing back here is only part of the discussion. It's how else we're taking out cost in development and coding and other things that are allowing us to put resources where we want to grow up.

Our labor rate probably does go up. That's an isolated view of a business. And so we're kind of taking a much more holistic view of the total value. If I'm manufacturing here, and if I can get my product sooner and get it to my customers sooner and get it installed sooner, I'm going to get paid sooner. I actually have an incentive to move faster and deliver this capability to customers faster to allow me to offset some of that potential labor cost.

Why is it so important to have these capabilities in the United States as opposed to overseas?

There are always some things that impact the ability to deliver care. Cost is continuing to go up. The fact that I can actually start to build and deploy systems in days much closer to where my customers consume the technology—that is lifesaving in just about every case. I'm actually getting lifesaving capability in the hands of health care providers much sooner and ultimately at a lower cost, as I continue to develop more electronically or digitally capable tools. And the more I can deploy in some of these virtual or digital ways, or AI-enabled workflows, I'm actually allowing people to work wherever they're at. They can interact with radiology studies or diagnostics from their home, from their laptop.

I'm making the whole process much, much faster. I don't have to deal with privacy laws. Everything I do is embedded here in the United States. I don't have to deal with transatlantic privacy. I'm compliant here in the U.S. for all our cybersecurity requirements. It's faster, much more effective, to be able to get it into the market sooner, and completely compliant with laws and regulations that we don't have to satisfy outside of the U.S.

And the side note is, we're the most stringent regulatory environment in the world. So if we can do it right here, we can do it anywhere.

How health care leaders are managing their own health

This week, I spoke with Suzen Heeley, executive director of design and construction at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She's the head designer on their new Kenneth C. Griffin Pavillion—a high-rise patient care tower that will soon be added to that famous Big Apple skyline.

Heeley described how the design of a space can influence human psychology, proactively contributing to (or detracting from) our sense of safety.

I'm cooking up a feature article on the Pavillion, which you can expect next month—but for now, here's a sneak peek at how Heely and her team are considering nurse wellbeing in their design:

Editor's Note: Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

""We're really trying to use research to develop the design as opposed to just making a beautiful space, and thinking about how it can impact not just the patients, but certainly the staff as well. We want to think about them and the pressures and the stress that they're under every day.

""One of the things we heard [from staff], which I thought was fascinating, was that there are periods where they want to be joyful. Somebody's getting engaged or having a baby or whatever, and they feel like they don't have a space where they can express their emotions in that way, because patients are maybe not in a place where they feel joy. We need to create those kind of off-stage spaces for staff to be in to express those emotions, whether they're joy or sorrow. You know, there's a lot of emotion that happens in these spaces on a day-to-day basis. So that was really kind of the foundation of the work that we were doing. We wanted to, of course, build that into our thinking and the way we were creating the design for the space.

""We have things like respite spaces, so places for them to have a private moment when they need it for emotional release, respite, refuge or renewal. And then we think about what those spaces could be, giving the staff the ability to control the temperature, lighting, sound if they want to play their music (or if they want to just sit and feel the quiet, they can do that). But these are spaces where staff can just step away. Unfortunately, on these nursing units, oftentimes they can't walk away too far because they're needed there. So we will have these respite spaces embedded in the patient units to take care of them and be there for them.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2722880/jeff-dilullo.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 15:11:44.911648

WMT is at the forefront, betting big on artificial intelligence. WMT is accelerating its push into artificial intelligence with the rollout of AI super agents that could redefine how the retail industry currently operates. CEO Douglas McMillon emphasized that artificial intelligence plays a vital role in enhancing both customer and employee experiences, with Walmart’s AI efforts built around four super agents designed to handle different aspects of the business.

Leading the charge is Sparky, the smiling digital assistant in Walmart’s app. Sparky is already shifting the experience from search-based navigation to AI-powered assistance and is set to become the primary tool for product discovery, reorders and returns. Early feedback has been positive, and Walmart plans to scale Sparky into a more intelligent and personalized companion for shoppers.

Complementing Sparky are three more super agents. Starting with the associate agent, which will consolidate key functions such as scheduling and sales data into one hub. For suppliers and advertisers, another agent will simplify onboarding, order management and campaign execution, enhancing efficiency across Walmart’s ecosystem. The final developer agent is designed to accelerate innovation by improving how Walmart tests and launches new products.

Walmart has created leadership roles focused solely on artificial intelligence. WMT is exploring AI-powered digital twins of facilities that can predict or prevent issues and provide more accurate delivery windows covering 95% of U.S. households by the end of the year. By embedding artificial intelligence, Walmart is signaling that the next era of retail will be shaped as much by intelligent agents as by physical stores.

Colgate-Palmolive Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Colgate-Palmolive, you need to believe in the ongoing resilience of its global brands across consumer health and pet nutrition, especially as the company steps up investment in productivity. The recent dividend announcement combined with a US$200 million to US$300 million productivity initiative does not substantially change the near-term catalyst around margin pressures from raw material costs, nor does it greatly mitigate the key risk of prolonged consumer caution in major markets.

Among all recent announcements, the board’s decision to maintain the quarterly cash dividend at US$0.52 per share stands out as especially relevant, reinforcing confidence in steady shareholder returns despite ongoing economic challenges. This consistency may continue to support investor sentiment as the company pursues its 2030 goals, though actual topline acceleration still hinges on category recovery and relief in raw material input costs.

However, it is important to remember that ongoing volatility in raw material and packaging expenses remains a risk investors should not ignore, especially when...

Colgate-Palmolive's outlook anticipates $22.4 billion in revenue and $3.5 billion in earnings by 2028. This projection is based on 3.8% annual revenue growth and a $0.6 billion increase in earnings from the current $2.9 billion level.

, a 14% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Six community fair value estimates for Colgate-Palmolive span a wide range, from US$60.84 to US$129.42 per share. These differing perspectives highlight the importance of watching key risks such as rising input costs, which could shape the company’s performance in the months ahead.

Keeping costs down for consumers is paramount as the grocery industry ramps up e-commerce, Instacart CEO Chris Rogers said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Wednesday.

“Affordability is probably the biggest unlock to online grocery adoption. We know that it’s the No. 1 reason that people churn off of Instacart,” Rogers said, noting that affordability will be a “key lever” in retaining more consumers.

To that end, Instacart is working with its retail partners on their pricing strategies as well as integrating retailers’ loyalty programs and offering weekly flyers, said Rogers, who became CEO in mid-August after nearly six years with the grocery technology company, including three as its chief business officer.

While retailers decide how to price on Instacart, the grocery technology company is urging them to price at or just above in-store prices, Rogers said, noting that retailers that offer price parity outperform those that mark up prices on the Instacart platform.

“We’re going to really show the business case to retailers and show them the compelling reasons why they should do this and also just make sure that we’re educating them on the broader digital landscape,” Rogers said.

During the past 12 months, sales among price-parity retailers have grown, on average, 10 percentage points faster than among marked-up retailers, he noted.

“We’re also seeing on our platform that users that are shopping on price-parity retailers are retaining better, so the data is suggesting that this is a strategic move for our retail partners,” he said.

Earlier this year, Instacart announced that Schnuck Markets, Heritage Grocers Group and home improvement chain Lowe’s switched to price parity. Walmart Canada lowered its markup, as did Costco on its same-day delivery websites for the U.S. and Canada.

Instacart is testing merchandising tools within its app that highlight price-parity retailers, Rogers added.

The company is also focused on continuing the momentum with its enterprise platform. Instacart sees the opportunity to expand its tools for retailers’ sites beyond North America, Rogers said. The company’s acquisition earlier this year of e-commerce solutions provider Wynshop “kind of exposed the fact that there is real product market fit for our enterprise suite of products beyond [North America],” he said.

The final priority Rogers outlined for the company is accelerating its ads and data revenue as well as ramping up monetization of data through its newly launched Consumer Insights Portal.

“I had a retailer recently tell me that the amount that I’m writing them a check for the ads business is larger than the SaaS fee that they’re paying us for the storefront,” Rogers said, referring to the acronym for Software as a Service.

Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Medtronic.

Simply Wall St performs a valuation analysis on every stock in the world every day (check out Medtronic's valuation analysis). We show the entire calculation in full. You can track the result in your watchlist or portfolio and be alerted when this changes.

Approach 2: Medtronic Price vs Earnings

For a consistently profitable company like Medtronic, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is one of the most widely used and meaningful valuation metrics. It helps investors assess how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of Medtronic's earnings, providing a snapshot of both value and growth expectations.

Growth prospects and business risks play a significant role in determining what a ""normal"" PE ratio should be. Companies with strong growth and stable earnings often command higher PE multiples because investors anticipate future profits. On the other hand, when risks are elevated or future growth appears limited, the fair PE typically decreases.

Medtronic currently trades at a PE ratio of 25.9x. For context, the average PE ratio among its medical equipment peers is 47.4x, while the broader industry average is 29.1x. This suggests Medtronic is being valued more conservatively than many of its peers.

Simply Wall St's Fair Ratio calculation provides a more nuanced view by considering Medtronic's specific growth rates, risk profile, profit margins, and market cap. This tailored approach avoids the limitations of simple peer comparison and takes into account factors unique to Medtronic rather than relying on broad industry averages. Based on these inputs, Medtronic’s Fair Ratio is 27.5x.

With an actual PE of 25.9x and a Fair Ratio of 27.5x, Medtronic's valuation aligns closely with expectations for a business of its quality, growth, and risk.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Medtronic Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. Put simply, a Narrative is your personal story about Medtronic, combining what you think about its future (like expected revenue, margin, and risks) with how those beliefs translate into a fair value for the stock.

With Narratives, you move beyond just tracking numbers. You actually link the company’s business story, such as why it will succeed or struggle, to concrete financial forecasts and arrive at a price you believe is justified. Narratives are easy to create and update right inside Simply Wall St’s Community page, where millions of investors share and discuss their perspectives.

This approach is practical too: you can quickly compare your fair value with the market price to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell. Because Narratives update when fresh news or earnings arrive, your view stays relevant and informed. For example, some Medtronic Narratives currently see fair value as high as $112 if innovation and robotics outpace expectations, while others see value closer to $82 amid execution and margin concerns. This shows that what you believe about the business really can shape your investment choices.

But Meta’s glasses appear to be catching on with consumers; Ray-Ban parent EssilorLuxottica said in July that revenue from its Meta glasses more than tripled year-over-year.
Virtual assistants that can answer questions based on a user’s surroundings nearly instantly have made smart glasses much more practical.

People without smart glasses may one day be at a “significant cognitive disadvantage” compared to those who do use the tech, he told analysts.

That vision for the company’s future could come into focus this week during the Meta Connect conference, where the tech giant outlines its next steps and announces new products. Reports suggest Meta will announce a new pair of AI-powered smart glasses to follow its relatively successful Ray-Ban spectacles, which can analyze a wearer’s environment and answer questions about their surroundings.

The smart glasses have been a bright spot in Meta’s largely lackluster attempts to bet early on disruptive technologies. It missed out on the smartphone in the early 2000s. Then in 2021, the company tried to reorient its brand around the metaverse, which failed to reshape the internet in the way Zuckerberg had envisioned.

But Meta’s glasses appear to be catching on with consumers; Ray-Ban parent EssilorLuxottica said in July that revenue from its Meta glasses more than tripled year-over-year. And market research indicates Meta is the leading smart glasses brand by far.

Smart glasses aren’t likely to become as ubiquitous as smartphones anytime soon. But they could allow Meta to reach consumers directly, potentially reducing reliance on smartphones. That could be critical as Meta seeks to develop “personal superintelligence” — a vague term Zuckerberg has used to describe AI that “knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them.”

The pressure is on as a wave of tech giants including Samsung, Google and Meta’s longtime social media rival Snap prepare to launch new smart glasses. Amazon is also developing new glasses with augmented reality, a technology that places computer graphics over real-world surroundings, according to The Information.

Meta’s AI glasses push

Meta and Ray-Ban partnered on a pair of glasses in 2021 called the Ray-Ban Stories that were primarily designed for capturing photos and videos hands-free. But Meta was far from the first to explore using glasses for tasks like snapping photos, making calls and listening to music without reaching for your phone.

Snap and Amazon, in addition to a wave of smaller tech firms, have all released smart glasses for these purposes. Google was an early entrant in 2013 with Google Glass, although that device was unpopular with consumers because of its high price, unfashionable look, limited functionality and short battery life.

Tech giants believe this new wave of smart glasses will be different. The technologies required to power the glasses – like processors, batteries and cameras – are now easier to fit in smaller, more lightweight designs at a much lower price than Google Glass.

But AI advancements have been primarily driving these new smart glasses. Virtual assistants that can answer questions based on a user’s surroundings nearly instantly have made smart glasses much more practical. With Meta’s eyewear, for example, a user can look at a pepper and ask whether it’s spicy, or read a sign and ask Meta’s AI assistant to translate it into a different language.

Meta is said to be developing new smart glasses that include a display for viewing apps and notifications and a wristband for easier gesture control, according to Bloomberg. Meta will likely announce these spectacles at the Connect conference, which it said will focus on the “latest innovations in AI glasses,” among other things. Last year, the company announced a prototype for its Orion augmented reality glasses.

Meta declined to comment on potential plans to announce new glasses at this week’s event.

The current Ray-Ban Meta glasses don’t display anything on the lenses, meaning wearers rely on audio feedback or Meta’s phone app. That could put them at a disadvantage compared to upcoming glasses like those from Google, which have a display for showing information along with providing verbal answers.

“That’s going to be another challenge,” said Guillaume Chansin, an analyst with market research firm Counterpoint Research. “Like if you want to replace a smartphone, can you really do that without having some kind of visual feedback?”

Why Meta cares so much about smart glasses

The AI boom has led to a tech industry frenzy to capitalize on the technology, as companies fear being perceived as behind the potential next big thing.

“Everybody is looking for what’s coming after the smartphone,” said Chansin.

The success of Apple’s AirPods and other wireless earbuds could strengthen the case for smart glasses. While the devices are inherently different, they serve some of the same purposes, like making calls and communicating with digital assistants without pulling out your phone.

“As we look forward, maybe smart glasses are going to evolve into the AirPods of the future,” said Melissa Otto, head of research at investment research provider S&P Global Visible Alpha.

Meta faces an uphill battle. While demand for smart glasses seems to be growing fast (ABI Research predicts the market will ship 13 million units in 2026, up from 3.3 million in 2024), they’re still a niche product. Hundreds of millions of smartphones are shipped in one quarter alone, and there’s little indication that smart glasses will ever be nearly as widely adopted.

Reality Labs, the division of Meta responsible for the company’s AI glasses and Quest virtual reality headsets, saw a $4.5 billion operating loss in the company’s fiscal second quarter of 2025. By comparison, Meta’s apps generated $583 million in revenue.

So what’s really in it for Meta? While smart glasses may not be a revenue driver right now, they could potentially set the stage for a future in which Meta is less reliant on hardware makers like Apple and Google to distribute its apps.

Meta has previously butted heads with Apple over policies related to the iPhone maker’s App Store, and Zuckerberg has previously criticized the iPhone maker’s App Store dominance.

“Apple’s (app store) stands out as the only one where one company can control what apps get on the device,” Zuckerberg said during the New York Times’ Dealbook Summit in 2022.

If glasses become the primary way people video chat and browse social media feeds, selling its own eyewear could give Meta more control over the experience.

“I look at Facebook, look at Instagram, look at Reels, Threads through my iPhone,” said Otto. “I don’t do it through a laptop. I don’t do it through smart glasses. I do it through my iPhone.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-09-25t204232z-1101917728-rc2u7aaqtwho-rtrmadp-3-meta-platforms-virtual-reality-zuckerberg.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-15 08:07:04.817467

Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) has dropped -6.58% in recent trading, painting a weak picture on the technical charts, and analysts suggest caution. With seven bearish indicators outweighing the single bullish one, the stock is under pressure, and our internal diagnostic score (0-10) for technicals stands at just 2.41.

News Highlights

Recent headlines in the food sector offer mixed signals for KHC:

DoorDash's aggressive consolidation in the food delivery market could reshape industry dynamics. DoorDash's $3.9 billion acquisition of Deliveroo highlights a growing trend of scale and tech-driven logistics—both of which could indirectly pressure traditional packaged goods players like .

Global food labeling reforms are gaining traction, with India and the US tightening standards for nutritional transparency. While this is a long-term trend, it may affect KHC's product positioning and marketing strategies, especially in emerging markets.

India's reliance on imported food processing machinery highlights potential vulnerabilities in global supply chains—KHC's exposure to international manufacturing could be a risk to monitor, especially with rising trade tensions and inflationary pressures.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Analyst sentiment for KHC remains neutral, with five recent ratings all at ""Neutral."" The simple average rating is 3.00, while the performance-weighted rating is 2.64. This slight divergence shows analysts are cautious but not entirely bearish, though their recommendations are not aligned with the current -6.58% price decline.

On the fundamental side, here are the key metrics and their internal diagnostic scores (0-10):

EV/EBIT: -3.53 (score 3.00) – A relatively bearish signal as the company's enterprise value is not well supported by its earnings.

Net income / Revenue: -7.93% (score 3.00) – Indicates a shrinking profit margin, which is a red flag for investors.

ROA: -0.96% (score 1.00) – A weak return on assets highlights concerns about asset utilization and profitability.

Rate of return on total assets: -7.86% (score 1.00) – Suggests the company is struggling to generate returns from its asset base.

Annualized return on total assets: -15.73% (score 1.00) – A severe underperformance in asset returns, worsening on an annualized basis.

While some factors are positive, like the Net profit attributable to parent company shareholders / Net profit: 100.04% (score 3.00), the overall score for fundamentals is 7.21, suggesting there is underlying strength, but it is not enough to offset the bearish technical and flow signals.

Money-Flow Trends

Fund flows suggest a nuanced picture for KHC. Big-money (institutional) flows are trending positive, with an inflow ratio of 50.75% and a positive block trend. In contrast, retail (small) flows are negative, with a 48.07% inflow ratio, indicating that retail investors are pulling back. Our internal diagnostic score for fund flows is 7.76 (good), showing a strong institutional presence but caution for smaller investors.

Key Technical Signals

The technical outlook for KHC is bleak, with seven bearish signals versus one bullish one. Here are the key internal diagnostic scores (0-10) for recent indicators:

Bullish Engulfing: 8.08 – A rare positive signal, but it was countered by more bearish patterns.

WR Overbought: 1.00 – Suggests the stock is in an overbought range, a precursor to a sell-off.

MACD Death Cross: 2.62 – A bearish momentum signal, suggesting the downward trend may persist.

Ex-Dividend Date: 1.00 – Historically weak, with a 25% win rate and average -3.03% returns in the past.

MACD Golden Cross: 1.00 – A typically bullish signal but here it scored poorly, indicating a bearish trap.

On September 28, the stock saw a Bearish Engulfing pattern, and on August 29, multiple signals—WR Overbought, MACD Golden Cross, Ex-Dividend Date, and Bullish Engulfing—appeared simultaneously, suggesting a volatile phase in the chart. The key takeaway is that the stock is in a weak technical state, and the bearish indicators heavily outnumber the bullish ones.

Meanwhile, Costco has begun strictly enforcing early shopping hours exclusively for Executive Members. Together, these moves highlight two very different approaches to driving value in membership models — one focused on added choice, the other on enforced exclusivity.

Walmart: Bundling Through Choice

Walmart announced that Walmart+ members will soon be able to select either the ad-supported Paramount+ Essential plan or Peacock Premium as part of their membership. Subscribers may switch between the two streaming services once every 90 days.

The new option marks Walmart+’s fifth anniversary and expands on a bundle that previously only offered Paramount+. Importantly, pricing remains unchanged at $12.95 per month or $98 per year.

The service continues to include other core benefits, such as free grocery delivery, free shipping with no minimum order, fuel discounts, and prescription savings. By adding flexibility without raising prices, Walmart is clearly aiming to boost engagement and retention.

Costco: Exclusivity Through Enforcement

Costco, by contrast, has taken a harder line. As of September 1, only Executive Members — who pay $130 annually versus $65 for Gold Star or Business memberships — can enter warehouses during early access hours. Gold Star and Business members are now restricted to regular opening times.

The rule was introduced earlier this summer but was loosely enforced during a grace period. September marked the beginning of strict enforcement at warehouse doors, with non-Executive members turned away if they attempt early entry.

Executive Members represent nearly half of Costco’s subscriber base but deliver a disproportionate share of sales, making enforcement a strategic push to strengthen tier economics and encourage upgrades.

Industry Context

The two announcements underscore diverging strategies in subscription and membership design:

Walmart+ is layering in additive value, expanding its bundle by giving all members access to more choice and flexibility.

Costco is enforcing exclusivity, drawing sharper lines between tiers and requiring staff intervention to uphold the policy.

Both approaches highlight how subscription and membership businesses are experimenting with levers of retention and monetization. Where Walmart is betting that flexibility deepens engagement, Costco is relying on exclusivity to push upgrades and reinforce premium tiers.

INSIDER TAKE

For subscription executives, these developments illustrate critical strategic contrasts:

Flexibility vs. Restriction: Walmart’s quarterly streaming switch is designed to feel empowering, while Costco’s early-access rule creates a clear sense of exclusion. Both approaches can drive results, but they trigger very different customer emotions.

Perceived Value vs. Perceived Penalty: Walmart enhances value without changing price, framing the perk as a reward. Costco introduces friction for lower-tier members, risking pushback but betting the exclusivity will drive upgrades.

Tier Management Lessons: Costco demonstrates the revenue potential of enforcing premium tiers — but also the reputational risk. Walmart shows how a flat membership can still grow stickier through partnerships and flexible benefits.

The Bundling Imperative: Walmart’s partnership with both Paramount+ and Peacock reflects a larger trend: cross-industry alliances are becoming table stakes in consumer membership models. For subscription leaders, the lesson is to evaluate not just what’s bundled, but how much flexibility customers have in consuming those bundles.

The takeaway: loyalty programs and memberships are evolving in two distinct directions — additive flexibility and enforced exclusivity. Both can work, but each carries very different risks and rewards.",https://www.subscriptioninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Walmart-2-1920-x-1670.png,N,,2025-09-14 17:06:14.292857

Bullish and bearish indicators are in a standoff, with a weak technical outlook and mixed price momentum.

(BSX) is currently down 2.64%, trading in a volatile pattern that suggests investors should be cautious and watch for clearer signals.

News Highlights

Recent news in the healthcare sector has been mixed, but here are a few key stories worth noting:

Healthcare Infrastructure Financing: Stanford Health Care announced a $424.9 million municipal bond sale to fund projects and refund debt. While this doesn’t directly affect , it shows continued investment in the healthcare infrastructure, which could bode well for long-term demand.

AI in Healthcare Billing: Healthpoint Ventures, a Tennessee-based startup, is using AI to streamline healthcare billing, partnering with regional providers like Williamson Health. Innovations like this could indirectly benefit medical device companies like Boston Scientific by boosting overall sector efficiency and growth.

Competitive Moves in Medical Devices: saw a price uptick after Boston Scientific announced the discontinuation of its rival heart-valve replacement systems. This kind of competitive shift can impact market sentiment and stock performance.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Analysts remain divided but leaning toward optimism, with a simple average rating of 4.50 and a performance-weighted rating of 5.62. However, this optimism contrasts with the current price drop, which shows the market's expectations are not fully aligned with near-term stock performance.

Fundamental Highlights

Price-to-Sales (PS) ratio: 28.90 (value: 28.89) with an internal diagnostic score of 1. High PS may signal overvaluation or strong revenue expectations.

Net Profit Margin (NPM): 15.71% (value: 0.1571) with a strong internal diagnostic score of 3. Healthy profitability remains a key strength.

Return on Assets (ROA): 1.91% (value: 0.0191) with a moderate internal diagnostic score of 2. Suggests decent but not exceptional asset utilization.

Return on Equity (ROE): 3.51% (value: 0.0351) with a moderate internal diagnostic score of 1. ROE is relatively low, indicating room for improvement in shareholder returns.

Cash flow from operations to assets (Cash-UP): 90.37% (value: 0.9037) with a strong internal diagnostic score of 3. Strong operational cash flow is a positive sign.

Money-Flow Trends

Big-money investors and institutional flows are showing a negative trend, with all sizes of inflows—small, medium, large, and extra-large—slightly below 50%. The fund-flow score of 7.59 (good) indicates that while large-scale investors are pulling back, the overall flow still shows some strength in retail and smaller institutional buying.

Key Technical Signals

The technical outlook for BSX remains weak and volatile, with more bearish indicators than bullish ones active in the last five days.

Internal Diagnostic Scores

Williams %R Overbought: internal diagnostic score of 3.2 — suggesting limited upside potential.

MACD Death Cross: internal diagnostic score of 2.2 — bearish momentum is gaining strength.

Bullish Engulfing: internal diagnostic score of 2.67 — typically a bullish candlestick pattern but currently leaning bearish.

Shooting Star: internal diagnostic score of 7.27 — a strong bearish reversal signal.

Hanging Man: internal diagnostic score of 7.17 — also a bearish top reversal pattern.

Recent Chart Patterns

2025-09-03: Hanging Man and WR Overbought signals suggest a potential top in the short term.

2025-09-09: A Shooting Star pattern appears — a red flag for bearish reversal.

2025-09-11: WR Oversold and MACD Death Cross signals suggest the stock is overextended and likely to correct.

Technical Summary

The overall technical score is 4.37, with 4 bearish and only 2 bullish indicators active in the last five days. The key insight is that the market is in a volatile state with no clear directional bias, and investors are advised to monitor market changes closely.

Headline Takeaway:

(ECL) is in a technical neutral zone, with no strong directional signal from recent indicators. The price has fallen by 1.60% recently, which contrasts with a relatively balanced analyst sentiment.

News Highlights

Recent news highlights include significant policy shifts in the U.S. regarding Covid-19 vaccines, the Trump administration’s push to fast-track uranium mining in Utah, and developments around Ethereum and

ETFs by REX Shares. These events reflect broader market uncertainty, especially around regulatory and policy changes, which may indirectly affect Ecolab’s operations in the industrial and healthcare sectors.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab has received a simple average analyst rating of 3.67 and a performance-weighted rating of 3.26. The ratings are relatively neutral to slightly positive, but there is notable dispersion in analyst views, with one ""Neutral"" and two ""Buy"" ratings over the past 20 days. This divergence doesn’t strongly align with the recent price drop of 1.60%, indicating mixed expectations among market participants.

Key fundamental factors include:

Price-to-Earnings (PE): 148.64 – Score: 0.00 (internal diagnostic score). High valuation relative to earnings.

Cost of sales ratio: 55.48% – Score: 1.00. Suggests moderate cost burden.

CFOA (Cash Flow from Operating Activities per Share YoY): -14.74% – Score: 2.00. Indicates a sharp decline in operating cash flow.

Fixed assets turnover ratio: 2.01 – Score: 1.00. Suggests efficient use of fixed assets.

Cash-UP (Cash to Market Value): 0.65 – Score: 3.00. Indicates a moderate liquidity position.

Money-Flow Trends

Big-money and retail flow patterns for Ecolab show a negative overall trend, with all major investor categories (Large, Extra-large,

.) showing outflows. The overall inflow ratio is 47.43%, which suggests that even within the negative trend, some inflows are happening, but not enough to reverse the pattern. This could indicate cautious positioning by institutional players and retreating confidence from smaller investors.

Key Technical Signals

From a technical perspective, Ecolab’s chart shows no bullish signals, but one bearish signal and one neutral signal. The most recent indicators include:

WR Oversold – Internal diagnostic score: 3.71 (neutral rise, 53.66% win rate, avg. return: 0.33%).

Bearish Engulfing – Internal diagnostic score: 6.56 (neutral rise, 62.5% win rate, avg. return: 0.84%).

Recent chart patterns over the last 5 days show multiple instances of WR Oversold (on 9/10, 9/03, 9/02, 9/09) and one Bearish Engulfing on 9/05. These suggest that while the market is not decisively bearish, volatility and lack of direction are key features of the current technical landscape. The overall trend is neutral, and traders are advised to wait for a clearer signal before committing to a position.

Investor Confidence: Balancing Risk and Reward Investor sentiment toward agribusiness has grown more nuanced in recent years.
Corteva's proposed split addresses this by reducing ambiguity around liability exposure—a critical factor in a sector where litigation over chemical safety has cost firms billions.
Data from Corteva's 2024 financials reveals a 40% revenue split between seeds ($9.5 billion) and pesticides ($7.4 billion) .
Conclusion: A Strategic Inflection Point Corteva's potential split represents more than a corporate restructuring—it is a recalibration of risk and growth in an industry at a crossroads.","Corporate restructuring has long served as a catalyst for unlocking value in capital-intensive industries, and agribusiness is no exception.

Agriscience, the $50-billion agribusiness giant formed from the 2019 merger of Dow and DuPont's agricultural divisions, is reportedly exploring a strategic split of its seed and pesticide operations into two distinct entities Report: Corteva Agriscience is Looking to Breakup Its Seed[ 5 ]. This move, if executed, would align with broader industry trends toward specialization, ESG compliance, and liability mitigation while addressing investor demands for clarity in an increasingly fragmented market.

Industry Trends: Specialization and ESG-Driven Restructuring

The agribusiness sector has seen a surge in corporate restructurings in 2025, driven by the need to address climate risks, regulatory pressures, and evolving investor expectations. Companies like

and have similarly pursued spin-offs or divestitures to streamline operations and focus on core competencies . For Corteva, separating its seed and pesticide businesses could insulate its high-growth seed division from potential liabilities tied to crop protection products, a strategy mirrored by Bayer AG's earlier restructuring efforts Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ].

This shift reflects a broader industry pivot toward specialization. Precision agriculture, biotechnology, and sustainable practices are redefining competitive advantages, with investors increasingly favoring companies that demonstrate clear ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) progress. Corteva's 2024 Impact Report underscores this trend, highlighting innovations such as drought-resistant seeds and biocontrol agents that align with global sustainability goals Report: Corteva Agriscience is Looking to Breakup Its Seed[ 5 ]. By isolating its seed business, Corteva could amplify its ESG narrative, a critical factor in attracting capital amid heightened scrutiny of agricultural chemical footprints.

Financial Implications: Sharper Focus, Enhanced Returns

Corteva's financial framework through 2027 emphasizes cost reductions, productivity gains, and $4.5 billion in shareholder returns Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. A split could accelerate these objectives by allowing each business unit to optimize capital allocation. For instance, the seed division—responsible for $9.5 billion of Corteva's 2024 sales—might reinvest more aggressively in gene editing and biologicals, while the pesticide unit could prioritize compliance with tightening regulations on chemical usage.

Historical case studies reinforce this logic. Bayer's separation of its crop science division in 2018, though later merged again, initially boosted investor confidence by clarifying operational risks and growth prospects Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. Similarly, Corteva's proposed split could create two distinct investment vehicles: a pure-play seed company with recurring revenue streams and a crop protection firm focused on innovation in low-impact solutions. This duality may appeal to a broader range of investors, from those prioritizing long-term agricultural resilience to those seeking short-term gains in high-margin chemical markets.

ESG Compliance: A Dual-Track Strategy for Sustainability

Environmental liabilities have become a defining challenge for agribusinesses. Corteva's pesticide division, while profitable, faces mounting pressure from regulators and advocacy groups over the ecological impacts of synthetic chemicals. By decoupling this unit, the company could redirect resources toward its seed business, which is central to addressing food security and climate adaptation.

The split also aligns with Corteva's 2027 ESG targets, including $1 billion in cost savings from sustainable practices Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. For example, its advancements in bee vectoring technology and biofertilizers—highlighted in the 2024 Investor Day presentation—position the seed division as a leader in regenerative agriculture Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, the pesticide unit could adopt stricter compliance protocols, such as those seen in Bayer's recent herbicide innovations, to mitigate reputational risks Bayer submits registration applications for novel herbicide in four major markets[ 3 ]. This dual-track approach ensures both units contribute to ESG goals without diluting their core missions.

Investor Confidence: Balancing Risk and Reward

Investor sentiment toward agribusiness has grown more nuanced in recent years. While commodity prices and weather volatility remain concerns, stakeholders now prioritize companies that demonstrate adaptability to systemic risks. Corteva's proposed split addresses this by reducing ambiguity around liability exposure—a critical factor in a sector where litigation over chemical safety has cost firms billions.

Data from Corteva's 2024 financials reveals a 40% revenue split between seeds ($9.5 billion) and pesticides ($7.4 billion) . A separation would allow each unit to be valued independently, potentially unlocking hidden equity value. For instance, the seed business's recurring revenue model and R&D pipeline in gene editing could command a premium valuation, while the pesticide unit's focus on compliance-driven innovation might attract investors seeking stable cash flows in a regulated environment.

Conclusion: A Strategic Inflection Point

Corteva's potential split represents more than a corporate restructuring—it is a recalibration of risk and growth in an industry at a crossroads. By aligning with ESG imperatives, embracing specialization, and addressing liability concerns, the company could position itself as a leader in the next phase of agribusiness evolution. For investors, the move offers a clearer lens to assess value creation in two distinct but complementary markets. As the agribusiness sector navigates the dual pressures of climate change and technological disruption, Corteva's decision may well set a precedent for how legacy firms adapt to secure long-term relevance.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757739219976.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-13 21:02:40.669310

Dive Brief:

Kroger will fuel modernization with AI as it deploys use cases to operate more efficiently, improve customer experience and boost sales, executives said during the grocer’s Q2 2025 earnings call Thursday.

“Accelerating our AI efforts is a natural step for Kroger, given our long history of leadership in data and machine learning,” Chairman and interim CEO Ron Sargent said Thursday. “Where we’ve implemented AI in different parts of the organization, we’re seeing results with more competitive pricing, shrink improvements and faster fulfillment.”

Cost optimization and operational efficiencies are top priorities for the grocer as it looks to move forward from its failed merger with Albertsons. Same-store sales excluding fuel rose 3.4%during the second quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of increase for this metric. The company also raised its identical sales growth forecast for the 2025 fiscal year.

Dive Insight:

Grocers, like other retailers, have increased their appetite for emerging technologies as leaders look to alleviate the effects of economic headwinds and add a competitive edge.

In April, Albertsons executives said the company was strengthening its data capabilities in pursuit of AI adoption. Walmart and Instacart have also worked to scale AI capabilities.

Kroger credits its “couple decades worth” of loyalty program data, a “deep bench of data science capability” and its 84.51° division for laying the foundation for its AI efforts, EVP and CFO David Kennerley said during the call Thursday.

Despite the focus on modernization, Kroger has reduced staff in related departments. In August, workers in Kroger’s Technology and Digital division were impacted. The company also laid off employees in 84.51°, the grocer’s retail analytics subsidiary, in March. The reduction in staff was an effort to “focus on the key priorities that power our go-to-market strategy,” a spokesperson told Grocery Dive.

GIS is likely to register a decline in its top and bottom lines when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Sept. 17.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 81 cents per share, indicating a decrease of 24.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.5%, on average.

The consensus estimate for General Mills’ quarterly revenues is pegged at $4.50 billion, which indicates a 7.1% decrease from the year-ago quarter.

Things to Know About GIS’ Q1 Earnings

General Mills operates in a highly competitive and price-sensitive food industry, where grocery inflation is weighing heavily on consumer spending. Reduced discretionary food spending by budget-conscious consumers remains a major obstacle to volume recovery. The company is also grappling with macroeconomic and operational headwinds across international markets, especially in China, where consumer demand remains subdued.

Additionally, sluggish trends in the U.S. snacking categories and softer demand in the away-from-home foodservice channel have further added to the company’s challenges. Persistence of such trends remains a concern for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. We expect price/mix to drop 1.8% and volume to decline 1.2% in the fiscal first quarter.

However, General Mills is leveraging brand strength, innovation, cost savings and portfolio reshaping to enhance market share. The company has unveiled a multi-year global transformation initiative, part of its Accelerate strategy, to fuel growth. While General Mills has implemented cost-saving initiatives under its Holistic Margin Management strategy, persistent inflationary pressures continue to impact its performance. These broad-based cost challenges, combined with weakening consumer demand and tariff woes, underscore the tough landscape facing General Mills in the near term.

Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE: BDX) is a heavyweight in the global medical technology game. The business is split into three key segments: BD Medical (think syringes, needles, and devices that keep hospitals humming), BD Life Sciences (diagnostics and biosciences kits), and BD Interventional (surgical and critical care gadgets). BD gets its products into the hands of hospitals, clinical labs, pharma companies, and more, using a mix of direct sales teams in big markets and distributors everywhere else. Revenue comes from items you buy often (like disposable needles), big-ticket machines (such as infusion pumps and diagnostic analyzers), and extra services (analytics, consulting). The medtech and diagnostics space is built on steady demand from aging populations, rising chronic illness, and constant innovation. BD’s main rivals include Medtronic, Abbott, Baxter, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Stryker, and Edwards Lifesciences. Thanks to its diverse lineup and global reach, BD has a solid competitive moat—recurring sales, close ties with customers, and enough scale to hold onto pricing power in a lot of product lines.

Recent Performance

From September 2024 to September 11, 2025, BD's shares fell by 17.89%, while the S&P 500 rose 14.92%. This slump mainly comes down to shrinking valuation multiples and worries about near-term growth, especially in BD’s Life Sciences unit (with rumors of a possible divestiture swirling around). Tech stocks and growth names have been in vogue, widening the gap even further.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

BD’s revenue isn’t exactly sprinting—it’s grown a modest 4.8% over the past year, lagging behind the broader market’s 8.7%. The Medical segment is the bright spot, riding a rebound in elective procedures, with third quarter sales up 5.1% year-over-year. BD’s poised to boost its intensive care unit presence with the $900 million-a-year Critical Care business from Edwards Lifesciences (deal expected to close by end-2024). Meanwhile, BD’s looking to offload its $21 billion biosciences and diagnostics business—a move that could free up capital for faster-growing areas, with a deal targeted for late 2025.

Quality & Moat

BD’s operating margin stands at 11.3%—a bit higher than its five-year average (10.5%) but trailing the market’s 18.2%. Returns are modest: return on invested capital (ROIC) is 4.8%, just above BD’s past five-year average but well below the market’s 11.1%. The consumables franchise keeps recurring cash flowing, but free cash flow yield has dipped to –4.1% (historic average is +1.4%), mainly due to inventory build-up and working capital needs. CEO Tom Polen has kept a tight rein, returning around $1.1 billion through dividends and $0.5 billion via buybacks in 2024, while still investing in research and strategic deals.

Valuation

BD trades at a forward P/E of 31.1×—a premium over the market’s 26.0×—thanks to its defensive business model and reliable cash flow, though there’s not much room for near-term upside. The EV/Sales ratio is 3.2×, below both BD’s five-year average (4.1×) and the market’s (4.6×), hinting at some valuation cushion if growth picks up. The high earnings multiple is partly justified by BD’s low beta (0.55) and steady revenues, but negative free cash flow puts a question mark on margins and capital efficiency.

Market Sentiment

Analyst opinion is split: most stick to ‘Hold,’ with average price targets about 5% above the current share price. Short interest is tame at 2% of float, so there’s not much bearish betting. Big institutions own around 85% of the shares, and insider buying has been quiet. News about the potential Life Sciences divestiture has kept the stock in check, though if management executes cleanly, investors see the move as adding value.

Key Risks

High leverage and working capital strain: BDX’s net debt sits at 3.8× EBITDA—much higher than the market average of 1.4×. That eats into financial flexibility and ups the refinancing risk if interest rates stay high.

Moderate profitability metrics: ROIC of 4.8% and operating margins of about 11.3% don’t stack up well next to medtech peers (averaging around 18%), so free cash flow will probably stay muted until margins improve.

Execution risk on divestitures: Spinning off the Life Sciences business won’t be easy. Tax-friendly structures like a reverse Morris trust could complicate things, dragging out timelines and drawing management’s eye from the core business.

Competitive pressures and pricing: Fierce competition from heavyweights like Medtronic, Abbott, Thermo Fisher—and upstarts too—could put pressure on prices for BD’s bread-and-butter products.

Regulatory and litigation exposure: BD is in a tightly regulated industry. Product recalls, legal battles, or new healthcare rules could inflate costs and ding the company’s reputation.

Bull Case

Defensive, recurring revenue base: A big chunk of sales comes from consumables and disposables—which keeps cash coming in, even when the economy wobbles.

Strategic M&A and portfolio optimization: Adding Edwards’ Critical Care business should strengthen growth. Shedding slower-growing assets could unlock value and sharpen BD’s focus on its core medtech strengths.

Operational improvement initiatives: Management’s ‘grow, simplify, empower’ strategy is underway, aiming to fatten up margins by streamlining manufacturing and tightening up the supply chain.

Shareholder returns: BD keeps shareholders sweet with dividends and buybacks. If it pockets extra cash from asset sales, expect more buybacks.

Valuation support: With the EV/Sales ratio below its own history and the broader market average, there’s a potential cushion if growth stabilizes.

Bear Case

Valuation premium: A forward P/E of 31× is steep — even if EV/Sales looks cheap by comparison. Unless the multiple expands, there’s a ceiling on upside.

Negative free cash flow: Building up working capital and snapping up new businesses has pushed cash flow into the red, raising doubts about how sustainable BD’s cash generation really is.

Execution risks on divestitures: If spinning off the Life Sciences unit drags on or gets muddled, BD could stay stuck in the slow lane with too much complexity.

Margin pressure: Underwhelming profits from diagnostics and biosciences may need a restructuring—and that could mean spending cuts that crimp future growth.

High debt burden: At roughly 4× EBITDA, BD’s leverage magnifies risks from higher interest rates and ties its hands on new investments.

On Our Radar

Q4 FY 2025 earnings release: Expected in late November 2025. Investors will be keen to see how organic growth and margin guidance are shaping up during BD’s ongoing portfolio shakeup.

Life Sciences divestiture decision: Due by the end of 2025. How BD chooses to spin off, sell, or structure its Life Sciences business will play a huge role in shaping capital allocation and valuation.

Waters Corporation merger close: Watch for the sale of BD’s biosciences division to Waters for $17.5 billion—expected by the first quarter of 2026. Keep an eye on deal progress and how the proceeds get used.

FDA approvals for new devices: Clearances for new infusion pumps and diagnostics, expected late in 2025, could give BD some extra sales momentum.

Investment Conclusion

BDX stands out as a defensive medtech player, anchored by steady consumables revenue and a history of disciplined capital returns. But growth has cooled off, and the balance sheet carries a heavy load—negative free cash flow and profitability that trails the peer group. Long-term investors might see potential for value if management nails its next round of acquisitions in critical care and successfully sheds slower-growing assets. Near-term, though, there’s no escaping the risks tied to portfolio moves and premium price tags. Patient, risk-aware investors might want to wait for a clearer path—possibly accumulating shares on dips, once BD’s portfolio puzzle pieces have locked into place, balancing the company’s steady income stream against its debt and slimmer margins.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-12 12:26:18.613126

Shares of the company, which also beat second-quarter comparable sales and profit estimates, were up about 3% in early trading.

Retailers such as Kroger, Albertsons and Walmart have been able to buck a slowdown in the broader industry as consumers, especially from lower-income households, snap up cheaper must-haves as they hunt for value.

Many consumers are also increasingly seeking bargains, according to second-quarter earnings reports and comments from industry executives over the past month.

""Food-at-home sits favorably in times of consumer stress and in terms of tariff exposure, and Kroger has opened FY'25 with consecutive guidance increases,"" said Bill Kirk, analyst with Roth Capital Partners.

Walmart and Dollar General raised their annual sales forecasts, indicating wealthier U.S. shoppers were also flocking to their stores worried about the effects of tariffs on prices.

Kroger, which is relatively less exposed to U.S. tariffs, said in June it had been focusing on promotions and maintaining low prices to meet growing customer demand for value.

The company then said it had slashed prices on more than 2,000 products so far this year.

""Sales growth has been strong, led by pharmacy, eCommerce and Fresh, and we are encouraged by the improvement in grocery volumes,"" Chief Financial Officer David Kennerley said in a statement on Thursday.

Kroger expects full-year comparable sales to increase in the range of 2.7% to 3.4%, versus its prior forecast of a 2.25% to 3.25% rise.

The company also raised the lower-end of its annual profit forecast to $4.70 from $4.60, while retaining the upper-end at $4.80.

Quarterly identical sales, without fuel, increased 3.4%, compared with analysts' estimates of 2.84%, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Kroger, which is in the middle of a legal battle with Albertsons after their $25 billion deal collapsed, posted an adjusted profit of $1.04 per share for the quarter, topping estimates of 99 cents.

Takeaway:

(ECL) shows signs of technical neutrality with a wait-and-see stance, and recent price action has fallen by -4.03%. While bullish and bearish indicators are nearly balanced, investors are advised to monitor market changes closely.

News Highlights

Recent global and economic developments could influence Ecolab’s performance. Here are a few highlights:

U.S. vaccine policy changes are expected to impact public health and healthcare sectors. While not directly related to Ecolab, these shifts may influence overall market sentiment.

Trump’s fast-tracking of a Utah uranium mine signals a potential shift in energy policy and resource development, which may indirectly affect Ecolab’s industrial and environmental clients.

China’s factory activity contracted in May, but signs of recovery are emerging. A slowdown in global manufacturing could affect Ecolab’s international business operations.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Ecolab’s recent analyst ratings are mixed, with three institutions offering differing perspectives:

Simple average rating: 3.67 (indicating a cautiously bullish bias)

Performance-weighted rating: 3.26 (showing analysts with stronger historical performance have slightly more bearish expectations)

Rating consistency: Analysts are not aligned—two “Buy” ratings and one “Neutral” rating are currently active.

This mixed analyst sentiment contrasts with the recent 4.03% price decline, suggesting a misalignment between market expectations and current price movements.

Key fundamental values and scores:

Return on Assets (ROA): 2.23% (internal diagnostic score: 3.0)

Cash flow from operations (CFOA): 2.96% (score: 3.0)

Net income-to-revenue ratio: 31.89% (score: 2.0)

Current assets turnover ratio: 1.18x (score: 3.0)

Non-current liabilities / Total liabilities: 65.88% (score: 2.0)

Ecolab’s fundamentals are mixed, with stronger performance in operating cash flow and turnover, but moderate profitability and heavy long-term liabilities.

Money-Flow Trends

Ecolab has experienced negative fund-flow trends across all investor categories, with retail investors (small) contributing the least inflow at 48.57% and large and extra-large investors contributing 47.46% and 46.25% respectively. The overall inflow ratio stands at 46.91%, suggesting a cautious stance among big players. The negative trend in all categories reinforces the idea that investors are taking a wait-and-see approach, especially with mixed technical and fundamental signals.

Key Technical Signals

Technical analysis reveals a complex and neutral setup for Ecolab:

WR Oversold: Shows an internal diagnostic score of 3.94—a moderate strength signal with a 55.0% win rate and an average return of 0.38% over historical signals.

Bearish Engulfing: This pattern shows a stronger bullish bias with a 7.82 score—a 71.43% win rate and an average return of 1.17% when activated.

Looking at recent patterns, the Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern was activated on 2025-09-05, alongside a recurring WR Oversold signal. These signals have appeared frequently in the past five days, indicating a volatile but indecisive market.

Key insight: Technical indicators are showing a balanced mix of long and short signals, with no clear trend emerging. Investors are advised to monitor developments closely and be ready for sudden swings.

Companies (EL) has embarked on a bold transformation under its newly appointed leadership team, with innovation at the core of its ""Beauty Reimagined"" strategy. This strategic pivot, introduced in February 2025, aims to restore sustainable sales growth and rebuild stakeholder confidence after years of declining performance. For investors, the question is whether this leadership evolution—marked by a focus on disruptive technologies, agile execution, and consumer-centric innovation—can translate into long-term shareholder value.

Leadership Realignment: A Foundation for Change

The appointment of Stéphane de La Faverie as CEO in January 2025 signaled a decisive shift in EL's corporate direction. De La Faverie, a veteran of LVMH and L'Oréal, brings a track record of scaling luxury beauty brands. His leadership has been paired with the hiring of René Lammers, Ph.D., as Executive Vice President and Chief Research & Innovation Officer, a role critical to advancing EL's innovation agendaRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ]. Lammers' expertise in science-based platforms and global R&D partnerships aligns with the company's goal of accelerating product development cycles and capturing emerging trendsRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ].

This leadership realignment has already yielded tangible results. For fiscal 2025, equity awards tied to performance metrics were earned at 70.1% of the target, reflecting progress toward strategic goals despite a challenging operating environment[PRE 14A] The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Preliminary Proxy Statement[ 2 ]. While this fell short of the initial 100% target, it underscores the performance-based nature of leadership incentives and the company's commitment to accountability.

Innovation-Driven Growth: From Lab to Market

EL's innovation strategy under ""Beauty Reimagined"" is not just about product launches—it's about redefining the beauty industry's relationship with consumers. In fiscal 2025, the company rolled out breakthrough products such as La Mer's Night Recovery Concentrate and the M·A·C Nudes Collection, both designed to address evolving consumer preferences for personalized, science-backed solutionsThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ]. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to expand ""consumer coverage"" through digital platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon's U.S. and Canadian Premium Beauty storesThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ].

The financials tell a mixed story. While net sales declined 8% year-over-year to $14.3 billion in fiscal 2025The Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ], gross margin expanded to 74.0% due to operational efficiencies and pricing actionsThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ]. However, operating losses widened to (5.5)% of sales, driven by goodwill impairments and restructuring chargesThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ]. For investors, the key takeaway is that

is prioritizing long-term innovation over short-term profitability—a risky but potentially rewarding bet.

Strategic Risks and Rewards

The path to restoring growth is fraught with challenges. EL's fiscal 2025 results highlight the difficulty of competing in a saturated beauty market, where consumer spending remains fragmented across categories. Yet the company's focus on ""disruptive technologies"" and collaborations with academic institutionsRené Lammers Appointed Chief Research & Innovation Officer[ 3 ] suggests a willingness to invest in high-impact R&D. This approach mirrors successful models in tech and pharma, where breakthrough innovation drives decades of value.

A critical test will be the execution of ""Beauty Reimagined"" in fiscal 2026. The company has signaled optimism about returning to positive sales growth after three years of declinesThe Estée Lauder Companies Reports Fiscal 2025 Results[ 1 ], but this will require not only compelling products but also disciplined cost management. The 28% reduction in senior leadership compensation[PRE 14A] The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Preliminary Proxy Statement[ 2 ] and de La Faverie's performance-based equity grants ($10 million target[PRE 14A] The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

The Bottom Line for Investors

For long-term investors, Estee Lauder's leadership evolution presents a compelling case study in balancing innovation with accountability.

However, this breakneck expansion is creating significant challenges, including a pervasive trust deficit, rising operational costs, and critical governance gaps that organizations are struggling to address.

“As organizations scale Agentic AI, they need to focus on priorities that deliver meaningful value with non-regrettable risk. This requires a unified enterprise framework that ensures consistent standards for ethics, access, orchestration, and observability,” said Craig Suckling, Chief AI Officer of Capgemini Europe.

Generative AI adoption reaches global scale

Generative AI has transitioned from experimental pilots to core business operations at a remarkable pace. Adoption has surged from a mere 6% of organizations in 2023 to 30% in 2025, representing a fivefold increase in just two years.

Currently, a significant percentage, which is 93% of companies, are actively investigating, experimenting with, or deploying GenAI capabilities in their operations. Industries such as telecommunications, consumer goods, and aerospace and defense are leaders in customer operations, marketing, and IT.

This is being driven by substantial and increasing investment, and most organizations report tangible benefits. Eighty-eight percent of organizations are spending more on GenAI, on average, 9% more investments in the last year, with 12% of the total IT budget allocated to the technology.

The returns are also evident, with 79% of organizations expressing satisfaction with their Gen AI results, citing increased innovation and productivity benefits.

Trust and governance gaps threaten AI scaling

Despite rapid adoption, a significant trust barrier prevents the full-scale deployment of autonomous AI systems.

Only 71% of organizations claim to be able to trust autonomous AI agents to be used in the enterprise to the full extent. It is due to security worries of 65%, the risk of privacy of 62%, and the threat of biased results of 51% that this skepticism is based on the deeper fear of relinquishing control without any verifiable assurances.

The lack of trust is complicated by a general inability to introduce efficient governance structures. Although almost half, which is 46% of organizations, have developed AI governance policies, nearly half of them, which is 47% are concerned that their employees rarely adhere to them.

Furthermore, governance is inconsistently applied across business functions in 47% of organizations, and dedicated oversight bodies, like a Chief AI Officer or an ethics committee, are found in only a minority of firms, leaving AI systems without adequate guardrails or accountability.

Retailers such as Kroger, Albertsons and Walmart have been able to buck a slowdown in the broader industry as consumers, especially from lower-income households, snap up cheaper must-haves as they hunt for value.

Many consumers are also increasingly seeking bargains, according to second-quarter earnings reports and comments from industry executives over the past month.

“Food-at-home sits favourably in times of consumer stress and in terms of tariff exposure, and Kroger has opened FY'25 with consecutive guidance increases,” said Bill Kirk, analyst with Roth Capital Partners.

Walmart and Dollar General raised their annual sales forecasts, indicating wealthier US shoppers were also flocking to their stores worried about the effects of tariffs on prices.

Kroger, which is relatively less exposed to US tariffs, said in June it had been focusing on promotions and maintaining low prices to meet growing customer demand for value.

The company then said it had slashed prices on more than 2,000 products so far this year.

For the first time, it is expanding its franchise operations into Asia, in partnership with SPC Group, a South Korea-based food company. Through this accretive partnership, CMG plans to open the first Chipotle restaurants in South Korea and Singapore in 2026.

The collaboration is strategically important because it provides Chipotle with an existing supply chain, operational support and knowledge of the local market — all of which will help mitigate the execution risks that accompany global expansion. Besides, the growing brand awareness among consumers for the company — thanks to Korean band artists — has bolstered this strategic move.

This project lays the foundation for further growth throughout Asia, which could prove to be a significant long-term growth engine and revenue diversification opportunity for Chipotle.

Chipotle’s Footprint Expansion Initiatives

Chipotle continues to execute on its long-term growth strategy by delivering exceptional food and hospitality as well as minimizing its expenses. It remains committed to improving the guest experience, emphasizing value and strengthening brand relevance in a challenging consumer environment. Looking ahead, the company plans to further highlight its value proposition by introducing new menu innovations, expanding its loyalty program and rolling out targeted marketing campaigns.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Chipotle advanced its expansion strategy by opening 61 new restaurants across the United States and Canada, including 47 Chipotlanes, and reaffirmed its target of 315 to 345 new openings for the year. The company is also deepening its international presence through strategic partnerships. In Mexico, Chipotle is collaborating with Alsea, a leading restaurant operator in Latin America and Europe, with the debut location expected to open in early 2026. In the Middle East, its partnership with Alshaya Group is set to accelerate development in the back half of 2025. Together, these initiatives provide a gateway into high-potential growth markets and strengthen Chipotle’s ability to extend its brand globally.

Shares of CMG have declined 22.7% in the past six months against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s 12.7% rise. Also, weakening consumer confidence, tariff pressures and high expenses are a concern. Going forward, Chipotle intends to leverage digital programs to expand access and customer convenience.
