S&P Global Ratings has restored Morocco’s investment-grade status, making it the only African sovereign Eurobond issuer with such a ranking.

The agency on Friday upgraded Morocco’s long-term foreign-currency rating to BBB- from BB+, with a stable outlook, placing it on par with Hungary and Oman.

Morocco had lost its investment-grade status in 2021 after the pandemic and drought battered its tourism- and agriculture-dependent economy, according to Bloomberg.

“Morocco’s recent economic performance and its outlook are supported by its policy mix and strong structural socioeconomic and budgetary reform momentum,” S&P wrote in a statement.

Rating boost to attract investment

The rating boost is expected to help Morocco attract foreign direct investment to drive growth and ease unemployment in its $154 billion economy. S&P projects a gradual decline in the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio as higher revenue narrows the fiscal deficit.

Should It Change What I Buy? - The New York Times,"Kwame Anthony Appiah, www.nytimes.com, kwame-anthony-appiah",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/27/magazine/magazine-email/sweatshops-clothing-ethics.html,"I am aware that concerns have been raised about human rights conditions in some manufacturing facilities in developing countries and in China.
— Barbara P. From the Ethicist: The United Nations’ “Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights” holds that companies have a responsibility to respect human rights and address abuses in their supply chains.
So you wouldn’t go wrong to raise the issue with the folks in H.R.
Don’t believe H.R.
A talk with H.R.?","I have been thinking a lot lately about better aligning my values with my purchasing decisions, particularly when it comes to clothing. I am aware that concerns have been raised about human rights conditions in some manufacturing facilities in developing countries and in China. My inclination is not to purchase from companies that appear to be unconcerned about the working conditions in their overseas factories. I also realize, however, that many people, often in poor conditions, depend on these jobs to support themselves and their families. Are there ethical guidelines to help me decide if I am doing the right thing? — Barbara P.

From the Ethicist:

The United Nations’ “Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights” holds that companies have a responsibility to respect human rights and address abuses in their supply chains. These days, many corporations have adopted such policies and set standards for their suppliers, though monitoring remains uneven and abuses persist. For a consumer, this means most large companies will have public positions on labor rights. With a bit of research, you can see what they claim to be doing.

For example, Walmart publishes detailed supplier standards; Target has a “business partner code of conduct” and defines its expectations with respect to health and safety and more; Burberry’s “human rights policy” requires all its business associates to comply with various international conventions concerning working conditions. Whether these commitments are honored is another matter, but once companies make such pledges, they at least risk public exposure if they fail. Various advocacy groups provide additional ways to compare firms — though you should always check the criteria behind their rankings.

Consumers, too, can hold companies accountable. Of course, one person’s shopping cart is not going to move the needle, but it can matter as part of an organized effort. Groups like the Britain-based Ethical Consumer track and publicize boycott calls, turning a shopper’s personal scruples into collective campaigns that corporations have a harder time ignoring.

Still, the picture is complicated. Exploitation occurs everywhere, not just abroad. Millions of U.S. workers earn poverty wages; in 2023 the U.N. special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights raised questions about whether Amazon, DoorDash and Walmart were contributing to “in-work poverty.” So the moral problem isn’t confined to the global south; it’s in American warehouses too.

A big complication, as you’re aware, is that while abstaining spares us complicity, it can also deprive others of their livelihood. Bangladesh’s ready-made-garment industry has been plagued by poor conditions, yet it also helped cut extreme poverty in that country sharply in recent decades. Workers often take these jobs not because they are good but because they are better than the alternatives. That doesn’t mean they aren’t exploited; governments often suppress unions and tilt the rules against labor, leaving workers “choosing” the least bad option.

So the challenge is to balance opposition to exploitation with the recognition that these industries have also been engines of survival and growth. Individual consumer choices, when tied into coordinated campaigns, can help push companies toward higher standards without losing sight of the uncomfortable truth: Clean hands here should not mean empty hands elsewhere.

A Bonus Question

I am the adult child of divorced parents and lived with my mother and stepfather for nearly all of my upbringing. Growing up, I understood that my biological father always fulfilled his legal obligations, like child support, and I believe he tried, in his way, to have a parental role. I visited him for two weeks each summer and a week over the holidays.

During those visits, he took me, my stepmother and my half-siblings on extravagant vacations. But there was always tension. At times he would remark that he wished he had custody, implying that my mother wasn’t doing a good job. He is loud, gregarious and very wealthy — fond of recalling his athletic triumphs and sexual exploits. I, by contrast, loved books, hated sports and dreaded disappointing anyone. The mismatch between us created a rift.

Once I became an adult, communication dropped off sharply. The last time I saw him was at my wedding 10 years ago. When I struggled financially in my 20s and could not afford to visit him, he never showed interest in visiting me, though he easily could have.

Now we keep up only the habit of phone calls — always on holidays, sometimes on birthdays. These conversations are superficial, limited to work and money, the kind of chat you would have with a casual colleague.

I know I don’t have a father-son relationship with him, but it feels wrong to keep dragging this along. It’s painful to keep talking with someone who ought to have paternal feelings for me. Yet I fear hurting him if I cut off contact, and dropping off the face of the earth feels wrong, too. — Name Withheld

From the Ethicist:

There’s a well-worn Zen story about two monks, both sworn to purity, traveling across the countryside. They come to a river where a woman needs help crossing. One monk picks her up and carries her over. Then they resume the journey. Hours later, the second monk bursts out, “You shouldn’t have done that!” The first monk replies: “I put the woman down at the riverbank. Why are you still carrying her?”

The point is that severing ties doesn’t always alleviate a burden; sometimes it becomes another kind of burden. There are people who never stop talking about the parents or siblings they’ve cut off, seeking validation from everyone they know. They keep carrying the renounced relative long after the last conversation. The history between you and your biological father has clearly left you with a sense of anger and disappointment; cutting things off won’t make that vanish. Is it possible, in fact, that doing so would weigh on you more heavily than the discomfort of these highly infrequent phone calls?

Not everything in family life is about maximizing our comfort. Many people keep up contact with difficult parents because they realize that, in the scheme of things, it’s not particularly onerous and that spurning the obligation would only magnify it. Still, the ambivalence you express suggests that there may be a way forward short of silence or shallow ritual. Try raising the level of honesty. Find a gentle way to tell him what you’ve told me: that the conversations feel hollow and that you would like them to take a different shape, maybe touching on something real.

The risk is that he brushes this aside and you’re left where you started. The hope is that he meets you halfway. Either way, you’ll have spoken your mind while also acknowledging his humanity. Somewhere in that space between your own ease and his dignity, you may finally be able to set this burden down.

Readers Respond

The previous question was from a reader whose colleague was going through a difficult divorce while caring for young children. The divorcing colleague has been at the organization more than 20 years and is well known to many; and another colleague set up a GoFundMe on her behalf, with her knowledge, to raise money for divorce-related legal fees. The reader wrote:

“I’ve been in the department only a little while and don’t know her well. Still, she has always been kind and willing to help when needed. … The fund-raiser has been promoted departmentwide, and I’ve been solicited directly. While I sympathize with her hardship, asking colleagues to contribute to legal expenses for a personal matter feels inappropriate. The GoFundMe shows who donated and how much. Though there’s an option to give anonymously, many colleagues have used their names. If I abstain or donate anonymously, I worry it will look as though I’m unsupportive. … I’m financially able to contribute; the problem is the awkwardness of being put in this position and the concern that whatever I do might be held against me later.”

In his response, the Ethicist noted:

“Once solicitation enters the workplace, it can blur professional and private life, introduce subtle coercion and set a precedent that can quickly spiral. If employees can be enlisted to support this cause, why not the next? That’s why many organizations have rules against personal fund-raising on work time or through work channels. So you wouldn’t go wrong to raise the issue with the folks in H.R. You don’t need to make it a complaint; simply point out that this method of solicitation puts people in a bind and runs against sound workplace practices. Establishing a nonsolicitation norm is a means to avoid the unhealthy dynamic you’ve described.”

⬥

While the Ethicist’s response is, needless to say, ethically correct, it is not the optimal course of action for the writer. Yes, the request is ill conceived and problematic on many levels. But it’s too late to stop this avalanche, so I’d advise the writer — who asserts that he/she can afford it — to contribute the same as the smallest published contribution, using his or her name. The writer sounds new to the job or department and there is something to be said for buying good will in this way, however odious. Then, go to H.R. and do what it takes to ensure that this doesn’t happen again Work is a community and sometimes, when the activity is innocuous, you have to go with the flow for the sake of your own well-being and comfort down the road. — Karen

⬥

Such a fund-raising campaign at work is unethical and should be grounds for termination. While co-workers may be sympathetic to the difficulties of the colleague going through a divorce, there’s no way others at work should feel coerced to contribute to her divorce or pay other expenses. H.R. should end this immediately. — JD

⬥

While this might be an issue for H.R., it seems that the simplest way to solve this is not to give to the fund. Escalating this matter to H.R. would bring about very uncomfortable inquiries into a simple act of kindness. Let it go. It does not seem to me that the colleagues who set this up are strong-arming anyone. — Patricia

⬥

Contribute to the inappropriate GoFundMe. Many years ago, two days after starting a new job, I politely declined to make the substantial donation requested for a wedding present to a junior employee. I was not her manager but it was a small company. It took a long time to get past a little coolness I felt from the gift committee. If I had it to do over, I would just hand over the cash. — Pat

⬥

This response ignores workplace politics and both recommendations put the writer at risk. Yes, hold your nose and donate a reasonable but small amount. Include your name. Then, in the future, take it up with H.R. Separate the two by a few months. Workplace politics is real. Don’t believe H.R. will protect your name. Wise up and recognize the game you’re playing. — Kelley

⬥

Is this really that morally challenging? A kind co-worker is having a rough time. The writer can afford to donate. A talk with H.R.? Really? Even this letter to the Ethicist — so much sturm and drang over a call that shouldn’t be nearly this tough. Give a little something. If you’re worried about the amount being judged, do it anonymously. And then feel good that you’re trying to be part of the solution in an often harsh world. — Debora",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/05/magazine/05mag-ethicist-print/05mag-ethicist-print-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 21:01:22.133850

While official confirmation is still pending, the involvement of major banks suggests this is a serious effort rather than just another proof-of-concept.","SWIFT, the backbone of global banking, has reportedly chosen Linea, an Ethereum-based network, to test moving its messaging system onto blockchain technology. This pilot program involves more than a dozen major banks and could change how money moves around the world.

Major Banks Join the Experiment

BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon are among the big names participating in this test. A source from one participating bank called it “a major technological transformation for the international interbank payments industry.”

The project will take several months to complete, according to a source from a participating bank. Banks chose Linea after months of negotiations because it offers strong privacy features that traditional banks need.

Linea uses zero-knowledge proofs, a type of advanced encryption that lets banks test blockchain features without exposing sensitive customer data. This addresses one of the biggest concerns banks have about using public blockchain networks.

How This Changes Banking

Right now, SWIFT only sends payment instructions between banks – it doesn’t actually move money. Banks rely on older systems with multiple steps and middlemen, which critics say makes transactions slow and expensive.

The Linea pilot aims to combine messaging and settlement into one blockchain transaction. This would let all parties track payments in real-time while cutting costs.

SWIFT processes the equivalent of the world’s entire GDP roughly every three days through its network, according to the organization’s website. Moving even part of this volume to blockchain could have massive effects on global finance.

Stablecoin Plans in the Works

The pilot also explores creating a stablecoin-like settlement token for banks. This would transform SWIFT from just a messaging service into a platform that actually handles value transfer.

Source: @WhaleInsider

However, according to The Big Whale’s report, stablecoins are only “under consideration” and the interbank token project remains under review. No official releases have been confirmed.

If successful, this would put SWIFT in direct competition with blockchain payment networks like Ripple, which has long promoted itself as a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional banking rails.

Market Reacts Positively

News of the partnership sent Linea’s token price up over 14% within hours of the announcement. The token jumped from $0.02544 to $0.02814 as trading volume increased by 6%.

This follows SWIFT’s broader push into digital assets. The organization completed tokenized fund settlement tests with UBS and Chainlink in November 2024. It also launched live digital asset trials across North America, Europe, and Asia in October 2024.

The banking world is watching closely. Stablecoin markets have grown to over $295 billion, up 42% since January, according to industry data. Traditional financial institutions increasingly see digital assets as the future of money.

What This Means for the Future

This pilot represents more than just another blockchain experiment. It signals that established financial infrastructure is ready to embrace new technology while maintaining regulatory compliance.

Success could speed up regulatory approval for blockchain-based settlements worldwide. It might also encourage other major financial networks to adopt similar technology.

The pilot builds on SWIFT’s participation in the Bank for International Settlements’ Project Agora and collaboration with central bank digital currency initiatives. These efforts show the organization’s commitment to staying relevant as finance goes digital.

The Bottom Line

SWIFT’s blockchain pilot with Linea could reshape global banking if successful. The combination of established financial infrastructure with cutting-edge blockchain technology offers a path forward that satisfies both innovation and regulation.

While official confirmation is still pending, the involvement of major banks suggests this is a serious effort rather than just another proof-of-concept. The coming months will determine whether traditional finance and blockchain can work together at scale.",https://bravenewcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bnc-Sep-28-2239.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 19:07:37.206736

Now the XRP token stands on a stronger foundation, with Ripple price climbing and institutional adoption fueling fresh momentum.","XRP has gone from being written off as a failed project to making one of the strongest comebacks in the crypto space. Once dismissed as “the banker’s coin” and buried under a long SEC lawsuit, the token is now showing definite growth.

Cheeky Crypto, a YouTube channel known for its crypto analysis, believes XRP could be on a path similar to Bitcoin. According to the analyst, for years, XRP lagged behind while Bitcoin price and Ethereum surged. Many labeled it the “banker’s coin” and dismissed it as too centralized.

Then came the lawsuit with the US SEC in 2020, which dragged Ripple through the mud. The XRP price collapsed, exchanges delisted it, and critics predicted the token’s end.

Fast forward to today, and the picture looks very different. XRP trades at levels not seen in years, showing more percentage growth in 2024 than BTC or ETH over the same period. Cheeky Crypto points out that this shift isn’t just luck. Ripple price recovery reflects real changes: regulatory clarity, fresh institutional interest, and an upgraded ledger that continues to speed up transactions.

Ripple’s Legal Wins Changed Everything

The analyst from the YouTube Crypto channel, mentioned that XRP’s turnaround started once the legal fog lifted. Ripple came out of its SEC clash with an outcome that removed the “security” tag hanging over the XRP token. That ruling alone acted like a massive weight lifted off its shoulders.

Cheeky Crypto explains that regulatory clarity matters as much as technology in crypto. Bitcoin had its moment when it gained recognition as digital gold. XRP is experiencing something similar now that it is no longer tied to constant courtroom drama.

Institutions and Real Utility Back XRP

Ripple has been busy forming relationships with financial giants. One example that caught attention was a partnership with BNY Mellon, America’s oldest bank. According to the commentator from Cheeky Crypto YouTube channel, such moves prove that XRP is not just speculation. Real-world adoption is happening, and when big banks start leaning into Ripple’s network, the token’s credibility strengthens.

The tech is also key. XRP transactions settle in seconds, compared to the long wait times on traditional banking systems. That kind of efficiency creates the potential for XRP to serve as a bridge currency in global payments. Cheeky Crypto emphasizes this utility as the kind of advantage that could push Ripple price growth far beyond where it sits today.

Comparing XRP to Bitcoin

Bitcoin set the standard as the first decentralized currency, but it also has limitations, especially in speed and scalability. XRP was built with cross-border payments in mind, designed to be faster and cheaper from day one.

Cheeky Crypto argues that the BTC price growth story could be mirrored by XRP as adoption continues. While Bitcoin is treated as a store of value, XRP might become the go-to solution for instant settlement across borders. If that happens, the upside could be dramatic.

Other voices in the market have started echoing the same perspective. Comparisons between BTC and XRP focus on growth potential. If Bitcoin price ever pushes toward $500,000, that would be a powerful gain but still a fraction of the multiples some analysts believe are possible with the XRP token.

The analyst points out that a move from a few dollars to double or triple digits would be transformative. The important part is not whether XRP exactly repeats Bitcoin’s journey but whether it steps into its own role as the next big network that reshapes finance.

XRP’s journey has been anything but smooth. From regulatory setbacks to being mocked as “too centralized,” it looked like an outsider for years. Now the XRP token stands on a stronger foundation, with Ripple price climbing and institutional adoption fueling fresh momentum.",https://captainaltcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P2P-Review-27.png,N,,2025-09-27 19:07:42.418846

Following a significant price rebound throughout 2025, fueled by a landmark legal victory and surging institutional interest, analysts are now forecasting a potential breakout to the coveted $5 mark by October. This bullish sentiment comes despite a recent period of volatility, underscoring a broader shift in how the market perceives XRP's long-term viability and utility.

The current excitement stems from a confluence of factors, including critical regulatory clarity provided by a favorable SEC ruling, the successful launch of new XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and growing adoption of Ripple's underlying technology. As XRP navigates crucial support levels, market participants are keenly watching for signs that this recent momentum will translate into a sustained rally, potentially reshaping the landscape for one of the crypto market's most prominent altcoins.

XRP's Resurgence: A Deep Dive into the Catalysts

XRP's journey in 2025 has been nothing short of spectacular, marking a substantial comeback after years of regulatory uncertainty. The digital asset has reportedly surged an impressive 370% year-to-date, eclipsing the performance of both Bitcoin and Ethereum over the same period. A pivotal moment arrived in July 2025, when XRP ascended to a seven-year high of $3.65. This surge directly coincided with a favorable ruling from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which determined that XRP is not a security in secondary market transactions, providing much-needed regulatory clarity. Adding to the bullish momentum, the ProShares XRP ETF also launched around this time, signaling growing institutional acceptance.

However, September 2025 has introduced a degree of market volatility. XRP has experienced a roughly 10% weekly pullback and a 25% dip from its mid-September peak of $3.65. As of late September, XRP is trading in the $2.73 to $2.77 range, testing key support levels between $2.70 and $2.80. Despite this recent correction, technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipping into oversold territory (30-38) suggest that a rebound is likely, indicating renewed buying interest at these price points. The launch of the Rex-Osprey Spot XRP ETF in September, which recorded $37.7 million in first-day trading volume, further highlights the burgeoning institutional appetite.

Several prominent analysts are now eyeing October 2025 as a critical period for XRP. CryptoBull, a widely followed analyst on X, has boldly predicted that XRP could reach $5 by the end of October, citing a large symmetrical triangle pattern on the weekly chart—a technical formation often preceding significant price movements. Other experts, including those at Standard Chartered, have also forecasted an increase to $5.50 for XRP this year, with an even more ambitious target of $8 in 2026. Even Elon Musk's Grok AI projects XRP could reach $3.50-$4.20 in September, with potential for $5 or more if a spot ETF approval materializes. The anticipation of several spot XRP ETF applications awaiting SEC decisions in October, alongside the CME's scheduled launch of XRP options on October 13, are significant catalysts underpinning these optimistic predictions.

Market Movers: Winners and Losers in the XRP Ecosystem

The resurgence of XRP creates a dynamic environment with clear winners and potential ripple effects across the financial and cryptocurrency sectors. At the forefront of the beneficiaries is Ripple Labs (private company) itself. As the primary developer of the XRP Ledger and a major holder of XRP, Ripple directly benefits from the asset's price appreciation. This improved valuation strengthens its balance sheet, enhances its ability to fund new initiatives, and validates its long-standing efforts to establish XRP as a global bridge currency for cross-border payments. The favorable SEC ruling has not only bolstered XRP's market position but also significantly de-risked Ripple's business operations, paving the way for broader partnerships and institutional adoption of its payment solutions.

Cryptocurrency exchanges stand to gain significantly from increased XRP trading activity. Platforms such as Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN), Binance (private company), and Kraken (private company) will likely see a surge in trading volumes, translating into higher transaction fees and increased liquidity. For publicly traded exchanges like Coinbase, a sustained XRP rally could positively impact their stock performance as investor confidence in the broader crypto market grows. The listing and delisting decisions surrounding XRP during its legal battle highlighted its importance to exchange revenues, and its renewed prominence will undoubtedly be a boon.

Investment firms launching and managing XRP-focused ETFs are also direct winners. Companies like ProShares (private company) and Rex-Osprey (private company), which have successfully launched XRP ETFs, are now attracting significant capital inflows. The success of these products not only generates management fees but also establishes these firms as pioneers in offering regulated cryptocurrency investment vehicles, potentially attracting further assets under management. Should more spot XRP ETFs receive SEC approval, as anticipated in October, other asset managers will likely enter this burgeoning market, creating new investment opportunities.

While the immediate impact is overwhelmingly positive for XRP-centric entities, the broader altcoin market could experience mixed effects. A strong XRP rally might draw capital away from other smaller altcoins in the short term, as investors consolidate their positions into a proven performer with clear regulatory backing. However, sustained institutional interest in XRP could also serve as a precedent, paving the way for greater acceptance and regulatory clarity for other digital assets, thereby benefiting the wider crypto ecosystem in the long run. Companies involved in traditional finance that are exploring blockchain technology for payments might also see XRP's success as a validation of distributed ledger technology, potentially accelerating their own adoption strategies.

Wider Implications: A Paradigm Shift for Digital Assets

XRP's recent rebound and the optimistic $5 breakout predictions signify more than just a price surge for a single cryptocurrency; they represent a potential paradigm shift in the broader digital asset landscape. This event powerfully underscores the increasing importance of regulatory clarity in driving institutional adoption. The resolution of the SEC lawsuit, which declared XRP not a security in secondary market transactions, has set a crucial precedent. It provides a blueprint for how other digital assets might navigate regulatory scrutiny, potentially encouraging more institutional players to enter the crypto market with reduced legal ambiguity. This clarity is a major step towards mainstreaming cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles and financial instruments.

The burgeoning interest in XRP ETFs, evidenced by the successful launches of the ProShares XRP ETF and the Rex-Osprey Spot XRP ETF, highlights a significant industry trend: the institutionalization of cryptocurrency investments. As traditional financial institutions seek regulated avenues to offer crypto exposure to their clients, ETFs serve as a vital bridge. The success of XRP ETFs could accelerate the approval process for similar products tied to other major cryptocurrencies, leading to a broader influx of institutional capital into the digital asset space. This trend suggests a maturation of the crypto market, moving beyond retail speculation towards more stable, regulated investment opportunities.

Potential ripple effects on competitors and partners are substantial. For other blockchain projects aiming for cross-border payments or enterprise solutions, XRP's success could intensify competition, compelling them to innovate further or seek stronger partnerships. Conversely, it validates the underlying technology for many, potentially opening doors for collaborations with Ripple or inspiring new applications of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Regulatory bodies globally will also be closely watching the impact of the U.S. SEC's stance on XRP. This could influence how other jurisdictions approach digital asset regulation, potentially leading to a more harmonized global regulatory framework, or, conversely, creating divergent policies based on differing interpretations.

Historically, the impact of regulatory clarity and ETF approvals has been transformative for other asset classes. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, for example, significantly boosted its legitimacy and accessibility for institutional investors. XRP's trajectory draws parallels, suggesting that its newfound regulatory status and ETF presence could usher in a new era of growth and stability. The expansion of Ripple's partnerships with institutions like BNY Mellon (NYSE: BK), DBS (SGX: D05), and Franklin Templeton (NYSE: BEN) to tokenize money market funds on the XRP Ledger further illustrates how regulatory clarity empowers real-world utility, moving beyond speculative trading to integrate digital assets into the core of traditional finance.

The Road Ahead: Navigating Opportunities and Challenges

As XRP stands at the precipice of a potential $5 breakout, the immediate future holds a mix of exciting possibilities and inherent challenges. In the short term, the market will be closely watching the critical $2.70-$2.80 support levels. A successful defense of these levels could indeed pave the way for a bullish run towards the $5 target by the end of October, especially if the anticipated SEC approvals for additional spot XRP ETFs materialize. The launch of CME XRP options on October 13 also introduces new avenues for institutional hedging and speculation, potentially adding to market liquidity and price discovery.

Looking further ahead, the long-term possibilities for XRP appear robust. Analysts from Standard Chartered project a potential rise to $5.50 this year and even $8 in 2026, contingent on sustained institutional adoption and further integration into global payment systems. Ripple's strategic pivots, including ongoing upgrades to the XRP Ledger, such as the launch of an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain, are crucial for expanding its institutional use cases and attracting major players. These developments aim to enhance the XRPL's versatility and appeal, ensuring its relevance in an evolving digital finance landscape.

Market opportunities that may emerge include increased liquidity, broader access for retail and institutional investors through ETFs, and the potential for XRP to solidify its position as a leading digital asset for cross-border payments. However, challenges persist. The broader cryptocurrency market remains susceptible to macroeconomic headwinds and general risk-off sentiment, which could temper XRP's upward trajectory. Volatility, as seen in the recent September correction, is an inherent characteristic of crypto markets and investors must remain prepared for price fluctuations. The success of new XRP ETFs, while promising, will also depend on sustained investor interest and performance mirroring the early success of products like Solana's ETF.

Potential scenarios and outcomes range from a rapid ascent to $5 and beyond, driven by a cascade of positive news and institutional inflows, to a more gradual climb with intermittent corrections. A less optimistic scenario could see XRP consolidate around current levels if broader market sentiment sours or if ETF approvals are delayed. However, the prevailing sentiment is one of cautious optimism, with many believing that the recent dip might represent the ""last dip"" before a significant, sustained rally, propelled by regulatory certainty and increasing utility.

Conclusion: A New Era for XRP and the Crypto Market

The recent rebound and the compelling analyst predictions for a $5 breakout by October mark a pivotal moment for XRP, signaling a new era of growth and legitimacy for the digital asset. The resolution of the SEC lawsuit, unequivocally stating that XRP is not a security in secondary market transactions, has been the cornerstone of this resurgence, unlocking significant institutional interest and paving the way for regulated investment products like spot XRP ETFs. This legal clarity, combined with Ripple's strategic partnerships and ecosystem development, has transformed XRP from a controversial asset into a frontrunner in the institutional adoption of blockchain technology.

Moving forward, the market's trajectory will be heavily influenced by the continued influx of institutional capital, the performance of newly launched and anticipated XRP ETFs, and the broader macroeconomic environment. While short-term volatility is to be expected, the long-term outlook for XRP appears increasingly bullish, driven by its established utility in cross-border payments and its expanding ecosystem. The potential for XRP to reach and surpass the $5 mark by October is a testament to the power of regulatory certainty and the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets.

Investors should closely watch key technical levels, the progress of additional spot XRP ETF applications, and any further announcements from Ripple regarding partnerships or technological advancements. The success of XRP in navigating its legal challenges and attracting significant institutional interest offers valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. It underscores that fundamental utility, regulatory compliance, and robust ecosystem development are increasingly critical drivers of value in the digital asset space, setting a precedent for what investors should look for in the coming months and years.

Ecolab Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Ecolab, you need to believe in its drive to lead digital transformation in industrial water management, along with its commitment to maximizing efficiency and sustainability for customers. The newly announced exclusive partnership with 4T2 Sensors to launch the AI-enhanced CIP IQ directly supports the key short-term catalyst of expanding digital solutions and efficiency, though any impact on revenue growth will depend on real adoption rates within food and beverage markets. The biggest risk remains the potential for softer demand in heavy industrial segments, which could counteract gains from digital innovation if broader customer activity slows.

Among Ecolab’s recent announcements, the launch of CIP IQ stands out for its clear link to product innovation and operational efficiency, the core goals of the company’s digital strategy. Integrating 4T2’s technology positions Ecolab to deliver measurable improvements in water use and production capacity, further aligning with the company’s efforts to grow higher-margin digital service offerings and support organic sales growth. Despite these opportunities, it is important for investors to recognize that, in contrast, near-term demand softness in core industrial end markets could present a headwind that not even advanced digital solutions may fully offset...

Ecolab's outlook anticipates $18.4 billion in revenue and $2.8 billion in earnings by 2028. Achieving this would require 5.4% annual revenue growth and a $0.7 billion increase in earnings from the current $2.1 billion level.

For U.S. Bancorp, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 14.7x.
Do you think there's more to the story for U.S. Bancorp?","If you’re holding U.S. Bancorp stock or considering adding it to your portfolio, now is a particularly intriguing moment to take a closer look. The stock has notched up an impressive 13.6% gain over the last year and sits at a 5-year climb of 64.7%. However, it’s not all a straight line upward. The past week saw a modest -1.9% dip, and the 30-day mark shows a quieter 1.4% gain. These recent shifts hint at evolving risk and reward calculations as investors digest the latest news and adjust for broader market turbulence.

What’s moving the needle? News recently landed that U.S. Bancorp is lowering its prime lending rate to 7.25% from 7.5%. While that suggests the bank is leaning into a more accommodative lending environment, it also reflects wider industry recalibrations as policymakers tread carefully. This kind of move can sway near-term sentiment, impacting both the bank’s profitability outlook and the stock’s perceived risk. Meanwhile, ongoing regulatory debates and global economic ripples such as stablecoin regulation and shifting European relationships are reshaping the entire sector’s risk map, not just for USB but for all major U.S. banks.

Here’s the key point: U.S. Bancorp earns a value score of 5 out of 6 checks for undervaluation, signaling that it looks attractively priced through nearly all the standard lenses. But what are those valuation checks, and is that really the full picture? Let’s dive into the specifics of each approach and stay tuned for an even more insightful perspective on the stock’s true worth at the end.

Approach 1: U.S. Bancorp Excess Returns Analysis

The Excess Returns valuation model gauges a company’s true worth by comparing the returns it generates above its cost of equity. In essence, it measures how efficiently U.S. Bancorp turns its book value into profit beyond baseline investor expectations, putting the focus squarely on sustained value creation.

For U.S. Bancorp, the calculations are straightforward and compelling. The company reports a Book Value of $35.02 per share and a Stable Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.93, with these estimates drawn from 14 leading analysts. The cost of equity comes in at $3.03 per share, while the excess return stands at $1.89 per share, demonstrating the profits earned above what investors would require for the risk taken. The long-term average Return on Equity is 12.64%, and the Stable Book Value estimate rises to $38.99 per share (based on consensus from 11 analysts).

This analysis feeds into an estimated intrinsic value of $79.27 per share. Compared to current trading levels, this suggests the stock is trading at a 37.6% discount to its intrinsic value, which points to notable undervaluation according to this model.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Excess Returns analysis suggests U.S. Bancorp is undervalued by 37.6%. Track this in your or , or discover more .

Approach 2: U.S. Bancorp Price vs Earnings

For established, profitable companies like U.S. Bancorp, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a time-tested way to quickly gauge whether the stock looks cheap or expensive relative to its earnings power. It is especially useful because it allows investors to compare how much they are paying for one dollar of company earnings against peers, wider industry benchmarks, and the company’s own growth and risk profile.

The ""right"" PE ratio for a bank is rarely a one-size-fits-all figure. Investors typically assign higher PE ratios to companies with faster growth prospects and lower perceived risks, and lower ratios to those facing more uncertainty or slower growth. In U.S. Bancorp’s case, the current PE sits at 11.8x, nearly in line with the broader banks industry average of 11.9x, but noticeably below the average for direct peers at 18.9x.

While those comparisons offer useful perspective, Simply Wall St's ""Fair Ratio"" approach goes further by customizing the expected PE ratio based on unique company factors, including future earnings growth, profit margins, market cap, and risk dynamics. For U.S. Bancorp, the Fair Ratio is calculated as 14.7x. Because the Fair Ratio takes a wide range of inputs into account, it provides a more tailored benchmark than a simple industry or peer comparison. Today, with the actual PE significantly below the Fair Ratio, signs point to the stock being undervalued by this method.

Result: UNDERVALUED

PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your U.S. Bancorp Narrative

Earlier, we alluded to a better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives, a tool that lets you shape your investment view by connecting the story you believe about U.S. Bancorp to real financial forecasts and a fair value.

With Narratives, you describe the drivers you think matter most for a company, set your own expectations for future revenue, profitability, and margins, and immediately see how those assumptions translate into an estimate of fair value.

This approach empowers you to move beyond one-size-fits-all metrics and tie your theory about the company's future to an actionable investment decision. If your calculated Fair Value is higher than the current price, you might want to buy, and if lower, maybe reconsider.

Available on Simply Wall St’s Community page, Narratives are used by millions as an easy, dynamic way to track their views; they automatically update as new news or earnings come in, so your investment thesis stays relevant.

For example, one U.S. Bancorp Narrative expects rapid digital banking adoption and margin resilience, projecting a fair value above $67 per share, while another highlights rising credit risk and demographic headwinds, supporting a lower $47 fair value. This demonstrates how Narratives let you make decisions aligned with your unique perspective.

In a higher-profile example of the strategy, Frasers acquired the online luxury retailer Matches in December 2023.
Between 2021 and 2024, Platt says, he was contacted on four occasions by Frasers about the group buying Pockets.
He said: “Selling would have made me very wealthy, but money is not everything.
Frasers acquired John Anthony in December 2023 and soon closed down its five stores in Bath, Bristol, Bournemouth, Swindon and Southampton.","Very few upscale independent menswear retailers have resisted Frasers “making them an offer they can’t refuse”.

Flannels — now operating from more than 80 locations across the UK and Irish Republic — is named after the Manchester-based mini-chain that Frasers founder Mike Ashley took control of in 2012, having previously acquired Cruise, a similar designer retailer in Scotland, and Van Mildert, a smaller concern in the northeast of England.

For a decade after that, Frasers, whose main money-maker is seen as the Sports Direct chain, played an intriguing retail chess game with arch-rival JD Sports, which also took controlling stakes in a hotch-potch of independent retailers from Scotland to Essex.

Then, in December 2022, with no warning, JD’s new chief executive Régis Schulz — who had replaced Ashley’s bitter opponent Peter Cowgill — threw in his fashion hand to concentrate on sportswear. He unloaded 14 retail, online and wholesale businesses, encompassing another 50 to 60 premium fashion-focused stores, to Frasers for £47.5 million, a sum that also scooped up the expensive stock held by the retailers.

Frasers’ strategy, its critics maintain, is to buy up such stores and then close them down as quickly as possible, removing rivals to allow Flannels to dominate the sector. Other well-regarded upmarket fashion indies such as Philip Browne in Norwich and Aphrodite in Sunderland landed in Frasers’ net soon after the JD deal. Both were closed down last year.

In a higher-profile example of the strategy, Frasers acquired the online luxury retailer Matches in December 2023. By March 2024, Matches had been put into administration, leaving many prominent designer brands out of pocket.

Frasers’ justification for such behaviour is that the businesses it acquires are loss-making or very nearly insolvent. Frasers declined to comment for this article.

Between 2021 and 2024, Platt says, he was contacted on four occasions by Frasers about the group buying Pockets. He maintains he was not tempted by the overtures. He said: “Selling would have made me very wealthy, but money is not everything. If I’d have sold out, Frasers would have closed Pockets. They told me that was their plan, so what was the point?”

“I’m old school. I believe in physical retailing space, not selling online. Pockets, like many indie retailers that are no longer with us, is all about presenting customers with desirable products at reasonable prices in an inspiring environment, backed by expert, interested service. Pockets Townhouse represents us taking all that to a higher level.”

Platt says he was encouraged to open Pockets in Bath, three hours’ drive from his main store in Shrewsbury, because he saw a gap in the city’s retail offering after the closure of a long-established similar business called John Anthony. Frasers acquired John Anthony in December 2023 and soon closed down its five stores in Bath, Bristol, Bournemouth, Swindon and Southampton.

Today Flannels trades from the former John Anthony unit in Bath, which still has the old name over the door but Flannels branding inside.

“The view of premium independent retailers like me is that Frasers is excellent with its Sports Direct price-driven chain, but it cannot run its Flannel shops is the same way,” Platt argued. “With 80-plus locations, typically crammed with similar-looking merchandise, it offers nothing like the personal, individual experience, with carefully curated ranges, that a good indie does.”

Without disclosing figures, Platt says he has made a profit for most of the time since he opened his first shop in Shrewsbury in April 1996. He admits Flannels’ aggressive discounting strategy before and after the Covid-19 lockdown put significant pressure on his business, but today he is more concerned about government-imposed demands.

“In the past 12 months, increases to our national insurance contributions, higher wages, rates and utility bills have added £100,000 to our costs,” Platt adds. “We have had to work hard and smart just to stand still.”

He declines to reveal what investment he has made in the leasehold townhouse in Bath, but by Pockets’ 30th anniversary next spring, he will have an idea if he was right to decline Frasers’ offer.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F7b0f232f-3449-45dc-b715-1cffc240a609.jpg?crop=5402%2C3039%2C0%2C281&resize=1200,N,,2025-09-27 18:08:13.055390

Players were tempted to pre-order the physical edition of Silent Hill f ahead of time by the ""free"" addition of a striking Steelbook case for orders placed with Amazon in the UK, and GameStop in the U.S.

However, as orders began arriving across the States this week and fans stopped by stores to pick up their freebie, it became clear that GameStop did not have nearly enough Steelbook cases to satisfy demand.

""Is anyone else having trouble trying to acquire their Silent Hill f steelbook?"" asked one customer. ""Preordered from GameStop months ago and went today just an hour after opening and they’ve run out of all four steel boxes they had in stock. All four. Called every GameStop in a 50 mile radius and NONE other store received ANY shipment of steel boxes at all.""

""Everyone is getting the shaft,"" someone responded. ""Stores that even got allocation were at like 10% or less compared to their pre-order number.""

""I went to a GameStop earlier today as they opened, and they only got one,"" commented someone else. ""And I was the second guy in line. Supposedly, they should get another shipment. But it's really stupid that there is a shortage of Steelbooks, and on top of that, online preorders require you to go in store to pick up the Steelbook. I wish Amazon US or Best Buy had the Steelbook, 'cause at least they would ship it with the game. I guess I'll check in and see if they ever get more in the upcoming weeks.""

Other players claimed GameStop employees confirmed to them that each store received only a handful of Steelbook cases irrespective of how many pre-orders the stores logged, with some saying their local store ""didn't even get a single Steelbook…""

""I work at GameStop. We got a total of nine Steelbooks… for 30+ preorders,"" explained another commenter.

If this all sounds very familiar, that's because it is. When Silent Hill 2 Remake pre-orders began shipping in the UK in October 2024, GAME customers similarly received their game without the steelbook sweetener they'd hoped to get when placing their orders, and it took several weeks for GAME to fulfil delayed shipments. This time around, however, Konami partnered with Amazon UK to distribute the Steelbook pre-order bonus, which seems to have been more successful this time around.

What's particularly galling for some fans, however, is the number of Steelbook cases that have made it onto online auction sites like eBay. Despite being given away for free, the collectible case is being auctioned for anywhere from $30 to $205, both with and without the game bundled alongside it.

In a thread entitled ""people ruin everything"" with hundreds of upvotes, one fan wrote: ""What [is] really disappointed me even more was going on eBay just to see what resellers were up charging for the cases, ruining it for other people by being greedy. I know [the] Silent Hill franchise ha[s] always been expensive, I’ve gotten my fair share of games over the years, but for people to sell a case for more than market value is sickening.""

With most retailers advertising the freebie as available ""while stocks last"", however, there's very little customers can do, as demonstrated by this email response from GameStop customer care, who told one player that ""even with online pre-orders, the Steelbook must be claimed in-store"" and ""these items are extremely limited and available only while supplies last.""

We'll reach out to GameStop and update as/when we hear back from the retailer.

MANHATTAN, Kan. – Avery Johnson passed for 168 yards and two touchdowns, and he added 75 rushing yards on 12 carries, and standout running back Dylan Edwards had 166 rushing yards and one score, as Kansas State put together its best performance of the season in a much-needed 34-20 win over UCF on Saturday.

K-State, 2-3 overall and 1-1 in the Big 12 Conference, took a 17-7 lead into the half and led 31-10 late in the third quarter after Edwards took a handoff and raced down the right sideline 75 yards for a touchdown, prompting a massive celebration among the crowd of 53,013 and coaches and players on the sideline for a K-State team that came off a bye week looking to rebound after a few tough losses.

Johnson, coupled with Edwards, his childhood best friend and pee-wee football teammate from the Wichita area, stole the show.

""Avery is a really special athlete and sometimes we have to say roll and go,"" K-State head coach Chris Klieman said. ""Just like Dylan. When those two are running, we can be a much better team.""

UCF, 3-1 and 0-1, suffered its first loss in the second tenure of head coach Scott Frost, who had won 16 straight with the Knights, and who led a squad into Manhattan after an emotional week following the sudden death of offensive line coach Shawn Clark.

K-State outgained UCF 434 to 402. The Wildcats had season highs both with 434 total yards and 266 rushing yards and were a perfect 4-for-4 inside the red zone. The K-State defense held the Knights' offense to 3-for-13 on third downs, and it held a squad that led the FBS in fourth-down conversions without a single fourth-down conversion in the contest.

""I don't think this team will ever give up,"" Frost said. ""We could lose three or four straight, and this team wouldn't give up. We're starting to develop a bond.""

Tayven Jackson completed 12-of-24 passes for 115 yards and one interception, and Jacurri Brown completed 1-of-2 passes with one touchdown and one interception. Running back Myles Montgomery had 10 carries for 119 yards.

But K-State held UCF to 20 points after the Knights entered averaging 39.7 points per game. The Wildcats had some standout performances on defense, including two interceptions, eight tackles for loss and three sacks.

Johnson completed 18-of-25 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns, and his 12 rushes for 75 yards were just what the doctor ordered in keeping the Knights defense honest. He was poised, calm, and picked his spots well in the running game.

Wide receiver Jaron Tibbs had eight catches for 72 yards, Garrett Oakley had two catches for 36 yards, and Sterling Lockett and Cure both had their first-career catches in a K-State uniform.

And then there was Edwards. And he was downright dangerous.

""It was a good feeling going out there today and playing football,"" Edwards said. ""That's something I wanted to do all these weeks I've been out. This felt really, really good.""

K-State's bond seems stronger than ever.

""It feels good to win,"" K-State senior tight end Will Swanson said. ""The thing that was on my mind was the energy we had as a team on the sideline, among us on the sideline. That's what separated ourselves with how we've been playing in the past.""

Klieman appeared pleased with Saturday's result.

""I'm happy for the guys,"" he said. ""They put the time and effort in. We talked about earning a win. You earn everything you get. Our kids earned the victory over a really good UCF team. Those guys have really talented kids. We jumped on them, then had a lull in there, but I'm most proud that you're going to have some ups and downs, and we kept responding. That's something I'm really proud of.

""We stayed in the fight mentally and physically.""

And the Wildcats did so to the delight of their fans.

""Thanks to the fans,"" Klieman said. ""You're a 1-3 football team not playing very good football and it's easy to say, 'I can watch this one at home.' I appreciate them believing in the kids and believing in us, because we feel we have a good football team. Is it going to be rough at times because there are really good teams in the Big 12? There are dang good teams in our league. But I appreciate the fans coming and supporting these guys because these kids want to win. They're as upset when we don't play well as the fans are, and I appreciate those fans coming out.""

K-State did its best to create energy fast.

In the game's first eight minutes, redshirt freshman Blake Barnett saw the first action of his career — rushing four times for 24 yards in the quarterback run game. While Edwards made his first return to the field in weeks after recovering from injury, K-State was without its top two wide receivers in Jayce Brown and Jerand Bradley.

Although K-State got off to a slow start offensively — its first drive ended when Cure threw an interception, and its second drive stalled when the Wildcats couldn't convert on fourth-and-6 at the UCF 36-yard line — K-State got on the scoreboard first when Luis Rodriguez booted a 38-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead with 13:03 left in the second quarter.

""Stalling out after that first drive isn't something we wanted to do,"" Johnson said, ""but stayed true to it, and never panicked and kept our energy up, and we were rewarded with success.""

UCF suffered an unfortunate situation early in the second quarter. On third-and-7 at the UCF 43-yard line, K-State defensive end Cody Stufflebean drilled UCF quarterback Tayven Jackson into the turf, and Jackson favored his left shoulder once he rose from the field with 10:48 left in the second quarter. Jackson went into the locker room.

UCF backup Jacurri Brown on his third play from scrimmage tossed an interception to safety Gunnar Maldonado, who returned the ball 12 yards to the UCF 26. But K-State struggled to move the ball — until it absolutely needed to. On fourth-and-2 at the UCF 18, Johnson rolled to the right side, planted his foot and cut inside against three defenders for a 14-yard gain, showing that running ability that defenses must respect. Just when it appeared Edwards scored on a four-yard run, K-State was called for holding. That meant it faced first-and-goal at the 14. Johnson again took the ball, and this time raced down the left side 13 yards and dove into the pylon.

Official review ruled that Johnson stepped out of bounds at the half-yard line. Running back Joe Jackson went up the middle and scored on the next play for a 10-0 lead with 3:52 left in the second quarter.

However, Brown and the Knights emphatically answered and made-up ground in a flash. Brown, a running quarterback, surprisingly unfurled a long pass to wide receiver DJ Black, who raced down the sideline on an 82-yard catch-and-run, silencing a stunned crowd, as UCF pulled to 10-7 with 2:54 left in the second quarter.

""Those big plays can't happen,"" Maldonado said. ""You can play 80 defensive snaps in a game and 75 of them can have no gains but five can put points on the board. Those things can't happen. We can do better.

K-State could've folded. Instead, the Wildcats put together one of the smoothest, most-clutch, two-minute drives in the Klieman era.

Johnson controlled the two-minute offense magnificently and his soft rainbow pass off play-action to sophomore tight end Will Anciaux all alone in the corner of the end zone gave K-State a 17-7 halftime lead. Edwards had four carries for 29 yards on the drive, Johnson ran when he needed to, and he found pass catchers across the field, with a 20-yard pass to Tibbs, and a 13-yard pass to Lockett, before his pass found Anciaux standing flat-footed, all alone, awaiting the catch.

""We were flowing, we were rolling, and Coach (Matt) Wells made some really good calls there,"" Johnson said. ""I knew where I wanted to go with the ball. When everybody plays together as one, we're really hard to stop.""

K-State didn't let down in the second half, as Johnson opened the third quarter with a 6-play, 65-yard touchdown drive. Two plays after Johnson completed a 35-yard pass to tight end Garrett Oakley, Johnson hit Oakley with a short shovel pass in the end zone to make it 24-7.

Jackson returned for UCF to start the third quarter, he and handed the ball to running back Myles Montgomery for a 45-yard gain. But facing fourth-and-1 at the K-State 21-yard line, Brown was held back, losing one yard, and fumbling the ball, which cornerback Justice Clemons recovered on the ground. It was the first fourth-down UCF failed to convert this season.

After a K-State punt, UCF drove for a 53-yard field goal by Noe Ruelas, then the two teams traded two long touchdown runs.

Edwards took the first play from scrimmage 75 yards down the K-State sideline for the longest-touchdown run of his career to extend the lead to 31-10. Then UCF sprinted back, as Jaden Nixon rushed to the right for a 54-yard touchdown to make it 31-17.

Just when it looked like UCF could threaten to make it a one-score game, they killed their drive with four penalties and settled for a 40-yard field goal from Ruelas to make it 31-20 with 9:34 left in the fourth quarter.

All that was left was a spectacular interception by Qua Moss and a 48-yard field goal by Rodriguez late for the game's final points — and a massive celebration for the Wildcats and Klieman, who celebrated his 58th birthday on Saturday.

""I told the guys to have fun and enjoy this win,"" Johnson said. ""Winning is hard in college football. We can't get on a winner's high now. We've won two games this year. It's another one-game season next week. That's just how we have to look at it from here on out — don't look too far into the future, and don't get caught up in the past.""",https://images.sidearmdev.com/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdxbhsrqyrr690.cloudfront.net%2Fsidearm.nextgen.sites%2Fkstate.sidearmsports.com%2Fimages%2F2025%2F9%2F27%2FGKW_1368.jpg&width=1600&type=jpeg,N,,2025-09-27 20:12:23.929985

Do you think there's more to the story for Johnson & Johnson?","If you are eyeing Johnson & Johnson stock and mulling over whether now is the right time to buy, hold, or simply keep watching, you are not alone. The healthcare giant has always attracted the attention of long-term investors looking for stability and steady gains, but recently, the story has taken a few interesting turns. In the past week, Johnson & Johnson shares nudged up 2.0%, adding to a modest 1.7% gain over the last 30 days and capping off an impressive 24.8% rise year-to-date. Over the last five years, the stock has compounded by 41.7%, showing its staying power, even through market turbulence and shifting investor sentiment.

This recent momentum comes on the heels of fresh optimism across healthcare stocks, as broader market developments point toward renewed confidence in companies with resilient revenue streams and powerful product pipelines. The risk perception for defensive stocks like Johnson & Johnson appears to be softening, leading many investors back to familiar names.

But here is where it gets especially interesting: by our core valuation checks, Johnson & Johnson comes in with a numerical score of 4, meaning the company is currently undervalued on four out of six major metrics. This raises a compelling question: is the stock’s recent run just the beginning, or are we heading for a pause?

In this next section, we will dive into the valuation approaches that underpin this score, unpack which levers matter most, and hint at an even smarter lens for understanding the company’s value by the time we wrap up.

Approach 1: Johnson & Johnson Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company’s value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today’s dollars. For Johnson & Johnson, this approach begins with its latest trailing twelve-month free cash flow (FCF), which stands at $18.4 Billion. Analyst estimates forecast steady increases; by 2029, the company’s FCF is projected to rise to $35.5 Billion, while even longer-term figures extend to over $55 Billion by 2035 based on reasonable extrapolations.

This growth reflects Johnson & Johnson’s robust operations and the resilience of its core business. The DCF analysis used a two-stage model, blending analyst consensus for the next five years with extended estimates by Simply Wall St for the years beyond. All cash flows are calculated in USD.

Based on these projections, the DCF model arrives at an intrinsic value of $442.56 per share. Compared to the current market price, this implies that Johnson & Johnson is trading at a 59.4% discount to its estimated fair value. This suggests that the stock may be undervalued according to this methodology.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Johnson & Johnson is undervalued by 59.4%. Track this in your or , or discover more .

Approach 2: Johnson & Johnson Price vs Earnings

The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a well-established way to assess the valuation of profitable companies like Johnson & Johnson, as it measures how much investors are willing to pay today for each dollar of earnings. Since Johnson & Johnson generates reliable profits year after year, the PE ratio serves as a relevant metric for comparing valuation both within its industry and against broader benchmarks.

Market participants often accept higher PE ratios for companies expected to deliver strong, stable earnings growth, or those seen as less risky than peers. Conversely, a lower PE is usually assigned to companies facing uncertainty or little expected earnings improvement. With that in mind, Johnson & Johnson currently trades at a PE ratio of 19.1x. For reference, the average PE ratio among its pharmaceutical industry peers is 18.3x, while the broader group of similar-sized peers averages a higher 22.4x.

Simply Wall St's “Fair Ratio” model takes this one step further by blending not just earnings growth outlook and risk, but also profitability, industry specifics, and company size to arrive at a fair PE ratio for Johnson & Johnson. This comes to 26.7x. This Fair Ratio is designed to provide a more holistic yardstick than a straightforward peer or industry comparison, as it tunes the valuation to reflect the company’s unique blend of qualities and challenges.

Comparing Johnson & Johnson’s actual PE of 19.1x to its Fair Ratio of 26.7x, the stock appears undervalued on this metric, supporting the case that it may have more room to run if the fundamentals hold up.

Result: UNDERVALUED

PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Johnson & Johnson Narrative

Earlier, we hinted at a smarter way to think about valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. In simple terms, a Narrative is your story about a company, the thinking and assumptions you have about its prospects, transforming your perspective on Johnson & Johnson from just numbers to a living, evolving forecast.

Narratives let you connect Johnson & Johnson’s business story to concrete financial assumptions, such as fair value, projected revenue, and expected margins, grounding your view in both the qualitative and the quantitative. On Simply Wall St's Community page, a resource used by millions, these Narratives are an accessible, easy-to-use tool that helps you clarify and track your own reasoning, while also learning from the stories of other investors.

Here’s how Narratives work: you build and customize your financial view of Johnson & Johnson, then instantly see how your Fair Value calculation compares to its current market price, making it clear whether you think it’s a buy, a sell, or a hold based on your beliefs. As soon as new information arrives (like earnings updates or breaking news), Narratives update automatically, letting your view stay current without extra effort.

For example, some investors may take a very optimistic Narrative, seeing J&J’s “rich drug pipeline” and 7.5% expected revenue growth, while others focus on risks and forecast lower growth and margins; Narratives capture both, letting you compare and decide what resonates with you.

Best Buy’s recent performance has kept longtime investors on their toes and new investors intrigued by the potential for a turnaround. Last week alone, the stock climbed 5.4%, a move that may have caught the attention of value hunters who see signs of change amid a longer-term dip. Yet, when you glance at the returns over the past year, there’s been a noticeable drawdown, with shares down 21.7%. That is a sharp contrast to the notable 38.5% return over the past three years, suggesting market sentiment is shifting even as some investors keep faith in the company’s underlying business.

With consumer tech demand shifting and competitive pressures evolving, Best Buy’s price swings reflect more than just industry headwinds. The market seems to be recalibrating its risk.

For those eyeing value, here is a key insight: according to a comprehensive score that checks if the company is undervalued on six key metrics, Best Buy lands at a 4 out of 6. This means there are clear signs that the stock could be trading below its fair worth, but not every box is ticked just yet.

So is Best Buy really a bargain, or is the recent rally just another blip? Let’s dig into how analysts and value metrics approach the stock, keeping an eye out for an even better way to understand its true worth by the end of our journey.

Approach 1: Best Buy Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach estimates a company’s true value by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to today’s dollars. This helps investors look past near-term ups and downs, focusing instead on how much cash the business will likely generate long term.

For Best Buy, the DCF model uses a current trailing twelve-month Free Cash Flow of $1.31 Billion. Analysts project that by 2028, free cash flows could reach $1.72 Billion, with longer-term forecasts stretching to nearly $2.42 Billion by 2035. While the first five years of these forecasts come from analyst estimates, further-out figures are extrapolated based on reasonable growth rates.

Running all these numbers through the DCF model, Best Buy’s estimated intrinsic value stands at $146.59 per share. Compared to the company’s present market value, the DCF calculation suggests the stock is trading at a 48.1% discount to its fair worth. This indicates it may be significantly undervalued relative to its future cash-generating potential.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Approach 2: Best Buy Price vs Earnings

The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used valuation metric for companies that consistently generate profits, like Best Buy. Since it compares a company's current share price to its earnings per share, it helps investors judge whether the market is pricing the company's profit potential appropriately.

What makes a “fair” PE ratio is not set in stone. Expectations for future growth, the predictability of earnings, and overall risk shape what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of profits. Generally, higher growth and stability justify a loftier multiple, while slower growth or greater risk pull it lower.

Best Buy currently trades at a PE ratio of 20.56x. Relative to the Specialty Retail industry average of 17.75x and its peer average of 48.20x, Best Buy is priced somewhat above the sector norm but well below many peers. However, relying solely on these benchmarks can be misleading since they do not always account for company-specific factors.

Simply Wall St’s “Fair Ratio” aims to solve that by digesting details like Best Buy’s earnings growth outlook, profit margins, market capitalization, and industry traits. Its proprietary fair PE for Best Buy comes in at 21.61x. This figure is considered more robust than a simple industry or peer comparison, as it reflects a balanced view of valuation, risk, and growth potential.

With Best Buy’s actual PE of 20.56x sitting almost perfectly in line with its 21.61x Fair Ratio, the market appears to be valuing the stock just about right for its current prospects.

Result: ABOUT RIGHT

PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Best Buy Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there’s an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. Narratives are a simple yet powerful concept: they let you connect your own story or investment perspective about a company with the numbers behind its future, combining your assumptions for revenue, earnings, and margins with an estimated fair value.

This approach ties together the company’s business outlook and strategy with a transparent financial forecast, so you can clearly see what needs to happen for an investment to make sense. It’s not just numbers on a screen; it’s your view on what Best Buy’s future could look like, made practical and accessible through an easy-to-use tool on Simply Wall St’s Community page, which is trusted by millions of investors.

Narratives help you decide whether to buy or sell by revealing the gap between Fair Value and today’s Price, and they automatically update as news breaks or earnings come out. For example, some investors estimate Best Buy’s fair value as high as $84 per share, seeing room for growth if digital and service innovation pay off, while others see it closer to $60 per share due to fierce retail competition and margin pressures.

Then there's OLED and QLED. These terms describe entirely different TV technologies, and in our side-by-side comparison reviews, one is better than the other. For the last few years, Samsung has been branding most of its TVs ""QLED."" Its 2025 QLED lineup includes Neo QLED models in 4K and 8K resolution. Samsung isn't the only one: TCL also makes QLED TVs.

On the other side of the OLED vs. QLED fence are OLED TVs. For the last few years, LG has dominated the OLED market, and its 2025 OLED TV lineup is more extensive than ever. Sony and Sharp also sell OLED TVs in the US. Adding to the confusion, Samsung has an OLED TV of its own, meaning it sells both OLED and QLED TVs. So what's the difference? Excellent question.

QLED vs. OLED: Quick summary of the TV technologies

Let's start with a quick breakdown.

OLED stands for ""organic light-emitting diode.""

QLED (according to Samsung) stands for ""quantum dot LED TV.""

OLED is a fundamentally different technology from LCD, the major type of TV.

QLED is a variation of LED LCD, adding a quantum dot film to the LCD ""sandwich.""

OLED is ""emissive,"" meaning the pixels emit their own light.

QLED, like LCD, is ""transmissive"" in its current form and relies on an LED backlight.

Both QLED TVs and OLED TVs are smart TVs in that they have built-in apps

Both technologies are capable of vivid colors and bright images, but some models are better than others

A QLED TV is just an LCD TV with quantum dots

The main takeaway is that QLED is closer to regular old LCD than it is to OLED, which I (and most other experts) consider a distinctly different class of television, much like plasma before it.

Quantum dots are microscopic molecules that, when hit by light, emit their own differently colored light. In QLED TVs, the dots are contained in a film, and the light that hits them is provided by an LED backlight. That light then travels through a few other layers inside the TV, including a liquid crystal, or LCD, layer, to create the picture. The light from the LED source is transmitted through the layers to the screen's surface, which is why we say it's ""transmissive.""

Samsung has been using quantum dots to augment its LCD TVs since 2015 and debuted the QLED TV branding in 2017. Samsung says those quantum dots have evolved over time -- that color and light output have improved, for example. In my experience, however, improvements caused by better quantum dots are much less evident than those caused by other image quality factors (see below).

Other TV makers also use quantum dots in LCD TVs, including Vizio and Hisense, but don't call those sets QLED TVs.

An OLED TV is not an LCD TV at all

LCD is the dominant technology in flat-panel smart TVs and has been for a long time. It's cheaper than OLED, especially in larger sizes, and numerous panel-makers can manufacture it.

OLED is different because it doesn't use an LED backlight to produce light. Instead, light is produced by millions of individual OLED subpixels. The pixels themselves -- tiny dots that compose the image -- emit light, which is why it's called an ""emissive"" display technology. That difference leads to all kinds of picture-quality effects, some of which favor LCD (and QLED), but most of which favor OLED.

Aside from the US brands mentioned above, Panasonic, Philips, Grundig and others sell OLED TVs in Europe. All OLED TVs worldwide use panels manufactured by either LG or Samsung.

Until 2022, LG was the only company making OLED panels, but that year Samsung started making its own panels using QD-OLED technology. Samsung promises improved color and brightness compared with current OLED TVs because its TVs use quantum dots -- just like QLED TVs -- and in our tests, the color of the Samsung S95C QD-OLED was superb. But we liked the LG G3 better, in part because it uses another new OLED panel technology called MLA (for micro lens array) to improve brightness. We expect OLED technology to continue evolving in the coming years, like one of the latest developments: 4-stack.

QLED and OLED vs LED

Aren't these all just ""LED TVs?"" No, at least not technically speaking. As mentioned above, all LED TVs are LCD TVs that use LED lights as their backlight. Or to put it another way, all QLEDs are LEDs but not all LEDs are QLEDs. Despite sharing many letters, OLEDs are not LED TVs, at least not as far as marketing nomenclature is concerned. They use a different technology than what's in LED TVs.

You might also see Mini-LEDs TVs. These are an evolution of LED TVs and are more comparable to OLED.

QLED vs. OLED image quality

Based on my reviews of both QLED TVs and OLED TVs, here are some general comparisons.

QLED TV picture quality varies more than OLED

Samsung and TCL each have multiple QLED series, and the most expensive ones perform a lot better than the cheaper ones. That's mainly because the biggest improvements in the picture quality of QLED sets don't have much to do with quantum dots. Instead, they're the result of mini-LED backlights, better full-array local dimming, bright highlights and better viewing angles, which help them outperform QLED (and non-QLED) TVs that lack those extras.

Meanwhile, every OLED TV I've reviewed has very similar image quality -- all have earned a 10/10 in picture quality in my tests.

OLED has better contrast and black level

One of the most important image-quality factors is black level, and their emissive nature means OLED TVs can turn unused pixels off completely, for literally infinite contrast. QLED/LCD TVs, even the best ones with the most effective full-array local dimming, let some light through, leading to more washed-out, grayer black levels and blooming around bright sections.

QLED is brighter

The brightest QLED and LCD TVs can get brighter than any OLED model, which is a particular advantage in bright rooms and with HDR content. In my tests, however, OLED TVs can still get plenty bright for most rooms, and their superior contrast still allows them to deliver a better overall HDR image than any QLED/LCD TV I've tested.

OLED has better uniformity and viewing angles

With LCD-based displays, different areas of the screen can appear brighter than others all the time, and backlight structure can also be seen in some content. Even the best LCDs also fade, lose contrast and become discolored when seen from seats other than the sweet spot directly in front of the screen. OLED TVs have almost perfectly uniform screens and maintain fidelity from all but the most extreme angles.

Resolution, color, video processing and other image-quality factors are basically the same

Most QLED and OLED TVs have the same resolution and 4K, and both can achieve 8K resolution, too. Neither technology has major inherent advantages in color or video processing. Both technologies are capable of accurate primary colors, i.e. reds, greens and blues, but not all will be accurate out of the box. QD-OLED can deliver improved color. Check out OLED vs. LCD and What's the Best OLED Screen Type? for more details.

QLED can get bigger and smaller (and cheaper)

There are six sizes of OLED TV on the market today. Two more sizes, 42-inch and 97-inch, were new since 2022.

OLED TV sizes

42-inch

48-inch

55-inch

65-inch

77-inch

83-inch

88-inch

97-inch

Meanwhile, as QLED TVs are LCDs, they can be made in a greater range of sizes. Non-QLED LCD TVs can get even smaller.

QLED TV sizes

32-inch

43-inch

50-inch

55-inch

58-inch

65-inch

75-inch

82-inch

85-inch

98-inch

One big advantage that QLED and LCD have over OLED is the cost of mainstream sizes over 65 inches. Large televisions are the fastest-growing segment of the market and show no signs of slowing down. However, 77-inch OLED TVs cost $2,200 and up, significantly more than most 75-inch QLED TVs, and in larger sizes the difference is even more drastic.

What about OLED burn-in?

Burn-in happens when a persistent part of the image -- a channel logo, a news ticker or a scoreboard on a TV, for example -- remains as a ghostly background no matter what else appears on screen. All OLED screens can burn-in, and from everything I know, they're more susceptible than LCD displays, including QLED.

All things considered, however, burn-in shouldn't be a problem for most people. Burn-in is typically caused by leaving a single, static image element, like a channel logo, on the screen for a long time, repeatedly. That's an issue if you keep Fox News, ESPN or MSNBC on for multiple hours every day and don't watch enough other programming, for example. But as long as you vary what's displayed, chances are you'll never experience burn-in.

Check out our guide on OLED screen burn-in for more.

Which is better in 2025 and beyond, QLED or OLED TVs?

As I mentioned above, when I pit an OLED TV against a QLED TV, OLED wins every time.

What about the future? Beyond its QD-OLED TV, Samsung is researching a direct-view quantum dot, which dispenses with the liquid crystal layers and uses quantum dots themselves as the light source. Emissive QLED TVs have the potential to match the absolute black levels and ""infinite"" contrast ratio of OLED, with better power efficiency, better color and more. That's pretty exciting, but it will be a few years before we see emissive QLED TVs for sale. Hopefully, they'll think up a new acronym by then (EQLEDs?).

Then there's MicroLED. It's another emissive technology, once again spearheaded by Samsung but also sold by LG, that's on sale now for the super-rich -- the largest examples cost more than $1 million. As you might guess from the name, it uses millions of teeny-tiny LEDs as pixels. MicroLED has the potential for the same perfect black levels as OLED, with no danger of burn-in. It can deliver higher brightness than any current display technology, wide-gamut color and doesn't suffer from the viewing angle and uniformity issues of LCD. It's also friggin' huge. It doesn't involve quantum dots, at least not yet, but who knows what might happen when it comes to market. QDMLED, anyone?

For now, however, OLED rules the picture-quality roost over QLED.

“The benchmarks of traditional finance still shape the global economy, and there’s no index more important than the S&P 500.”

– Centrifuge CEO Bhaji Illuminati

The Janus Henderson Anemoy S&P 500 Fund went live under the ticker SPXA this week exclusively on Base, a layer-2 network developed by the leading US crypto exchange, Coinbase (COIN +1.92%), which makes building, owning, and earning simple and accessible.

The L2 helps resolve Ethereum’s (ETH -0.63%) scalability problem while leveraging the security of the Ethereum mainnet with the ultimate goal of becoming a “Superchain” of fully decentralized and interoperable Ethereum L2 networks.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently expressed strong support for Base, calling it a model for how L2 platforms should evolve.

Critics say the network is too centralized, but Buterin argues that Base maintains decentralization while enhancing user experience. For security, he noted that the L2 relies on Ethereum’s secure base layer to guarantee non-custodial operation, which ensures that “user funds remain under L1 control, preventing theft or censorship by L2 operators.”

With the faster and cheaper blockchain as its base, Centrifuge has launched the first tokenized index fund, which is authorized by its operator S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI).

This offering marks the stepping stone for S&P Dow Jones Indices to “build the future of index-linked financial products”, said Cameron Drinkwater, chief product officer at S&P DJI, who also noted that SPXA will enable direct exposure to the S&P 500 Index within an “ecosystem that supports liquidity, transparency, and interoperability.”

S&P 500 Goes On-Chain with SPXA on Base

Swipe to scroll →

The S&P 500 Index is a product of S&P Dow Jones Indices. It tracks the stock performance of 500 leading companies listed on US stock exchanges, covering approximately 80% of the available market capitalization.

The S&P 500 Index boasts an aggregate market cap of more than $57 trillion. Interestingly, the ten largest companies on the index account for about 38% of its market cap, and the 50 largest account for 60% of the index.

Nvidia (NVDA +0.28%), Microsoft (MSFT +0.87%), Apple (AAPL -0.55%), Amazon (AMZN +0.75%), Meta Platforms (META -2.65%), Broadcom (AVGO -0.47%), Alphabet (GOOGL +0.31%), Tesla (TSLA +4.02%), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A +0.59%) & (BRK-B +1.02%), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM +0.83%) are currently the top ten largest companies.

This stock market index is widely regarded as the best single measure of large-cap U.S. equities. One of the most commonly followed equity indices, it has been historically used to provide insight into the direction of the stock market. It is also used as the standard for the performance of the economy at large.

One doesn’t directly invest in the S&P 500, though, as it’s an index, but rather in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds that use it as a benchmark and track its composition and performance.

By tokenizing the S&P 500, Centrifuge is bridging the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Notably, this will allow it to trade around the clock with transparent holdings. The traditional US stock market operates only during limited hours, but now with the tokenized version, it will trade non-stop, which can potentially increase liquidity and flexibility for global investors who exist across different time zones.

Another great benefit of this tokenization is improved accessibility. Traditional S&P 500 ETFs or futures often require large capital, and that can now be eliminated through fractionalization. This lowers the entry barriers for retail investors, especially in emerging economies, who can now buy fractions of the index exposure.

This democratizes access, especially for investors in regions where US products are restricted.

By allowing investors outside the US to access the S&P 500 more easily, tokenization makes cross-border investing not just possible but also simpler, while removing issues like currency conversion and custodial barriers in the process.

Putting the index on-chain also comes with the added advantage of instant settlements and reduced counterparty risk, as blockchain removes intermediaries, unlike the traditional finance sector.

The crypto integration further opens up a whole new sector for the S&P 500. The tokenized index can now be integrated into various DeFi protocols, such as lending, borrowing, yield farming, and collateral in derivatives, unlocking new and exciting use cases for traditional ETFs that weren’t possible before.

Tokenized indices can even be packaged into new structured products such as yield-bearing tokens, finally introducing much-needed innovation in the Wall Street infrastructure.

Meanwhile, crypto traders, many of whom have only traded tokens and never really traded stocks, can finally gain TradFi exposure without leaving the familiarity of the blockchain ecosystem. This way, crypto natives can hedge their crypto portfolios with traditional assets.

Tokenized S&P 500 can also help crypto investors diversify their portfolio. With crypto assets known for their high volatility, traditional assets can provide the much-needed stability and reduce portfolio risks.

Traders can also capture the upside of the TradFi market and take advantage of new asset classes while seamlessly moving from one narrative to another.

For instance, the S&P 500 index is up 2.2% in September so far, while Bitcoin (BTC -0.26%) is up only 1.15% and Ethereum is down 10.72% this month.

Moreover, the stock market recently hit a new peak. In contrast, Bitcoin is down 11.7% from its $124K all-time high (ATH) hit in mid-August, Ether has fallen 20.8% off its almost $5K peak, and the total cryptocurrency market cap is back under the $4 trillion mark.

Currently, the S&P 500 index is trading at 6,604.72, up 12.29% YTD and 15.42% in the past year. Meanwhile, its 3-year annualized return has been 21.38%. Just about six months ago, the index had fallen to almost 4,835, but it has since made a stellar recovery, hitting nearly 6,700 at the beginning of this week, representing a 38.5% upside.

So, crypto traders can now easily capture these gains right from their crypto wallets without having to get a broker account. They can also take advantage of new arbitrage strategies between TradFi and crypto.

Not to mention, the integration of TradFi into DeFi makes the latter a multi-asset market. It will no longer be just about crypto but will expand into new assets and attract more users and capital.

On-chain versions of the S&P 500 index can further make it easy for institutions to interact with crypto, smart contracts, liquidity pools, and its many other innovations, further accelerating the institutional adoption of blockchain and DeFi.

With this, the crypto market can also make its shift from speculative digital assets to the global financial layer.

How SPXA Works: Licensing, Managers, and Multichain Plans

The brand new SPXA is based on the S&P 500 Index, but it is in no way sponsored or sold by S&P DJI, Dow Jones, S&P, or their other affiliates.

While it is currently live on Base, the S&P 500 Index Fund has chosen Wormhole as its multichain provider, which will allow the seamless movement of SPXA across different supported chains.

Wormhole is a decentralized interoperability protocol that facilitates secure transfer of data and tokens across more than 40 blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Sui, Cosmos, Aptos, and Arbitrum. Wormhole will handle SPXA’s future expansion to these other blockchains.

For the S&P 500 Index Fund, Centrifuge’s asset management arm, Anemoy, is serving as the investment manager and will oversee the fund, while crypto brokerage, FalconX, is the anchor investor in the product.

London-based global asset manager, Janus Henderson, which holds about $500 billion in AUM, is serving as sub-investment manager.

The SPXA launch “is a natural progression of our blockchain strategy, bringing the world’s most important equity index to a new generation of investors,” said Nick Cherney, Head of Innovation at Janus Henderson. “This is the start of a broader effort to scale our tokenization capabilities and expand secure, efficient access to global markets.”

Janus will make sure the product is executed in line with the regulatory requirements.

The asset manager isn’t new to the tokenized world, having already tokenized two funds, JTRSY and JAAA, with Centrifuge. The first tokenized fund strategy (JTRSY) scaled beyond half a billion dollars in AUM within weeks, while the second one (JAAA) was the fastest to reach a billion dollars in AUM.

JTRSY also received an AA+f / S1+ fund credit quality rating from S&P Global Ratings in March, which is not only the highest rating given to any tokenized fund but also the second-highest rating awarded by S&P. Last year, the fund also got an “A+” rating from Particula and an “Aa” rating from Moody’s.

Following that success, they have turned to SPXA now, with which they are creating a “blueprint for how institutional finance can thrive onchain,” said Cherney.

Centrifuge itself has been involved in the tokenization space for several years now. It first built infrastructure for tokenizing fixed income and private credit back in 2017. With SPXA, Centrifuge is making its entry into equities, a tokenization trend that has gained significant traction in recent months.

“Indices are the best way to bring stocks on-chain,” said Illuminati in a statement. “They’re simple, collateral-ready and unlock liquidity in ways individual securities can’t.”

The company that enables its users to tokenize and distribute funds on-chain is aiming to position itself as the technology partner for the multi-trillion-dollar index industry with SPXA.

It was a few months ago that Centrifuge first announced its collaboration with the world’s leading index provider, S&P DJI, to bring the Index on-chain for the first time, thus laying the foundation for programmable asset management as well as seamless integration with institutional capital markets and DeFi.

The collaboration is expected to help licensed asset managers launch in the future compliant index-tracking funds using smart contracts.

“Having spent most of my career in the ETF industry, I’ve seen firsthand how index-based products transformed market access,” said Anil Sood, Chief Strategy and Growth Officer at Centrifuge at the time. And bringing the index data and fund infrastructure on-chain represents the “next logical leap,” making capital markets more open, efficient, and faster.

He added:

“It’s about taking everything we learned in traditional markets and reimagining it with programmability, transparency, and global, 24/7 accessibility.”

As Centrifuge noted, the index trades more than a trillion dollars daily across ETFs, derivatives, and structured products. By bringing it on-chain, they are opening the doors for institutions, wealth platforms, and DAOs to license S&P DJI index data and receive seamless access to the most trusted benchmark in capital markets.

The Bigger Picture of Tokenization

The initiative from Centrifuge reflects the widespread trend of tokenization, where traditional financial instruments such as equities, funds, and bonds are increasingly being put onto blockchain rails.

Tokenization of these real-world assets (RWA), which also include real estate, art, wine, commodities, fiat currencies, and stocks, is being explored for operational gains, faster settlements, and around-the-clock availability.

Major institutions like MultiBank Group, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock (BLK +0.8%), Libre, and Visa (V +0.73%) are already actively looking into tokenization, signaling its growing adoption in the TradFi industry.

According to Boston Consulting Group, tokenization is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030. Today, it is sitting at $30.89 billion, doubling from the beginning of the year, with Ethereum dominating the market with more than half of all tokenized assets.

Its robust infrastructure, mature ecosystem, institutional adoption, and broad developer support have been the main driving factors behind Ethereum serving as the primary hub for RWA tokenization.

While tokenization has vast potential in terms of inclusiveness, programmability, composibility, accountability, and cost savings, challenges like smart contract vulnerabilities and regulatory uncertainty still need to be addressed for its broader adoption.

Some experts also argue that tokenization needs utility and liquidity to really work. Still, the tokenization sector is fast-growing, with several major developments taking place just this month alone.

For starters, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET -1.9%), which has transitioned into an ETH treasury company, plans to become the first public company to issue its common stock directly on the Ethereum blockchain. For this, it has chosen Superstate as the digital transfer agent, which will use its regulated on-chain issuance platform Opening Bell to tokenize SBET equity in a compliant manner.

“We are excited to raise the floodgates further by onboarding TradFi to composable DeFi on Ethereum. As one of the largest corporate holders of ETH, this major step forward reinforces SharpLink’s conviction that Ethereum is the foundation upon which the next generation of financial infrastructure will be built.”

– Consensys CEO Joe Lubin, who chairs SharpLink

With this move, SharpLink has joined crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital and Solana treasury company Forward Industries in utilizing Superstate’s Opening Bell for stock tokenization.

Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and eToro are also pursuing on-chain solutions for public equities.

Despite the growing interest in tokenized entities, they have only captured about $710 million worth of assets. However, progress is ongoing, with Robinhood (HOOD -0.71%) CEO Vlad Tenev sharing plans to launch a publicly listed fund called the Robinhood Ventures Fund I, which would offer retail investors the opportunity to invest in private companies.

“For decades, wealthy people and institutions have invested in private companies while retail investors have been unfairly locked out. With Robinhood Ventures, everyday people will be able to invest in opportunities once reserved for the elite.”

– Tenev

Nasdaq, meanwhile, is seeking approval to enable the trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs on the same order book as traditional products.

These major developments come following the SEC’s Project Crypto initiative to update regulations for crypto and on-chain markets. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is also working on modernizing capital markets and providing clear guidance to crypto businesses.

CFTC has launched an initiative for using tokenized collateral, including stablecoins, in derivatives markets. Just earlier this year, the agency tapped Ripple, Coinbase, Circle, Moonpay, and Crypto.com for a non-cash collateral derivatives pilot program.

In contrast to the crypto-friendly positioning of the US authorities under the Donald Trump administration, China’s Securities Regulatory Commission is giving top brokerages informal advice to pause RWA tokenization activities in Hong Kong.

This comes after authorities asked brokers to stop endorsing stablecoins in their research in order to cool retail enthusiasm.

Still, fintech giant Ant Group is advancing in the field through its blockchain arm Ant Digital Technologies. They are currently working on bringing more than $8.4 billion worth of energy assets on-chain. They have already been tracking power output and monitoring outages across 15 million new energy devices in China, and moved it all onto its own AntChain. The company has also done financing for three clean energy projects through tokenization, raising about $42 million for the operating companies.

While Beijing is taking a guarded stance, Hong Kong has released a policy blueprint to accelerate RWA tokenization, while the European Commission is preparing its own tokenization proposals. Recently, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) rolled out a blockchain platform for private funds and even completed a deal.

Amidst this surging interest, asset management firm Bitwise also submitted a proposal for the Bitwise Stablecoin & Tokenization ETF.

If approved by the SEC, it would “provide exposure to assets poised to benefit from the growing adoption of stablecoins, tokenization, and fundamental shifts in how financial assets are exchanged and settled.”

Final Thoughts

The tokenization of the S&P 500 index through SPXA is the latest development in the rapidly growing on-chain space that has captured significant TradFi interest, marking a major shift by showcasing how legacy benchmarks can evolve into programmable, globally accessible financial assets.

Retailers like Ralph Lauren have found footing thanks to this boost in consumer appetite, but there is more stirring beneath the surface. The company’s recent spotlight stems not just from macroeconomic momentum but from its ongoing strategic expansion and digital transformation, which have consistently been credited for driving earnings growth and analyst optimism.

If you zoom out for context, Ralph Lauren has delivered a strong run over the past year with the stock up 61% and momentum building. Shares have climbed nearly 35% year-to-date and are up double digits over the past 3 months. The market’s response has been supported by continued positive headlines, including high-profile analyst rankings and recognition for the brand’s expansion. While the one-day performance can grab headlines, it is the persistent tailwinds and upgrades that set the tone for the stock’s upward trajectory.

With the company’s transformation narrative and recent gains now well-established, the critical question remains: is the current share price an attractive entry, or is the market already factoring in all of Ralph Lauren’s future gains?

Most Popular Narrative: 9.8% Undervalued

According to the most widely held view among analysts, Ralph Lauren is currently trading below its estimated fair value. The narrative projects robust upside potential.

Accelerating international expansion, especially in Asia and Greater China where sales grew over 30% and now represent 9% of company revenue (up from 3-4% a few years ago), positions Ralph Lauren to benefit from rising global wealth and middle-class growth. This supports sustained top-line revenue gains.

What is fueling this bullish outlook? It comes down to three key performance levers and a financial trajectory often reserved for industry leaders. Which ambitious projections are quietly powering this double-digit discount to fair value? Discover the bold expectations that analysts are relying on to justify a premium future valuation.

Result: Fair Value of $345.74 (UNDERVALUED)

However, decelerating European growth and uncertainty around U.S. consumer demand could present challenges for Ralph Lauren’s ambitious earnings trajectory in the coming quarters.

Another View: Is the Market Overlooking Something?

Yet, if we look through the lens of market price-to-earnings ratios, Ralph Lauren actually trades at a higher valuation than the broader US Luxury industry. Does this mean the market is pricing in extra optimism or is it simply rewarding strong execution?

In that kind of world, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) isn’t just another project.","Stablecoins used to be seen as the boring corner of crypto.

They didn’t have the wild swings of meme coins or the promise of explosive gains that make headlines. But today, stablecoins are the ones banks and big tech are circling around.

SWIFT, the global payment messaging giant that connects more than 11K institutions, is now testing payments using Ethereum’s Linea network.

The test involves BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, and a dozen other banks, with a stablecoin-like token at the center.

It’s no longer just about sending messages between banks. It’s about moving real value on-chain. That could turn out to be the biggest shift since the invention of the credit card.

Why Banks Care About Stablecoins

The reason for all the sudden attention is simple: cost and speed.

SWIFT wires can take days and cost up to $50. Stablecoins settle in seconds for pennies. Chainalysis data shows $USDT already clears over $1T per month, while $USDC peaked at $3T in activity last October.

With a $230B market size, stablecoins are no longer a side project. They are becoming part of the financial system.

The U.S. even passed its first federal stablecoin law in July, and banks are considering their own tokens.

Big tech is interested too, with Apple, Airbnb, Uber, and X all holding talks. Google Cloud has already integrated PayPal’s $PYUSD.

SWIFT’s current trial uses Ethereum’s Linea network, chosen for its zk-rollup technology that keeps costs low while maintaining security and privacy.

If SWIFT succeeds with its Ethereum experiment, it won’t just make cross-border wires cheaper. It could mark the start of a new chapter where stablecoins compete directly with legacy banking rails.

What Best Wallet Token ($BEST) Brings to the Table

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is more than a utility token attached to a crypto app – it’s designed as the key that unlocks an entire ecosystem.

Holders get real, tangible benefits: reduced transaction fees, early access to upcoming projects, higher staking rewards, and governance rights over the platform’s future.

That means $BEST isn’t just a speculative play. It’s a passport into a growing ecosystem where usage drives demand.

One of the most important utilities is access to Upcoming Tokens, a presale tool that lets investors buy new crypto projects directly inside the app. This feature eliminates the risks of scam mirror sites and fake launches that often target presale buyers.

By tying that functionality to $BEST, the project creates a natural cycle where the token becomes central to how people safely enter presales – one of the most active segments of the market.

Backed by Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology, the wallet infrastructure itself ensures bank-grade security, but it’s the token that makes the experience rewarding.

With over 70K social media followers and a self-proclaimed 50% monthly user growth rate, adoption is already accelerating, giving $BEST a strong base for long-term traction.

Why Buy Into $BEST Now

The numbers already speak volumes.

At the current presale price of $0.025705, $BEST has raised more than $16.1M, showing strong demand before the token even hits exchanges.

That early momentum is important, especially in a market where many new crypto projects struggle to get attention.

But timing is the bigger picture here. With SWIFT now testing stablecoin payments on Ethereum, the financial world is signaling that stablecoins and blockchain-based settlement are moving mainstream.

$BEST is positioned right in the middle of that shift, offering exposure to payments, presales, and tokenized finance all at once.

For investors looking at the next wave of best altcoins, $BEST is a chance to be part of the infrastructure that could define how digital money moves across borders.

Stablecoins Are Moving Center Stage

Stablecoins are no longer niche. SWIFT’s Ethereum tests show that mainstream banking is finally serious about them.

In that kind of world, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) isn’t just another project. It’s a shot at being part of the payment future everyone from Google to BNP Paribas is preparing for.

Workplace safety has evolved significantly over the past decade in the UK, yet a paradox persists. While accident rates have declined overall, claims against businesses, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), continue to rise. This contradiction points to deeper issues than mere safety negligence. According to HSE, slips, trips, and falls remain the leading causes of workplace injuries. Meanwhile, AXA highlights that one in four SMEs have faced a workplace claim in the past five years. These statistics reveal that safety improvements alone are not enough.

Underlying these numbers are often overlooked risks that quietly accumulate over time. High-risk industries such as construction, manufacturing, and healthcare remain particularly vulnerable. Incidents involving hearing loss, manual handling, and repetitive strain injuries often fly under the radar but carry significant long-term costs. Adding to this complexity is a growing compensation culture that encourages claims even when preventive measures exist. Businesses that fail to actively manage risk through training and compliance may find themselves facing legal and financial repercussions, no matter how cautious their teams are.

The challenge for SMEs is not merely preventing accidents but creating a culture where every employee understands potential hazards, the steps they need to take, and how their daily actions contribute to overall safety. Preventing incidents requires data-driven insights, actionable reporting, and a system that tracks compliance effectively. By focusing on these factors, companies can reduce both the frequency and the financial impact of workplace injuries.

The Hidden Costs Behind Workplace Injuries

The direct costs of workplace injuries, such as medical treatment and compensation payouts, are often easy to quantify. However, the indirect costs, including lost productivity, recruitment and training of replacement staff, reputational damage, and administrative overhead, can be far more impactful over time. SMEs are particularly vulnerable to these indirect costs because they operate with lean teams and limited financial buffers.

Even minor incidents can trigger a cascade of operational disruptions. For example, if an employee suffers a musculoskeletal injury due to manual handling, other team members may need to take on additional responsibilities, potentially leading to fatigue and errors. Over time, repeated small injuries across the workforce can add up to substantial operational and financial strain. Identifying the biggest cause of workplace injury and understanding its ripple effects allows SMEs to implement targeted measures that reduce both the frequency and severity of incidents.

Data from multiple UK studies shows that workplaces with high incident reporting also experience better long-term safety outcomes. When organizations actively analyze accident data, they identify patterns that might otherwise be overlooked. For SMEs, turning this data into actionable strategies is essential. Preventive measures can then be implemented proactively rather than reacting only after an incident occurs. This approach saves money, preserves staff morale, and enhances overall operational efficiency.

Leveraging Employee Behaviour Insights

A crucial element of workplace safety is understanding human behavior. Accidents often occur not because of lack of equipment or safety protocols but due to inconsistent adherence to them. Observing trends in employee behavior can reveal where gaps exist in training, awareness, and culture.

For instance, slips and trips frequently result from complacency or insufficient awareness of environmental hazards. Data can identify which areas of a facility are most prone to incidents and highlight the types of behaviors that precede injuries. Once patterns emerge, targeted interventions can be designed to address specific risks, whether that involves adjusting workflows, reinforcing training, or changing the physical layout of the workplace.

In high-risk industries, where manual handling and machinery use are frequent, behavioral insights are especially valuable. Collecting and analyzing data on incidents, near-misses, and employee feedback creates a clear picture of risk exposure. By understanding not just what happens but why it happens, SMEs can make informed decisions that prevent accidents before they occur.

Centralizing Training and Compliance

This is where Moralbox plays a critical role. The platform allows SMEs to centralize training records, monitor compliance, and ensure that every employee's certification and skills are up to date. Moralbox acts as a digital hub for workplace safety management, providing real-time visibility into potential compliance gaps and upcoming training needs.

Key benefits include:

Automated Training Matrix: Track employee training statuses, certifications, and refresher deadlines in one visual interface

Individual Training Profiles: Each team member has a personal profile showing completed courses and upcoming training requirements

Certificate Management: Secure storage of certifications ensures audit readiness and legal compliance

Email Alerts and Reminders: Proactive notifications reduce the risk of expired training or overlooked requirements

Comprehensive Reporting Tools: Custom reports give managers insight into compliance, workforce health, and training progress

By leveraging these capabilities, SMEs gain a central point of control, helping prevent accidents by ensuring staff are fully trained and aware of safety procedures.

Identifying Patterns Through Incident Data

Analyzing past incidents is one of the most effective ways to prevent future injuries. Patterns often emerge from even seemingly minor events, revealing systemic issues or overlooked risks. For SMEs, a data-driven approach allows teams to focus resources where they will have the greatest impact.

Consider a warehouse environment where slips and trips are frequent. By tracking each incident, managers may find that injuries cluster around particular shifts, specific areas, or certain weather conditions. With these insights, practical steps can be taken to improve safety, such as redesigning walkways, implementing anti-slip flooring, or adjusting schedules to ensure adequate staffing during peak risk periods.

Similarly, in high-risk industries such as construction or healthcare, incident data highlights the importance of targeted training. By correlating injury patterns with employee experience levels or specific job roles, companies can implement proactive measures before accidents occur. Data does not just identify problems; it guides solutions and empowers managers to make informed decisions that reduce overall risk exposure.

Creating a Culture of Continuous Safety Improvement

A culture of safety cannot be imposed; it must be nurtured. Data provides the foundation, but engagement and reinforcement are essential. Companies that foster open communication, encourage reporting of near-misses, and celebrate proactive safety behavior are more likely to see sustained improvements.

Continuous safety improvement involves more than following procedures; it requires ongoing evaluation and adaptation. Employees need to feel ownership over safety practices and understand how their actions contribute to broader organizational goals. Regular training sessions, workshops, and hands-on learning experiences reinforce key safety messages, while feedback loops ensure that policies remain effective and relevant.

Leadership commitment is also a critical component. When managers actively prioritize safety, set clear expectations, and model appropriate behavior, employees are more likely to engage with safety initiatives. Ultimately, a culture that values safety at every level minimizes accidents and enhances employee morale and retention.

Practical Tools for SMEs

Moralbox provides SMEs with practical tools to implement and sustain workplace safety effectively. The platform consolidates training, compliance, and reporting, making it easier for managers to oversee and optimize their workforce.

Key features of Moralbox include:

These tools simplify compliance management and allow SMEs to focus on their core operations while reducing the risk of workplace injuries.

Preparing for Emerging Risks

The workplace is constantly evolving, and new risks emerge as industries grow more complex. SMEs must be proactive in identifying potential hazards before they result in incidents. Emerging risks may include new machinery, shifts to hybrid or remote working, and changing regulatory requirements.

Preparing for these risks requires ongoing education, monitoring, and adaptation. Data analytics and compliance management systems, like Moralbox, enable businesses to anticipate challenges and respond quickly. By continuously updating training programs, monitoring workforce health, and ensuring adherence to evolving safety standards, SMEs can stay ahead of potential hazards and maintain a resilient, compliant, and safe working environment.

Conclusion: Building Safety Through Data and Compliance

Preventing workplace injuries goes beyond addressing the most common causes. It requires a proactive approach guided by data, behavioral insights, and a culture of safety. SMEs that embrace training management and compliance tools can identify risk patterns, address skill gaps, and ensure that employees remain prepared for the challenges of their roles.

Platforms like Moralbox enable businesses to centralize training, track certifications, and maintain audit-ready records, creating a safer and more efficient workplace. By focusing on prevention rather than reaction, SMEs can reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, protect their workforce, and limit costly claims. In the modern workplace, a data-driven approach combined with practical compliance tools is the most effective strategy for building a safer, more resilient workforce.

Chaudhry said the recognition underscored Islamabad’s determination to transform its ports into competitive regional hubs, highlighting policy measures, regulatory reforms and investment in modern technology.

Measuring the profitability Colgate generates from its debt and equity, this high ROIC shows that the company thrives when it reinvests in its operations.

This top-tier ROIC is especially powerful considering Colgate spent nearly $4 billion on acquisitions over the last decade.

While many aging stocks are excellent at lighting cash on fire when they try to integrate new acquisitions, Colgate has a long track record of successfully generating outsize profits from its new businesses and product iterations.

This ability to invest in new growth areas and defend its market share with new versions of products makes Colgate's long-term outlook as steady as ever.

Colgate's once-in-a-decade valuation

Best yet for investors, despite Colgate's brand power and high ROIC, the company currently trades at about 20 times free cash flow (FCF), far below its historical averages.

Meanwhile, the company's 2.5% dividend yield is also higher than usual, making it particularly alluring at today's prices.

If I plug Colgate's data into a reverse discounted cash flow calculator, I find that the company would have to grow its FCF by 4.5% annually to justify its current share price.

Considering the company grew its organic sales and FCF by 7% and 8% over the last five years, I don't think it's outrageous to believe Colgate can clear this 4.5% hurdle.

The cherry on top for investors?

Despite paying a respectable 2.5% dividend yield, Colgate only uses 48% of its FCF to fund its dividend payments, leaving plenty of room for future increases.

And if that's not enough, management has steadily lowered the company's shares outstanding by 1% annually over the last decade, further juicing investors' returns.

Ultimately, if you're an investor looking for market-stomping returns or the possibility of a mega-multibagger, Colgate-Palmolive isn't the pick for you.

However, if you're looking for a Steady Eddie Dividend King home to a powerful brand moat and an ability to profitably expand and innovate over the long haul, Colgate-Palmolive looks like a once-in-a-decade opportunity at today's price.

Prolonged screen time has become a part of today’s digital era. Eyes are being glued to screens more than ever, and this is leading to increased eye-related issues. Laptops and smartphones leave the eyes tired, dry and sore, leading to a condition called digital eye strain. But imagine this, in a world dominated by screens, a simple practice that can be done sitting on desks, can reduce the fatigue of eyes and even improve long-term eye health. This is exactly what the 20-20-20 rule promises. What is the 20-20-20 eye rule

Take a break from screen every 20 minutes

Look at something 20 feet away

For at least 20 seconds

Recommended by optometrists, the 20-20-20 rule is a simple, yet powerful eye care guideline to combat the growing ‘computer vision syndrome’. CVS arises when one’s eyes are focused on close-up screens for long periods of time. Blurred vision, eye strain, dryness and even neck, head or shoulder pain can be symptoms of CVS. Although the 20-20-20 rule may sound like a very simple practice, its benefits aren’t so simple. Over time, this routine can enhance focus and may even help slow the progression of myopia, especially in children.

Breaking the 20-20-20 factor

20-minutes factor Prolonged near-focus keeps the ciliary muscles inside the eyes continuously contracted. Over time this leads to fatigue and strain in the eyes. A break gives the muscles a chance to relax and reduces tension and discomfort in the eyes. 20-feet factor Studies show shifting eye focus helps prevent symptoms like blurred vision and headaches. Thus, shifting focus from your screen to a distant object relaxes the eye’s focusing system. 20-second factor During this small span of time, the eyes recover from constant near-focus. This stimulates blinking, which helps and keeps the eyes moist and comfortable.

How 20-20-20 rule improves vision

The three ‘20-factors’ relieve eye muscle fatigue, support tear film and mixture and may even slow myopia progression and this practice can work as a preventive tool for eye health.

Reduce eye strain: Brief breaks from focusing close-up to focusing on distant objects relaxes the eye muscles and eases strain.

Prevents Myopia Progression: Looking at distant objects at regular intervals potentially balances eye focus.

Improves Visual Comfort: Reduced eye discomfort and promotes focus during long screen hours.

Setting reminders is one of the easiest ways to maintain consistency. One can use their phones, laptops, smartwatches to give a ‘stay-away’ reminder every 20 minutes. Setting reminders makes the habit easier to maintain. Adapting the 20-20-20 rule into daily routines is a practical strategy to keep the eyes healthy and comfortable, even during prolonged screen use.

Les Américains dépensent environ 18 euros (20 dollars) par an et par personne en déodorant. C’est un record mondial. Le marché des déodorants pesait 6,6 milliards de dollars en 2023, selon l’institut de recherche Euromonitor.

Company payouts are stronger compared to previous years, despite brewing macro risks

A weaker dollar and resilient consumer spending support record earnings and stock prices, even amid cautious CEO sentiment

We spot key events as the calendar flips to October, along with happenings at the biggest U.S. bank

Dividend-increase announcements are on the rise. According to the Wall Street Horizon research team, 71.9% of all dividend changes have been positive so far in 2025. That tops the comparable year-to-date figures of 68.8% and 68.6% from 2024 and 2023, respectively. In all, the current-year hike tally is now 3,553. Perhaps the bump is not surprising, given that the global bull market is about to turn three years old.

More dividend payouts mean investment teams need to adjust stock prices to reflect these corporate actions properly in order to conduct time-series analysis. TMX’s Price Adjustment Curve (PAC) provides price adjustments applicable down to tick level prices or even orders, and below you can see the number of recorded adjustments for North American dividends have been steadily increasing. Q2 2025 recorded 11,194 such price adjustments, the largest second quarter tally in our five years of data. With one week left in the current quarter, the Q3 2025 total stands at 8,904.

October also marks the start of the third-quarter earnings season. The big banks begin reporting profit numbers on October 14, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) providing the unofficial kickstart.

Unlike a year ago, however, equity tailwinds are not primarily a U.S. story. With just a handful of trading days left in Q3, the iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF (ACWX) boasts an 11.4 percentage-point lead over the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Much of the difference is explained by a 10% year-to-date drop in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY).

Help from the Dollar

In general, a softer greenback is a profit tailwind for large multinational corporations as they repatriate their overseas sales from foreign currencies to the dollar. Indeed, S&P 500 earnings per share estimates are at fresh highs. It’s against that backdrop that companies, despite the ongoing tariff threat, are willing to boost their dividends. It may leave you and other investors wondering: What could disrupt the steady diet of dividend-hike announcements?

As always, we can put the spotlight on the consumer. August’s Retail Sales report, released last week, confirmed that household spending is resilient, a softening labor market notwithstanding. The so-called “core control group” of the U.S. Census Bureau’s consumption snapshot rose by 0.7% over the middle month of the third quarter, a crucial period for domestic retailers.1 The back-to-school shopping season was apparently a hit—particularly for e-commerce firms.

Jobs Data on Tap

Robust consumer spending may hinge on the employment situation. We’ll know more about that next Friday once the September jobs report crosses the wires. Expectations could be low after back-to-back soft payroll gains, not to mention the steep downward revisions from the annual Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report put out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics two weeks ago. Further labor-market nuggets could be found in next week’s multitude of employment indicators.

According to our Economic Calendar, with data licensed from Econoday Inc., August job vacancy figures via the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) prints at 10 a.m. ET on September’s final day, the ADP private employment numbers come the following morning, and the now widely followed Challenger Job Cuts survey publishes on Thursday, October 2, in the premarket. Investors shouldn’t discount the importance of the Employment sub index readings within both the ISM’s and S&P Global’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) surveys. Those are in next week’s queue, too.

What To Do with All That Free Cash Flow?

How the macro setting unfolds could determine companies’ capital allocation plans heading into 2026. We typically don’t see a high number of dividend-increase or decrease announcements in the second half of the year compared to the first half. A strong finish to 2025, though, and next year’s first-quarter sum could eclipse the Q1 2025 dividend-hike tally of 1,803.

And here’s why that’s significant: Investors increasingly prefer that companies return cash flow to them via share buybacks and dividend payments. That was one of the takeaways from BofA’s September Global Fund Manager Survey. Along with increased capital spending, there’s less desire from shareholders for firms to shore up their balance sheets.

Record Buybacks, Record Dividends? JPM In Focus.

So, will that wish come true? With U.S. corporate buybacks reaching $1 trillion in August, we may learn more on the dividend front soon.2 It’s very much a “watch what I do, not what I say” situation.

It’s hard to go a few minutes with financial TV on in the background without your ears perking up due to cautious words from CEOs and other business executives. One of the poster children for cloudy executive outlooks is undoubtedly Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPM. America’s banker routinely expresses trepidation regarding fiscal and other macro matters. Yet guess what big bank announced a significant dividend boost? JPMorgan.

On September 16, the world’s most valuable bank by market cap raised its quarterly dividend from $1.40 to $1.50.3 The press release came after a strong Q2 report issued back in July and the authorization of a new share repurchase program. Now the third-best-performing component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the year, JPM may have eyes on the $1 trillion market-cap figure. If it were to do so, it would join fellow Financials-sector stalwart Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) in that exclusive club.

How the Fed Fits In

And here’s something else to consider on the topic of dividends at this juncture of the economic cycle: Given the Fed’s apparent willingness to run the economy hot in terms of inflation, additional rate cuts may be in store not just in Q4, but throughout 2026. If that happens (and Treasury yields hold in check), it could make dividend stocks all the more attractive compared to bonds.

The Bottom Line

Dividend-increase announcements are tracking above year-ago levels and 2023’s pace. Even with shakiness in the labor market and some guarded outlooks offered by companies during the busy Q3 conference season, shareholders are being rewarded with growing quarterly payouts.

We’ll find out more in the weeks ahead—first from next week’s employment numbers, and second as third-quarter earnings reports roll in (assuming we are sticking with quarterly updates!).

The pharmaceutical leader is now taking similar steps to enhance its GLP-1 pipeline.
Looking at the big picture Can Pfizer eventually challenge the dominance of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in the GLP-1 space?","The GLP-1 market has grabbed considerable attention in the past couple of years, and there's little doubt as to which pharmaceutical companies dominate this space. Eli Lilly is currently the leader, followed closely by Novo Nordisk.

However, other giants in the industry have been attempting to enter the field, and Pfizer (PFE 0.64%) is among them. Although the company has encountered some setbacks in this quest, it hasn't given up, as evidenced by a recent $5 billion investment that will allow it to make another run at the goal.

Let's figure out what Pfizer is doing, and whether the company's shares are worth investing in.

Pfizer lands another acquisition

In the past few years, Pfizer has made a series of acquisitions to bolster its pipeline. The most important may have been its $43 billion buyout of Seagen, a cancer specialist. The pharmaceutical leader is now taking similar steps to enhance its GLP-1 pipeline. Pfizer recently announced that it would acquire Metsera (MTSR -0.49%), a company focused on developing weight management medicines. The transaction will cost Pfizer $4.9 billion in cash.

Here's what the company is getting out of this deal: MET-097i, an investigational GLP-1 medicine in phase 2 studies. MET-097i is being tested as both a weekly and a monthly medicine. Metsera's pipeline also features MET-233i, a potential monthly weight loss therapy that mimics the action of the amylin hormone; this drug is in phase 1 clinical trials. Metsera has two other investigational oral GLP-1 therapies that are about to enter the clinic.

Although it's far too early to predict whether these candidates will succeed in clinical trials, it's worth noting that Metsera's products address existing needs in the growing GLP-1 market.

For instance, the current leaders in the field are administered subcutaneously once a week. There would be a demand for both oral GLP-1 therapies and some that could be as effective but with a less frequent dosing schedule, all of which Metsera is working on. With the backing of the larger and more financially stable Pfizer, these candidates could progress even faster.

Looking at the big picture

Can Pfizer eventually challenge the dominance of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in the GLP-1 space? Maybe not, but it doesn't need to do that to find success. The weight loss market is projected to grow significantly in the coming years, potentially reaching $150 billion in sales by 2035, according to some estimates. In 2024, it was worth just $15 billion.

Even carving out a smaller niche than the established leaders in the field could count as a win for Pfizer -- especially since, unlike Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, it would not rely exclusively on this single therapeutic area to drive sales growth. Pfizer's lineup features products across various fields, as does the company's pipeline. The acquisition of Metsera will help improve things for the drugmaker, but isn't, by itself, a good reason to buy its shares: Metsera's products could still flunk in clinical trials.

However, looking at Pfizer's entire business, the stock appears attractive for long-term investors. Pfizer's financial results are slowly improving. In the second quarter, revenue increased by 10% year over year to $14.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were up 30% to $0.78.

Pfizer has received some new approvals that should eventually meaningfully contribute to its top line, including Abrysvo, a vaccine for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that generated $143 million in sales during the period. Furthermore, the bottom line has improved in recent quarters due to ongoing cost-saving initiatives. Lastly, Pfizer's extensive pipeline, which features over 100 active programs, should eventually yield significant clinical and regulatory successes.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/834534/patient-self-administering-a-shot.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 14:12:21.539577

What a U.S. government shutdown means If a U.S. government shutdown occurs, it will immediately halt salaries for hundreds of thousands of federal employees.

A U.S. government shutdown is more likely than ever as political gridlock persists in Washington.","The odds of a U.S. government shutdown have reached an all-time high on Polymarket, at 82% that lawmakers will fail to pass the necessary funding by the October deadline. As bipartisan talks stall and key meetings are canceled by President Trump, both parties appear unwilling to budge. The stalemate is turning up the risk of prolonged disruption across government services.

What a U.S. government shutdown means

If a U.S. government shutdown occurs, it will immediately halt salaries for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. It will delay procedures like passport processing, disrupt national parks, and potentially impact social programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and healthcare funding.

Crucial economic reports used by investors to assess market trends may be postponed, causing increased volatility and limited visibility for finance professionals.

This standoff is unique because both major parties see political upside in refusing to compromise. Analysts have warned that the likelihood of resolution is fading as the deadline approaches. A U.S. government shutdown could last from days to weeks, depending on how quickly lawmakers return to negotiations.

Impact on Bitcoin and crypto markets

The growing risk-off sentiment generated by shutdown fears has already rattled the crypto market, causing sharp pullbacks in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major coins.

With Bitcoin swinging between $108,780 and $113,700 intraday, investors have flocked to stablecoins and defensive assets, while memecoins and high-volatility tokens have suffered double-digit declines.

Key crypto-linked ETFs experienced significant outflows, and some analysts warn that the uncertainty surrounding government funding and delayed economic data releases may extend price swings and erode confidence in risk assets. Ash Crypto noted:

“In the past, US government shutdowns have resulted in market correction, and this is why people are panicking.”

Regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC may slow or halt non-essential activities, delaying new ETF decisions, enforcement actions, and policy guidance for digital assets.

A stronger U.S. dollar, often seen as a safe haven during periods of global uncertainty, also impacts risk assets like Bitcoin, making them less attractive to buyers and reducing overall demand. Institutional investors, in response, have pivoted towards short-duration credit, stablecoins, and real assets to manage volatility during the shutdown risk cycle.

A U.S. government shutdown is more likely than ever as political gridlock persists in Washington. The effects would be felt across government agencies and services, with widespread economic uncertainty spilling over into financial and crypto markets.

For digital assets, ongoing volatility, regulatory delays, and defensive strategies may continue until political compromise is reached and government operations resume. All eyes are on Washington and the October 1 deadline, which may not be the best start to “Uptober” that crypto investors are hoping for.

The producing company collected samples of the pre-cooked pasta used as an ingredient in the product as part of an ongoing FDA investigation related to a Listeria outbreak linked to chicken fettuccine alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores. The test confirmed that the linguine pasta was positive for Listeria and further testing is ongoing to determine if the Listeria is genetically related to the specific outbreak strain.

As of Sept. 25, a total of 20 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria have been reported from 15 states. Of 20 people with information available, 19 have been hospitalized and four deaths have been reported. There is one illness in a pregnant mother that resulted in a fetal loss.

The implicated product has establishment number “EST. 50784” or “EST. 47718” printed inside the USDA mark of inspection. This item was shipped to Walmart locations nationwide.

The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a recall notice linked to the Listeria outbreak in June and continues to coordinate with FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state public health partners on the outbreak investigation.

The FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS expects more updates as this investigation continues. As more information becomes available, FSIS will update this public health alert. Consumers should check back frequently because additional products may be added.

More than a dozen major banks, including BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon, are taking part in the trial to explore how blockchain could improve interbank communication.

Linea Chosen for Privacy and Security

On Friday, The Big Whale reported that the project is expected to take several months to materialise. Citing a source from one of the participating banks, the report stated that the initiative “promises a major technological transformation for the international interbank payments industry.”

Explaining the reason for selecting Linea, Grégory Raymond, co-founder of The Big Whale, stated on X that the network prioritises privacy through advanced cryptographic proofs, designed to enable banks to innovate while remaining fully compliant. This focus on privacy and compliance provides the foundation for SWIFT’s wider blockchain initiatives.

In line with this, SWIFT is testing blockchain as a way to make payments faster, increase transparency, and enable more automated processing, all while maintaining strict regulatory oversight. These steps demonstrate how the network is approaching innovation carefully, balancing efficiency and compliance in its interbank operations.

Building on these initiatives, SWIFT has previously explored blockchain and said that banks will begin live tests of digital instruments and transactions on its network this year. The organisation, which connects 11,000 banks worldwide, is also developing an interbank token, according to The Big Whale.

SWIFT Faces Challenges Amid Growing Blockchain Competition

While the project still has several months before going live, The Big Whale highlighted some key challenges that the project will need to address:

Integrating the blockchain system with existing banking infrastructure.

Meeting regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions.

Ensuring that privacy safeguards are strong and reliable

At the same time, competition in international payments is increasing. Ripple has promoted its blockchain network as a faster and lower-cost alternative to SWIFT’s traditional system and recently showcased a stablecoin prototype that allows businesses to conduct global transactions and exchange digital assets for local currencies. These developments show how both networks are turning to blockchain to adapt to evolving payment needs.",https://www.cointribune.com/app/uploads/2025/09/SWIFT-works-with-Linea-1.png?nowebp,N,,2025-09-27 13:07:42.882606

The products, Persilux Zebra Blinds and Autoez Bamboo Shades, contain cords that violate federal safety regulations, posing strangulation and entanglement risks to young children, which can result in death or serious injury.

Third-party sellers sold the recalled items on the retailers’ online platforms. The CPSC has not received any reports of incidents or injuries related to either of the recalled products.

The larger recall involves approximately 133,000 units of Persilux-branded zebra blinds, sold on Amazon from June 2023 through June 2025 for between $40 and $124. The blinds were imported by Zhejiang Xidamen New Material Co. Ltd., of China, operating as the Amazon seller Persilux.

These blinds, sold in beige, black, dark gray, light gray, and white, have long operating cords that violate the federal rule for window coverings and labeling requirements. The packaging is marked with “Persilux” and “Zebra Blinds,” and the barcode label includes “X003FFPT63.”

Consumers who purchased the Persilux blinds should immediately stop using them and contact Persilux for a free repair kit, which includes a replacement operating cord wand. The remedy requires consumers to remove the blind, cut and remove the operating cord, and send a photograph of the modified product to the company at recall@persiluxhome.com. For more information, please visit https://recall.persiluxhome.com.

The CPSC also announced the recall of about 550 Autoez Bamboo Shades, sold on Walmart.com from September 2023 through May 2025 for between $21 and $50. The shades were imported by Sichuan Yunduan Renjia Trading Co. Ltd., of China, doing business as the Walmart seller Autoez.

The Autoez shades, which are brown, have long operating cords and accessible inner cords that present a risk of strangulation and entanglement to children. The shades also violate the federal safety rule and labeling requirements for window coverings.

Consumers should immediately cease use of the recalled Autoez shades and contact the company for a full refund. The remedy instructs consumers to remove the shades, cut the operating cord, write “Recalled” on the shades, and dispose of the product. A photograph of the destroyed shades in the garbage should be sent to Autoez at Autoez_recall@163.com. Additional details can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/recall-autoez.

The proposed 10-day foreign exposure visit of Himachal Pradesh

Health Minister Col. (Dr.) Dhani Ram Shandil and a delegation to London and France has been cancelled, following intense criticism on social media and political backlash.

The controversy primarily stemmed from the inclusion of the Minister’s son, Col. (Dr.) Sanjay Shandil, in the official delegation.

The trip, scheduled from October 2 to 11, was intended for key policymakers and medical professionals to study innovative healthcare models. However, it came under fire after the official government notification, which listed the Minister’s son as the tenth member and curiously described him as an “accomplice,” went viral.

The term, along with the perceived nepotism, drew widespread ridicule and anger from the public and opposition leaders.

Former Chief Minister Jairam Thakur was among those who condemned the move, adding political pressure on the state government.

Earlier on Saturday, Minister Shandil had attempted to clarify, stating that the tour was not immediate and that his son and daughter-in-law would accompany him at their own expense.

He defended the visit’s objective, saying, “Good work is being done in the health sector abroad. Technology learned from there should be implemented here.”

Despite this defence, the mounting criticism proved insurmountable. According to sources, the government has now decided to cancel the visit entirely.

The delegation was to include two MLAs and senior health department officials. The expenditure was to be borne from the savings of the Himachal Pradesh Medical Services Corporation Ltd.

The cancellation highlights the increasing public scrutiny of official foreign tours and the perceived misuse of public funds, forcing the government to roll back its decision.

U.S. Bancorp will lower its prime lending rate to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent, effective September 18. This move comes as part of broader industry rate adjustments in response to changes in economic conditions and central bank policy.

Banking advocacy groups, including those representing U.S. Bancorp, have flagged a regulatory loophole that would allow crypto exchanges to pay interest to stablecoin holders, while banks remain restricted under the Genius Act. This issue has sparked debate about industry parity and regulatory fairness.

Fintech and cryptocurrency leaders are urging the Trump administration to prevent U.S. banks from implementing customer data access fees. They argue that these charges could stifle innovation and create challenges for small enterprises.

A forthcoming executive order from the White House will direct regulators to fine banks, including U.S. Bancorp, if they close accounts due to customers' political views. The policy is intended to reinforce anti-discrimination laws within the financial sector.

How This Changes the Fair Value For U.S. Bancorp

The Consensus Analyst Price Target remained effectively unchanged and moved only slightly from $53.60 to $54.13.

The Future P/E for U.S. Bancorp remained stable, changing only marginally from 13.92x to 14.00x.

The Discount Rate for U.S. Bancorp also showed minimal change, moving from 7.73 percent to 7.78 percent.

South Holland District Council has ruled that BoyleSports can take on the former Barclays Bank unit at 10 Hall Place in Spalding.

Officers made the decision, ruling that the addition of another bookmaker would ‘support the vitality and viability’ of the town centre - a verdict that is likely to spark controversy among the many opponents of the plan.

Spalding already has four bookies — two Ladbrokes, a BetFred and a William Hill - plus a Merkur Slots casino and a New Horizon gaming centre.

Critics say that there are too many of these establishments — and raised concerns over issues with gambling addiction.

However, BoyleSports argued that four of the circa 300 units in the town centre are betting establishments and says one more would take the proportion from 1.3% to 1.6% and that ‘it therefore cannot reasonably be said that the proposed development would lead to saturation or constitute proliferation’.

In quoting the argument made by the bookmaker, the district council ruled: “Taking into consideration the relatively low percentage of betting shops that exist both within the primary shopping frontage and town centre as a whole it is not considered that the addition of a further betting office would result in an over-proliferation of similar uses.”

BoyleSports says it would invest about £300,000 into the shop and that it would employ three full time and three part time workers. The shop would open from 8am to 10pm.

The firm suggested that its new store could actually attract people to the town centre and submitted a footfall survey to back this up.

Of this, council officers said: “In the absence of any evidence to the contrary it is considered that the provision of a further betting shop would maintain and support the vitality and viability of Spalding town centre.”

Opponents to the scheme were also concerned about the impact on the appearance of the town centre, the loss of a potentially prime retail site and fears over the possibility of anti-social behaviour and crime.

A BoyleSports statement in response said: “There is no evidence of antisocial behaviour linked to existing betting offices in Spalding town centre, measures to mitigate potential issues are a matter for licencing.

“One of the licensing objectives BoyleSports must demonstrate relates to the 'protection of the vulnerable' and therefore robust policies are in place to ensure this.""

If you don't want to browse through all of the products on offer, I've looked through the sale and picked out 15 of the best deals I recommend.

Let's start with this LG B5 48-inch OLED TV for $599.99 (was $1,299.99). We were huge fans of the previous LG B4 here at TechRadar, rating it as one of the best budget OLED TVs you could buy. Now that the B5 has taken its place, it slips right into that same slot, with its affordable price, impressive contrast and rich blacks, and 120Hz VRR support for gamers.

Elsewhere, you can score some record-low prices on Apple MacBooks, including the latest M4 model and the older but still capable M2 version. It makes sense to go for the newest laptop if your budget stretches that far, but I can't deny that the MacBook Air 13-inch (M2) for $649 (was $799) is incredible value for money if you need a powerful all-around device.

Those are just a couple of my personal recommendations from this weekend's Best Buy flash sale. You can check out more hand-picked tech deals below that I'd buy right now before the offers end Sunday.

According to renowned market analyst Ali Martinez, XRP currently has a price gap sitting between $2.51 and $2.73, a technical phenomenon that could have significant implications for traders and investors.

Price gaps occur when an asset’s price jumps or drops sharply without any trading occurring in the intervening range, often signaling strong market momentum or a potential area of price correction.

Martinez highlights that this gap represents a critical zone where XRP may experience heightened activity. Historically, such gaps tend to act as magnets, with prices often revisiting the range to “fill” the gap before resuming a larger trend.

In practical terms, this could mean that XRP might retrace toward $2.51 if selling pressure intensifies, or rally past $2.73 if bullish momentum dominates.

Notably, this gap aligns with broader technical signals pointing to heightened volatility. Gaps often reveal abrupt shifts in supply and demand, and in XRP’s case, it may signal traders rapidly repositioning amid recent price swings and wider macroeconomic pressures on the crypto market.

Interestingly, Price gaps often act as psychological markers, shaping trader behavior. XRP’s $2.51–$2.73 zone could serve as a pivotal support-resistance range, buyers may view the lower bound as a bargain entry, while sellers see the upper bound as a profit-taking target. How the market responds at these levels will be key in defining XRP’s short-term trajectory.

Barclays Report Highlights Crucial Deadline for Crypto Integration into Global Payments

Popular crypto observer SMQKE has highlighted a recent Barclays report confirming the November 2025 ISO 20022 deadline as a pivotal moment for global payments and crypto integration.

The shift is set to reshape how banks, fintechs, and digital asset markets connect, marking a milestone that could redefine the future of finance.

SWIFT projects 91% of financial institutions will be ISO 20022-ready by November 2025, a milestone that upgrades payment data standards and paves the way for seamless interoperability between fiat, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins.

Barclays notes that ISO 20022’s enhanced data model will be pivotal in bridging digital and fiat assets. By streamlining cross-border payments, accelerating settlements, and providing greater transaction transparency, it lays the foundation for crypto’s seamless integration into global finance.

Meanwhile, the November 2025 deadline is not the end of payments transformation but the launchpad for a new era of financial innovation. ISO 20022’s enhanced messaging standards enable instant payments, streamlined APIs, and broader open banking adoption, while setting the stage for digital assets to enter mainstream commerce.

ISO 20022’s standardized, data-rich framework is set to fuel financial innovation—enabling real-time cross-border payments, automated digital asset settlement, and seamless integration between traditional banking and DeFi ecosystems.

For crypto enthusiasts, the November 2025 ISO 20022 deadline marks a pivotal shift where regulatory-compliant, interoperable systems are converging with blockchain’s capabilities. This isn’t just a technical upgrade, it’s the catalyst for embedding digital assets like XRP into the global payments ecosystem.

Conclusion

The November 2025 ISO 20022 deadline is far more than a compliance milestone, it is the foundation of a new financial era. By bridging traditional payments with digital assets, it sets the stage for faster, smarter, and more inclusive global transactions.

As banks, fintechs, and crypto platforms align under this universal standard, the payments industry will not only become more efficient but also more open to innovation.

Meanwhile, XRP’s price gap between $2.51 and $2.73 is more than just a technical curiosity, it’s a battleground for momentum where buyers and sellers will likely define the token’s short-term direction.

ID17,CVS Health,2025-09-27 14:02:10+00:00,Boston 25 News,Mass. health officials announce two additional human cases of West Nile virus,Natalie Khait,,,,,https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/mass-health-officials-announce-two-additional-human-cases-west-nile-virus/UHTO7T6ORRG6JGJU5QREWUWE5M/,"— The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) has announced two new human cases of West Nile virus (WNV), bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the state this season to eight.
As a result of these additional cases, WNV risk levels have been elevated to high in the communities of Arlington, Chelsea, Medford, and Waltham.
State officials shared the following tips to help prevent mosquito bites and the transmission of the virus: Avoid mosquito bites and be aware of peak mosquito hours.
Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites.
Horse owners should keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes.","Mass. — The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) has announced two new human cases of West Nile virus (WNV), bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the state this season to eight.

The newly reported cases involve a woman in her 60s from Middlesex County and a man in his 50s from Suffolk County.

As a result of these additional cases, WNV risk levels have been elevated to high in the communities of Arlington, Chelsea, Medford, and Waltham.

The first WNV-positive mosquitoes of the season were detected on June 17, and since then, 445 mosquito samples have tested positive for the virus across 12 counties, including Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol, Dukes, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester.

There has also been one confirmed animal case of WNV this year, involving a goat.

Currently, 47 municipalities across Suffolk, Middlesex, Essex, and Worcester counties are considered to be at high risk for WNV, while 210 additional cities and towns across the state are at moderate risk.

In addition to WNV, Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has also been detected in the state this year, with 23 EEE-positive mosquito samples identified, though no human or animal cases have been reported to date.

State officials shared the following tips to help prevent mosquito bites and the transmission of the virus:

Avoid mosquito bites and be aware of peak mosquito hours. The hours from dusk to dawn are peak biting times for many mosquitoes. Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening, after 6 p.m. or early morning. Otherwise, take extra care to use repellent and protective clothing. Mosquitoes can be active during daylight hours when the temperatures are cool.

Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites. Although it may be difficult to do when it is hot, wearing long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.

Apply insect repellent when you go outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)] according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used on infants younger than 2 months of age and should be used in concentrations of 30 percent or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children younger than 3 years of age.

Mosquito-proof your Home and drain standing water. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by either draining or getting rid of items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and change water in birdbaths frequently.

Install or repair screens. Some mosquitoes like to come indoors. Keep them outside by having tightly fitted screens on all windows and doors.

Protect your animals. Animal owners should reduce potential mosquito breeding sites on their property by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires, and wading pools – especially after heavy rains.

Water troughs provide excellent mosquito breeding habitats and should be flushed out at least once a week during the summer months to reduce mosquitoes near paddock areas. Horse owners should keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Owners should also speak with their veterinarian about mosquito repellents approved for use in animals and vaccinations to prevent WNV and EEE.

If an animal is suspected of having West Nile Virus or EEE, owners are required to report to the Department of Agricultural Resources, Division of Animal Health by calling 617-626-1795, and to the Department of Public Health by calling 617- 983-6800.

More information, including all West Nile Virus- and EEE-positive results can be found at this website or by calling the DPH Division of Epidemiology at 617-983-6800.

This was a more than decent result, which should be compared to the total underperformance of his teammate Fabio Di Giannantonio at the Twin Ring Motegi. The Italian, who has not always stood out for the right reasons this year, would still like to be a little closer to the top positions. But the road is still long.

""Franky"", who can finally be satisfied with his second day in Japan, puts his level of performance into perspective. « A good Saturday with good progress compared to FridayArriving at the pits this morning, I was still a bit sore from yesterday, but the team was super positive and gave me the energy I needed to tackle FP2. We had a solid FP2 and then had good pace in Q1. This is how we got to the second qualifying session."" could be read in the columns of speedweek.

The pace was there, but the small gap that separated him from the leaders seemed difficult to close. “Q2 was good, even with one tire. We were able to secure a second row position. The sprint was solid; I managed to stay in the leading group throughout the race and finished just eight tenths off the podium placesIf we want to fight for the top 3, we will have to improve a few points. added the Italian.

Morbidelli explained what made the difference between him and the others during the Sprint. “We had a slight disadvantage in acceleration, because I didn't have the grip I expected. It also made me lose feeling when braking.. After a few laps, I found some feeling again, but it was too late."" he concluded.

Alors que d’autres auraient pu se contenter d’une quatrième place, le Catalan a attaqué pour monter sur le podium de la course sprint à Fuji.

Pourtant, rien ne fut simple pour le pilote Ducati, en léger retrait depuis le début du week-end, où il concède avoir une « pression supplémentaire ». Car à Motegi, Marc a l’occasion de devenir champion du monde pour la septième fois en MotoGP, la neuvième en Grand Prix. Pour cela, il lui faut marquer trois points de plus que son frère et dauphin Álex, qui lui ouvre grand la porte avec zéro point marqué en Sprint et une élimination en Q1 qui compromet déjà son Grand Prix.

Márquez sur l’autoroute du titre

Encore fallait-il que Marc Márquez concrétise, et le premier pas vers le titre a été fait avec la manière : une deuxième place acquise de haute lutte, suite à des dépassements musclés sur Pedro Acosta (KTM) et Joan Mir (Honda).

« C’était assez difficile aujourd’hui, j’ai eu les deux pilotes les plus difficiles à dépasser au freinage devant moi ! » sourit Márquez à l’arrivée, en évoquant son ancien coéquipier Joan Mir et son cadet Pedro Acosta. « Ils freinent extrêmement tard, et à chaque fois que j’ai essayé sur Joan je suis parti au large. Je perdais du temps, j’ai vu que Pecco (Bagnaia) commençait à s’échapper. J’ai donc décidé de faire ma course et de ne pas m’inquiéter. Quand je suis passé deuxième, mes sensations s’amélioraient à chaque tour. »

Cela s’est vu au chronomètre, avec un rythme en amélioration tour après tour, qui lui a permis de terminer sur les talons de son équipier, vainqueur de sa 12e course sprint en MotoGP, la première de la saison. Pour Márquez, l’objectif est de toute façon ailleurs, avec la perspective du titre en ligne de mire. « Dimanche, ce sera une longue course, mais nous ne pouvons pas oublier que notre objectif principal n’est pas une victoire ce week-end », assure le n°93, qui a désormais une main, quatre doigts et deux phalanges sur sa septième couronne mondiale.

As cycle overlays suggest, Bitcoin’s path toward the projected $200,000 price channel is contingent on maintaining technical support and catalyzing fresh capital inflow.

From a technical perspective, weekly MACD and daily RSI trends reflect a neutral to mildly constructive technical posture. The consolidation under $115,000 maps to previous market troughs, while waning RSI and modest MACD crossovers indicate a shift in speculative positioning as open interest flattened through mid-September.

Churn increased as volatility reset, but the market retained its structure, with price bouncing off the $107,000 threshold multiple times.

Surge potential remains attached to breaking above the $115,000 resistance, as technical modeling aligns with multi-cycle fractal overlays from 2015-2017 and 2021-2025.

Still, unlike 2017, institutional dynamics and global monetary policy developments shape the market structure as Q4 approaches.

Macro-tracking sources note that persistent dollar strength, changing US Federal Reserve policy, and global demand for duration assets remain influential for spot price direction.

ETF product flow fades have exerted temporary pressure, adding nuance to cycle analogs. Risk remains, as observed in the case where $107,000 fails to retain support, resulting in broader deleveraging and potential price slippage below technical base, which would prompt a realignment of short and long positions across major exchanges.

How Bitcoin could replicate 2017 rally

Forward projections modeled by price-cycle researchers offer upside channels derived from fractal repetition and market structure overlays. If price sustains closing action above $115,000 during early Q4, a parabolic rise is possible.

As historical correlations persist, technical modeling points to a blow-off phase reminiscent of 2017. Real-time price modeling and cycle overlays indicate further price extension beyond previous cycle highs if macro conditions and flows stabilize.

Cycle inflection zones act as catalysts that sustain upside, but caution remains warranted as persistent macro volatility and policy intervention could recalibrate the projected path.

The prevailing structure observed on multi-year overlays demonstrates a continuing alignment with the market’s historical rhythm, underlying each pattern.

Bitcoin price action follows a familiar cadence, positioning the asset for a potential cycle extension into new highs if conditions outlined above hold.

If current technical and macro conditions persist, final forward-looking projections suggest Bitcoin remains poised to track the upper boundaries of its historical cycle, with the opportunity for cycle expansion above prior highs if sustained capital inflows materialize through ETFs and institutional treasuries.

Spot price action will determine whether the red line scenario materializes, should technical, policy, and liquidity factors remain supportive, cycle continuation beyond prior limits remains a viable possibility, closing the quarter with Bitcoin once again positioned at the center of global financial conversation.",https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bitcoin-rally-etf.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 12:17:15.243612

The Wildcats leaned on senior playmaker Tillman Clements, who broke a late fourth-quarter run for the game-winning touchdown after shaking off multiple defenders. Trinity’s defense sealed the win moments later with a stop on fourth down, allowing the Wildcats to take a knee and celebrate the comeback victory.

“It was just kind of like cardiac kids,” Trinity coach Brian Seymore said. “I thought St. James fullback, No. 30 (Miles Zukowski), ran the ball extremely well. Kudos to them because Coach (Larry) Ware had those guys ready to play. They made it a fourth-quarter battle. We were able to make one more good play.”

The game was tight from the start. St. James struck first for a 7-0 lead. The Wildcats answered back by tying the score at 7-7 before Clements raced down the sideline to put the Wildcats up 14-7 late in the first quarter.

St. James answered as quarterback Mason Craig found Grant Phillips out of the backfield for a 24-yard completion to set up the running back’s 6-yard run into the end zone to tie the game at 14-14 midway through the second.

Both defenses stiffened as turnovers and missed opportunities marked the remainder of the second quarter. St. James missed a 37-yard field goal at the halftime horn, keeping the game tied.

The Trojans grabbed momentum after the break. Philips broke free on a 53-yard scoring run to give St. James a 21-14 lead. Trinity quarterback Land Shapeless responded by hitting John Allen Schroll for a 29-yard touchdown that tied the game once again.

With 10 minutes left, St. James pushed ahead once more on a quarterback sneak, making it 28-21. But the Wildcats refused to go away. Shapeless scrambled and found Clements uncovered in the end zone to knot the score at 28 with just under seven minutes remaining.

That set up for the wild finish. The Wildcat defense came up with a clutch stop on a fourth-and-two play by St. James to get the ball back. On the ensuing drive, a defensive penalty helped push the Wildcats into scoring position. Clements then provided the play of the night, breaking loose from four would-be tacklers to score on a 34-yard run with 74 seconds remaining. Though the extra point was blocked, Trinity’s defense held firm in the final minute to preserve the 34-28 win.

“Our kids believe, man. When you believe, you’ve got a fighting chance,” Seymore said. “They came out and gave us big-time opposition, but we just kept fighting back, digging deep, finding a way.”

For St. James, head coach Larry Ware said his team’s slow start proved costly.

“We didn’t fight like we should have in the first half,” he said. “We came back out in the second half after a challenge. Our kids really fought hard. We didn’t come out the way we wanted to.”

Despite the loss, Ware praised his team’s offensive effort but emphasized the need to return to its defensive identity.

“When you score 28 points or more, you should win,” Ware said. “We have to get back to our defensive prowess.”

After Friday’s non-region battle, both teams jumped back into region play with crucial games as Trinity (4-1) will play host to Montgomery Academy at Ragsdale-Boykin Field, while St. James (1-4) will travel to Tuskegee to play Booker T.

The Matildas forward is set to become the first professional footballer and first Australian ambassador to walk the globally-celebrated runway, joining a line-up that includes Kendall Jenner, Jane Fonda, Eva Longoria and Dame Helen Mirren.

For Fowler, the crossover into fashion and beauty might surprise some — but it’s beyond a burgeoning interest. “Ever since I was young, I’ve loved art and fashion,” she tells Refinery29 Australia. “I’ve always enjoyed playing dress-ups, experimenting with makeup, and using style as a way to express myself.”

Now, the football phenom is using that creative passion to connect with a new generation of sport-loving girls who, like her, are navigating often-confusing identities both on and off the field. “I’ve had my own struggles with self-worth so partnering with L’Oreal to spread messages to girls that they’re enough just the way they are is really meaningful to me,” Fowler added.

Fowler’s walk at Le Défilé, taking place on September 29, is a bold entrance into the global fashion world. “This will be my first time walking a runway, so I am a little nervous,” she admits. “But while it’s a little outside of my comfort zone, the opportunity to walk alongside extraordinary women in a celebration of women’s empowerment, inclusion, and sisterhood is truly inspiring.”

As for who she was most excited to share the runway with? “I’m quite a fan of Viola Davis,” Fowler says. “She’s an incredible actress, but what I most admire in her is how she shows up very authentically to the world and isn’t afraid to speak up for what she believes in. She uses her platform and her voice for good, which is something I hope to emulate as well.”

Mary’s journey alongside the rest of the Matildas has been one of Australia’s most inspiring sporting stories of the decade. When the Women’s FIFA World Cup landed on our shores in 2023, the event broke records and propelled the sport into even the hearts, minds and living rooms of even the most novice football fans in Australia. The Matildas’ semi-final game against England became the most-watched television program in Australian history. The 2023 World Cup saw record-breaking stadium attendance, earnings, and engagement from the public. It catapulted all of the Matildas from sporting figures to national heroes.

“I’m incredibly proud to represent women in sport,” Fowler tells R29. “And I’m proud to get an opportunity to encourage young girls to dream big because they don’t have to be just one thing.”

“

“I want to show little girls who look like me or come from similar backgrounds that they’re enough just the way they are.”

— Mary fowler

”

This seems to summarise Fowler to a tee: definitely not “just one thing”. Unafraid to dream big herself, Fowler has continued to use her fame for new ventures, from charity ambassadorships to even penning a book. In November, Fowler is set to release her first memoir, Bloom. “I know I'm only 22 years old so it seems a little early to be writing any kind of life story, but I wanted to create something that potentially would've been helpful for my teenage self to read,” she wrote on Instagram to announce its release. It’s also this desire to make her young self proud that has driven her to Le Défilé. “I never imagined I’d be walking any runway, let alone one for L’Oréal that’s in Paris of all places. I know little me would be ecstatic to know I’m doing this — she loved beauty and fashion, and she knew how to own the stage.”

And while she’s clearly proud of what this moment means for her personally, Fowler’s even more energised by what it might mean for others. “I want to show little girls who look like me or come from similar backgrounds that they’re enough just the way they are.”",https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935516.jpg?crop=40%3A21,N,,2025-09-27 10:07:37.665894

Mortgage rates have already started coming down in anticipation of those cuts, and they could breathe some life into a torpid housing market. That's good news for a range of stocks that benefit from housing activity, but RH seems especially poised to be a winner. Home transactions tend to drive furniture sales, and CEO Gary Friedman hasn't been shy about discussing the challenges from the housing market.

The company, which was formerly known as Restoration Hardware, has managed to deliver solid growth even in a challenging housing market. Since it caters to the higher end of the market, it should also be more insulated from any headwinds in the labor market.

In its recent second-quarter earnings report, revenue increased 8.4% to $899.2 million, and profits surged as it lapped earlier investments in its European expansion.

RH has a lot of leverage in its business model, and margins could expand if demand jumps. The stock currently trades at a P/E of less than 20 based on fiscal 2027 earnings estimates, and the company can exceed that forecast with some help from the housing market.

Given the company's growth opportunity as it expands to new regions and businesses, RH could soar.

High demand, lower interest rates

Jennifer Saibil (Carnival): Carnival's business has made an incredible comeback. Although demand spiked when it reopened its cruises, the market was worried that it couldn't last. But it has remained strong for years already, and management is investing in all sorts of projects to keep it that way.

It continues to report records across metrics. In the 2025 fiscal second quarter (ended May 31), it had record revenue; operating income; adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); net yields; and customer deposits. It outperformed management's guidance on every metric, and management raised full-year guidance again, like it did after the first quarter.

Customer deposits reached $8.5 billion in the quarter, and it's already booked 93% of 2025 occupancy. So far, 2026 demand is in line with 2025's historical highs. Plus, the bookings are at high ticket prices.

Cruises are far from essential purchases, so this shows incredible resilience in a tough environment. Carnival is the leader in cruises, with the most ships and the highest revenue at nearly $26 billion in trailing-12-month sales. It's expanding its fleet to cover high demand, with the new Star Princess set to sail in the fourth quarter and several more in the works. It's also adding new attractions onboard and exclusive destinations.

However, Carnival stock remains 58% off its all-time high due to its staggering debt. Although it's already paid off several billion dollars of it, the debt still stands at more than $27 billion as of the end of the second quarter.

The good news is that lower interest rates will make it easier to pay off the debt. That's already been happening, and Carnival refinanced $7 billion in the first half of the year at better rates. The new rate cut announced last week should help even more, and the Federal Reserve is expecting to cut another quarter-percent in October, and then again in December.

Carnival announces third-quarter earnings this week. Expect good news on the debt front, which should make October a great month for Carnival stock.

He could have made a big deal of it, but the team bonded, and the player didn't want to have to pay for a whole team dinner again!","Liverpool manager Arne Slot appears to still favour handling disciplinary matters behind closed doors to maintain squad harmony, just as he did at Feyenoord. He has dismissed claims that Hugo Ekitike faced a fine following his Carabao Cup dismissal.

The French forward netted the decisive goal off the bench as Liverpool defeated Southampton 2-1 at Anfield on Wednesday, but was given his marching orders after removing his shirt in celebration. He had already received a booking for a foul earlier in the second half.

Reports emerged suggesting Ekitike would forfeit a fortnight's salary for his actions, though Slot has refuted such claims. Following the same blueprint he employed at Feyenoord, the Dutchman was keen to play down his discussions with Ekitike.

Last year, as Slot prepared for his Premier League debut with Liverpool, American midfielder Cole Bassett, who featured under him in Rotterdam, explained the manager's philosophy on handling wayward players.

""There's a line with him, but he didn't want to make too big a deal out of anything to the point where it affected the team or performances, and everybody started talking about it in the media,"" Bassett exclusively told Mirror Football.

""He deals with it internally so it never gets out and you can move on and focus on team things. Sometimes players do things and coaches go out in the media and make a big deal with it.

""Then the focus isn't on the team for the game. I think he did well when we did have issues to keep it internal. Everyone makes mistakes, and then you move on with it.

""There was a time when we had an international break and the guys who didn't get called into their national teams were able to go away for three or four days.

""One player didn't come back on time for training on the Monday. Arne did well to sort it out. The player got fined and he had to take us out to a team dinner.

""His punishment was taking everybody out and he had to pay for it. He could have made a big deal of it, but the team bonded, and the player didn't want to have to pay for a whole team dinner again! He learned his lesson and no-one outside of the group ever knew about it at the time.""

When quizzed during his press conference ahead of Liverpool's meeting with Crystal Palace, which Ekitike will sit out due to suspension, Slot dismissed any speculation that the 23-year-old had been hit with a fine for his actions.

When asked whether Ekitike would face punishment, Slot responded: ""Disciplined means I spoke to him, but if 'disciplined' means a fine, we didn't do that. It wasn't smart what he did, he recognised that straight away and said sorry to his team-mates.

“A Biological Male competed in California Girls State Finals, WINNING BIG, despite the fact that they were warned by me not to do so.
Zeigler penned an op-ed Wednesday originally titled “California trans athlete policy is something everyone can embrace.” “Everyone?” Not this sports editor.","On September 24th, 13 Congress members penned a letter to the governor, asking him to sign AB 554 — or the PrEPARE Act of 2025 — into law. If passed, the bill would strengthen existing state laws around health insurance coverage and access to preventative medication for individuals affected by HIV/AIDS.

AB 554 would require health plans and insurers to cover all FDA-approved PrEP medications, including injectable forms, without prior authorization or step therapy. The bill’s co-authors and supporters emphasize the need to bolster support for impacted individuals and communities, ensuring that they can access effective treatment plans with as few systemic barriers as possible. The bill also includes protections for community clinics, so that they are reimbursed promptly and able to provide medication for impacted people.

In this letter, co-signed by local elected officials including District 42 Representative Robert Garcia, District 43 Representative Maxine Waters, and District 34 Representative Jimmy Gomez, the coalition of Congress members cites a number of reasons for this call to action.

Namely, they state that the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s reported desire to oust all members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — an independent panel of disease prevention experts that provides recommendations to insurance companies, doctors, and other health professionals — is a move that “risks reversing decades of progress in the fight against HIV, one of the most devastating epidemics in history.”

They also write in the letter that insurance cost-sharing restrictions are especially harmful towards Black and Latine communities, who “accounted for over 70% of new HIV diagnoses [in the state] yet remain significantly underrepresented among PrEP users compared to their White counterparts.”

In a separate letter addressed on September 25th, over 90 advocacy groups and public health organizations similarly stressed the importance of AB 554 to the governor. Here, they discussed CVS Health’s decision to not approve coverage for Yeztugo, the first twice-yearly injectable PrEP medication, even though it was approved by the FDA in June.

The organizations that have signed on include LGBTQ+ civil rights organization Equality California, as well as resource outreach groups such as the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and the California LGBTQ Health & Human Services Network. They write that CVS’s “dangerous decision underscores the urgent need for additional clarity in state law to ensure that all FDA-approved PrEP medications are covered without cost-sharing, guaranteeing that lifesaving innovations are available to Californians without delay.”

The letters highlight a need to address equity and accessibility for those impacted by HIV/AIDS, specifically those who belong to marginalized communities. AB 554 received a majority vote of support by both the California State Assembly and Senate on September 10th, and now waits in limbo for Governor Newsom’s signature. He has until October 12th to sign or veto the bill.

In the meantime, Equality California encourages community members to visit their website to learn more about the bill, other pending LGBTQ+ state legislation, and how they can support these movements.

President Donald Trump is making good on his threat to punish California officials for allowing transgender female student-athletes to compete with cisgender girls in school sports.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it is suing the state’s Department of Education, claiming California’s policy to allow trans students to compete with other girls violates Title IX, the federal law that bans discrimination in education based on sex. The DOJ’s suit says California’s rules “are not only illegal and unfair but also demeaning, signaling to girls that their opportunities and achievements are secondary to accommodating boys.”

As the Washington Blade reported in June, this lawsuit follows a warning by the Trump administration to end the trans participation policy within 10 days or face referral to the DOJ as well as the loss of federal education funding.

And California may merely be the first to face legal action, according to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who warned that the 21 other states which permit trans girls to compete in female athletics could also face challenges by the federal government.

“If you do not comply, you’re next,” she said in a video posted on the DOJ website. “We will protect girls in girls sports.” Bondi was joined by Secretary of Education Linda McMahon.

The DOJ suit named California’s Education Department and the California Interscholastic Federation, the governing body for high school sports. A spokesperson for the CIF told the Associated Press the organization would not comment on pending litigation.

A spokesperson for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom deferred to the CIF and the Department of Education in declining to comment on the lawsuit since the governor was not named a defendant. But Newsom’s office told the AP that the Trump administration’s attacks on its policies protecting transgender athletes are “a cynical attempt” to distract from the federal government’s withholding of funds for all students who benefit from after-school and summer programs.

Newsom, however, has come under criticism — most notably by the Human Rights Campaign — for remarks he made in March, that allowing transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports was “deeply unfair,” as the Blade reported.

For more than a decade, California law has allowed students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity.

But headlines about AB Hernandez, an out trans female high school student-athlete who won titles in the California track-and-field championships last month, drew condemnations from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, and President Trump himself.

Following the meet, Dhillon wrote in a letter to the California Interscholastic Federation that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution by allowing trans girls to compete against other female athletes.

As for the lawsuit, DOJ claims California’s policies “ignore undeniable biological differences between boys and girls, in favor of an amorphous ’gender identity.’”

“The results of these illegal policies are stark: girls are displaced from podiums, denied awards, and miss out on critical visibility for college scholarships and recognition,” the suit says.

Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases challenging state bans on trans student-athletes, as the Blade reported. More than 20 states have limited trans girls from participating on girls sports teams, barred gender-affirming surgeries for minors and required parents to be notified if a child changes their pronouns at school. More than two dozen states have laws barring trans women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Challenges to some of those policies are still being decided by courts across the country.

Back in February, the president signed an executive order that bans trans girls and women from participating in sports that match their gender identity, as the Blade reported.

Supporters of banning trans girls and women from competing include the conservative California Family Council, which has posted a petition online, arguing a ban would restore fairness in athletic competitions. Opponents like Equality California say bans are an attack on transgender youth.

“Local schools and athletic associations are the ones who should be handling these issues, and they are already creating policies that protect transgender youth and ensure a level playing field for all students. A federal ban that overrides those rules could require young girls to answer inappropriate personal questions or even be subjected to genital inspections by strangers if they want to participate in sports,” the organization said in a statement in February.

“The head of the NCAA, himself a former Republican Governor, recently told a U.S. Senate panel that he knew of less than 10 out transgender athletes among the 510,000 currently competing in college sports—less than .002 percent of all NCAA athletes.

“Studies confirm that participation in sports provides kids with invaluable life skills such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, and cooperation—fundamental lessons that every young person deserves the chance to experience. Beyond the field, sports also contribute significantly to students’ overall well-being, fostering better mental health, boosting academic performance, and enhancing self-esteem and confidence.”

Williams Institute at UCLA has released its latest report, highlighting the intersection between LGBTQ and immigration issues and the impact of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) raids across Los Angeles on LGBTQ people.

According to the brief, LGBTQ immigrants who hold legal status, but who are not naturalized citizens may also face challenges to their legal right to reside in the U.S.

Recent reports indicate that non-citizens with legal status are being swept up in immigration operations and several forms of legal status which were granted at the end of the Biden administration are being revoked. Those include: Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for some Venezuelan immigrants, as well as those from Afghanistan and Cameroon, while Haitian nationals are now facing shortened protection periods, by up to six months.

The Justice Department has proposed a new rule which grants the government border authority to revoke green card holders’ permanent residency status at any time. This rule is currently under review by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which could significantly affect non-citizens who are currently documented to reside in the county legally.

Supervisorial District 1, under Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, and Supervisorial District 2, under Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell would particularly be affected as it contains the city center of Los Angeles and nearly 29,000 LGBTQ, noncitizens would face the harshest impact. Those two districts contain many of the county’s historically Black, Latin American and Asian, Pacific Islander neighborhoods.

For transgender, nonbinary and intersex immigrants arrested or detained by ICE, there are additional impacts regarding how federal law defines biological sex and gender identity. The Trump administration has signed an executive order which redefines “sex” under federal law to exclude TGI individuals. This adds an extra thick layer of possible violence when TGI individuals are placed in detention centers or in holding that does not correspond to their identity.

According to the report, ‘transgender, non-binary, and intersex immigrants must navigate an

immigration and asylum system without information about how federal agents will respond to their gender identity and with the risk of greater violence if placed in detention centers, given the effects of this executive order.’

The brief estimates the number or foreign-born adults in Los Angeles County who will be potentially affected by the Trump administration’s executive orders on mass deportations.

Using previous data from other Williams Institute Studies and reports from the University of Southern California Dornsife Equity Research Institute and data from the Pew Research Center, the latest brief states that there are over 1.35 million LGBTQ-identifying people across the U.S., with 30% of them residing in California.

The report further points to 122,000 LGBTQ immigrants who reside within LA County specifically, making Los Angeles County home to about 10% of all LGBTQ adult immigrants in the U.S.

While 18% of those Angelenos are foreign-born, only around 7%, or 49,000 of them do not hold legal status.

Using research from the Pew Center and applying an estimate, that means that there are approximately 23,000 undocumented LGBTQ across LA County and the remaining 26,000 LGBTQ immigrants in the county have some form of legal status.

Among the LGBTQ population of adult immigrants in California, approximately 41,000 are transgender or nonbinary. That figure also points toward approximately 5,200 of them residing in LA County. According to the proportions applied for this estimate, the Williams Institute approximates that around 3,100 transgender and nonbinary immigrants in LA County are naturalized citizens, over 1,100 have legal status and just under 1,000 are undocumented.

According to a brief released in February by the Williams Institute, ‘mass deportations could impact 288,000 LGBTQ undocumented immigrants across the U.S.

In the heart of South Central Los Angeles lies Trinity Recreation Center, known as Trinity Park, considered what some might refer to as a “hood staple.”

Although there is no denying the park’s history of gang-related incidents and even death, for many, the park is also a place full of profound memories, cherished as one of the only green spaces and gathering places within a community that is often underserved. The park sits in the city’s 9th Council District (CD-9), a district known for its lack of green spaces.

South Central L.A. is often characterized by an over concentration of liquor stores and a lack of quality, affordable grocery stores and sit-down restaurants, contributing to high rates of heart disease, diabetes and premature death among South L.A. residents.

For me, the park brings me back to a time when life was easier. It was the place where I made my first friend. This park was my large family’s front yard for over three years and a place that I have passed by and walked through for over two decades.

Trinity Park was one of the first places I have memories of. A year after my family immigrated to the U.S., we moved into a three-bedroom house across the street from the park. The first year in the states was difficult for my mother, who juggled two jobs.

For me, understanding very little English and not being able to speak it made it extremely difficult to communicate or connect with other kids and adults at school. My thick accent was always a point of concern and embarrassment.

Trinity Park, which in the early 2000s was even more notorious for crime and shootings, was a special place for my family and me during the almost three years that we lived neighboring it.

When my mother worked long hours, my aunts and uncles would take me to the park at least twice a week, where I would run uncontrollably and ride the swings for as long as possible. The park, in a sense, saw me grow up and helped me build a close sense of community at a time when I felt very alone and isolated.

That, too, is what the park has been to many of the kids and community living in the park’s surroundings. Trinity Park, is also located 12 minutes from downtown L.A., in an area of South Central L.A. known as Historic South Central within CD-9, where the majority of the population is composed of Black and Latino working-class families.

The Trinity Recreation Center opened its doors in 1968. In the last few years, there have been significant upgrades and additions to the park, including the 2016 opening of a synthetic soccer field and a skate park, which officially opened in 2021.

To what to many outsiders might look like an unsafe and unpredictable piece of land, Trinity Park holds dear memories for many of those who have passed through or hung out in the park at some point in their lives.

The park was also where I remember making my first true friend in L.A., a friendship that wasn’t sparked because we went to the same class or because our parents knew each other, but because of a simple connection between kids while playing. I don’t remember her name, but the photo below was taken the day I met her at Trinity Park.

My mother, on one of her only days off, had taken me to the park. It was the summer of 2004 and we arrived at the park close to sunset. I wish I could recall more than us playing tag and running around the park, but I remember the feeling of making my first friend, one I had made on my own. We probably spent three to four hours together that day playing and at the end of it all, my mother ran across the street to bring her camera. I think she, too, wanted to preserve the memory, the feeling of seeing her daughter connect with another kid after what had been a very tough time in both of our lives.

That was also the park where I taught myself to ride a bike and that gave me confidence, something that was hard for me to find as a kid.

Later in life, although we moved out of the home across the street from the park, my family and I continued living in that same neighborhood and all throughout my high school journey, I walked through that park every day to get to school. In middle school, the park was also a meetup place for my friends and me after school, where we would hang out and share music playlists.

The park has been a silent but consistent entity from childhood to now — adulthood — always in the background of pieces and times in my life.

ICE raids have taken place across Los Angeles County over the last few days and tens of thousands of Angelenos have taken to the streets to protest against the raids and the police brutality involved in the arrests.

The Trump administration has threatened to arrest Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass if they were to interfere with the ICE raids. In response, California has now filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

Early Monday morning, the U.S. Northern Command announced that it activated around 700 Marines, after the Pentagon and the Trump administration deployed around 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles over the weekend. As of today, Trump has deployed double the amount of National Guard troops and ICE raids are said to continue for the next 30 days. The deployment is set to cost $134 million and last 60 days or more according to Secretary Pete Hegseth and a senior defense official.

Reporters have been hit with rubber bullets, batons and have been tear gassed while trying to document the protests. There are eyewitness reports and video footage showing police officers trampling people over with horses, running people over with squad cars and detaining people who have legal status.

In a broadcast interview with CNN, Mayor Bass stated that she believes that if ICE raids hadn’t happened on Friday, we would not be seeing the type of disorder we are seeing. The Los Angeles Police Department declared Downtown L.A. an unlawful assembly area after union president David Huerta was detained by ICE along with several undocumented immigrants. Huerta appeared in court on Monday and was released on a $50,000 bond.

LAPD Chief Jim Donnell says they have adapted their tactics to arrest people, but that they are ultimately “overwhelmed” by the number of protesters.

“We have adapted our tactics to take these people into custody and to be able to hold them accountable,” said Chief Donnell. “We are overwhelmed as far as the number of people out there engaged in this type of activity,”

Mayor Bass said she was “completely in sync” with what the police chief stated, adding that she believes there is enough video footage to prosecute protestors even if they did not get arrested on scene.

“Some people might think that just because they haven’t gotten arrested on the spot, that they’ve gotten away with it and the message I would send is: there’s ton of video tape and people who didn’t get arrested today for committing violent acts — don’t plan on the fact that you get off because you can get arrested in the next few days,” said Mayor Bass.

Mayor Bass doubled-down on her statement regarding the ICE raids and how L.A. is a city of immigrants and ICE raids will continue to affect the local economy.

There have also been reports that ICE raids are taking place across schools and graduation ceremonies.

Los Angeles Unified School District is set to deploy school police to set up safe zones around graduations and school campuses amid these raids targeting celebrations. According to the LA Times, school police will patrol and guard campus entrances when ICE and Border Patrol are seen in the area. Graduation ceremonies will become sanctuaries for families until immigration agents disperse from the area.

Medical providers like St. John’s Community Health released a statement on the issue.

“The aggressive increase in ICE activity is forcing already vulnerable people to fear going to the doctor, school, or even the grocery store — and putting countless families in danger,” said Jim Mangia, president and CEO of St. John’s Community Health.

Community leaders like Tony Hoang, executive director at Equality California stated that as a child of immigrants, it deeply saddens him to see the ICE raids take place across Los Angeles.

“Equality California joins Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta in calling for an end to National Guard deployment. We condemn the raids that have occurred and are continuing, which are xenophobic and traumatizing to families, individuals, and communities,” he said.

“We stand in solidarity with immigrant communities across Los Angeles and the state—and we call on every leader, at every level of government, to reject this assault on our values and take urgent action to protect those under threat.”

A lot happened at last weekend’s high school state track and field championship meet in

Clovis, Calif. Parents of cisgender student-athletes booed the one and only transgender

girl competing. Police and security officers showed up in large numbers to keep

protestors apart and safeguard the competitors. Police made an arrest outside the

stadium after a demonstrator brandishing a transgender pride flag allegedly assaulted a

man described as a conservative activist and caused damage to his vehicle.

The trans student — 16-year-old AB Hernandez — finished a winner. But she wasn’t “the” winner.

As CBS News reported, “Hernandez took home first place medals in both high jump and

triple jump and she placed second in the long jump event. Following a rule change by

the California Interscholastic Federation, a co-winner was named in each of the three

events in which Hernandez placed.”

You didn’t misread that. Hernandez shared the podium with “co-winners.”

As the Blade reported last week, the CIF introduced a new “pilot entry process” that for

the first time, allowed judges to score trans athletes separately from cisgender

competitors, so there were three winners in every event: a cisgender male winner, a

cisgender female winner and a trans student-athlete winner.

The new policy was announced hours after President Donald Trump threatened to pull

“large scale federal funding” from the state if officials allowed trans athletes to compete

according to their gender identity.

Despite the policy change, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on social

media it was investigating State Attorney General Rob Bonta, State Superintendent of

Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, the Jurupa Unified School District, and the CIF for

potential violations of Title IX, as the Blade reported.

So what happens now? As KXTV reported, President Trump issued another threat to

pull funding on Monday in a post to his Truth Social account, not naming Hernandez but

labeling her “a biological male” and using his favorite derogatory nickname for

California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“A Biological Male competed in California Girls State Finals, WINNING BIG, despite the

fact that they were warned by me not to do so. As Governor Gavin Newscum fully

understands, large scale fines will be imposed!!!”

Now, the pundits are weighing-in. Sara Pequeño wrote in USA Today how she was

encouraged to see Hernandez share the 2nd place podium with Brooke White and “put

their arms around each other.”

“They’re setting an example for how all of us should treat our trans neighbors, i.e.,

treating them like human beings, not enemies,” she wrote.

As Pequeño noted, Save Women’s Sports, an anti-trans advocacy group, could only

identify five trans students in the entire United States who were competing on girls’

teams from kindergarten through grade 12 in 2023. “That group’s entire existence is to

hate trans athletes, and they found very little to hate,” she wrote.

According to the president of the NCAA, there are fewer than 10 student-athletes

who publicly identify as transgender out of the more than 500,000 competing at the

collegiate level.

Pequeño was not alone in finding joy in the rules change that brought cisgender and

transgender girls together on a podium, each of them a “co-winner.” So did self-

proclaimed “trans advocate” Cyd Zeigler.

He’s one of the co-founders of the LGBTQ+ sports site Outsports, who in 2023

infamously came close to endorsing Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis for

president, only to offer his regrets, following a backlash from readers. Zeigler penned an

op-ed Wednesday originally titled “California trans athlete policy is something everyone

can embrace.”

“Everyone?” Not this sports editor.

He called the new CIF policy “the best possible path in 2025 to trans participation in

sports.”

In celebrating this change, Zeigler also trashed “goal-post-moving trans advocates” and

policies in California and Connecticut that allow “a trans girl to run in boys track meets

and, without a medical transition, later compete in girls meets,” meaning high school

competitions. “That’s bad policy,” declared Zeigler without evidence.

That policy in Connecticut has stood since 2011 and is enshrined in state law, and so far

has withstood legal challenges once again being heard in federal court.

Outsports at some point changed the headline of his screed to “New California trans

athlete policy is something we can embrace” and apparently made another significant

choice: Despite quoting the outlet’s one and only remaining transgender contributor,

Karleigh Webb, who opposes the rules change, Zeigler did not mention her by name.

Why?

In an article published before the championship, Webb wrote: “If AB Hernandez wins,

why should she have to share the spoils with someone else if’s not a tie? That’s what

professional transphobes like Jennifer Sey and Riley Gaines try to sell. Awarding a

duplicate medal gives their nonsense credence to the detriment of the sport and the

athletes.”

Webb is right. Zeigler and the CIF and Gov. Newsom are wrong. You either win, or you

lose, or if you prefer, you come in second, third, whatever. But “co-winners?”

That’s a crock.

Imagine if the Dodgers and Yankees shared the World Series trophy. Why shouldn’t the

49ers also win the Super Bowl alongside the Chiefs? Maybe Kamala Harris should be

declared a “co-winner” of last November’s election?

Personally, I’m glad to see Hernandez embraced by her cisgender peers. I’m relieved to

know that crowds cheering these amazing girls last weekend drowned out the hecklers

who showed up to boo a child. I’m encouraged that even if she had to share the win,

Hernandez was given her rightful place among the teens competing and proved she

was not only worthy of competing but did not win in every event.

So, she’s hardly “unbeatable.” Most trans athletes actually lose, as Zeigler wrote almost

six years ago, back before he started echoing anti-trans inclusion activists Martina Navratilova, Renee Richards and Nancy Hogshead-Makar.

If he really thinks the CIF “co-winners” rule is going to silence anti-trans forces, I think

he’s going to be very surprised by Riley Gaines and her crowd.

While it’s easy for Zeigler to concede public opinion has shifted, he should know

better than to blame those who pushed for inclusion, when it’s clear that conservative

voices in media and politicians, like his, are the ones responsible for influencing that

move to reject trans women’s right to compete in women’s sports. It’s a pendulum swing

that in time will undoubtedly swing back, once the science proves that trans women and

girls don’t always win. In fact, researchers have already proven some trans athletes are

at a disadvantage compared to their cisgender competitors.

Just as Parker Molloy reported that a Republican-commissioned study on gender

affirming care in Utah actually found “that youth who received care before age 18 had

better outcomes, especially around depression, anxiety and suicidality. Hormonal

treatments were associated with positive mental health and psychosocial functioning

outcomes.”

I believe the science is on the side of transgender Americans. Americans love a

winner. Not a “co-winner.”

The LA County Board of Supervisors and the LA County LGBTQ+ Committee gathered on Tuesday, June 3, to officially kick off Pride Month across the county with a blessing from The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, who purified the space with their sacred chicken, then led everyone in blessing the Progress Pride flag before raising it at the Kenneth Hall of Administration.

“By raising this flag, the emblem of our souls and of our souls, of our love, of our survival, and of the gifts we offer to every Angeleno in this county — you all declare and you declare to everyone both here and abroad, that we are your people and you affirm that this is our home too,” said Sister Unity. “This needs to be done, because once again, our county and our nation houses people who want us gone, who wish us harm.”

Supervisors Janice Hanh, Holly J. Mitchell, Lindsey P. Hovarth and Hilda L. Solis spoke on the importance of representation in the face of discrimination, homophobia and transphobia.

Supervisor Hahn mentioned in her speech that her father, Kenneth Frederick Hahn designed the LA County flag and it was clear to her that he believed that a flag was more than just a piece of fabric.

“My dad, the original Supervisor Hanh, designed the LA County flag and he understood that a flag is not just fabric. A flag is a symbol. It’s a visual representation of who we are, what we value and what we stand for.”

Two years ago, Supervisor Hahn started the tradition to raise the flag alongside the one her father designed and then it was Supervisor Horvath who suggested that the Pride flag be flown on all county facilities across Los Angeles.

“Now, in every corner of our vast county — from our lifeguard stations on our beaches, to every library, fire station — and may I add: all eight county buildings in the city of Downey. Wherever there is a county facility, the Progress Pride flag will send a clear, powerful message to our LGBTQ residents: ‘your county government unequivocally and unapologetically has your back.’”

The comment about the city of Downey is in regards to a controversial Pride flag ban that was enacted last year.

Supervisor Hahn then introduced LA County Assessor Jeff Prang, one of the longest-serving, out, elected officials in the state of California. Due to his long history in government and as a member of the LGBTQ community, Assessor Prang helped launch the LA County LGBTQ Elected Officials Association with over 50 active members from all levels of government.

“We are in a moment of crisis in the nation. Across the country, an extremist movement is working to dismantle LGBTQ rights — from banning books to criminalizing gender-affirming care, to silencing drag performers, to targeting our youth and families with cruelty disguised as policy,” said Assessor Prang. “These are not isolated incidents, this is a campaign of fear and repression.”

Héctor Trinidad-Plascencia, the Chair of LGBTQ+ Commission, encouraged attendees who are not from the queer and trans communities, to remove the blockages that keep them from being in solidarity with queer and trans people.

“With your solidarity, we are creating a different world together starting in our county home and for the nation to follow,” they said.

Healing and uplifting communities through music and unity is the foundation of this event space created by Zacil “DJ Sizzle Fantastic” Pech and Norma “Normz La Oaxaqueña” Fajardo.

For nearly a decade DJ Sizzle has built a reputation in the queer POC and Spanish-speaking undocumented communities for making the space for them to come together to celebrate their culture and partake in the ultimate act of resistance — joy.

Couples, companions, comadres all dance together on the dancefloor at Cumbiatón. (Photo courtesy of Cumbiatón).

Cumbiatón was created during the first Trump administration as a direct response to the erasure, racism, homophobia and xenophobia that was engrained into the administration’s mission for those first four years. Now that the second Trump administration is upon us, the racism, homophobia, transphobia and xenophobia are tenfold.

This event space is a ‘party for the hood, by the hood.’ It is led by women, queer and trans people of color in every aspect of the production process.

The recent fires that burned through Altadena and Pacific Palisades made DJ Sizzle decide to step back from marketing the event in Los Angeles, an area where people had just lost their businesses, homes and where their lives were completely thrown for a loop.

Now they’re back, doubling-down on their mission to bring cumbias, corridos and all the music many of us grew up listening to, to places that are accessible and safe for our communities.

“I started Cumbiatón back in 2016, right after the election — which was weirdly similar because we’re going through it again. And a lot of us come from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) movement. We were the ones to really push for that to happen along with the DREAM Act.”

DJ Sizzle says that she wanted to create a space out on the streets to celebrate life and come together, because of how mentally and physically taxing it is to be a part of the marginalized communities that were and still are, a major target for ongoing political attacks.

Edwin Soto and Julio Salgado pose for a photo at a Cumbiaton event in 2024. (Photo courtesy of Cumbiatón).

“We need these spaces so that we can kind of refuel and rejoice in each other’s existence,” said DJ Sizzle. “Because we saw each other out on the street a lot, but never did we really have time to sit down, have a drink, talk, laugh. So I found that music was the way to bring people together and that’s how Cumbiatón got started. It was honestly like a movement of political resistance through music.”

DJ Sizzle is an undocumented community organizer who aims to not only bring awareness to the issues that her communities face, but also to make space to celebrate the wins and bond over the music that brings people in Latin America, East L.A., Boyle Heights and the Bay area together.

Julio Salgado, a queer, visionary artist and migrant rights activist from Ensenada, Baja California with roots in Long Beach and the Bay Area, connected with DJ Sizzle over their shared passion in advocating for immigrant rights.

“Cumbiatón was created during the first [Trump] administration, where you know, a lot of people were really bummed out and so what Sizzle wanted to create was a place where people could come together and celebrate ourselves,” said Salgado. “Fast-forward to the second [Trump] administration and we’re here and feel a little bit more like: ‘oh shit, things are bad again.’ But, things have always been bad.”

Salgado is involved with Cumbiatón through his art. He is a mixed-media artist who creates cartoons using his lived experience with his sobriety journey, undocumented status and queer identity.

With a background in journalism from California State University, Long Beach, Salgado documents what activists do in the undocumented spaces he has been a part of throughout his life.

In 2017, Salgado moved back to Long Beach from the Bay Area, and at the time he started doing political artwork and posters for protests against the first Trump administration, but because the nature of that work can be very tiring, he says that he turned to a more uplifting version of his art where he also draws the joy and unity in his communities.

When he and Sizzle linked up to collaborate during that time, he thought he could use his skills to help uplift this brand and bring it to the forefront of the many events that saturate the party landscape.

“We are familiar with using the dance floor as a way to kind of put the trauma a little bit away just for one night, get together and completely forget,” said Salgado.

Coming from an undocumented background, Salgado and Sizzle say that their experience with their legal status has made them very aware of how to go about the ID-check process at the door for their events.

“When you’re undocumented, you have something called a [High Security Consular Registration (HSCR)] and it’s kind of like your ID and many of these heterosexual clubs would see that and say it was fake,” said Salgado. “But at the gay club, they didn’t care.”

Just being conscious of what that form of ID looks like and knowing that it’s not fake, helps many of the hundreds of people who come through for Cumbiatón, feel just slightly more at ease.

Edwin Soto, who is another community activist and leader in the undocu-queer community, is also involved in the planning and organizing of the event.

In the long journey of making Cumbiatón what it is now, they say that they have all been very intentional about who they bring in, making sure that whoever they are, they also understand the experience of being undocumented and accepted anyway.

“Something that Sizzle and the team have been very intentional about is making sure that [the security at the door] knows that someone might be using their consulate card,” said Soto.

Bringing together this event space is no easy task, considering the fact that their events are deeply thought out, intentional and inclusive of not just people of color, but also people with differing abilities and people who do not reflect the norm in West Hollywood clubs.

“We created the space that we were longing for that we did not see in West Hollywood,” he said. “[Cumbiatón] is what life could really be like. Where women are not harassed by men. Where people are not body-shamed for what they’re wearing.”

When it comes to their lives outside of Cumbiatón and partying, Sizzle says that it does get exhausting and planning the event gets overwhelming.

“It is really difficult, I’m not going to lie,” said DJ Sizzle. “We are at a disadvantage being queer and being undocumented because this administration triggers us to a point that, anyone who is not a part of those identities or marginalized communities would ever be able to understand,” said Sizzle. “There are times where I’m just like: ‘I’m going to cocoon for a little bit’ and then that affects the marketing and the communication.”

Usually, the events bring in hundreds of people who are looking for community, safety and inclusion. (Photo courtesy of Cumbiatón).

That’s a little bit about what goes on behind the scenes — which really shouldn’t come as a surprise for anyone who is out there fighting for basic human rights, while also making the space to party and enjoy themselves.

“I’m really trying to find balance and honestly my life raft are my friends and my community,” she said. “Like, being able to share, being able to have this plática, and be like ‘bitch, I see you and I know its fucked up, but we got each other.’”

Cumbiatón was made with the purpose of making space to include and invite the many different people in these communities who are otherwise sidelined in broader conversations and in party scenes where they are not as inclusive or thoughtful about their attendees.

“How beautiful is it to be queer and listen to rancheras and to norteñas and cumbia, and to just own it,” said Soto.

Among other queer and ally big names like Lizzo, Alyssa Edwards, Kim Petras and Frankie Grande will be taking center stage on Saturday, May 31, at this year’s OUTLOUD Music Festival at WeHo Pride. In the wake of the queer community’s current political strife, Grande is taking the spotlight, unapologetically and ready to bring the party, celebrating activism and sexuality unabashedly.

Hot off the heels of his recent two hit singles, “Rhythm of Love” and “Boys,” Grande is gearing up for the release of his new album, Hotel Rock Bottom, hitting platforms on June 27. The album is bringing queer aesthetic to the pop genre and is a retelling of Grande’s life as he has gone from party boy to stage, screen, and reality TV personality, to getting married and living a sober family life (dog and all).

We sat for a chat with Grande as he prepares for his WeHo Pride extravaganza. With everything socially and politically considered, Grande is not holding anything back this Pride season.

Pride is recharging and gearing up for battle. I feel like we’re in a place where our community is under attack, and this is the time where we get the microphone so recharge and get ready to be loud and be prouder than we ever have before. We need to show the world that we are not to be fucked with. We got the mic, so let’s use it.

No stranger to taking the stage, Grande promises a spectacle for his Outloud appearance.

I’m so excited. I’ve put so much effort into crafting a very beautiful show, a very gay show, a very hot show. I’ve selected some really fun songs from my album that people are going to get to hear for the first time because the album won’t be out. I’m also doing some fun and clever covers of songs that have inspired me. I’m excited that I’ve mixed it up and it’s going to be really fun and really gay.

This Pride, Frankie’s call to the gay community is clear.

Support our trans siblings. It is more important than ever. Go to your trans friends and be like, “Hey, what do you need? And how can I help?” Because they’re the ones who are directly being scapegoated at this moment. To think that it’s happening to them means it’s not happening to you is crazy. We are all part of the same community. We’re all under the rainbow umbrella, so let’s go support the community that is directly under attack right now.

Grande’s album comes at a time when queer folk could use a little levity and party attitude. He has been a long-time spokesperson for the LGBTQ community. He has used his platform from reality TV to his role as GLAAD board member to incite activism. He knows full well the fatigue that many of the queer community face as we continue to resist a brutal Presidential administration.

You have to find moments of joy. Honestly, that’s a lot of what this album is to me. It’s like, let’s dance around and bop and be silly to boys tonight so that we can hit the ground running tomorrow and go get some legislation overturned. My whole life, I’ve turned to the dance floor during times of stress, and I think we do need to do that. We have to go celebrate. We have to remember why it is so fun to be a huge homosexual and what we’re fighting for. But then we need to go fight. Don’t get so fucked up that you have to be in bed for three days because we actually do need to go to work.

Grande has also become the poster boy for sober party gays. Celebrating 8 years of sobriety, he has been very open about his journey and how it fits into gay culture. Being openly sober has gained momentum in the queer community and many Prides now include dry events. Grande knows the triggers that Pride can include and has some advice to his fellow sober folk.

First of all, sober gays are fun gays, let’s just say that. If you’re triggered, get the fuck out. You know? There are a lot of drugs, there’s a lot of drinking, there’s a lot of partying, and sometimes you’re just not fully ready to be in those environments. And if that is true, then just leave. The people who are drinking and using will have no idea that you left.

Also go find some sober friends to go with. I did everything in sobriety, like linked with my sober BFFs, Salina EsTitties and stylist Mandoh Melendez. They were my bodyguards and they were my shield, and they had more sobriety than I did. They showed me the ropes, and to this day, they’re still sober and my best friends. So, get a sober buddy and GTFO when you’re triggered, just leave.

Grande is being very vulnerable in his upcoming album Hotel Rock Bottom. Not only is he leaving himself to be compared to other family members in the business, but he is also telling his story on his own terms with music. What is his intent with his album?

My mission with this album is to inspire others to be themselves by being so open and honest. If you just want to listen to the surface value of my album, then you’re going to have a great fun dance time being like, this is so much fun. But if you want to actually go and listen to the lyrics and dissect it, you’ll see that there’s a lot of darkness and a lot of light on both sides of this album. I organized this album into side A and side B, or top and bottom, as we’re calling it on the vinyl. There’s sobriety and using days, there’s good and bad, and highs and lows on both. So, no judgment, it’s all about just be yourself, live your life, live authentically, and you’re going to get through whatever you’re dealing with.

And his message to the queer LA community this Weho Pride?

We’re very privileged and we’re very blessed because we’re in a very liberal and very blue state, so we need to have the best time and show up. But let’s make sure that we’re constantly beaming our love, light, and energy, and thinking about how we can help people in red states who are not going to have a governmentally and a community-supported Pride, because that is a reality these days. Let’s try to figure out how we’re going to help the country while we’re in the most liberal, most protected state in the world, which is fabulous.

That means just a little bit more that we can do for our community.” The favorable bond ratings will support the city’s upcoming capital projects.
Alexandria has maintained its top bond ratings since 1992, a track record that helps reduce borrowing costs for major infrastructure and community projects.
The consecutive years of highest ratings underscore the city’s consistent financial management practices during both economic growth periods and challenging times.","Alexandria has once again received the highest possible bond ratings from major credit agencies, marking the 33rd consecutive year the city has earned top marks for its financial management – news that City Manager Jim Parajon appeared to preview at a tourism industry event Thursday night.

S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Ratings reaffirmed Alexandria’s ‘AAA’ and ‘Aaa’ ratings, respectively, allowing the city to continue securing low interest rates when issuing bonds for significant capital projects.

The announcement, made in a city press release on Thursday evening, came almost simultaneously with Parajon’s comments about upcoming financial news during Visit Alexandria’s annual meeting at the Hilton Mark Center.

“Last week we went to meet with the bond rating agencies to talk about the creditworthiness of our community,” Parajon told the audience of tourism industry leaders. “I don’t want to ruin the message, but stay tuned. There’s some good news, I think, coming.”

The timing of Parajon’s remarks and the subsequent press release suggest the city manager was referencing the positive rating reaffirmations, which he emphasized are increasingly rare achievements.

The trip to meet with rating agencies had been previewed by Mayor Gaskins during her monthly conversation with ALXnow on September 2, when she outlined the city’s financial planning activities.

“We will also be headed, myself, the city manager and the finance team and I will be headed up to New York City this month to defend our bond rating and to present to the bonding agencies kind of our strategy for the future moving forward and why Alexandria continues to be a AAA city and a good investment,” Gaskins said during the September interview.

“It’s critically important. And if you pay any attention to the newspapers, you know that not many people are succeeding in that endeavor,” Parajon said of maintaining high credit ratings.

Mayor Alyia Gaskins celebrated the reaffirmations as proof of Alexandria’s financial stability during uncertain economic times.

“At a time when we are grappling with economic uncertainty, Alexandria’s top ratings are proof that our city is on solid ground,” Gaskins said in the press release. “These reaffirmations show that our fiscal responsibility and commitment to community set us apart, and that Alexandria can serve as a model of stability and resilience for the region.”

In the press release, S&P Global particularly praised Alexandria’s “well-embedded, comprehensive policies that govern budgeting and reporting practices, and a culture of long-term planning.” The agency noted that it rates Alexandria “above the sovereign,” stating it believes “the City can maintain better credit characteristics than the U.S. in a stress scenario.”

Moody’s highlighted the city’s “diverse and affluent local economy”. They noted that Alexandria’s financial position is “robust and supported by strong formal policies and a long track record of conservative fiscal management.”

The strong credit ratings come as Alexandria celebrates record-breaking tourism revenue, which Parajon emphasized directly benefits residents through reduced tax burdens. At Thursday’s tourism event, he noted that visitor spending generated $88 million in consumption taxes for the city.

“$88 million in consumption taxes, you know, why is that important to me?” Parajon said. “That means that we can fund more books in the library. That means another teacher in the classroom. That means offering a little help to someone who has experienced being unhoused. That means just a little bit more that we can do for our community.”

The favorable bond ratings will support the city’s upcoming capital projects. Later this year, Alexandria plans to issue $105 million in tax-exempt general obligation bonds to fund infrastructure improvements, including the renovation of George Mason Elementary School, the next phase of the Waterfront Improvement Project, and initial work to renovate Alexandria City Hall.

Others say there's still opportunity in this part of the fixed-income market.

We checked in with Michael Chang, one of two subadvisers behind our favorite junk bond fund, the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate (VWEHX), to get the lowdown. Chang, of Vanguard's in-house bond group, runs one-third of the assets in the fund; Wellington Management's Elizabeth Shortsleeve runs the rest.

Chang concedes that ""it's tough to make the case that high-yield bonds are overly attractive today."" But in his view, the U.S. economy is healthy, and relative to other parts of the bond market, ""high yield offers decent opportunities to generate good income in a market where income is hard to come by."" The fund yields just under 6.0%.

The Vanguard High Yield Corporate – a member of the Kiplinger 25, the best no-load mutual funds you can buy – eked past its competition over the past 12 months with an 8.0% return, in part because Chang's portion of the fund was defensively positioned heading into the spring selloff in bonds.

He had a pot of cash and a heavy tilt toward the higher-quality end of high-yield bonds – debt rated double-B and single-B – in defensive sectors such as food and beverage, health care, and utilities. That mix of bonds weathered the April selloff well, Chang says.

Hunting for bargains

Chang and his team of 15 managers, traders and analysts also boosted the fund's performance by snapping up stakes in lower-quality high-yield debt – rated single-B and triple-C – that had sold off, ""in some cases dramatically,"" he says.

Apple is notorious for surprising loyal iPhone users with the latest and fastest models, and this September, we’re getting a shiny new series, called the iPhone 17. To add to the excitement, T-Mobile, which offers the best network (according to Ookla Speedtest), will extend a truly can’t-miss deal on the new cell phones, so you get the best of both worlds. Another reason to get the new phone through T-Mobile? They include lots of additional features and benefits on Experience plans, such as their recently launched T-Satellite service, which keeps you connected even in dead zones. Let’s dig into everything we can expect from the latest iPhone model, and then explore how you can score one for free from T-Mobile.

How Much Does the iPhone 17 Cost?

T-Mobile shares that the iPhone 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199 for 256GB, depending on the plan you select. The prices vary based on the phone’s storage capacity. You can purchase the phone in three colors: Cosmic Orange, Deep Blue, and Silver. Below is a quick price breakdown:

iPhone 17 Pro Max with 256GB: $1,199+

iPhone 17 Pro Max with 512GB: $1,399+

iPhone 17 Pro Max with 1TB: $1,599+

iPhone 17 Pro Max with 2TB: $1,699+

What’s New in the iPhone 17?

It can be challenging to decipher all of the new upgrades each iPhone iteration offers; that’s why T-Mobile makes it simple to understand. The iPhone 17 Pro Max includes a heat-forged aluminum unibody, which gives it a unique appearance compared to other phones, plus a 6.9-inch Super Retina XDR display. It also consists of an 18MP Center Stage front camera that helps users take “smarter” group selfies. Speaking of cameras, the 17 Pro Max features the ultimate pro camera system, which also features 48MP fusion rear cameras with 8x optical-quality zoom.

The upgrades don’t stop there. The new iPhone has Apple’s A19 Pro chip that is vapor-cooled and lightning-fast, always to keep you connected. And since you’ll always be using your phone, Apple also upgraded the phone’s battery life. Now, your battery can last up to 16 hours longer than other models.

The iPhone 17 Pro is crafted with a 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR display, just a few inches shorter than the new Pro Max. Like the Pro Max, the iPhone 17 Pro also has an aluminum unibody design with a ceramic shield back and a ceramic shield front, and is made with three times better scratch resistance. You also get the camera upgrades and a battery life of up to 33 hours of video playback.

What’s the Difference Between the iPhone 17 Pro and the Pro Max?

According to Apple, the 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are “the most powerful and advanced Pro models ever.”

“Both models feature A19 Pro, the most powerful and efficient chip for iPhone yet, enabling the advanced camera systems, next-level mobile gaming, and Apple Intelligence,” Apple said.

When comparing the iPhone 17 Pro and the Pro Max, the key differences lie in their screen sizes and video playback time — the iPhone 17 Pro features a 6.3-inch screen, and the Pro Max has a 6.9-inch display. The Pro offers up to 33 hours of video playback, while the Pro Max includes up to 39 hours of video playback.

One more factor to consider: the Pro Max is available in 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB storage sizes. You can snag the Pro in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. If you’re the kind of person who takes millions of photos and videos and never deletes them, you may want to upgrade to the Pro Max for all of that extra storage space. Lastly, the Pro weighs 7.27 ounces, while the Pro Max is slightly heavier at 8.22 ounces.

When Will It Be Available?

Get ready! The release date for the iPhone 17 Pro Max is September 19, 2025, across most platforms, but pre-orders start at T-Mobile on Friday, September 12, at 5 a.m. (PDT). You can head to your local T-Mobile or the service provider’s website to place your order.

It’s a smart move, but a hard sell.

At least for today.

That’s part of why they’re playing the long game, with young rookies on the floor and young fans off it.

The Nets are aiming to cultivate generational fandom.

And the latest example of that came this week with the long-awaited opening of the Brooklyn Basketball Training Center, right across from Barclays Center.

For BSE Global — the parent company of the Nets, Liberty and Barclays Center — this building is key to building a young fan base.

“It’s huge,” BSE Global CEO Sam Zussman told The Post. “Then you’re a fan. Yeah, I mean, think about what made you a fan. Sometimes it’s the parents coming home, bringing a ball to someone, and all of a sudden they’re a fan of that team. It’s the smallest things. And this is super, super organic. It also pulls the parents in.”

The cold, hard fact is the tanking Nets are going to lose games this season, with winning the lottery a successful result. They’re not converting adult fans from the established Knicks, so they’re targeting a different younger demographic.

The Nets are looking to keep putting down roots in the community after moving from New Jersey, and the Brooklyn Basketball Training Center is an example. Located on Flatbush Ave. on the former site of Modell’s, it’ll serve kids aged 6-17 and be the hub of the larger Brooklyn youth program that includes free training at local schools and paid training at the center.

And of course, it’ll introduce kids to the Nets.

“Your kid comes, says, ‘I want to watch a Nets game’. Good luck telling him or her anything else, right?” Zussman said. “So, I think it’s a way to engage the entire family. It’s the most organic way to do it. Because this is what we do, right?”

Through their partnership with the Department of Education, the Nets provided clinics to 40,000 kids last year in Brooklyn. The new center will be an 18,600-square-foot chunk of outreach, with Nets owner Joe Tsai, wife Clara, minority owner David Koch Jr. and others on hand for Thursday’s ribbon cutting.

“One of the greatest barriers to success is access,” Brooklyn Deputy Borough President Kim Council said at the ribbon cutting. “Our children need to see and they need to be able to visualize themselves in certain spaces. So I’m incredibly thankful to Joe and Clara Tsai for their investment, not just in this facility but in Brooklyn and the larger community.”

BSE Global has further development plans for the area. Even if the Brooklyn Basketball Training Center moves to a bigger location, say, three years from now, the plan is it’ll grow the way the Nets hope the young fan base grows.

In a way, they hope the rebuilding team mirrors that.

The Nets made an NBA-record five first-round picks in June. While it was tough for fans to truly buy into last season’s 26-56 roster filled with players who were mere placeholders, this season they can invest in a group of young rookies who will grow up before their eyes over the next few years in Brooklyn.

“We started this dream years ago. We had Kyrie (Irving) and Kevin Durant,” Zussman told the Post. “What I’d say is, you’re right in the fact that the team now is probably more relatable to someone young, right? Because they see ‘Oh my God, they have 18-, 19-year-old players and they’ll grow up here.’ ”

After the Nets had contact five-on-five on the first two days of camp, Friday was a non-contact recovery day.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-7khhd7jg2-1758925471553.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1758911102&w=1024,N,,2025-09-27 09:05:23.274095

According to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service notice alert on Thursday, Sept. 25, samples of the FDA-regulated and pre-cooked pasta from “Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce” were tested as part of an “ongoing investigation” into another listeria outbreak in June 2025.

The linguine used as an ingredient in the meal kit, which tested positive for listeria monocytogenes, was the same linguine used in FreshRealm’s Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo meals that caused three deaths and 16 hospitalizations.

“We have long maintained that the source of the listeria was likely an ingredient supplied by a third party,” FreshRealm said in a statement obtained by Associated Press.

Nate’s Fine Foods, based in Roseville, California, is the supplier of the pasta, according to the Sept. 25 notice alert. USA TODAY contacted Nate’s Fine Foods on Friday, Sept. 26, but has not received a response.

The agency is conducting additional testing to determine if the listeria is genetically related to the specific strain associated with the outbreak. “Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce” was shipped to Walmart stores nationwide.

“FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them,” the notice reads. “These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.”

Here’s what we know about the investigation so far, including how to remedy the situation.

What is listeria monocytogenes?

Listeria monocytogenes, or Lm, is a bacterium that causes listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, individuals with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and their newborns. Consumption of food contaminated with listeria can cause listeriosis, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Common listeriosis symptoms include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, according to the Cleveland Clinic and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service.

Because listeriosis spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery in pregnant women, as well as life-threatening infection of the newborn. “Serious and sometimes fatal infections” can also occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems.

“Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food,” according to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.

‘Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce’ product details

ID8,Best Buy,2025-09-27 08:19:50+00:00,South Side Weekly,Always Gonna Be the Best Taqueria (Especially After the Club): Atotonilco's - South Side Weekly,Ricardo Gamboa,,,,,https://southsideweekly.com/always-gonna-be-the-best-taqueria-especially-after-the-club-atotonilcos/,"One of the city’s oldest taquerias, Atotonilco’s was founded in 1972 by Don Jesús from Arandas, Jalisco.
My grandfather moved my grandmother, my dad, and his eight siblings into the corner house on 23rd St. and Millard Ave, just a few blocks from Atotonilco’s.
Like my dad, Atotonilco’s on 26th St. was my late-night spot.
When you bite a taco at Atotonilco’s, it ain’t just carne you taste, it’s history.
We don’t talk enough about how the invisible items on the menu at some Chicago spots like Atotonilco’s are our memories.","I vaguely remember being fed in a high chair in my mom’s avocado-green kitchen when I was a baby. Aside from that, some of my earliest food memories are of eating at La Posada on 26th and Ridgeway, Papa Charlie’s on Taylor and Morgan, and Atotonilco’s original location on 26th and Springfield. Of those places, only Atotonilco’s remains.

One of the city’s oldest taquerias, Atotonilco’s was founded in 1972 by Don Jesús from Arandas, Jalisco. My dad remembers eating there then, but 1972 is memorable to him for other reasons. It was the year he graduated high school and the first time he ever lived in a house, when his family moved to 2352 S. Millard Ave. in La Villita.

Like Don Jesús, my grandparents migrated from Jalisco, and my father was born on a migrant farm in Weslaco, Texas. My grandparents picked their way up to Chicago where my grandfather sought work in the steel mills but ended up with a job at a taffy apple factory.

My dad grew up moving from apartment to apartment. The first was on Madison, the second on Garibaldi, and then one on Cullerton and Allport. From there, my grandfather moved them to Taylor St. and Laflin Ave., then 19th St. and Blue Island Ave., back to Mexico for a few months, and then back to the spot on Allport. They lived in an apartment on 19th St. and Carpenter Ave. before my grandfather finally bought a house.

My grandfather moved my grandmother, my dad, and his eight siblings into the corner house on 23rd St. and Millard Ave, just a few blocks from Atotonilco’s. It’s where he grabbed tacos after baseball games at Douglass or Piotrowski or after class at Amundsen Mayfair Junior College (now Truman College).

But mostly, Atotonilco’s would punctuate my dad’s late nights. He’d walk over with friends after a night of drinking, smoking, and shooting pool in the basement. He headed there after nights out with my mom or with friends going off to the military.

After all, Atotonilco’s opened during the Vietnam War, which ultimately claimed more than 58,000 U.S. lives, including 3,000 from Illinois, with nearly a third of those being from Chicago.

Five years after Don Jesús opened Atotonilco’s, it was bought by brothers Oscar and Raul Muñoz who’ve kept the taqueria in the family and expanded to Back of the Yards, Gage Park, and Pilsen.

Like my dad, Atotonilco’s on 26th St. was my late-night spot. It’s where I’d go after dancing to a new wave DJ Mode set at the Orbit, after bobbing to hip-hop at Funky Buddha or after getting high as hell in someone’s backyard.

It’s where I took someone when I really started to like them. I wanted them to see the place where I’ve been going since I was small enough to stand on a chair or needed both hands to grip the soda fountain glass to drink my licuado de Chocomilk.

Through the years, I may have changed, but my order never has: I always get a “torta de milanesa, no más frijoles, crema y aguacate,” and, of course, a licuado de Chocomilk like when I was a kid. Atot’s has the city’s best licuados.

Every year, there’s some list in Time Out or on TikTok claiming to know where to get the “best tacos” in Chicago. If they don’t have Atotonilco’s among them, I assume they’re transplants, try-hards or genuinely tasteless. When you bite a taco at Atotonilco’s, it ain’t just carne you taste, it’s history.

Walking into Atotonilco’s feels like going back in time in the best way. No computerized menus, just the big, brightly colored hand-painted signs. We don’t talk enough about how the invisible items on the menu at some Chicago spots like Atotonilco’s are our memories.

In a social media post, she said: “I had a committee meeting for the British Museum ball (think Met Gala ambition with UK uniqueness).”

Next year the British Museum will display the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts the 1066 Norman invasion and Battle Of Hastings. The artefact is returning to England for the first time in more than 900 years.

The museum is also engaged in research projects with partners across the globe, including an archaeological excavation at Benin City, Nigeria, in collaboration with the Museum of West African Art (MOWAA).

Part-funded by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), the museum also finds financial support through other channels.

Oh right, on the Chromebook Pixel and Pixel C, two devices made by Google.
All of this comes on the back of Google's continued push to merge the ChromeOS and Android kernels, representing a tectonic shift for both platforms.
It just feels like Google is gearing up for a massive release and something that could change the way we think about Android and ChromeOS forever.
That alone should be enough to get everyone excited about the future of ChromeOS and Android.","This week, Qualcomm hosted its yearly Snapdragon Summit, where the company has already unveiled the next generation of flagship smartphone chips, along with new Snapdragon Arm processors. I'm just as excited as the next nerd about those, but something was said by Google SVP for Platforms and Devices Rick Osterloh during the CEO Keynote that caught my attention.

Towards the end of the Keynote, Osterloh was asked by Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon ""What can you share about this new project we're doing together about personal computing?"" Right off the bat, that's enough to get my ears to perk up, as I assumed it would have something to do with Chromebooks and ChromeOS. However, Osterloh's response didn't mention ChromeOS or Chromebooks once.

Google's entering the ""PC domain""?

""In the past we've always had very different systems between what we're building on PCs and what we're building on smartphones. And we've embarked on a project to combine that. And so, we're building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.""

That might seem like a bunch of fodder, but it's just the build up before Osterloh reaches the crescendo a moment later. ""...bringing all of our application and developer community into the PC domain. So we're really excited about this, and I think this is another way in which Android is going to be able to serve everyone in every computing category.""

Pixel Laptop anyone?

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but that sure sounded like Google is working on something major, with Osterloh trying to remain as tight-lipped about it as possible. Then, Amon let another cat out of the bag, as he replies with ""It's incredible. It delivers on the conversion from mobile to PC. I can't wait to have one."" So not only is this a separate platform from say, Windows, but it sure sounded like Google's working on some new hardware.

Immediately, I was reminded of the ""Pixel Laptop"" rumor that was making its rounds in late 2024, which was initially said to be running ChromeOS. However, a subsequent rumor suggested that wouldn't be the case, and instead would be the result of merging ChromeOS into Android, creating a completely different, yet familiar, experience.

Google's cooking something up

That would've been enough for me to be intrigued, but then, our friends over at Chrome Unboxed called out a discovery made by Chromebook Live about ""Android Desktop."" And before that, Chrome Unboxed found references to a brand new ARM-powered ChromeOS tablet codenamed ""Sapphire"" with ""code changes that explicitly add support for an LED light bar."" Where have I seen the light bar before? Oh right, on the Chromebook Pixel and Pixel C, two devices made by Google.

All of this comes on the back of Google's continued push to merge the ChromeOS and Android kernels, representing a tectonic shift for both platforms. Not to mention all of the progress we've seen with Desktop Mode on Android 16, letting you plug your phone into a monitor and being presented with an interface similar to what Samsung DeX has offered for years.

Based on the conversation between Osterloh and Amon, I don't think they were talking about a device that requires a phone for it to run (i.e. NexDock). It just feels like Google is gearing up for a massive release and something that could change the way we think about Android and ChromeOS forever.

Sorry Tensor, the Snapdragon is here

There's another interesting tidbit to throw into the mix here, and it's not something that I was expecting. In the past, I've suggested that Google should make a splash by releasing a new Pixelbook powered by its own Tensor SoC.

It sure seems as though that won't be the case, and instead could be powered by a Qualcomm chip. And seeing as the hardware is at the point that its being demoed, albeit privately, this suggests Google is closer than we thought to actually releasing a new piece of hardware to pair with its new OS venture.

If I were to guess, this would be powered by one of the Snapdragon X2 Elite processors, as opposed to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. This would give Qualcomm a way to respond to MediaTek's inclusion of the Kompanio Ultra found in the likes of the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 and more recently, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514.

No matter what happens, it's clear that something big is on the way and that it's just a matter of ""when"" and not ""if."" That alone should be enough to get everyone excited about the future of ChromeOS and Android.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i26BrmcRAYpBgL6AhxWmVS.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 06:02:30.389509

Auch sind laut PwCs Global Consumer Insights Survey fast 90 Prozent bereit, mehr für Produkte von Marken zu zahlen, denen sie ihr Vertrauen schenken.

Doch unsere Definition von Vertrauen geht weit über diese entscheidende Kundenbeziehung hinaus. Für L‘Oréal ist es die oberste Maxime im Miteinander mit allen unseren Stakeholdern – und dies seit mehr als 115 Jahren.

Vor allem ist Vertrauen das Herzstück unserer internen Kultur und das Band, das unsere Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter verbindet. Wir investieren bewusst in eine Umgebung, in der Offenheit, Eigenverantwortung und gegenseitige Unterstützung wachsen können, denn wir wissen: Vertrauen ist die Basis für psychologische Sicherheit am Arbeitsplatz und damit der stärkste Motor für Innovation und Engagement. Und unsere Teams bestätigen dies in der jährlichen Mitarbeiterbefragung: Mehr als 90 Prozent der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter in der DACH-Region gibt an, dass sie das Vertrauen haben, Fehler machen zu dürfen, solange wir daraus lernen. Auch empowern und ermutigen wir jede und jeden Einzelnen von ihnen, ihre Interessen in internen Netzwerken zu vertreten. Das Themenspektrum reicht von Familie, LGBTQIA, Generationen, Inklusion bis zu kultureller Zugehörigkeit – und das zahlt sich aus: über 90 Prozent der L’Oreal-Beschäftigten fühlen sich fair behandelt, unabhängig von Alter, sexueller Orientierung, Herkunft oder Geschlecht.

Die Bedeutung von Vertrauen erstreckt sich jedoch weit über die Grenzen des Unternehmens hinaus. Sie ist ebenso entscheidend für das Miteinander mit Handelspartnern, anderen Unternehmen und auch für den Austausch mit politischen Entscheidungsträgern.

L'Oréal ist seit vielen Jahrzehnten tief verwurzelt in Deutschland. Seit über 60 Jahren produzieren wir in Karlsruhe – mittlerweile laufen hier jedes Jahr rund 320 Millionen Produkte über das Band -, das weltgrößte L’Oreal-Distributionszentrum befindet sich im badischen Muggensturm, ein weiterer Industriestandort in Mönchengladbach und das Headquarter für unsere Märkte Deutschland, Österreich und Schweiz hat seinen Sitz in Düsseldorf. Wir glauben fest an das Potential dieses Landes, auch künftig Motor der europäischen Wirtschaft zu sein. Unsere jährlichen Investitionen im zweistelligen Millionenbereich in die Produktion in Karlsruhe sind ein eindeutiges Bekenntnis zum hiesigen Wirtschaftsstandort.

Allerdings: Vertrauen ist keine Einbahnstraße, es braucht ein Zutun von beiden Seiten. Auch wir müssen vertrauen können – in zukunftsgewandte politische Rahmenbedingungen, die Innovationen und Wachstum fördern, und in den politischen Willen, bestehende Überregulierung schrittweise abzubauen. Verlässlichkeit, Planbarkeit und ein stabiles regulatorisches Umfeld sind unerlässlich für Unternehmen, die langfristig investieren und Arbeitsplätze sichern wollen. Aktuell erleben wir jedoch leider vielmehr das Gegenteil. Wir beobachten eine Zunahme an regulatorischen Vorhaben, die für unsere Industrie eine große Belastung und eine Gefahr für viele der rund 700.000 Arbeitsplätze darstellen, die allein in Deutschland von der Kosmetikbranche abhängen. Andere Branchen sind hiervon ebenso betroffen. Dabei ist Deutschland Europas größter Kosmetikmarkt. Allein hierzulande trägt unsere Branche rund 38 Milliarden zum BIP bei. Um auch weiterhin so erfolgreich zu bleiben, braucht unsere Industrie aber klare und praktikable Rahmenbedingungen – und ein gegenseitiges Grundvertrauen von Politik und Wirtschaft. In einer Zeit rapider Veränderungen und globaler Herausforderungen werden wir nur so die Weichen für die nachhaltige und erfolgreiche Zukunft stellen können, die wir uns alle wünschen.

Significant control over BRD - Groupe Société Générale by public companies implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions

Société Générale Société anonyme owns 60% of the company

If you want to know who really controls BRD - Groupe Société Générale S.A. ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are public companies with 60% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Meanwhile, institutions make up 21% of the company’s shareholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.

In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of BRD - Groupe Société Générale.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About BRD - Groupe Société Générale?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

BRD - Groupe Société Générale already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see BRD - Groupe Société Générale's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Hedge funds don't have many shares in BRD - Groupe Société Générale. Our data shows that Société Générale Société anonyme is the largest shareholder with 60% of shares outstanding. This implies that they have majority interest control of the future of the company. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 5.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.

Insider Ownership Of BRD - Groupe Société Générale

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

We note our data does not show any board members holding shares, personally. Given we are not picking up on insider ownership, we may have missing data. Therefore, it would be interesting to assess

General Public Ownership

The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in BRD - Groupe Société Générale. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Public Company Ownership

Public companies currently own 60% of BRD - Groupe Société Générale stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand BRD - Groupe Société Générale better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - BRD - Groupe Société Générale has we think you should be aware of.

The CISO Superpower: Mastering AI Identity – The Cyber Circuit

In this episode of The Cyber Circuit, former Levi Strauss CISO Steve Zalewski sits down with Michael Morgenstern to explain why traditional IAM is failing catastrophically in the age of AI agents. From the three stages of AI identity evolution to why “the bad guys have no issue going straight to AI,” they outline why CISOs must weaponize AI for defense before it’s too late.

(WMT) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","Walmart Inc. WMT and Target Corporation TGT remain two of the most influential players in the U.S. retail space, each with strong footprints and evolving digital strategies. Both companies recently reported second-quarter results, reflecting resilience in a tough consumer environment pressured by tariffs and discretionary pullbacks.

Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, operates more than 10,500 stores across 19 countries. Its model is built on “everyday low prices,” spanning groceries, general merchandise, membership (Sam’s Club) and fast-growing digital businesses. Target, with nearly 2,000 stores, blends affordable style with essentials, leaning on its stores as fulfillment hubs while investing in digital growth.

Walmart commands a market cap of around $819 billion, while Target stands at roughly $40 billion. Together, these companies showcase two distinct models of modern retail — one purely built on scale and everyday value, and the other on curated style and brand experience. With both navigating tariff pressures, shifting consumer habits and the make-or-break holiday season, their diverging strategies set up a compelling face-off.

The Case for Walmart

Walmart’s strength lies in its unmatched scale and its ongoing transformation into a tech-inflected omnichannel powerhouse. Its vast store network remains a major asset, serving both as traditional retail outlets and as hubs for fulfillment through curbside pickup, same-day delivery and in-store pickup. This omnichannel strategy has been a key driver of growth, with global e-commerce sales climbing 25% in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, reflecting strong momentum in digital adoption.

Adding another layer of growth is Walmart Connect, the company’s advertising business. By leveraging its shopper data and digital reach, Walmart is carving out a high-margin revenue stream that complements its core retail business. Apart from this, its membership program, Walmart+, provides recurring income while strengthening loyalty.

Technology and operational efficiency remain central to Walmart’s strategy. The company continues to invest heavily in AI, automation and advanced supply chain tools to cut costs, improve inventory flow and deliver better execution. These capabilities not only help the company sustain its everyday low-price promise but also protect profitability in the face of inflation, tariffs and other cost pressures.

Walmart’s international presence adds another leaf to its growth story. Recent performance in markets like China, Flipkart and Walmex showcases the company’s ability to capture opportunities in high-growth regions while spreading geographic risk. Walmart’s strong balance sheet and efficient capital allocation position it well to keep investing in expansion and innovation while returning value to shareholders.

However, tariff costs, wage inflation and healthcare-related expenses are putting pressure on Walmart’s margins. Volatile foreign currency movements are also a concern. That said, with fiscal 2026 guidance calling for sales and operating income growth, Walmart continues to stand out as a resilient company. For fiscal 2026, the company expects consolidated net sales growth of 3.75-4.75% (at constant currency), while the adjusted operating income is expected to increase 3.5-5.5% at cc.

The Case for TGT

Target’s greatest strength is its brand identity — one that blends affordability with style in a way that keeps customers coming back. Further, the company has turned its extensive store network into mini-hubs for e-commerce, enabling same-day services like Drive Up, order pickup and delivery. This omnichannel approach allows it to compete effectively with other retailers while keeping costs efficient and maintaining the relevance of physical stores.

The company is also strengthening customer loyalty through its Target Circle program, now expanding into Target Circle 360. This evolution offers personalized perks and a deeper digital connection with guests. Apart from this, high-margin ventures such as the Roundel ad network and the Target Plus marketplace are scaling quickly, giving Target new avenues for profitable growth.

Technology investments add another layer of strength. In the second quarter of 2025, Target deployed more than 10,000 AI licenses to improve forecasting, automate routine work and sharpen replenishment. These tools delivered the best on-shelf availability in years and supported more reliable digital fulfillment, showing how operational upgrades can translate directly into better customer experiences.

On the merchandising side, the company continues to focus on innovation through private labels, partnerships and store concepts like shop-in-shops. Coupled with supply-chain modernization, these initiatives are building a more resilient and flexible platform for long-term growth. Taken together, Target’s brand power, digital evolution and operational improvements make it a retailer with meaningful upside potential.

However, Target is navigating a cautious consumer backdrop. It witnessed a comparable sales decline of 1.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, with overall traffic down 1.3%. For fiscal 2025, Target expects a low-single-digit decrease in sales. Further, tariff-related pressure and increased promotional activity pose a threat to margins.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Walmart’s current fiscal-year sales and EPS suggests a year-over-year increase of around 4% and 3.6%, respectively. The consensus estimate for EPS for the current fiscal year has remained unchanged at $2.60 over the past 60 days.

WMT & TGT: A Look at Past-Year Stock Performance

Over the past year, shares of Walmart have gained 29.2%, while Target has slumped 43.8%. Currently, WMT trades just 2.9% shy of its 52-week high compared with Target, which sits 46% below its peak. For now, investor sentiment leans more toward Walmart.

WMT vs. TGT: A Peek Into Stock Valuation

Walmart’s forward P/E of 36.69 sits above its median of 35.07. Target is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11, below its one-year median of 13.23. On valuation grounds, Target looks better, as its forward P/E is below its historical median, signaling relative undervaluation compared to Walmart’s premium multiple above its median.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

WMT vs. TGT: Which Is the Better Bet Now?

Walmart’s unmatched scale, global reach and steady push into higher-margin businesses like advertising, membership and e-commerce make it better positioned to deliver growth, even in a tough retail climate. Target’s strengths in brand appeal, style-driven merchandising, and digital innovation remain meaningful, but its near-term challenges in sales momentum and consumer demand limit visibility. While valuation favors Target, the stronger momentum, resilience and confidence built into Walmart’s story make it the better bet at this juncture.

Both Walmart and Target currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

On September 25, the FSIS issued a public health alert for ready-to-eat linguine with beef meatballs and marinara sauce sold nationwide at Walmart, due to concerns that the FDA-regulated pasta in the dish may be contaminated with Listeria.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in healthy individuals. Listeria usually causes mild illness, such as fever, headache, nausea, or stomach problems. But for young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, the infection can be life-threatening.

Again, this item hasn’t been formally recalled by Walmart. However, the FSIS has reason to believe this pre-cooked pasta dish contains an ingredient that’s linked to an ongoing investigation related to a deadly listeria outbreak from chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals, which sickened people (and caused three deaths) between August 2024 and May 2025.

The FSIS conducted samples of the pre-made pasta dish and found that it tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). However, further testing remains “ongoing to determine if the Lm is genetically related to the specific outbreak strain,” the FSIS states.

No one has allegedly fallen ill from consuming this product. However, the FSIS advises consumers to check back frequently for status updates as the investigation continues.

On September 22, BofA reiterated its Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), keeping the price target at $235.

Vivek Arya from BofA retained the rating on NVDA following the company’s plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. The analyst remains optimistic on NVIDIA as he believes that this investment will yield a significant return on investment, potentially returning $300 to $500 billion in revenue over time. This investment positions NVIDIA to be a key strategic compute and networking partner of OpenAI, enhancing its competitive advantage over its peers, such as Broadcom and AMD.

Moreover, NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) strong positioning in the rapidly growing AI sector, driven by a compelling valuation, supports Arya’s Overweight rating on the stock. The company’s robust FCF margins and major investments in the ecosystem are projected to expand its addressable market and accelerate product development in AI, adding to its growth prospects. NVIDIA’s CEO Jensen Huang has mentioned on several occasions that the investors have confidence in the company’s future to strengthen its supply chain partners.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a full-stack computing infrastructure company. It stands at the center stage of this AI era as the company’s Compute & Networking segment offers its Data Center, driven by computing platforms, AI solutions, and software.

We know that on-field ads would be first, but they won’t be the last.

We’ve got a few months to wonder what the Orange will be wearing, so we put it to the TNIAAM staff to get some early thoughts on potential sponsors and here’s what we came up with?

Dom: My not-so-serious list includes something with Dunkin’ (imagine a DART runs on Dunkin’ patch or something like that… the design possibilities are endless, and so are the endorsements). Do the Orange go with Johnson & Johnson to embrace #JerseyCulture (its HQ is there, after all)? Jokes aside: how about the obvious choice in Coca-Cola, Syracuse University’s new non-alcoholic beverage partner and an owner of Fanta? The Syracuse Orange are FANTA-stic. On the last question, leaning toward it should be a sport by sport basis. The patch has to make sense with the identity of the team, unless it’s either Orange-branded and can be applied universally, or the company is significant enough where it just makes sense to lock in one larger deal for all of Syracuse Athletics.

Sam: I’d assume that this probably ends up being JMA Wireless, Coca-Cola, or another company that is already a major SU Athletics sponsor, but I have a few other ideas all around the fun-serious spectrum. That starts with Micron, for whom it may make sense to partner with SU Athletics given its investment into the region. It continues with Tully’s and Wegman’s, two brands that all CNYers can agree on being in some ways, giants of the region. The silliest thing that comes to mind is any company that makes darts, or even DART (Dallas Area Rapid Transit) itself. Anyway, I can’t wait to see the Tyson Chicken logo on Arkansas jerseys.

Kevin: My initial thoughts were JMA Wireless, Micron, Dunkin or possibly one of the area banks. Wegman’s really hasn’t done sponsorships so I don’t see them jumping in, but what about other companies in the area-Lockheed Martin, Lotte Biologics, Feldmeier Equipment or TTM Enterprises? If we want to have some fun, there’s always Gianelli Sausage because who wouldn’t want a dancing pig on their jersey. I might not have a good sense of where Syracuse will turn,, but I am pretty sure that Siena Basketball will have an Upstate Shredding patch.

Dublin, Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The “United States 4K Medical Imaging Market Report by Type, End User, States and Company Analysis, 2025-2033” report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com’s offering.

United States 4K Medical Imaging Market is expected to increase remarkably from US$ 320 Million in 2024 to US$ 720 Billion by 2033. The growth demonstrates a strong Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.33% over the forecast period of 2025 to 2033. The main drivers for this growth are improved medical technology, rising healthcare spending, and heightened demand for high-resolution imaging in treatment and diagnosis.

4K medical imaging is the application of high-definition imaging technology with four times the pixel resolution of standard 1080p HD imaging. With its greater clarity, it offers enhanced visualization of tissues and organs, which is important for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. In the United States, 4K medical imaging is being increasingly used in numerous specialties, such as radiology, surgery, and pathology.

In radiology, 4K imaging increases the potential to capture subtle irregularities in scans, for instance, tumors or fractures, resulting in sooner and more precise diagnoses. In surgery, 4K cameras give surgeons a better view of anatomical structures, enhancing accuracy during minimally invasive procedures. 4K imaging also assists in pathology by providing detailed images of specimens, enabling improved analysis and more accurate results.

In addition, with increased telemedicine and remote consultations, the need for high-quality images has grown stronger, turning 4K medical imaging into a critical component of today’s healthcare routines in the country.

Drivers of Growth in the United States 4K Medical Imaging Market

Increased Need for Minimally Invasive Surgeries and Precision Diagnosis

The need for precision imaging products is growing as American healthcare professionals increasingly embrace precision diagnostics and minimally invasive surgeries. 4K medical imaging provides ultra-high resolution, allowing clinicians to spot tiny anatomical structures and subtle abnormalities better than normal HD imaging. This enhances surgical accuracy, minimizes complications, and improves patient outcomes. Hospitals and specialty clinics are quickly adopting 4K imaging in endoscopy, laparoscopy, and interventional radiology.

As patient demands for higher-quality care increase and medical mistakes need to be eliminated as much as possible, the superior resolution and detail of 4K imaging continue to drive robust adoption throughout the U.S. healthcare network. January 2024 – Arthrex, the world leader in minimally invasive surgical products and education in surgical skills, has introduced a new patient-oriented website, TheNanoExperience.com, emphasizing the science and advantage of Nano arthroscopy, a contemporary, least invasive orthopedic surgery that potentially enables rapid return to activity and reduced pain.

Technological Advances and Integration with Online Platforms

Technological advancement is a primary driver of growth in the U.S. 4K medical imaging market. Manufacturers are combining 4K with artificial intelligence (AI), robots, and telemedicine platforms to enable improved decision support and remote collaboration. Cloud storage and real-time streaming of 4K images enable experts to share cases for consultation rapidly. Advanced monitors and endoscopic systems with improved color accuracy further enhance diagnostic reliability.

Portable and hybrid imaging systems are also on the rise, increasing access across a range of healthcare facilities. As the U.S. is among the early adopters of healthcare technology, the convergence of 4K with digital ecosystems is driving high growth. November 2023, EIZO Corporation launched the CuratOR MIR-1, its first medical imaging recorder for capturing high-quality 4K UHD video and still images from endoscopy, microsurgery, and surgical cameras at 60 fps, offering improved surgical accuracy and documentation.

Increasing Healthcare Investments and Infrastructure Upgrades

The United States is experiencing robust investment in healthcare infrastructure, and hospitals and outpatient facilities are upgrading to new imaging technologies. Federal and private sector financing for upgrading medical equipment is driving adoption of 4K imaging systems. Increased demand for outpatient procedures, along with patient affinity for high-quality care, is driving facilities to implement next-generation imaging in order to remain competitive. Training initiatives and collaborations between equipment vendors and healthcare organizations are also enhancing rates of adoption.

As the U.S. healthcare sector prioritizes efficiency, safety, and innovation, spending on 4K imaging technology is becoming a fundamental strategy for improving clinical functionality. July 2024 – The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, NNPHI, and PHAB made the launch announcement for a new Implementation Center Program to aid public health agencies in upgrading their data systems. Supported by $255M from the CDC through the Public Health Infrastructure Grant, the program will provide customized assistance and technical services to propel the implementation of updated health information technology standards for data exchange.

Challenges to the United States 4K Medical Imaging Market

High Costs of Equipment and Installation

The price of 4K medical imaging systems is a principal challenge to adoption in the U.S. They need sophisticated cameras, monitors, storage, and interfacing with hospital IT systems already in place, which means high initial investments. Small hospitals and specialty clinics, especially those located in rural settings, cannot afford these expenses despite the clinical advantage.

Staff training, maintenance, and software upgrade costs add to the financial load. While large healthcare networks have the ability to internalize these expenses, affordability constraints throttle mass adoption. Cost-effective technology solutions and leasing options will be key to overcoming this constraint and widening the market’s reach.

Data Management and Compatibility Issues

The transition to 4K imaging produces huge data volumes, which present healthcare providers with storage, transfer, and processing issues. Most hospitals are also having challenges in integrating 4K systems with their current PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems) or electronic health record platforms. Bandwidth constraints also make real-time streaming challenging for telemedicine or collaborative care.

Additionally, non-standardization by device manufacturers promotes compatibility problems across systems, hindering clinical workflows. Overcoming such challenges demands heavy IT investment, cybersecurity, and vendor cooperation. Without integration, adoption will be slowed down notwithstanding increasing demand for ultra-high-resolution imaging.

As part of the agreement, DHL and Hapag-Lloyd said that they have already achieved 25,000 tons CO2e emissions reductions through a first order executed in July 2025.
The companies said that offering more sustainable logistics solutions to customers is a key lever to achieve these goals.
Casper Ellerbaek, Head of Global Ocean Freight at DHL Global Forwarding, said: “The signing of this three-year framework agreement marks a crucial step toward realizing our shared vision of a decarbonized shipping industry.
We are thrilled to partner with Hapag-Lloyd in driving the adoption of sustainable marine fuels and the book and claim mechanism, ultimately empowering our customers to achieve their climate goals.”","Freight company DHL Global Forwarding and container shipping company Hapag-Lloyd announced today a new three-year agreement aimed at enabling Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions through the use of sustainable marine fuels in Hapag-Lloyd’s fleet for ocean shipping.

The new agreement utilizes a “book and claim” chain of custody mechanism, which enables customers to claim Scope 3 emission reduction for their transport separately from the physical use of the fuel, decoupling decarbonization from the physical transportation of sustainable marine fuel, which is currently limited in supply globally.

The agreement will allow the use of second-generation biofuels via the book and claim approach. Hapag-Lloyd has been deploying second-generation biofuels since 2020, and in 2023 the company launched “Ship Green,” its emission-reduced ocean transport product utilizing biofuel blends instead of traditional fossil marine fuel oil (MFO). Its second-generation biofuels are sourced from certified supply chains and waste- or residue-based feedstock, such as brown grease or used cooking oil.

As part of the agreement, DHL and Hapag-Lloyd said that they have already achieved 25,000 tons CO2e emissions reductions through a first order executed in July 2025.

Danny Smolders, Managing Director Global Sales at Hapag-Lloyd, said:

“We are delighted to have completed this order with DHL, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of using sustainable marine fuels to reduce Scope 3 emissions through our Ship Green product. Partnering with DHL shows how powerful collaboration can be. Together, we are creating real momentum in further decarbonizing supply chains, one bold step at a time.”

Both DHL and Hapag-Lloyd have set net zero goals, with Hapag-Lloyd aiming to achieve net zero fleet emissions by 2045, and DHL targeting reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050. The companies said that offering more sustainable logistics solutions to customers is a key lever to achieve these goals.

For the current SWIFT payment system, which can take up to three days to settle, this is a qualitative leap.
Building a unified global payment standard Blockchain is inherently global, unlike the fragmented standards of traditional finance.
If SWIFT builds a unified standard based on this, it could lead the next generation of global payment infrastructure.
But even at the testing stage, it sends a strong signal: The “old order” of the global cross-border payment system is undergoing a revolution driven by technology.","According to an exclusive report by foreign media outlet The Big Whale, international financial communications giant SWIFT is collaborating with several major global banks (including BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon) and has selected the Ethereum Layer2 network Linea as its blockchain testing platform, aiming to migrate its traditional cross-border payment messaging system “on-chain.”

The project, reportedly driven by Ethereum core developer Consensys, has attracted participation from more than ten global financial institutions and will enter the actual deployment phase in the coming months. An insider from one of the participating banks stated: “This collaboration is expected to bring about a major technological transformation for the global interbank payment system.”

If this collaboration is officially announced in the future, it will not only be a technical milestone but could also mark a historic turning point:The widespread adoption of blockchain and stablecoins is shaking the technological foundations of legacy financial infrastructures like SWIFT, forcing them to take the first step toward transformation.

Who is SWIFT? How important is its status?

SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication), founded in 1973 and headquartered in Belgium, is the “super hub” used by banks worldwide to transmit financial messages (such as payment instructions, clearing confirmations, fund settlements, etc.).

Simply put, SWIFT is like a “super WeChat group” for banks around the world. It does not handle specific businesses like deposits or remittances, but is responsible for securely transmitting instructions such as “A should transfer X amount to B” between banks.

Currently, SWIFT connects more than 11,000 financial institutions worldwide, covering over 200 countries and regions, and processes more than 42 million financial messages daily. It plays a “central nervous system” role in global trade, cross-border remittances, securities trading, and clearing.

However, this highly centralized network system also faces numerous pain points:

Low efficiency: Cross-border payment cycles can take 1–3 business days, depending on the number of intermediary banks and national regulations;

High costs: Each transaction involves intermediary bank fees;

Poor transparency: Payment paths and statuses are unclear and difficult to track;

Geopolitical risks: In recent years, SWIFT has been used multiple times as a tool for financial sanctions (e.g., Russia being removed from SWIFT), exposing its highly centralized strategic sensitivity.

Against this backdrop, the inherent decentralization, transparency, and high efficiency of blockchain technology are seen as potential solutions to SWIFT’s “outdated structure.”

Why Linea?

Linea is an Ethereum Layer2 network developed by Consensys, utilizing ZK-Rollup (zero-knowledge rollup) technology, and has several notable advantages:

Privacy protection: ZK technology allows verification of transaction authenticity without exposing the underlying data, meeting banks’ dual requirements for compliance and confidentiality;

High performance, low cost: Compared to the Ethereum mainnet, Layer2 can handle larger transaction volumes at lower fees;

Compatibility with Ethereum mainnet: Seamless integration with existing stablecoins, RWA, and DeFi components;

Enterprise-level support: Backed by Consensys, with the capability and reputation to serve large institutions.

Compared to other chains, Linea provides a “regulator-friendly, high-performance on-chain environment,” making it an ideal choice for SWIFT under current compliance pressures.

Market data shows that after this news broke, the price of the Linea token surged by more than 14% at its peak that day and remains at the upper end of the upward range, significantly outperforming the broader market.

What does an on-chain SWIFT mean?

If SWIFT migrates part or all of its messaging transmission system to blockchain, it will have the following impacts:

1. Lower cross-border payment costs and time

On-chain systems running on ZK-Rollup and other L2 architectures can achieve second-level transaction confirmations, greatly reducing intermediary steps and corresponding fees. For the current SWIFT payment system, which can take up to three days to settle, this is a qualitative leap.

2. Improved financial transparency and traceability

On-chain records can be queried and audited by authorized parties, greatly enhancing anti-money laundering and compliance capabilities. At the same time, real-time visibility of transaction status also increases the transparency and trustworthiness of financial transactions.

3. More flexible asset settlement

In the future, SWIFT may not only transmit “payment instructions” but also “the assets themselves.” On-chain, assets such as stablecoins, government bonds, and bills can be implemented via smart contracts, enabling settlement finality.

4. Building a unified global payment standard

Blockchain is inherently global, unlike the fragmented standards of traditional finance. If SWIFT builds a unified standard based on this, it could lead the next generation of global payment infrastructure.

Who benefits first? Who might be left out?

Potential winners:

Ethereum ecosystem: Linea’s integration with SWIFT will bring massive capital flows and application scenarios to the Ethereum mainnet;

Stablecoin issuers (such as USDC, DAI): Will play a key role in on-chain settlement;

On-chain compliance service providers (such as Chainalysis, Fireblocks): Will benefit from the demand for regulatory-friendly infrastructure;

Modular DeFi component developers: Providing underlying functions such as account systems, AML tools, and payment interfaces.

Potentially pressured parties:

Correspondent Banks: In the SWIFT system, they profit from “transfer channels.” If these paths are replaced by on-chain smart contracts, their business model will be challenged;

Legacy clearinghouses and payment networks: If they cannot quickly adapt to on-chain operations, they may be marginalized;

National payment systems with outdated technology: Will gradually lose competitiveness in the face of global on-chain payment systems.

Summary

This is not SWIFT’s first attempt to embrace blockchain. Previously, it has explored cross-chain communication with Chainlink and piloted digital bond clearing with Euroclear. However, this time, choosing to migrate its core messaging system to the public chain environment represented by Linea is its most “decentralized” attempt ever.

Whether SWIFT will truly “go on-chain” in the future still awaits official confirmation. But even at the testing stage, it sends a strong signal: The “old order” of the global cross-border payment system is undergoing a revolution driven by technology.

Global Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing Market size is expected to be worth around US$ 14.23 Billion by 2034 from US$ 2.15 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 20.8% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024, North America led the market, achieving over 37.3% share with a revenue of US$ 801 Million.

The direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing sector is experiencing strong growth, supported by scientific progress, government initiatives, and international ethical frameworks. Several key factors are enabling this expansion and shaping the global market outlook.

One of the strongest growth drivers has been the sharp reduction in DNA sequencing costs. According to the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the cost of sequencing a human genome has dropped more than a million-fold since the Human Genome Project. This reduction has made genetic testing much more affordable and accessible for consumers. The falling costs continue to allow laboratories to process high volumes of samples at lower prices, supporting both industry expansion and wider consumer adoption.

Clearer regulatory frameworks are also boosting growth. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has established defined pathways for consumer genetic tests. For example, the agency authorized 23andMe’s Personal Genome Service to deliver certain health-related reports directly to consumers. This type of approval provides trust in the quality of results and encourages more companies to invest in consumer-facing products.

Transparency in available testing services has improved through public databases. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), which provides detailed information on available genetic tests. As of November 2024, the registry listed more than 68,000 tests from 429 laboratories worldwide. This demonstrates both the depth of available services and the scale of global participation in genetic testing.

Public health programs are further encouraging the use of genomics. In the United Kingdom, the government’s Genome UK strategy outlines how genomics will be integrated into the National Health Service. This not only promotes awareness among patients but also strengthens healthcare providers’ confidence in using genetic information. Similar initiatives across other countries are increasing literacy and normalizing the use of genetic testing.

International ethical guidelines have also supported market development. The World Health Organization (WHO) released principles in 2024 on the ethical collection and sharing of human genomic data, while UNESCO’s declaration on human genetic data promotes privacy and consent. These frameworks reduce concerns over misuse of data and give consumers greater confidence in using DTC services.

Finally, government health agencies have documented rising use of genetic testing in clinical practice. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported significant increases in hereditary cancer testing, such as BRCA testing. Growing awareness of genetic risk in medical settings is spilling over into consumer-driven demand, especially for tests related to ancestry, health traits, and disease risk.

Test Type Analysis

The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing market is segmented by test type into ancestry & relationship testing, predictive testing, carrier screening, nutrigenomics testing, pharmacogenomics testing, and skincare testing. Among these, ancestry and relationship testing holds the leading position, accounting for 44.2% of the global market share in 2024. This dominance is attributed to strong consumer interest in understanding family origins, ethnicity, and biological relationships. Easy-to-use kits, affordable pricing, and growing consumer awareness of genealogy have further supported the expansion of this segment.

Predictive testing represents a significant growth area, as consumers increasingly seek insights into potential health risks and disease predispositions. Rising awareness of genetic contributions to chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders has made this segment more relevant in preventive healthcare. Carrier screening is gaining traction, particularly among couples planning families. This testing helps in identifying genetic conditions that could be passed on to children, supporting informed reproductive choices.

Nutrigenomics testing is emerging as a consumer-focused segment, with rising demand for personalized diet and fitness solutions. As lifestyle-related health issues grow, individuals are showing interest in tailoring nutrition to their genetic profile. Pharmacogenomics testing is expected to see steady adoption due to its potential in guiding personalized medicine, though regulatory complexities remain. Finally, skincare testing is expanding as consumers increasingly connect genetics with personalized beauty and anti-aging solutions.

Overall, while ancestry testing remains the dominant driver, health-oriented testing types are expected to accelerate market diversification over the coming years.

The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing market is segmented by technology into whole genome sequencing (WGS), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips, and targeted analysis. Among these, whole genome sequencing holds the dominant position, accounting for 41.7% of the global market share in 2024. The dominance of WGS is driven by its ability to provide comprehensive insights into an individual’s genetic profile. Falling sequencing costs and advancements in bioinformatics have made WGS increasingly accessible to consumers, supporting its adoption across ancestry, health risk, and personalized wellness applications.

SNP chips remain a widely used technology, especially in ancestry and trait-based testing. These chips allow the detection of specific variations in the genome at lower costs and with faster processing times compared to full sequencing. Their affordability and efficiency make SNP chips a popular option for high-volume consumer tests, although they offer limited depth compared to WGS.

Targeted analysis focuses on specific genes or gene panels associated with defined health conditions, traits, or carrier status. This approach is gaining attention for its precision and clinical relevance, particularly in predictive health, carrier screening, and pharmacogenomics testing. While it covers only a subset of the genome, targeted analysis is valued for its accuracy in addressing specific consumer needs.

Overall, while WGS leads due to its broad coverage and falling costs, SNP chips and targeted analysis continue to play crucial roles in ensuring affordability, scalability, and clinical relevance in the DTC genetic testing market.

Sample Type Analysis

The direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing market is segmented by sample type into blood samples, saliva samples, buccal swabs, and other bodily fluids. Among these, blood samples dominate the market in 2024, accounting for 49.6% of the global share.

The dominance of this segment is attributed to the high reliability and accuracy of blood-based genetic analysis, which enables comprehensive testing across a wide spectrum of genetic conditions. The preference for blood samples is also reinforced by their ability to deliver higher DNA yields and minimize contamination risk, thereby supporting precise results.

The saliva samples segment represents the second-largest share in the market. Saliva-based testing has gained popularity due to its non-invasive nature, ease of collection, and convenience for at-home sample submission. Companies offering ancestry and wellness-focused kits have widely adopted saliva collection as a customer-friendly approach, particularly in developed markets.

Buccal swabs are another widely used sample type, especially in cost-sensitive regions, as they offer a simple, painless, and economical collection method. These are increasingly applied in paternity testing, basic ancestry kits, and niche genetic studies, though their lower DNA yield compared to blood and saliva samples limits their broader adoption.

The segment of other bodily fluids (such as urine or amniotic fluid) holds a comparatively smaller market share. However, it is expected to gain traction in specialized applications where alternative collection methods are necessary or clinically relevant.

Overall, blood samples continue to lead the market, while saliva and buccal swabs are expanding accessibility and consumer adoption in non-clinical settings.

Distrubution Channel Analysis

The distribution of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing kits is segmented into online platforms and over-the-counter (OTC) retail outlets. In 2024, online platforms dominate the market with a 66.8% share, reflecting the growing preference for digital channels in healthcare-related consumer purchases. The prominence of online platforms is driven by their wider accessibility, convenience, and the ability to directly reach global consumers without geographical limitations.

The availability of comprehensive product information, user reviews, and price comparisons further enhances customer confidence in online purchases. Moreover, the rising trend of e-commerce adoption in healthcare and the integration of subscription-based models for wellness and ancestry testing support the leadership of this segment.

The OTC segment accounts for the remaining share and caters to consumers who prefer physical access to testing kits through pharmacies, retail chains, and healthcare outlets. OTC channels provide instant product availability, particularly in urban centers, and are preferred by customers who value face-to-face interaction and direct purchase without shipping delays. While its share is lower, OTC remains relevant in building consumer trust, especially among first-time users who may be hesitant to order online.

It all started with a man by the name of Jacob Davis, who was born in 1831 in what is now Latvia, then the Russian city of Riga.
Davis helped build the Reno Brewing Company owned by Frederick Hertlein before returning to his earlier work as a tailor.
Soon, everyone, especially railroad workers, was asking Davis for work pants, and he quickly found himself overwhelmed with the sheer number of orders.
In 2006, a plaque was erected in Reno where Davis’s original Reno-based tailor shop was based, and within it, the legendary blue jean.","If I told you to look in your closet for a pair of pants right now, I can almost guarantee what comes to mind first is that traditional blue jean. Everyone likes blue jeans, right? They’re as American as apple pie.

Did you know the world actually has our very own Reno, Nevada to thank for blue jeans?

It all started with a man by the name of Jacob Davis, who was born in 1831 in what is now Latvia, then the Russian city of Riga. His given name was Jacob Youphes, but when he immigrated to the U.S. in 1854, he changed his name to Davis.

He worked as a tailor in the East Coast before setting his sights on the West and California in 1856. He then moved to Canada to pan for gold, before coming south again where he sold pork and tobacco in Virginia City.

Finally, in 1868 at the age of 37, he settled in Reno.

At the time, Reno was little more than a railway station with a tiny town attached. Davis helped build the Reno Brewing Company owned by Frederick Hertlein before returning to his earlier work as a tailor.

Davis opened a tail shop on the main street of town and got to work. He made tents, riding blankets; anything people might need out on the road, especially those working for the Central Pacific Railroad.

He bought wholesale fabric that was a mixture of denim and white duck twill from none other than San Francisco-based Levi Strauss.

The story goes, in 1870, a woman asked Davis to make a hearty pair of pants for her husband, who was a woodcutter. He whipped her up a pair of pants using the denim-duck cloth, adding copper rivets to the seams for strength.

Soon, everyone, especially railroad workers, was asking Davis for work pants, and he quickly found himself overwhelmed with the sheer number of orders.

He then sent a message to Strauss with a business proposition.

On May 20, 1873, the new business of Jacob W. Davis and Levi Strauss & Company received patent no. 139121 for copper-riveted pants.

After the patent was granted, Davis sold his Reno property and holdings and moved his family to San Francisco, where he oversaw his creation at the Levi Strauss factory.

He supervised almost 500 employees for the rest of his life as they made variations of his original design, including overalls and work shirts, which soon became a standard of the fashion industry.

Davis died in San Francisco in 1908, but his legacy lives on.

In 2006, a plaque was erected in Reno where Davis’s original Reno-based tailor shop was based, and within it, the legendary blue jean.

Bottom Line Private equity has long promised double-digit returns, but the math is shifting.","The Federal Reserve cut rates again, but analysts say cheaper money won't fix private equity's (PE) massive problem. Traditionally, they'd take companies public on the stock market for huge profits, but that exit door has narrowed shut, down 46% in 2024 from the previous five-year average.

""Private equity firms are increasingly trading assets among themselves or accepting lower returns,"" Kevin Khang, Vanguard's senior international economist, noted in recent analysis. ""The $11 trillion industry's aggressive use of leverage, which once defined the model, is now being reined in, forcing a strategic rethink.""

What's striking is how this shift is rippling through America's retirement system, despite PE's gains and losses often being attributed to the very wealthy. More than 34 million public sector workers, as well as colleges and universities, depend on private equity returns to fund their pensions, and these massive institutional investors now find themselves stuck holding investments they can't sell.

Why PE Is Running Out of Exit Strategies

PE firms buy companies using borrowed money, fix them up, and sell them for profit—like house flippers but for businesses. Their traditional exit strategy was to take companies public on the stock market through initial public offerings (IPOs). But those made up just 6% of exits in 2024, and by mid-2025, total exits dropped another 12%.

Desperate for alternatives, firms are now selling companies to themselves through ""continuation funds,"" essentially moving investments from one pocket to another. This accounted for $41 billion worth of companies in just the first half of 2025.

Meanwhile, PE firms are having a harder time raising new money. They collected just $592 billion in the year to June—their worst showing in seven years. Despite offering big discounts to attract investors, they returned only 11% of investors' money last year, the lowest since 2009. The math is brutal: $3 trillion worth of companies sit unsold globally.

Pension Funds Feel the Squeeze

A teacher's pension, a firefighter's retirement—they're all caught in this mess. The transformation has been massive: In 2001, the typical pension owned zero private equity. By 2023, it was 10% of their portfolio, representing 20% of all pension assets.

PE delivered solid 13.5% annual returns over 10 years, but they're often illiquid investments, meaning it's hard to move capital out of them if they're not exiting their positions as easily as before.

More than half of pension funds now own more private equity than they intended—what Wall Street calls being ""overallocated."" When PE can't sell companies and return cash, pension funds can't reinvest elsewhere.

University Endowments Double Down

While pensions struggle with overallocation, university endowments are betting even bigger. Elite schools now hold 55.7% of their portfolios in alternative investments—private equity, venture capital, and real assets—up from near zero three decades ago. Major institutions like Clemson University Foundation are raising allocations from 18% to 24%, while the University of Utah tripled its private equity allocation from 10% to 30%.

Harvard maintains 39% of its $53 billion in private equity, with Yale having about half of its $40 billion in PE. They're chasing the long-term gains over other assets—large endowments averaged 8.3% annually over 10 years versus 6.5% for smaller schools. But with universities withdrawing $30 billion annually while earning just 3.4% over three years, they're eating into principal to fund operations.

Secondary Market Becomes the New Exit

Unable to go public or find buyers, the industry created its own solution: selling to each other. This ""secondary market"" hit $162 billion in 2024 and could exceed $200 billion in 2025.

This is changing how PE operates. Rather than traditional IPO exits, firms are increasingly trading assets among themselves or selling stakes to specialized secondary buyers.

Bottom Line

Private equity has long promised double-digit returns, but the math is shifting. With trillions worth of unsold companies and pensions overallocated, the risk is that what once fueled retirement security could now strain it. If exits don’t reopen soon, the industry’s biggest investors may be forced to rethink how much longer they can afford to wait.",https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/DtAbXkTETaVLFxztK0Kkh0U-oW4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-2223384485-e80aa5f3bf1b4d6a8430196607c936a8.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 14:13:06.601820

Few pieces of outerwear carry the cultural weight and timeless appeal of Levi’s Trucker jacket.

For decades, it’s transcended fashion trends and movie sets to become a wardrobe staple for everyone from rugged cowboys to style-conscious urbanites.

Long ago, Levi’s decided to upgrade the classic silhouette with a fuzzy sherpa lining for cold weather—and right now, the premium version is on sale for a limited time.

Classic and Cozy

According to Levi’s heritage documentation, sherpa jackets represent an evolution of the traditional trucker design, combining “the iconic style of the original with the warmth needed for colder climates.”

The exterior maintains the classic denim construction that Levi’s has perfected over a century, featuring the brand’s signature washed denim in various colorways.

The plush sherpa helps transform the jacket from a three-season piece into genuine cold-weather gear.

The craftsmanship remains true to Levi’s standards, with reinforced stitching at stress points, authentic copper rivets, and the brand’s signature leather patch at the back waist.

The fit balances classic and contemporary, offering enough room for layering without appearing oversized. The jacket features the traditional four-pocket design, complete with chest pockets that are both functional and aesthetically essential to the trucker look.

Pricing and Availability

Normally retailing for around $130, the Premium Type III Sherpa Trucker Jacket is available directly from Levi’s at a discounted price of $90.

The sale includes multiple colorways, allowing you to match your existing wardrobe or explore new territory.

Given the timeless nature of the trucker silhouette, this is the kind of piece that pays dividends season after season.

Polo shirts and pleated tennis skirts at Emporio Armani.
Still, the flavors of preppy American style have turned up time and time again throughout the first few days of Milan Fashion Week.
The pillars of prep—polish made easy and a sense of no-nonsense dressing—are a language everyone seems to want to speak right now.
The barn jackets, penny loafers, and striped button-up shirts you might need are right at home.","From April until September, Americans dreamed of an Italian girl summer. We scoured The RealReal for vintage Pucci prints and tied silk scarves in our hair, with visions of la dolce vita—Aperol Spritzes, Vespa rides, Amal Clooney's general vibe—dancing in our heads. But as Milan Fashion Week's designers spent the summer preparing their Spring 2026 runways, they collectively tapped into a very different regional energy.

Polo shirts and pleated tennis skirts at Emporio Armani. Button-ups under academic cardigans and linen Bermuda shorts at BOSS. Oversize shackets in Masters Tournament green or Cape Cod salmon pink, set with a tiny crest logo over the heart, at Prada.

Judging by the styling on the Milan runways this week, ""Italian girl summer"" isn't the aspiration for Italians—it's a Nantucket sail or an afternoon at a Connecticut country club. In other words, it's Americana prep.

No one on the fashion calendar has cited the scions of American sportswear as their inspiration for these spring collections (at least that I've seen so far). Nor have they dropped references to a college near Boston in their look books. Still, the flavors of preppy American style have turned up time and time again throughout the first few days of Milan Fashion Week.

Fendi's kaleidoscopic Spring 2026 collection features sharp-collared shirts tucked into pleated minis, as well as very Jackie Kennedy collarless jackets topping polka dot skirts. Onitsuka Tiger—of celebrity-favorite sneaker fame—swaps sportier jackets for tweedy blazers and flashes of sailor stripes.

Of all the preppy motifs pioneered back stateside by the likes of Ralph Lauren and J.Crew, the button-up shirt is getting the most runway attention in Milan. Emporio Armani models wore them layered—one tied as a shawl, the other half-open beneath pendant necklaces—with beachy short-shorts. At BOSS, they tucked them into linen shorts and under linen trenches, while at Missoni they were ultra-cropped, revealed only when a heather gray crewneck sweatshirt was tied at the midriff. Druv Kapoor refashioned one button-up as a mini dress with a bubble hem—a fresh re-read on the Preppy Handbook staple.

This isn't to say that Milan's signature sprezzatura has gone MIA. Designers are simply reinterpreting the pieces Americans know and love, injecting them with an ease and a dash of sex appeal that's distinctly Italian. Prada's take on the polo jacket comes to mind, cut in exaggerated proportions and paired to teeny-tiny microshorts. So do MM6 Maison Margiela's riffs on conservative pencil skirts and button-front sweaters, made to feel futuristic with wraparound sunglasses resembling a stainless steel arc and strips of striped fabric sewn over the skirt in a ""Y"" pattern.

The ""Americana, Italian style"" theme kept going as the days rolled on. Tod's paired its signature leather driving shoes to oversize striped button-ups that would make a vacationing Kennedy circa the 1960s proud. The Attico, normally the home of rave-ready partywear, presented several looks built around tennis court button-ups and university library stripes. I didn't make it into Dario Vitale's super-exclusive Versace debut, but I saw videos of what resembled a long-sleeve polo over a sequin skirt making the rounds online. And, of course, Julia Roberts and Amanda Seyfried's shared outfit at the Venice Film Festival gave us all a look at what was to come, twice: a very American sportswear blazer and jeans, with a buttery yellow button-up.

This isn't happening only in Milan: Michael Rider, making his debut at Celine over the summer, showed his Ralph Lauren training with twists on rugby shirts and striped ties. The pillars of prep—polish made easy and a sense of no-nonsense dressing—are a language everyone seems to want to speak right now.

So, next summer, don't worry about booking a trip to Italy if shopping's on the agenda. The barn jackets, penny loafers, and striped button-up shirts you might need are right at home.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GX2QrnMUjixHfvU5tFZV56.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 18:16:12.477904

These at-risk Medicare members have multiple chronic diseases or conditions like cardiovascular disease, cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which makes them vulnerable to extreme heat.

Why it matters: To help members stay protected and avoid the effects of the extreme heat, care managers reach out to them several days in advance to offer health and wellness guidance. They remind them to stay hydrated and limit outdoor activities in the middle of the day, and they make them aware of local cooling locations, including Oak Street Health centers, public libraries and senior centers.

The extreme heat outreach effort launched as a pilot last summer, and care managers engaged nearly 1,000 Medicare members across 26 states.

This summer, the significantly expanded initiative engaged more than 9,000 Medicare members across 43 states.

Before these calls, the registered nurse care managers research who they’ll be talking to: They review case notes, medications and social determinants of health in order to provide the best recommendations.

“This is important work from the Care Management team, and a great example of holistic support for the member and their health,” says Dr. Paige Wickner, VP, Medical Affairs.

What they’re saying: “Getting a call from my health insurance company about this was unexpected but welcome,” says Aetna Medicare member Lee Lambert, 78, who has lived in Kansas City, Missouri, for decades. “This type of program is good for people who may not be knowledgeable or aware of the impacts of severe heat. I watch the news frequently and I’m aware of the weather conditions. I’m also aware of the dangers of heat and things to do to keep safe. However, sometimes I have brain fog and appreciate the reminders!”

What we’re saying: “Members appreciate the fact that their care managers are doing this outreach,” says Sara Rios, Senior Manager, Strategic Planning, who provides support to the Care Management team through workflow optimization, training, issue tracking and more. “Our nurses are amazing when it comes to speaking with a member and helping them with their needs. They show empathy. They provide top-notch customer service along with their registered nurse experience, support and care.”

How it works: The Clinical Analytics Product Solutions team identifies which Medicare members may be impacted by extreme heat by monitoring a 10-day weather forecast. They then share that information with the Care Management team, explains Matt Anderson, Lead Director, Clinical Social Data Intelligence.

“With this initiative, we’re making a change, we're really caring, we’re getting very patient centric, and we can see the impact,” Matt says.",https://www.cvshealth.com/content/dam/enterprise/cvs-enterprise/images/news/health-equity/2025/20220915_CVS_WOMENS_HEALTH_01_ANGOTTI_JONES_FAMILY_KITCHEN.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 18:15:32.695352

Since then, XO has been one of Vista Global’s two consumer brands alongside VistaJet.","VistaJet will have company in Asia, as its sister brand, XO, is set to make its debut in the region next year.

Vista Global announced the news during a press conference in Japan this week.

XO offers ad hoc charters and dynamic-pricing memberships.

Members get priority access to the Vista Members Fleet of VistaJet-branded private jets.

VistaJet already holds a 52% share of Japan’s international business aviation flights, according to WingX numbers cited in the announcement.

Chief Commercial Officer Ian Moore says, “With XO now in Asia, our clients enjoy the best of both worlds through Vista’s global infrastructure, from on-demand flights with instant booking through the XO marketplace to a guaranteed flight solution that replicates an aircraft ownership experience with VistaJet.”

He adds, “We deliver seamless travel that combines international reach, domestic flexibility and bespoke lifestyle experiences.”

XO promises “efficient and immediate access to more than 2,000 aircraft around the world (with) the right aircraft for every private flight across all cabin classes — from short domestic hops to international, multi-leg itineraries.”

President Asia Pacific Crystal Wong adds, “We are seeing increasing demand from clients in Asia who are looking for flexible and instant booking flight solutions.”

She says, “Through the XO app, Japanese clients may book and confirm their flights with real-time pricing.”

VistaJet has been operating in the region for 15 years.

VistaJet registered 22% year-on-year growth in its Program membership during the first half of 2025.

The Program targets flyers who want guaranteed rates and availability with one-way, occupied-hour pricing on super midsize, large-cabin, and ultra-long-haul jets.

Japan saw a 50% year-over-year increase in the first six months of the year.

About XO

XO is one of private aviation’s best-known brands.

It has a history of innovation, first as an operator and later as a private jet charter broker and platform.

Its predecessor, XOJet, founded in 2006, was at the forefront of the floating fleet model for private jet charter with point-to-point pricing.

It was among the first charter operators to attract significant private equity firms, gaining investment from TPG, a backer of Continental Airlines, in 2007 and 2009.

It was among the first charter operators to expand its fleet with a mix of owned and leased private jets for the charter market.

The traditional private jet charter market utilized mainly managed aircraft that required owner approval and had to return to base after every trip.

It also launched flat-rate transcontinental pricing.

XOJet was the first large charter operator to have WiFi fleetwide in 2011.

It then built a $100 million off-fleet private jet charter brokerage business, a hybrid model.

XOJet was also one of the first to charge membership fees, comparing the access it provides to golf clubs.

XOJet to XO

After Vista Global bought XOJet in 2018, its new owner spun out its brokerage, merging it with the 2019 acquisition of JetSmarter, a leader in digital booking.

Since then, XO has been one of Vista Global’s two consumer brands alongside VistaJet.",https://cdn.privatejetcardcomparisons.com/uploads/shutterstock_2360483575.jpg?w=1200&h=628&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-26 20:11:04.289483

A portable and powerful soundbar with room-filling audio

Just because the Insignia 2.0 Mini Soundbar is small doesn’t mean the sound is weak. The speakers point straight towards you, which is excellent for news, shows, YouTube, and late-night viewing. Sports commentary is sharper, cartoons sound brighter, and you can hear voices clearly even at low volumes, so you won’t have to constantly adjust the sound between quiet and loud parts. The soundbar itself doesn’t vibrate, which eliminates the boxy sound often associated with TV speakers.

It’s also easy to connect. Use an optical or aux cable to connect to your TV with just one wire, or use Bluetooth to play music from your phone or tablet. This simple setup works well in a living room, bedroom, or office, eliminating the need for multiple cords. You can stand it up, or use the holes in the back to hang it on the wall under a small TV.

Setting it up takes only a few minutes. Just plug it in, connect the audio, and it turns on with your TV. The small remote allows you to easily change the input, volume, and sound settings. A little extra bass makes action scenes more exciting without shaking everything, and there’s a voice setting to make talk shows clearer. It remembers what you used last, so all you have to do is turn it on, watch TV, and turn it off, no complicated menus needed.

With the Insignia 2.0 Mini Soundbar, apartments, small bedrooms, workshops, and guest rooms can have better sound without needing big, bulky equipment. This soundbar addresses the issue of weak TV audio, allowing you to hear everything more clearly. It also works as a Bluetooth speaker for music.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have contacted some of the 200+ firms that unveiled cryptocurrency treasury strategies this year. The probe follows reports of stock price spikes before announcements—raising concerns of potential insider trading or disclosure lapses.

Regulators Tighten the Lens

According to the Wall Street Journal, SEC officials warned companies against selectively sharing material nonpublic information. While the SEC declined comment and FINRA has yet to respond, the inquiry signals stronger enforcement on market integrity in crypto-linked corporate moves.

MicroStrategy Effect

Publicly traded firms have increasingly looked to crypto as a balance-sheet hedge, inspired by MicroStrategy (MSTR.O), the software company that began aggressively accumulating bitcoin in 2020. Many newcomers hoped to replicate its outsized returns—yet the scrutiny now underscores the compliance risks of this approach.

What Comes Next

2025 H2: SEC & FINRA inquiries continue into trading patterns and corporate disclosures.

2026: Potential enforcement actions or guidance on crypto-treasury disclosures.

2027: Market standards may formalize around disclosure protocols for digital-asset treasury strategies.

The regulatory pendulum is swinging: companies racing to mimic crypto pioneers may face heightened compliance costs and legal risk if oversight intensifies.

Conclusion

The corporate rush into cryptocurrency as a treasury asset is colliding with regulatory realities. While firms hoped to emulate MicroStrategy’s success, U.S. regulators are signaling that market integrity and disclosure standards come first. Companies pursuing crypto strategies will need to balance ambition with airtight compliance or risk turning opportunity into liability.",https://impakter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/monogramma_impakter_H-180x180.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 17:09:06.723094

According to a Sept. 26 report from The Big Whale, the global financial messaging cooperative has initiated a development project with more than a dozen major institutions to experiment with putting its foundational messaging framework on-chain.

A source within a participating bank indicated the project is a multi-month endeavor, characterizing it as a precursor to a significant technological transformation for the interbank payments industry.

SWIFT’s blockchain path was years in the making

Last year, SWIFT announced that live trials for digital asset and currency transactions across its network were slated for 2025. The current project with Linea appears to be the foundational technical work necessary to make those live trials feasible, moving the cooperative beyond theoretical research and into practical implementation.

Before this announcement, SWIFT published results from a series of trials that tested the movement of tokenized assets across both public and private blockchains. SWIFT’s research demonstrated that its existing secure messaging infrastructure could potentially function as a universal “interoperability layer,” connecting different distributed ledger technologies without requiring banks to undertake massive and costly systems integrations with each new platform.

These include the RAISE infrastructure grant and Safe Streets and Roads for All programs, for which Congress has allocated a combined $2.5 billion annually to expand public transportation and address the US’s worsening epidemic of pedestrian deaths.
Car crash fatalities are also up in general, according to preliminary data from the Department of Transportation: 39,345 were killed in motor accidents in 2024 compared with 32,744 a decade prior, a 20% increase.
Despite this, the Trump administration has made its preference for maximizing car travel abundantly clear.
Trump has attempted to block California from constructing a massive new high-speed rail line from Los Angeles to San Francisco and has tried to stymie New York’s wildly successful congestion pricing program.","The US Department of Transportation began earlier this month to rescind federal funding for local projects across the country to improve street safety and add pedestrian trails and bike lanes, because they were deemed “hostile” to cars.

A report Monday in Bloomberg cited several examples of multimillion-dollar grants being axed beginning on September 9, all with the same rationale:

A San Diego County road improvement project including bike lanes “appears to reduce lane capacity and a road diet that is hostile to motor vehicles,” a US Department of Transportation official wrote, rescinding a $1.2 million grant it awarded nearly a year ago.

In Fairfield, Alabama, converting street lanes to trail space on Vinesville Road was also deemed “hostile” to cars, and “counter to DOT’s priority of preserving or increasing roadway capacity for motor vehicles.”

Officials in Boston got a similar explanation, as the Trump administration pulled back a previously awarded grant to improve walking, biking, and transit in the city’s Mattapan Square neighborhood in a way that would change the “current auto-centric configuration.” Another grant to improve safety at intersections in the city was terminated, the DOT said, because it could “impede vehicle capacity and speed.”

These are just a few of the projects canceled in recent weeks by the Trump administration. According to StreetsBlog, others included a 44-mile walking trail along the Naugatuck River in Connecticut, which the administration reportedly stripped funding from because it did not “promote vehicular travel,” and new miles of rail trail in Albuquerque for which DOT said funding would be reallocated to “‘car-focused’ projects instead.”

The cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to slash discretionary federal grants under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act signed by former President Joe Biden in 2021.

These include the RAISE infrastructure grant and Safe Streets and Roads for All programs, for which Congress has allocated a combined $2.5 billion annually to expand public transportation and address the US’s worsening epidemic of pedestrian deaths.

Way earlier than Instagram and TikTok—and screenshots. And certainly prior to images of fashion shows becoming easy to find and instantly available. Back then, fashion editors—think Grace Coddington and others of her ilk—would sketch doodles of runway looks to refer to when making their edits. Save for a few illustrators sharing their work online—say, Richard Haines or Pepe Muñoz—this practice has all but disappeared.

That’s until this weekend, when I unlocked my phone to a message from Ignacio Murillo, Vogue’s global casting director, urging me to look at Luna Yohannan’s Instagram profile. The breakout model—she debuted on the runway at Michael Rider’s first show for Celine earlier this year in July—has been sharing illustrations of the runway looks she’s worn this spring 2026 season. In New York: Tory Burch, Altuzarra, Coach, Ralph Lauren, and Jason Wu. They’re playful and sweet; joyful, even. They look more like poster illustrations than straightforward fashion croquis. Yohannan gives her figurines—or herself as a figurine—charming personalities.

A native New Yorker, Yohannan graduated from high school last year and planned on taking a gap year before enrolling at Wesleyan University in Connecticut to study biochemical engineering—a true multi-hyphenate, this one. She had been working at Indochine, a restaurant downtown, as a hostess. “I knew it was a fashion spot,” she said last Friday, calling from her Airbnb in Milan, “but one night this guy comes in and asks me who I’m signed with, I was just like, ‘Do you have a reservation?’” she laughed. Yohannan gave him her Instagram and moved on, though, as it turns out, he was a friend of Butterfly Cayley, a scout from DNA Models.

Yohannan calls herself the “queen of side hustles,” she still works at Indochine, plus the Strand bookstore and occasionally shucks oysters on the East River. “I’m jumping around all of my interests because… I can!” she said with a laugh. Her passion for art, she said, has always been a part of her and was partially ignited by her dad, who had been a colorist for Marvel. “It started with the Ralph [Lauren] show, I was feeling so feminine and beautiful, so I drew the look,” she said.

Her original gap year plan was to backpack through Australia, where she ended up going once signed for “development”—building a portfolio and other key components of developing a modeling career. She backpacked after, returning to New York to kick off her career properly. “I really fell in love with the creativity of modeling because it’s so similar to art,” she said, “I’m just having the time of my life.” Yohannan had already developed the habit of drawing the looks she wears at fittings or for other jobs outside the runway, in addition to drawing her model buddies at castings. “It was a way for me to show my agents the looks they fit me in,” she said, not unlike how those editors of yore used to operate.","https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68d6bb8a39e6905a024e65d6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Luna_moschino.jpg",N,,2025-09-26 16:13:39.173053

Takeaway: Category managers can respond by offering flexible assortments, targeted promotions and personalized messaging to help shoppers feel confident they’re getting value without sacrificing choice.
Takeaway: Category managers can support this trend by making meal solutions, recipe kits, and complementary items easy to discover online and in-store.
Takeaway: For category managers, this means monitoring trending content, identifying high-engagement moments, and ensuring relevant products are visible both digitally and on the physical shelf.
Takeaway: Category managers can tap into this trend by highlighting premium or indulgent options, offering smaller pack sizes and creating eye-catching displays that encourage trial.","Consumers may have returned to stores, but their shopping behaviors continue to evolve.

According to 2025 research from McKinsey, many crisis-era adaptations during COVID — such as digital-first shopping, at-home activities and trade-offs across categories — have since solidified into lasting habits.

Today, shoppers are navigating a complex mix of economic pressures, new technology and evolving social trends, all of which are reshaping purchasing behavior. Research indicates that consumers are increasingly intentional about how, when and where they shop, balancing price sensitivity with convenience, personalization and social media influence.

For category managers, this means shopper missions can’t be analyzed in isolation. Instead, they’re part of a more fluid set of priorities. Understanding important missions shaping today’s shoppers can help brands better anticipate consumer attitudes and behaviors in an environment defined by lasting disruption.

1. Responding to Value

Economic uncertainty, tariffs and rising prices are driving a “value first” mindset among consumers. Price increases and sticker shock — even among high-income shoppers — are causing a loyalty crisis, with some brand loyalists turning away for good, according to eMarketer.

The USDA’s Food Price Index shows that food inflation has cooled since pandemic-era peaks but remains uneven. Overall grocery prices are projected to rise 2.2% in 2025 — slower than in recent years — yet staples like beef and eggs are expected to climb sharply, keeping price sensitivity high. Meanwhile, restaurant meals are forecast to increase nearly twice as fast as groceries, reinforcing trade-offs between dining out and eating at home.

This holiday season, value-conscious behavior is expected to dominate, but it’s not just about price. PwC’s 2025 Holiday Outlook finds that while overall spending may drop 5%, consumers remain focused on traditions, meaningful gifts and smarter shopping.

Gen Z, facing the steepest budget cuts, are expected to opt for frugality and sustainable (e.g., resale/upcycled items) as well as wellness-focused items, while older generations remain steadier spenders and baby boomers are even increasing budgets by 5%. Across generations, shoppers are looking for a balance of value and experience, gravitating toward promotions, bundles and loyalty incentives.

Brand example: Some brands are recalibrating their approach to inflation. Kellanova, for example, is returning to more traditional pricing and promotional strategies after years of heavy price increases, using flexible pack sizes and timed promotions to meet financially strained households where they are, while continuing to invest in innovation and brand-building.

Takeaway: Category managers can respond by offering flexible assortments, targeted promotions and personalized messaging to help shoppers feel confident they’re getting value without sacrificing choice.

2. AI-Driven ‘Dinner Tonight’ Ideas

Artificial intelligence is increasingly shaping meal planning and grocery decisions. One-quarter of Americans using AI rely on it for recipes or meal planning, according to a 2025 Vitamin Shoppe report. Generative AI is becoming a popular shopping assistant, helping consumers find recipes, plan dinners and explore new products.

A recent report by media company Future shows shopping is the second-most common daily AI use. What's more, shoppers use AI to research products, get recommendations and discover unique items, and AI-driven traffic shows higher engagement — 12% more pages viewed per visit and 23% lower bounce rates — than non-AI traffic, according to Adobe. While conversions remain lower than traditional channels, the gap is shrinking, indicating growing comfort completing purchases after using AI.

Brand example: Albertsons Cos. enhanced its Ask AI search tool across all apps by integrating Google Cloud’s Conversational Commerce agent, enabling multi-turn conversations for meal planning, product comparisons and bundle suggestions. Early results show customers often add extra items to their baskets, demonstrating how AI can guide and influence purchases in real time.

Takeaway: Category managers can support this trend by making meal solutions, recipe kits, and complementary items easy to discover online and in-store. Aligning digital content with AI queries — e.g., “quick weeknight dinners” or “family-friendly meals” — helps capture shoppers at the point of inspiration.

3. Social Media-Driven Occasion

Social media is increasingly influencing consumer discovery and purchasing decisions. According to McKinsey, nearly 30% of consumers in the U.S., U.K. and Germany have purchased a brand they discovered via social channels. Consumers are turning to platforms such as Instagram and TikTok for inspiration on holidays, celebrations and lifestyle moments, creating opportunities for brands to link inspiration directly to the purchase path.

Brand example: Candy brand Joyride used social media to drive in-store sales at Target. The brand promoted exclusive SKUs with a sweepstakes and a Guinness World Record attempt, encouraging shoppers to post photos on Instagram. The campaign boosted social buzz — with 1,733 tags in an hour — and drove sales, helping Joyride rank among Target’s top-selling candy brands and linking social discovery directly to in-store purchase behavior.

Takeaway: For category managers, this means monitoring trending content, identifying high-engagement moments, and ensuring relevant products are visible both digitally and on the physical shelf. Leveraging social-driven insights can help translate online buzz into in-store and ecommerce sales.

4. Treat-Yourself Indulgence

Even amid economic caution, consumers are seeking small luxuries that bring joy. McKinsey and Circana research shows that younger shoppers — especially Gen Z — are splurging on affordable indulgences, from beauty products to premium snacks and home gadgets. Circana notes that at-home indulgence is rising, with purchases of items like single-serve blenders, espresso makers, fondue sets and spa-style massagers helping consumers create joyful, cost-effective experiences at home. The long-held “lipstick effect” highlights that shoppers will spend on items that deliver emotional satisfaction, even while cutting back elsewhere.

Brand example: E.l.f. Cosmetics and Stanley teamed up in 2024 to launch limited-edition tumblers and matching tinted lip oil holders exclusively at Target. The co-branded endcap featured stickers for personalization, sold out quickly and was promoted heavily on Instagram, TikTok and Target.com. This collaboration gave shoppers a playful, affordable way to treat themselves, blending beauty and lifestyle while tapping into social sharing and collectibility.

Takeaway: Category managers can tap into this trend by highlighting premium or indulgent options, offering smaller pack sizes and creating eye-catching displays that encourage trial. Seasonal promotions or themed tie-ins can reinforce the idea of a guilt-free treat.

5. Trial, Discovery & Dupes

Consumers are increasingly experimenting with “dupes,” or lower-cost alternatives to premium products. Morning Consult data shows that 27% of U.S. adults intentionally purchase dupes, down slightly from 2023, with Gen Z and price-conscious shoppers leading the trend. Kearney analysts also note that these consumers often use trial products to test performance before committing to higher-priced items.

Social media plays a central role: TikTok and Instagram communities share affordable alternatives across beauty and personal care, highlighting accessibility, quality and creative self-expression. “Brands don't mind when people post dupe fragrances because it eventually does lead the person to purchase the real thing,"" says dupe reviewer Paul Reactss.

Takeaway: Category managers can capitalize on dupe-seeking by offering entry-level products, creating trial packs, bundling new items with familiar favorites or visually comparing alternatives in merchandising. Simplifying discovery and trial encourages engagement, increases basket size and can build loyalty.

The USDA said consuming food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis.
Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.","A public health alert is being issued for some ready-to-eat Walmart meals that may have pasta contaminated with listeria.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service issued a nationwide alert Thursday for packages of Walmart's Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce.

The USDA said the meals contain pre-cooked pasta, which is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and could be contaminated with bacteria.

The pre-made meal is sold in 12-oz. clear plastic tray packages and has “best if used by” dates SEP 22, 2025; SEP 24, 2025; SEP 25, 2025; SEP 29, 2025; SEP 30, 2025; and OCT 01, 2025. The product bears establishment numbers “EST. 50784” or ""EST. 47718"" inside the USDA mark of inspection.

The linguini and meatball meals were shipped to Walmart locations nationwide.

The USDA said consuming food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis. This serious infection primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

The USDA said the company that makes the meals collected samples of the FDA-regulated pasta as part of an ongoing investigation into a listeria outbreak linked to Chicken Alfredo meals. The test confirmed that the linguini pasta was positive for Listeria monocytogenes.

Further testing is ongoing to determine if the listeria detected is genetically related to the specific outbreak strain.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Consumers with questions regarding the public health alert can contact Nate’s Fine Foods at 916-677-7303. Operating hours are between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. PST Monday through Friday.

Listeriosis symptoms

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn.

In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics.

Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

ICE has not disclosed the reason for his arrest, and as of Tuesday, no criminal charges had been filed in Florida courts.
Vorbe and his family own Société Générale d’Énergie S.A. (Sogener), once one of Haiti’s largest private electricity providers.
Vorbe’s arrest comes just two months after ICE agents in Florida detained another powerful Haitian figure, businessman and former presidential candidate Réginald Boulos.
“There is not much love lost in Haiti either for Dimitri Vorbe or Réginald Boulos, or many of the elite families,” Johnston said.","MIAMI, Florida — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has detained Dimitri Vorbe, one of Haiti’s most powerful and controversial businessmen, marking the latest move by American authorities against members of Haiti’s political and economic elite.

According to online detention records, Vorbe was being held Tuesday at the Krome North Service Processing Centerin Miami. ICE has not disclosed the reason for his arrest, and as of Tuesday, no criminal charges had been filed in Florida courts. An ICE spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Vorbe and his family own Société Générale d’Énergie S.A. (Sogener), once one of Haiti’s largest private electricity providers. The Vorbe family was also known for winning lucrative government contracts for roads and infrastructure projects during the presidency of René Préval.

In 2020, then-President Jovenel Moïse — who was assassinated in 2021 — accused Vorbe and other elites of corruption and seized control of Sogener. The episode underscored deep tensions between Haiti’s oligarchs and the government, with Moïse claiming the power sector was draining state resources.

“Both Boulos and Dimitri Vorbe were the two members of the elite, the oligarchs that Jovenel went after,” noted Jake Johnston, international research director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Vorbe’s arrest comes just two months after ICE agents in Florida detained another powerful Haitian figure, businessman and former presidential candidate Réginald Boulos. U.S. authorities have accused Boulos of providing financial support to violent gangs in Haiti — groups the U.S. government has formally designated as terrorist organizations.

“With the arrests of Boulos and Vorbe, you are seeing a strata of Haitian society touched in their places of exile,” said Michael Deibert, author of Notes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti. “A message is being sent to the upper echelon of Haiti’s political and economic elite that they’re not untouchable anymore.”

Reactions in Haiti to Vorbe’s detention were mixed. Many citizens, frustrated by years of corruption and impunity among political and business elites, have welcomed the arrests as a rare sign of accountability.

“There is not much love lost in Haiti either for Dimitri Vorbe or Réginald Boulos, or many of the elite families,” Johnston said. “Many people will cheer it in a country with a broken judicial system as it’s some sliver of accountability, [but] we don’t know what any of this is for. How does this all fit together into a strategy that actually benefits Haiti?”

Vorbe’s arrest came just a day after the U.S. government imposed sanctions on two former Haitian officials with ties to his family. Former deputy Arnel Belizaire and ex-senator Antonio Cheramy were designated for “significant corruption,” making them and their immediate families ineligible to enter the United States.

“The U.S. government will remain relentless in pursuing those supporting terrorist gangs through indictments, arrests, sanctions, arms seizures, and other immigration restrictions,” said Christopher Landau, Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of State.

For now, Vorbe’s future remains uncertain as ICE has not disclosed whether he faces deportation, charges, or continued detention. His arrest, however, deepens the sense that Washington is tightening its grip on Haitian elites who have long escaped accountability at home.",https://nycaribnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/v.png,N,,2025-09-26 21:07:13.774633

Instacart is the leader in on-demand grocery delivery, while DoorDash and Uber have both invested in expanding partnerships with grocers.
DoorDash stock fell 4% Aug. 13, the day of the Amazon news.
Meanwhile, DoorDash stock has found support above its 21-day exponential moving average since the start of September.
DoorDash stock boasts a near-perfect 98 IBD Composite Rating, according to IBD Stock Checkup.","DoorDash is the IBD Stock of the Day for Friday. Shares of the food and grocery delivery firm are chasing a cup-with-handle buy point and have steadily found support from investors at the 50-day exponential moving average.

On the stock market today, DoorDash (DASH) stock gained a fraction to 262.57 in recent trades. DASH stock is ahead 55% year to date and more than 80% from 12 months ago.

And DoorDash's shares have racked up a more than 400% gain since the start of 2023, as the company's strong sales growth and improved profitability eased investor concerns about the sustainability of on-demand food delivery.

Strong Q2 Results

The strength of U.S. food-delivery demand was on display when DoorDash reported earnings results in early August. Shares jumped 5% and touched a record high of 278.15 the day after the report.

DoorDash's revenue jumped 25% to $3.28 billion for the June-ended quarter, compared with analyst estimates of $3.16 billion. That's the money DoorDash collects in fees and other costs from the $24.2 billion in gross order value on its marketplace during the quarter, which marked a 23% increase from a year earlier. Revenue growth accelerated from the 21% rate that DoorDash posted in Q1.

Earnings swung to 65 cents per share for the quarter, compared with a loss of 38 cents per share a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet were forecasting earnings per share of 44 cents for DoorDash.

These Are The Five Best Stocks To Buy Or Add To A Watchlist Now

Grocery Debate Hits DoorDash Stock

But DoorDash stock pulled back from those gains. Shortly after the company's earnings report, Amazon announced a major expansion of its grocery delivery offering.

The tech giant's maneuvering weighed on shares of DoorDash, Instacart (CART) and Uber Technologies (UBER). Instacart is the leader in on-demand grocery delivery, while DoorDash and Uber have both invested in expanding partnerships with grocers.

DoorDash stock fell 4% Aug. 13, the day of the Amazon news. Shares closed the month 2% lower overall. That marked just the second month this year that DoorDash stock did not post a gain, the other coming in March.

Some analysts viewed concerns about Amazon's grocery push as overblown, at least for DoorDash stock.

""We will continue to monitor for evidence on Amazon's encroachment, but for now remain optimistic on the path forward — powered by core restaurant delivery but also expansion areas and normalized margin opportunity,"" Bernstein analyst Nikhil Devnani wrote to clients last month.

Impacted Less Than Rivals

DoorDash stock has taken far less of a blow than Instacart, which relies on grocery sales for the majority of its revenue. Instacart stock fell 10% in August and is down another 3% this month.

Of course, Amazon is not the only company battling for grocery sales. Uber expects to reach $12.5 billion in gross bookings from non-restaurant deliveries this year, according to a Bloomberg report Friday. The report noted that Uber had struck partnerships with some retailers previously only available on Instacart or DoorDash.

Meanwhile, Walmart (WMT) is the overall market leader for online grocery sales.

What's Next For DoorDash Stock?

DoorDash's third quarter ends with September, with the company typically reporting results in late October or early November. Analysts are projecting DoorDash's Q3 revenue will grow by about 24% to reach $3.35 billion while earnings increase 79% to 68 cents per share, according to FactSet.

Analysts are mostly bullish about DoorDash stock. The stock has 30 buy calls among Wall Street analysts, according to FactSet, compared to 13 analysts who are neutral and one who holds a sell rating.

Meanwhile, DoorDash stock has found support above its 21-day exponential moving average since the start of September. Shares are ahead 6.5% this month.

DoorDash's weekly chart on MarketSurge shows the stock in a second-stage cup base with a 278.15 buy point. Shares broke out from a double-bottom base buy point of 201.03 in early May. The low point of that base undercut a previous flat-base pattern from December and January, resetting DoorDash's base count on its weekly chart.

DoorDash's daily chart, meanwhile, shows a cup-with-handle base with an entry at 269.06.

DoorDash stock boasts a near-perfect 98 IBD Composite Rating, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

That score places DoorDash at the top the 59-stock Retail-Internet industry group tracked by IBD, which has performed well this year. The group ranks 21st among 197 industry groups, based on six-month price performance. The overall group is up 26.3% year to date.

DoorDash's Relative Strength rating is down from a month ago but remains a strong 89 out of 99.

The petrol ban covers both producers and resellers, with carve outs for intergovernmental agreements (like Mongolia), while the diesel curb excludes producers, whose pipeline shipments account for the bulk of exports.

About three-quarters of Russian diesel exports move via producers through the North and South pipelines to Baltic and Black Sea ports. Volumes shipped by independent traders are “relatively small,” according to the communique.

The move follows refinery outages after Ukrainian drone attacks that reduced Russian oil refining by almost a fifth on certain days and widened fuel shortages in multiple regions. In Moscow, Lukoil restricted gasoline sales in jerry cans at some stations, while Crimea’s regional head cited supply disruptions linked to refinery closures.

Following the news, the ICE low-sulphur gasoil premium to Brent climbed over 5% to $26.14, near a two-month high.

By the numbers, Russia produced more than 86 million tonnes of diesel in 2024, exporting around 31 million tonnes, placing it alongside the US as a top seaborne diesel exporter.

Officials did not announce curbs on other refined products such as aviation fuel or fuel oil in this package, and producer-shipped diesel via pipelines continues. Crude exports also continue but face a lowered price cap of $47.60/bbl effective early September under new mechanisms, while refined product caps remain at $100/bbl for high-value products and $45/bbl for low-value products.

Flexible electrolyzer design co-produces hydrogen, creating feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel and e-methanol.

Potential pathway to decarbonise aviation and shipping, sectors responsible for more than 5% of global CO₂ emissions.

Amsterdam bets on flexible carbon capture

Dutch climate tech company Brineworks has raised €6.8 million (US $7.3 million) in fresh funding to advance a new form of Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology designed to deliver carbon removal at below €100 per ton. The round, led by SeaX Ventures with participation from Pale Blue Dot, First Momentum, AiiM Partners, Energie360°, and Katapult, comes as policymakers and investors intensify scrutiny of aviation and shipping emissions.

The company, founded in 2023, is targeting commercial readiness by 2026 with a system that also produces hydrogen, the essential input for e-fuels. Earlier this year, Brineworks secured a €1.8 million grant from the European Innovation Council’s Accelerator program to accelerate pilot deployment.

DAC paired with hydrogen

At the core of Brineworks’ approach is a patented electrolyzer engineered to operate flexibly with renewable power. Unlike conventional systems, which degrade when turned on and off, the unit is designed to start and pause in sync with solar and wind availability.

“We’ve proven a clear path to capturing CO₂ directly from air at below $100 per ton,” said Joseph Perryman, co-founder and CTO. “That’s the threshold the world has been waiting for, and now the scale-up begins.”

The technology enables DAC and hydrogen co-production. Together, these streams provide the building blocks for synthetic fuels such as e-methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For airlines and shipping companies under pressure from regulators and investors, the economics of such a system could provide a lifeline.

Aviation and shipping in focus

Aviation accounts for roughly 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, while maritime shipping contributes more than 3%. Both industries face limited options to decarbonise at scale. Synthetic fuels offer a potential solution, but costs have remained prohibitive.

“Renewable energy is becoming cheaper faster than anyone predicted. The bottleneck now is technology that can use this power flexibly and affordably,” said CEO Gudfinnur Sveinsson. “That’s exactly what we’ve built.”

By aligning DAC with renewable generation, Brineworks aims to localise production of carbon-neutral fuels. If the model proves viable, it could allow countries to produce e-fuels domestically, reducing import dependency while contributing to climate targets.

Investor confidence in science-led solutions

Investors describe Brineworks’ approach as a step-change in carbon removal economics. “We’re always looking for visionary founders solving massive problems with science-backed solutions, and Brineworks is exactly that,” said Kid Parchariyanon, managing partner at SeaX Ventures. He added that supporting the company aligns with the fund’s goal of helping to cut 1% of the world’s carbon footprint.

The financing reflects a broader wave of venture and public funding moving into engineered carbon removal. European institutions, including the EIC, are prioritising projects that pair carbon capture with synthetic fuels, in part to meet transport decarbonisation targets set by Brussels.

Policy and market implications

If Brineworks achieves its target of commercial readiness by 2026, airlines could begin sourcing carbon-neutral fuel before 2030, supporting compliance with the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate and the International Maritime Organization’s decarbonisation strategy.

The sub-€100 per ton capture benchmark is particularly relevant to investors. Current DAC systems often operate at two to four times that cost, limiting their integration into fuel production at scale. Achieving that threshold would make DAC competitive with established offset markets while offering a verifiable, technology-based pathway.

Looking ahead

The next phase for Brineworks is scaling its electrolyzer-DAC system to pilot level, with demonstration projects expected in the next 18 months. For global energy and transport leaders, the outcome will be closely watched. Success could reshape the economics of synthetic fuels and offer a scalable solution to two of the hardest-to-abate sectors.

For investors and policymakers, Brineworks highlights the growing intersection of renewable integration, carbon removal, and industrial decarbonization. As nations look to secure domestic energy supplies while meeting net-zero commitments, technologies that merge these goals are gaining strategic importance.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dutch-Startup-Brineworks-Secures-7.3M-to-Scale-Direct-Air-Capture-for-e-Fuels.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 17:09:12.117627

In statements to the press after a follow-up meeting on the implementation of the Royal Initiative, held with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation, and Moroccan Expatriates, Nasser Bourita, the Foreign Ministers of Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Chad reiterated their countries’ full commitment to the Royal solidarity-based Initiative and to accelerating its implementation. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Niger, Bakary Yaou Sangaré, expressed his country’s gratitude to His Majesty the King, emphasizing that the audience granted by the Sovereign to the Foreign Ministers of the Alliance of Sahel States on April 28, 2025, in Rabat marked “a great esteem.” During this historic audience, the minister continued, “His Majesty the King presented His initiative and His clear vision to enable our countries to access the Atlantic. We were deeply moved by this gesture.” Referring to the follow-up meeting, held on the sidelines of the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Nigerien minister noted that it provided an opportunity to “convey the greetings and gratitude of our countries’ authorities for this initiative.” “At this stage, we already have a matrix of projects developed by the task forces,” he explained, “which will meet soon to prioritize the projects and identify those that can be implemented immediately, in the short and long term.” “We are moving from the design phase to the implementation phase, to show the world that the Royal Atlantic Initiative is underway and becoming a reality,” the Nigerien minister concluded. In the same vein, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mali, Abdoulaye Diop, emphasized that the meeting falls within the framework of strengthening ties between Morocco and the Alliance of Sahel States through this “special mechanism” embodied by the Royal Atlantic Initiative. He welcomed the “approach of consideration, listening, and mutual respect” that characterizes this cooperation, expressing appreciation for “the way in which Morocco approaches its relations with our countries, which are currently facing difficult times.” “Morocco acts as a brother, with a spirit of listening and mutual respect, as we jointly examine the problems and solutions to the challenges facing our countries,” he stressed. “This is also the feeling that the Foreign Ministers of the member states of the Alliance of Sahel States shared during the historic audience granted by His Majesty King Mohammed VI in Rabat,” he added. Likewise, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso, Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré, praised the vision of His Majesty the King, which he described as authentic and forward-looking, viewing the Sahel “not as an isolated enclave, but as a gateway.” “His Majesty the King does not see the Sahel as a land without a future, but as a land of opportunities,” he stated, adding that this visionary approach is “fundamental” in shaping Morocco’s relations with Sahel States. He also noted that during the follow-up meeting, it was agreed to begin implementing, as soon as possible, the elements identified by the task forces that are ready for immediate execution.

Arizona has an Aa1 issuer rating and stable outlook from Moody's Ratings.","Arizona's outlook from S&P Global Ratings is back to stable after 14 months at positive.

The rating agency, which raised its outlook for the state's ratings in July 2024, pointed to potential financial pressure sparked by tax and policy changes on the federal level for the reversal.

""The outlook revision reflects our view of the state's evolving budget environment and the need to maintain strong budget management practices as it navigates potential economic uncertainty and effects from federal policy changes to maintain its strong finances,"" S&P said in a report on Thursday.

Arizona's AA issuer rating and AA-minus rating for appropriation-secured certificates of participation were affirmed by S&P, which cited the state's economic and population growth, budgetary discipline and low debt profile, along with a trend of relatively late annual audits.

It also noted the state's ""demonstrated financial management and recent increases in reserves, although tempered by our view of potential financial and economic uncertainty influenced by federal changes that we believe could pose negative pressure on its budgetary performance.""

H.R. 1, the massive federal tax and spending ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, could reduce Arizona's general fund revenue by $459.6 million in fiscal 2026 and $398.5 million in fiscal 2027, according to a Sept. 18 report by the state's Joint Legislative Budget Committee.

The report said Arizona applied for $760 million from a federal program to reimburse states for border security costs incurred since 2021, adding the criteria or timeline for awarding grants is uncertain.

S&P said the state could take steps to mitigate impacts from H.R. 1, including addressing tax conformity.

At a ceremonial signing of Arizona's $17.6 billion fiscal 2026 general fund budget in July, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs warned H.R. 1 would be devastating for the state's spending plan.

Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on S&P's outlook revision to stable.

SWIFT’s Linea Blockchain Pilot Competes With Ripple Payments.

The trial involves some of the world’s top banks (BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon) and it is “a major step forward in moving SWIFT’s messaging system on-chain, as the TheBigWhale reported. This particular development creates competition for Ripple, which has long touted blockchain as a cheaper and quicker alternative to bank transfers.

Already tokenized messaging and settlement are used in Ripple’s model to reduce dependence on SWIFT’s legacy infrastructure. SWIFT is testing its own blockchain pilot, signaling that it is not about to give ground in the fast-evolving payments landscape.

Currently, SWIFT links more than 11,000 financial institutions around the world. Recently, Tom Zschach, a company executive, claimed that banks would favor SWIFT’s payment rails, tokenized deposits, or regulated stablecoins.

It doesn’t move money directly. Rather, it sends standardized instructions to banks to enable them settle payments through correspondent accounts. This system has supported global finance for decades but is slow, expensive and depends on several intermediaries.

The Linea pilot aims to change that. Built by Consensys, Linea provides privacy-focused cryptographic proofs as well as scalability for Ethereum transactions. Such features attract banks that want operational efficiencies with compliance and data confidentiality. The pilot combines payment instructions and settlement in one on-chain transaction. This would cut costs and would let everyone monitor progress in real time. Thus, it can reduce costs and enable all parties to monitor progress in real-time.

Pilot Faces Challenges but Shows Growing Blockchain Use in Banking

Ripple has been among the biggest challengers to SWIFT’s dominance. Banks and companies can move money across borders using their blockchain-powered payment network at lower fees and in a shorter time than before.

An interbank token is also being studied as part of the pilot, potentially adding stablecoin-like features to SWIFT’s offering. Such a move could blunt Ripple’s advantage as it gives major banks their own blockchain-based option for settlement. However, Ripple has also made a counter-move by unveiling a payment stablecoin demo.

The test is still early and it may be months before practical results emerge. Technical challenges include integration with existing banking systems and demonstration of Linea security’s efficiency. The pilot is proof that traditional finance is showing greater interest in incorporating blockchain services.",https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/swift_plans_stablecoin.webp,N,,2025-09-26 14:14:55.154090

Boots Made For More Than Just Walking

A roundup of flat, knee-high styles that are both practical and pleasing to the eye.

Sept. 26, 2025Updated 12:46 p.m. ET

In T’s column 1 Piece, 10 Budgets, we share 10 perfect versions of an item in a range of prices. This season, the flat boot, or “floot,” as T’s fashion team has taken to calling it, has risen to the top of the editors’ fall wish lists. While it was once strongly associated with equestrian style, today’s iterations are sharper and ready for city life. Here are the T market editor Jaclyn Bloomfield’s favorite pairs.

1. Sappun, $77.90

At under $100, these synthetic leather boots from the Korean brand Sappun, with a zipper that runs up the inside, offer an accessible entry point to the season’s essential silhouette.

2. H&M, $109

H&M has modernized an otherwise pared-back, classic shape with an elongated toe box capped with a squared-off edge.

3. Toral, $447

Crafted from ultrasoft leather, this pair from the Spanish brand Toral features balanced proportions and will work as well with a leather jacket and jeans as with a feminine dress.

4. Larroudé, $525

Handmade in Brazil from calf leather, these Larroudé boots are finished with gold-accented tabs, making them easy to get on, and a memory-foam insole, making them just as easy to wear.

5. Loeffler Randall, $650

Jessie Randall, who founded her label out of her Brooklyn apartment, has always designed pieces she wants to wear, and this boot — made from black vachetta leather and featuring a padded footbed — is no exception.

6. Tory Burch, $775

The Twisted Riding Boot from Tory Burch, a consistent favorite among T’s fashion editors, is form-fitting up through the calf and finished with a floating belt detail — just the kind of statement piece sure to elevate an entire look.

7. Tibi, $995

For fall, Tibi introduced a taller, knee-high version of its beloved Bux boot. Made in Italy from soft leathers, this design, too, embodies the brand’s thinking about everyday luxury, which is that it should be simple, adaptable and wearable.

8. Proenza Schouler, $1,190

Named for its slim, trapezoid-shaped toe, Proenza Schouler’s Trap Flat Boot is crafted from both calf leather and lambskin, with clean-lined seams around the ankle and a straight silhouette.

9. Khaite, $1,580

Initially part of Khaite’s pre-fall 2023 collection, the Marfa boot, with an elongated square toe and tonal topstitching, has become a brand staple. Made in Italy from supple calfskin, it’s an investment piece you’ll want to revisit every season.

10. Hermès, $3,175

This style, which debuted on Hermès’s fall 2025 runway, replaces the classic riding boot’s round toe with a fine point, and a strap fitted with the house’s signature ruthenium-plated buckle adds further polish.

The Trump administration has instituted several duties using Section 232, including those on steel and aluminum, as well as cars and auto parts.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department is still investigating goods such as semiconductors, which could be precursors to additional tariffs.","The U.S. will levy sector-specific tariffs on a slew of new goods starting Oct. 1, President Donald Trump said Thursday evening.

In separate Truth Social posts, Trump announced that he would install a 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products and a 25% tariff on “‘Heavy (Big!) Trucks.’” In a third post, he outlined plans to impose a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and associated products, and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture.

The pharmaceutical tariffs will kick in unless a company is “building [a] manufacturing plant in America,” he wrote, defining building as “breaking ground” or “under construction.” Many pharmaceutical companies, among them Roche, GSK, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson, have already rushed this year to onshore drug production or increase U.S. spending, leaving the impact of the new tariff threat on the sector unclear.

In April, the Commerce Department initiated a Section 232 investigation into the pharmaceutical and trucking sectors. Trump also said in August that his administration had begun a “Tariff investigation” into furniture imports, with plans to levy duties within 50 days.

Although Trump did not mention the prior probes on Thursday, he did cite national security as a rationale for the truck and furniture tariffs. Section 232 reviews focus on evaluating the national security implications of imported goods.

The president has threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports several times since returning to the White House, saying in August that they could reach as high as 250%. At the time, he said he would begin with “a small tariff” before ratcheting up the rate over the next year and a half. It remains unclear if that is the planned cadence of the administration.

The announcement comes the same month the Trump administration expanded its list of sectors under Section 232 scrutiny. On Sept. 2, the Commerce Department launched an investigation into personal protective equipment, medical equipment and devices imports, while also opening a similar review of robotics and industrial machinery.

At this year’s Health Systems Implementing Climate Action event during Climate Week NYC, CVS Health outlined how one of the country’s largest healthcare providers is preparing for and responding to the rising risks of climate-driven disasters. The presentation demonstrated how technology, logistics, and strategic partnerships are being used to create a more resilient healthcare system that can withstand the disruptions of extreme weather.

Safeguarding Access to Care During Extreme Weather

Jenny McColloch, Vice President of Sustainability and Community Impact at CVS Health, explained that the company is focused on protecting patients, communities, and frontline healthcare workers as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and heatwaves become more frequent. She emphasized that ensuring uninterrupted access to essential services is not only a matter of business continuity but also a commitment to public health and safety.

In her remarks, McColloch described how CVS Health is using predictive data and Geographic Information Systems to anticipate potential disruptions and reroute supply chains so that pharmacy services remain available even when traditional networks are down. She noted that new technology-enabled solutions are becoming central to these efforts, including the use of drone delivery, smart packaging, and rapid pharmacy recovery initiatives. Alongside these innovations, CVS is also investing directly in local organizations and relief partners to provide immediate assistance while supporting long-term recovery and resilience in communities most affected by disaster.

Partnership with SkyfireAI Expands Capabilities

A major focus of the presentation was CVS Health’s work with SkyfireAI, a company known for its expertise in drones and AI-powered autonomy. Together, CVS Health and SkyfireAI are piloting and scaling drone operations that help the company respond more quickly and effectively when disaster strikes. Drones are being used to assess damage to CVS facilities and community health centers, deliver critical specialty medications and emergency medical supplies when roads are impassable, and provide real-time situational awareness that helps public and private stakeholders accelerate response times.

The results of these efforts have already been seen in recent hurricanes, when CVS deployed SkyfireAI drones to determine the operational status of facilities within hours. This capability allowed state and federal agencies to reallocate resources with greater efficiency and gave CVS the ability to restore services for vulnerable patients days ahead of competitors.

Matt Sloane, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of SkyfireAI, described the partnership as rooted in shared values. “Watching how CVS Health shows up for communities in the middle of a disaster leaves a real impression on us at SkyfireAI,” said Sloane. “Their willingness to invest in people, employees, customers, and neighbors alike goes beyond business. It’s about stepping in when it matters most, and that’s why we’re proud to stand alongside them.”

Building a Scalable Model for Resilience

The Climate Week discussion highlighted the increasing pressure on healthcare systems as climate-related disasters grow in intensity. CVS Health’s integrated model, strengthened by collaboration with innovation partners such as SkyfireAI, offers a practical blueprint for resilience. By combining predictive data, advanced technology, and community investment, the company is demonstrating how health systems can protect access to care not only in the immediate aftermath of disasters but also in building stronger, more sustainable systems for the future.

Industrial refrigeration is the engineering and technology applied to the design, installation, and maintenance of large-scale industrial cooling systems. It is employed to cool and control temperatures for a wide range of industrial applications, such as food and beverage processing, chemical processing, pharmaceutical processing, cold storage, and more. Industrial refrigeration is used to preserve and extend the shelf life of perishable goods, regulate process temperatures, and create optimal conditions for industrial operations. It is critical for industries that rely on temperature sensitive components and processes, as it safeguards product quality, personnel safety, and operational efficiency.

Prime Determinants of Growth:

The global industrial refrigeration market growth is attributed to several factors such as the growth of the cold-chain industry, the increasing food & beverages and pharmaceutical industries, and industrialization in developing economies. However, the strict government regulations and high initial costs and maintenance expenses restrict the market growth. Moreover, technological advancements in refrigeration systems present new opportunities for the growth of key players in the coming years.

COVID-19 Scenario:

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the global industrial refrigeration market, owing to the temporary closure of industrial refrigeration system manufacturing firms during the lockdown.

Not only the production but also the sale of industrial refrigeration systems was hampered due to the closure of end-user industries, especially in the initial period of the pandemic.

However, the situation has recovered, and the industrial refrigeration market is growing steadily.

The compressor segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period-

Based on component, the compressor segment held the highest market share in 2020, accounting for nearly one-third of the global industrial refrigeration market revenue, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period. Compressors such as screw compressors, reciprocating compressors, and others are used for industrial refrigeration systems and are the main components of a refrigeration system. On the other hand, the others segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 6.2% from 2023 to 2032. The others segment includes electrical components, pipes, and expansion systems, and due to the rising demand for refrigeration systems, this segment is expected to witness a high growth rate.

The ammonia segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period-

Based on refrigerant type, the ammonia segment held the highest market share in 2020, contributing to more than half of the global industrial refrigeration market, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period. Ammonia gas is a zero ODP and zero GWP refrigerant gas, making it an eco-friendly refrigerant. In addition, constructing a refrigeration system with ammonia-based refrigerant costs 10-20% less than one that uses CFCs, as narrower-diameter piping can be used. Such factors along with many others are driving the growth of this segment. However, the carbon dioxide segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 6.1% from 2023 to 2032. This is due to growing demand for natural and non-toxic refrigerators which is expected to drive the growth of this segment in the coming years.

The stationary refrigeration segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period-

Based on type, the stationary refrigeration segment accounted for the largest share in 2020, holding around 90% of the global industrial refrigeration market revenue, and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period. The rapid expansion of refrigerated warehouses for storing and processing food and beverages has fueled the demand for industrial stationary refrigeration. However, the transportation refrigeration segment would portray the largest CAGR of 5.6% from 2023 to 2032. Growing domestic and international trade of temperature-sensitive goods is expected to drive demand for transportation refrigeration systems.

Asia-Pacific to maintain its dominance by 2032-

Based on region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in 2020, accounting for more than two-fifths of the global industrial refrigeration market revenue, and is likely to dominate the market during the forecast period. The increase in demand for food & beverages, growth in the pharmaceutical industry, and rise in the number of refrigerated warehouses in the region have fueled the growth of the industrial refrigeration market. However, the LAMEA region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 5.9% from 2023 to 2032. The LAMEA industrial refrigeration market is witnessing growth with the growing demand for food and beverages. Further, an increase in the export of perishable products to the U.S. and other parts of the world has supplemented the growth of the industrial refrigeration market in the region.

The building will have an interior area of almost 90,000 square metres when it is completed in July 2027.
It is intended to be a “tribute to steel” and “showcase” the possibilities of building with steel.
The interior garden will be 2,000 square metres.
In contrast to the blast furnace steel from which the Eiffel Tower is made, ArcelorMittal’s new headquarters will be built from steel that has a carbon footprint that is eight times lower.","The Kirchberg skyline is changing. Even today, what towers above the fencing of the construction site for ArcelorMittal’s new headquarters is conspicuous. “The building will be even taller,” Vijay Goyal, executive vice president at ArcelorMittal, announced during a press tour of the construction site on Friday.

“The new building should be more than just a headquarters. It should be a landmark and an iconic building for the city,” said architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte. “What better material for this than steel?” A “superlative headquarters” is being built in Kirchberg.

‘Iconic building for the city of Luxembourg’

The steel sector has a long history in Luxembourg. Goyal said: “For a long time, the iron ore in the Minette was the only source of the country’s wealth.” The EU started as common steel and coal market and Luxembourg has always been at the centre of the project. It is “inseparable from the heritage.”

“We want to continue this legacy,” he added. The Kirchberg district was chosen because it is “the modern face of Luxembourg”. The new company headquarters will stand out in the area.

The building will have an interior area of almost 90,000 square metres when it is completed in July 2027. It will have space for 2,000 employees, of which only 300 to 500 will be occupied by ArcelorMittal. Half of the office space will be used by state agencies.

Goyal was tight-lipped about the costs. “It will cost around €4,000 per square metre,” he replied to a journalist’s question. That would be around €356 million for the 89,000 square metre site. Part of the cost of the building will be covered by the Luxembourg state, which is paying around €273.5 million for its share of the space.

“All of this was built using only ArcelorMittal products,” stated Wilmotte during the press tour. It is intended to be a “tribute to steel” and “showcase” the possibilities of building with steel.

The atrium will have a ceiling height of 60 metres, “higher than the cathedral in Metz”, said Wilmotte. The interior garden will be 2,000 square metres. 9,000 tonnes of steel from the ArcelorMittal plants in Esch/Belval and Differdingen will be used. “The Eiffel Tower only [used] 7,300 tonnes,” noted Wilmotte.

In contrast to the blast furnace steel from which the Eiffel Tower is made, ArcelorMittal’s new headquarters will be built from steel that has a carbon footprint that is eight times lower. “The production of one tonne of XCarb steel generates only 300 kilograms of CO2, making it one of the lowest CO2 [emitting] steels in the world,” said Goyal.

There is another connection to Paris. ArcelorMittal was an official partner of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris and also produced the rings that were attached to the Eiffel Tower, among other things, during the Olympic Games. The Olympic steel rings were melted down in Luxembourg and reused as beams, said Pierre Engel, head of the construction project.

This is only possible because the electric steelworks in Esch/Belval use electricity whose production does not generate any CO2. “We only wanted to use local products,” said Goyal. When asked whether this would have driven up costs, he replied: “Maybe Chinese steel is cheaper, but ours is better.”

The glass that will soon cover the exoskeleton also comes from Luxembourg factories. Engel said that 27,700 square metres of glass are needed to build the façade. The mayor of Luxembourg City even feared that reflections off the HQ could blind the city’s residents. “That’s why glass with a special anti-reflective coating is being used on the side,” said Engel.

Wrapping Up: A New Era for Coffee Economics The recent rebound in Arabica coffee prices, fueled by critically low exchange stocks and relentless supply pressures, marks a significant turning point for the global coffee market.","New York, NY – September 26, 2025 – The global coffee market is currently experiencing a significant shake-up as Arabica coffee prices have staged a remarkable rebound, reaching levels not seen in over a decade. This surge is primarily attributed to a dramatic and sustained decline in Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) certified stocks, signaling a tightening supply amidst resilient global demand. The development has sent ripples through the soft commodity markets, raising concerns among roasters, distributors, and consumers alike about future availability and pricing.

The recent price trajectory underscores a critical imbalance in the fundamental supply-demand dynamics of one of the world's most consumed commodities. With inventories at historical lows and adverse weather continuing to plague key producing regions, the market is bracing for a prolonged period of elevated prices, potentially reshaping consumer habits and strategic planning for major industry players.

The Perfect Storm: Depleting Stocks and Weather Woes Drive Price Rally

Arabica coffee futures have been on an impressive upward march, with the ICE Arabica futures contract reaching $2.75 per pound by late September 2024, representing a 46% increase from the start of that year and a staggering 91% surge over the preceding 12 months. This momentum carried into 2025, with prices hitting an all-time high of 440.85 US cents per pound in February 2025. As of September 26, 2025, Arabica coffee stood at 374.84 US cents per pound, reflecting a 0.94% increase from the previous day, maintaining its elevated position.

The primary catalyst for this meteoric rise has been the precipitous fall in ICE-monitored certified Arabica coffee stocks. These inventories, crucial for the futures market, plummeted to their lowest levels since 1999 in late 2023. The decline has been relentless, with ICE-monitored Arabica inventories falling to a 1.5-year low of 579,961 bags as of September 25, 2025. This drawdown has been exacerbated by the imposition of 50% US tariffs on Brazilian coffee imports, leading American buyers to void new contracts and further tighten US supplies, as Brazil typically accounts for a significant portion of America's unroasted coffee imports. The market has observed minimal coffee being delivered for exchange certification, coupled with increased purchases from existing certified stocks, further depleting available supply.

Beyond dwindling exchange stocks, severe supply-side pressures are intensifying. Extreme weather events, particularly in Brazil, the world's largest Arabica producer, have severely impacted crop yields. Brazil experienced a brutal combination of historic droughts and heavy rains in 2024, leading to a dramatic fall in harvests. The nation's crop forecasting agency, Conab, on September 4, 2025, cut its Brazil 2025 Arabica coffee crop estimate by 4.9% to 35.2 million bags. Similarly, the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association reduced its 2024/25 Vietnam coffee production estimate to 26.5 million bags. Rising labor and fertilizer costs are also squeezing producers, further dampening future output prospects. Volcafe projects a global Arabica coffee deficit of -8.5 million bags for the 2025/26 season, marking the fifth consecutive year of deficits.

Despite these significant supply constraints, global demand for coffee has remained remarkably robust. Coffee's cultural entrenchment and low-price elasticity mean that consumption changes only marginally in response to price increases. Growing consumption, particularly from younger demographics, shows no signs of abating, leading to a significant drawdown in global inventories, which are now at 20-year lows. This confluence of dwindling stocks, adverse weather, rising production costs, and inelastic demand has created the perfect storm for soaring Arabica coffee prices.

Corporate Fortunes: Who Wins and Who Loses in a High-Price Environment

The dramatic surge in Arabica coffee prices is creating a clear divide between winners and losers across the global coffee supply chain. For multinational coffee roasters and distributors, higher raw material costs translate directly into increased operational expenses, potentially squeezing profit margins if they cannot fully pass these costs onto consumers. Conversely, major coffee-producing nations and, to some extent, individual farmers, stand to benefit from the elevated prices, provided their crops are not severely impacted by adverse weather.

Among the publicly traded companies, major coffee roasters and retailers like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) and JDE Peet's (AMS: JDEP) will likely face significant headwinds. While these companies often hedge their coffee purchases, prolonged high prices will eventually filter through their supply chains, leading to higher input costs. They may be forced to either absorb these costs, impacting profitability, or raise retail prices, which could affect consumer demand, albeit coffee demand is relatively inelastic. Smaller, independent coffee shops, which have less hedging capacity, are particularly vulnerable and may struggle to maintain margins without substantial price increases.

On the other hand, agricultural commodity traders and some integrated food companies with robust sourcing operations might see mixed results. Companies like Nestlé S.A. (SWX: NESN), while a massive buyer of coffee for brands like Nescafé, also has diversified operations that might buffer the impact. Their scale allows for better hedging and direct sourcing agreements, potentially mitigating some of the volatility. However, the overall trend of higher prices will still be a cost factor.

The true beneficiaries, at least in theory, are the coffee farmers and producing nations. Countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam, despite facing production challenges, will see increased revenue per pound for the coffee they do manage to harvest and export. However, the benefits at the farmer level are often diluted by intermediaries and the impact of reduced yields due to weather. For example, while the price per bag is high, a Brazilian farmer whose crop was decimated by drought might not see a net financial gain. Furthermore, the higher prices could incentivize increased planting in the long run, potentially leading to future oversupply if demand doesn't keep pace.

Broader Implications: A Shifting Landscape for Global Coffee

The current Arabica coffee price rally is not an isolated event but rather a stark indicator of broader, systemic challenges facing the global agricultural commodity markets, particularly soft commodities. This event fits squarely into a trend of increasing supply volatility driven by climate change, geopolitical factors, and evolving trade policies. The sustained decline in ICE certified stocks highlights a critical vulnerability in the global supply chain, where transparent and accessible inventories are shrinking, making the market more susceptible to price spikes.

The ripple effects of this price surge are extensive. Competitors in the beverage industry might see a shift in consumer preferences if coffee prices become prohibitively high, potentially boosting demand for alternatives like tea or other non-coffee beverages. This could impact companies like Unilever PLC (NYSE: UL), which has a significant tea portfolio. Furthermore, the situation could accelerate innovation in coffee production, including the development of more resilient coffee varieties or sustainable farming practices to mitigate climate risks.

Regulatory and policy implications are also significant. The 50% US tariffs on Brazilian coffee imports, which have contributed to the drawdown in ICE inventories, demonstrate how trade policies can have immediate and tangible effects on global commodity flows and prices. Governments in producing countries may face pressure to support farmers through subsidies or infrastructure development to stabilize production. Consumer protection agencies in importing nations might also scrutinize price increases at the retail level.

Historically, coffee markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility, often linked to weather events in Brazil, such as the major frost in 1975 or droughts in the 1990s. The current situation bears resemblance to these past crises in its intensity, but with the added complexity of dwindling exchange stocks and the pervasive threat of climate change making weather patterns more unpredictable. Unlike past events that might have been more episodic, the current challenges appear to be more structural and long-term, suggesting that the era of cheap coffee may be drawing to a close.

What Comes Next: Navigating a Volatile Coffee Future

The immediate future of Arabica coffee prices remains highly dependent on several critical factors, primarily weather patterns in key growing regions and the replenishment of exchange stocks. In the short term, prices are likely to remain elevated, supported by the ongoing supply deficit. Any further adverse weather events in Brazil or other major producers could trigger additional price spikes, while a significant improvement in harvest prospects could provide some relief, as observed in recent weeks where prices showed a slight downward trend after a surge.

Longer-term, the market faces a period of potential strategic pivots and adaptations. Coffee roasters and distributors will need to re-evaluate their sourcing strategies, potentially diversifying their supply chains to reduce reliance on single regions or adopting more robust hedging mechanisms. Investment in sustainable farming practices and climate-resilient coffee varieties will become paramount for producers to ensure future supply stability. This could present opportunities for agricultural technology companies focused on climate-smart solutions.

Potential scenarios range from a continued upward trajectory if supply issues persist and demand remains strong, to a moderate correction if new crops exceed expectations and exchange stocks begin to rebuild. The International Coffee Organization (ICO) anticipates average Arabica prices to hover in the 280-310 cents per pound range in 2025, suggesting continued high prices. However, the USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) projects a 2.5% increase in world coffee production for 2025/26, albeit with a 1.7% decrease in Arabica production, indicating a complex and potentially divergent future for different coffee varieties.

Market opportunities may emerge for companies that can innovate in coffee alternatives or processing technologies that maximize yield from smaller harvests. Challenges will persist for those heavily reliant on conventional sourcing methods and unable to adapt to the new pricing reality. The market will closely watch for any significant changes in crop forecasts, inventory reports, and global economic indicators that might influence consumer demand.

Wrapping Up: A New Era for Coffee Economics

The recent rebound in Arabica coffee prices, fueled by critically low exchange stocks and relentless supply pressures, marks a significant turning point for the global coffee market. The confluence of climate change impacts, shifting trade policies, and unwavering consumer demand has created an environment where the days of abundant, cheap coffee may be a relic of the past. This event highlights the increasing fragility of global agricultural supply chains and the profound impact that environmental and geopolitical factors can have on everyday commodities.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by heightened volatility and a greater emphasis on supply chain resilience and sustainability. Investors should closely monitor crop reports from major producing nations, particularly Brazil and Vietnam, as well as the weekly updates on ICE certified stock levels. The strategic responses of major coffee companies – in terms of sourcing, hedging, and pricing – will be key indicators of how the industry adapts to this new economic reality. Furthermore, any shifts in consumer behavior due to sustained high prices will be a crucial factor to watch in the coming months. The coffee world is entering a new era, one defined by scarcity, higher costs, and an urgent need for adaptation.

ID17,CVS Health,2025-09-26 16:32:39+00:00,www.medpagetoday.com,Study Throws Shade at Fee-for-Service in Medicare Advantage | MedPage Today,"Shannon Firth, Washington Correspondent, MedPage Today, Shannon  Firth",,,,,https://www.medpagetoday.com/practicemanagement/reimbursement/117662,"Value-based payment models beat fee-for-service models in clinical quality outcomes among Medicare Advantage (MA) members, especially with 2-sided risk sharing, according to a retrospective cross-sectional study.
Craig and team explained that ""value-based payment and value-based care delivery models align clinician reimbursement with high-quality, cost-effective, evidence-based, patient-centered care, while fee-for-service models incentivize volume over health outcomes.""
""These results align with previous findings that commercial VBP [value-based payment] models are mostly beneficial to care quality.""
According to the Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network, the MA segment has the most value-based care, as well as the most downside risk arrangements.
Another potential limitation was that clinicians in value-based payment models are ""incentivized to report quality measures and therefore may report more completely than their [fee-for-service] counterparts.""","Value-based payment models beat fee-for-service models in clinical quality outcomes among Medicare Advantage (MA) members, especially with 2-sided risk sharing, according to a retrospective cross-sectional study.

Among more than 3 million MA enrollees, value-based payment models outperformed fee-for-service models for all 15 clinical quality outcomes, with a mean score difference of +6.7% (all P<0.001), reported Kelly J. Thomas Craig, PhD, of CVS Health in Hartford, Connecticut, and co-authors.

The mean score differences for blood glucose control (+25.5%) and blood pressure control (+23.3%) indicated ""markedly better performance"" with value-based payment models, they noted in a research letter in JAMA Health Forum.

Craig and team explained that ""value-based payment and value-based care delivery models align clinician reimbursement with high-quality, cost-effective, evidence-based, patient-centered care, while fee-for-service models incentivize volume over health outcomes.""

""These findings support [the role of value-based payment] in advancing mutually beneficial health and healthcare-related outcomes for patients, clinicians, and payers,"" they concluded.

When comparing the differential impacts of a range of risk-sharing levels, models with 2-sided risk performed better than fee-for-service models across all measures, while 1-sided risk and pay-for-performance models had stronger impacts on 14 and 13 measures, respectively. Of note, 2-sided risk outperformed 1-sided risk and pay-for-performance for nine measures.

Additionally, six measures focusing on hypertension, diabetes, and cancer showed ""incremental improvements in performance"" with 2-sided risk sharing, with mean score differences for controlling high blood pressure of +8.6% with 2-sided risk versus 1-sided risk; +7.3% for 1-sided risk versus pay-for-performance; and +15.0% for pay-for-performance versus fee-for-service (all P<0.001).

""Across the risk-sharing continuum, clinical quality performance consistently improved as financial arrangements moved toward 2-sided risk,"" Craig and colleagues wrote. ""These results align with previous findings that commercial VBP [value-based payment] models are mostly beneficial to care quality.""

In an email to MedPage Today, Craig noted that ""by actively participating in evidence generation, payers play a pivotal role in accelerating the shift towards value-based care -- enabling scalable, real-world insights that improve population health, enhance patient and provider experience, promote prevention, and reduce costs.""

As for policy implications, Craig said that ""this adds to the evidence that value-based care payment arrangements with providers have higher-quality outcomes for MA beneficiaries. According to the Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network, the MA segment has the most value-based care, as well as the most downside risk arrangements. MA is an excellent proving ground for value-based care because its focus on innovation allows plans to align the incentives between providers and health plans so naturally.""

Paul B. Ginsburg, PhD, of the University of Southern California Schaeffer Institute for Public Policy and Government Service, told MedPage Today that the consistent finding of the degree of risk-sharing predicting favorable quality impacts is ""meaningful.""

""But observational studies can only take us so far,"" said Ginsburg, who is a former member of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. ""Medical practices most likely to succeed under VBP are most likely to choose it. Mandating VBP for a subset of practices, as CMS did in traditional Medicare for joint replacements, is the best way to both assess VBP impact and refine the tools.""

For this study, Craig and colleagues included 3,312,536 MA members designated to the value-based payment (57.1%) or fee-for-service (42.9%) model based on their primary care practitioner's contract. Mean age was 72.4, and 56.2% were women.

They analyzed 15 clinical quality measures representing five secondary and tertiary prevention categories, including two cancer screening, four diabetes, four heart disease, one osteoporosis, and four care coordination measures.

Since the study was not a randomized trial, the findings support ""an associational rather than causal relationship,"" the authors noted. Another potential limitation was that clinicians in value-based payment models are ""incentivized to report quality measures and therefore may report more completely than their [fee-for-service] counterparts.""

""We feel confident in our results and that the data sharing effect may account for a part of, but not the whole, difference,"" Craig said.",https://assets.medpagetoday.net/media/images/117xxx/117662.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 14:15:14.696116

Professor Ifor Samuel, from the School of Physics and Astronomy, said: ""We are excited to demonstrate this new direction for OLEDs.
By combining OLEDs with metasurfaces, we also open a new way of generating holograms and shaping light.""
This breakthrough will enable a step change in the architecture of holographic displays for emerging applications, for example, in virtual and augmented reality.""
Professor Graham Turnbull, from the School of Physics and Astronomy, said: ""OLED displays normally need thousands of pixels to create a simple picture.","In a study published recently in Light, Science and Application, researchers from the school of Physics and Astronomy created a new optoelectronic device from the combined use of Holographic Metasurfaces (HMs) and Organic Light Emmitting Diodes (OLEDs).

Until now, holograms have are created using lasers, however researchers have found that using OLEDs and HMs gives a simpler and more compact approach that is potentially cheaper and easier to apply, overcoming the main barriers to hologram technology being used more widely.

Organic light-emitting diodes are thin film devices widely used to make the colored pixels in mobile phone displays and some TVs. As a flat and surface-emitting light source, OLEDs are also used in emerging applications such as optical wireless communications, biophotonics and sensing, where the ability to integrate with other technologies makes them good candidates to realize miniaturized light-based platforms.

A holographic metasurface is a thin, flat array of tiny structures called meta-atoms - the size of roughly a thousand of the width of a strand of hair - they are designed to manipulate light's properties. They can make holograms and their uses span diverse fields, such as data storage, anti-counterfeiting, optical displays, high numerical aperture lenses - for example optical microscopy, and sensing.

This, however, is the first time both have been used together to produce the basic building block of a holographic display.

Researchers found that when each meta- atom is carefully shaped to control the properties of the beam of light that goes through it, it behaves as a pixel of the HM. When light goes through the HM, at each pixel, the properties of the light are slightly modified.

Thanks to these modifications, it is possible to create a pre-designed image on the other side, exploiting the principle of light interference, whereby light waves create complicated patterns when they interact with each other.

Professor Ifor Samuel, from the School of Physics and Astronomy, said: ""We are excited to demonstrate this new direction for OLEDs. By combining OLEDs with metasurfaces, we also open a new way of generating holograms and shaping light.""

Andrea Di Falco, professor in nano-photonics at the School of Physics and Astronomy, said: ""Holographic metasurfaces are one of the most versatile material platforms to control light. With this work, we have removed one of the technological barriers that prevent the adoption of metamaterials in everyday applications. This breakthrough will enable a step change in the architecture of holographic displays for emerging applications, for example, in virtual and augmented reality.""

Professor Graham Turnbull, from the School of Physics and Astronomy, said: ""OLED displays normally need thousands of pixels to create a simple picture. This new approach allows a complete image to be projected from a single OLED pixel!""

Until now, researchers could only make very simple shapes with OLEDs, which limited their usability in some applications. However, this breakthrough provides a path toward a miniaturized and highly integrated metasurface display.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/smartphone-tablet-holographic-display.webp,N,,2025-09-26 14:15:21.181433

H&M is publicly traded on the Stockholm exchange and operates in 74 countries.
Added to this, since H&M wants to convey the perception of quality items with good cost-benefit ratio.
In the conference call with analysts, management commented on closing 135 loss-making stores of various global brands (72% bear the H&M name) between December and August.
The global CEO opened the quarterly presentation talking about Brazil, showed the video of the first store, and was questioned about the operation.","The chain avoids commenting on market expectations, given its still small scale in the country, but announced new expansion plans on Thursday. Four more stores will open in Brazil in 2026, in addition to the four already announced this year, totaling eight so far. H&M is publicly traded on the Stockholm exchange and operates in 74 countries.

Also on Thursday, for the first time, the country was one of the topics in the group’s earnings conference call. Analysts wanted to know about Brazilian customer demand and the pace of store openings, at a time when the U.S. is imposing tariffs and closing borders to foreign fashion.

The stock closed up 9.8% on the Swedish exchange. The price was the best in 11 months (171.25 Swedish crowns). What encouraged investors was better-than-expected operating profit from June to August, and signals of accelerated expansion in emerging countries (especially Brazil and India, in that order), while the U.S. and Nordic countries posted a weaker performance.

Valor revealed in an August interview with global CEO Daniel Ervér that Brazil could help the company balance losses from current restructuring efforts, including the shrinking of its loss-making store base.

The company should inaugurate two more stores in Brazil at the end of November, Reuters reported, in addition to the first one already opened in São Paulo in August, at Iguatemi Shopping. The third will open in December. The openings were already known, but not the exact month. Currently, based on what’s been announced, this year still needs openings at São Paulo malls Anália Franco and Morumbi, and at Parque Dom Pedro (Campinas).

The chain also announced it will inaugurate its first store in Rio de Janeiro in 2026, entering Rio Sul shopping center, from the Iguatemi group, in the south zone. In Porto Alegre, the first units will open next year, with two operations, at Iguatemi Porto Alegre and Praia de Belas Shopping, from the same mall group.

In the country’s interior, the chosen city was Sorocaba (São Paulo), a location known by brands for testing launches. As in other cases, the chosen mall will be from Iguatemi, the Iguatemi Esplanada.

Real estate groups, when they close agreements to host new brands, especially foreign retailers, sign opening packages that involve better rental conditions, sometimes even some type of financial support for the brand’s arrival. Therefore, it’s common for opening announcements to happen with the same group.

Added to this, since H&M wants to convey the perception of quality items with good cost-benefit ratio. something the company has been trying to work on to distance itself from the fast fashion concept, the agreement with Iguatemi helps strengthen this strategy.

In the conference call with analysts, management commented on closing 135 loss-making stores of various global brands (72% bear the H&M name) between December and August. This is 4% of total units worldwide (there are 4,100 locations). More than half of the closures occurred in Asia, Oceania and Africa.

The global CEO opened the quarterly presentation talking about Brazil, showed the video of the first store, and was questioned about the operation. Analyst Daniel Schmidt, from Danske Bank, asked whether Latin America can reverse the trend of store closures in 2026. The answer was vague. Mr. Ervér said he is excited, sees opportunities, and continues working. Joseph Ahlberg, head of investor relations, stated that the issue is finding the right locations.

“Brazil is a mature, well-established fashion and retail market. It’s not about new shopping centers being built, but about finding stores in existing, excellently performing shopping centers. We need to balance speed [of launch] with quality [of the asset],” he said.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/zs3BQvyln_CihTfDDSqK2QX7Kec=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/S/z/rBgJ6ASAia7xUrcTqznA/foto26emp-101-hem-b3.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 16:12:34.703376

Kip Underwood, CEO of Burcon, says that demand for plant-based protein products is at an all-time high.
Demand is particularly being propelled by environmental, health and weight management concerns, especially with the rise of GLP-1 medications.","CHICAGO — The Institute of Food Technologists IFT First: Annual Event and Expo returns to McCormick Place in Chicago July 13-16, 2025, featuring several educational sessions focused on health and wellness. The show, themed ""Cutting Sodium, Cutting Cost, and Clean Label Solutions – Driving Taste Innovation through Localized Application,"" specifically discusses GLP-1 medications, consumer concern over ultra-processed foods, the trajectory of the plant-based protein category and much more.

The 2025 IFT First show presents the latest trends and advancements in food science and technology, indicating that consumer and market needs are leaning more toward clean-label, functional foods focused on strong nutritional panels and claims.

Americans are increasingly utilizing GLP-1 medications such as Wegovy and Ozempic to manage diabetes and weight. In an individual IFT presentation titled ""Thriving in Foodservice in a World With GLP-1 Medications,"" Mattson & Co. CEO Justin Shimek discusses the rising phenomenon of GLP-1s, and the likelihood of these medications to drastically change the food industry.

In his presentation, Shimek notes that GLP-1 medications drastically reduce the caloric intake of the medication user, up to 1,000 calories per day when first beginning the medication. In addition to this effect, Shimek says that GLP-1 medications have been altering the palettes and food preferences of some consumers. Moving forward, GLP-1 medications offer an avenue for foodservice operators to reduce portion sizes and prioritize value, as well as culinary innovation.

Room for growth with plant-based products?

At another session titled ""How Can Plant-Based Proteins Gain Consumer Acceptance?"", panelists explore potential growth avenues for plant-based proteins, as well as overall category challenges. Panelists for this session include Devin Peterson, professor at The Ohio State University, Rohan Shirwaiker, co-director of the Bezos Center for Sustainable Protein at NC State University, Serap Vatansever, R&D scientist at General Mills and Renske Janssen, senior project manager protein technology at Nizo.

Vatansever says plant-based proteins are more common in cuisine globally, and the United States has room for growth. Renske notes that, since consumers typically eat what they know, slow plant-based protein integration is likely the best way forward for the industry in the US.

Renske says that fermentation in the dairy industry can be applied to alternative meat products, helping to add texture and manage off flavors. She notes that fermentation can be implemented in both ingredient and product development.

Shirwaiker says that, although plant-based protein is likely to continue dominating the alternative protein category, cell-cultured and fermented products are on the rise. Hybrid products are likely to continue their popularity. Renske is seeing more plant-based protein industry interest in collaborating with the animal-based protein industry, to add value and address fiber needs as well as high demand for protein.

No clear definition of ultra-processed foods

Another standout session offers insights on rising consumer concerns over ultra-processed foods. Speakers include Hillary Schiff, assistant professor at The Ohio State University, Susana Socolovsky, past president of the Argentinian Association of Food Technologists, David Julian McClements, professor at the University of Massachusetts and Martin Slayne, VP global SRA, innovation at Ingredion.

Slayne notes that while it is good to bring overall awareness to food processing, the phrase ""ultra-processed foods"" is too broad; without a clear definition or focus, the food industry does not have much of a way to address consumer concern over ultra-processed foods. Slayne also says that positive collaboration is the key to addressing this concern; McClements highlights that ultra-processed foods need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to understand each product's impact on nutrition.

The expo floor features a few standout themes, including guava-flavored ingredients and solutions, high demand for alternative proteins such as sunflower and fava bean, and minimal ingredient usage. With consumer concern over ultra-processed foods on the rise, food scientists and producers are prioritizing shorter labels for products that still have strong flavor, texture and mouthfeel attributes.

To further explore show-floor innovations and category trends on display at IFT First 2025, Dairy Foods is consulting with plant-based protein company Burcon NutraScience Corp., family-owned cheese company Sargento and plant-based ingredient company Beneo. Kip Underwood, CEO of Burcon, says that demand for plant-based protein products is at an all-time high. Demand is particularly being propelled by environmental, health and weight management concerns, especially with the rise of GLP-1 medications.

Denisse Colindres, head of nutrition communication at Beneo, notes that claims related to digestive health and microbiome support, as well as pre and probiotics, are gaining strong traction in the dairy industry, particularly in formats like yogurt. ""Consumers are actively seeking these products to contribute to not only gut health, but we see they're also searching for overall well-being,” she says. “These claims really resonate with consumers because they're just more aware of the importance of taking care of their gut for overall health.""

Colindres notes that satiety and appetite control are also gaining significant attention in the dairy category, as well as claims focused on protein content. She says that dairy is in a prime position for the booming protein trend, since dairy is already a go-to protein category.

Rod Hogan, senior vice president of innovation for Sargento, says that natural cheese products in particular are resonating strongly with consumer shopping priorities. Cheese consumption is up; “Flavor and variety and convenience all play a huge role,” Hogan says.

Strong interest in high protein content is particularly benefitting the dairy snacking occasion, Hogan says. In addition to these attributes, he says nutrition, credentials and clean ingredient statements are driving growth not only for natural cheese products, but for the dairy category as a whole. “I think that that level of understanding, that level of thoughtfulness from a consumer standpoint is creating opportunities,” Hogan says.

Taste is more important than ever before, especially for the dairy and plant-based categories. “We eat for enjoyment. We eat for joy,” Underwood says. “We have to deliver the health and wellness benefits, and it has to be foods that are familiar, that taste great, that you're excited to go purchase, eat and enjoy.”

Consumers still want dairy products that are enjoyable to eat, Colindres says, but nutrient density and clean labels uniting to provide functional benefits is what’s driving many consumer purchasing decisions. She also sees strong interest in sugar reduction to support nutritional goals.

The IFT 2025 educational sessions, show floor and exhibitors all reinforce the fact that high protein content, nutritional benefits and clean labels are driving the next wave of food and beverage innovation, but highlight the fact that, to drive repeat purchases, these products must taste great as well.",https://www.dairyfoods.com/ext/resources/DF/2025/Sept/DF-September-2025-WebFiles-900x500-IFTReview-HERO.jpg?height=635&t=1758896127&width=1200,N,,2025-09-26 21:06:50.946336

Bosch plans to cut 13,000 jobs in its car parts business

Engineering giant Bosch is hoping that cutting jobs will save €2.5 billion as the crisis in Europe’s car market continues. Bosch plans to cut around 13,000 more jobs at its automotive parts business by 2030. This accounts for approximately 3% of its global workforce. These new cuts will mainly affect positions in Germany. The company’s base in the Stuttgart area is expected to be the one most severely affected, while sites in areas such as Feuerbach and Schwieberdingen are likely to see thousands of job cuts. The company has stated that it will begin speaking with the affected employees immediately. Car makers are finding it challenging to cope with slow demand, higher labor and energy costs, and competition from cheaper models from China. They are also facing higher tariffs on US exports. Currently, these duties are charged at a rate of 15%, down from a previously proposed rate of 27.5%.

China pledges carbon cuts, but experts call it ‘too timid’

On Wednesday, around 100 countries, collectively responsible for about two-thirds of the world’s emissions, presented plans or made commitments to reduce fossil fuel emissions and combat climate change at the UN General Assembly. China has announced its first cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. At a United Nations meeting on climate change, China’s President Xi Jinping announced that the country, which is the largest polluter, aims to reduce its carbon emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035. China produces more than 31 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, and these have been increasing for a considerable time. During the meeting, more than 100 world leaders discussed the importance of taking further action to mitigate the release of gases that contribute to global warming.

According to Renub Research Latest Report coffee bean market is projected to grow from USD 34.89 billion in 2024 to USD 61.60 billion by 2033, at a CAGR of 6.52% between 2025 and 2033. Market expansion is fueled by the increasing coffee culture among younger consumers, the proliferation of coffee shops and franchise expansions in developing nations, rising disposable incomes, and the diversity of beverages offered in cafés and restaurants worldwide.

Growth Drivers for the Coffee Bean Market

1. Urbanization and Lifestyle Changes

Urbanization, changing lifestyles, and a growing middle class in emerging markets are key factors driving coffee demand. With busier lifestyles, coffee is increasingly consumed as a convenient, on-the-go beverage. The popularity of coffee pods, ready-to-drink coffee, and specialty beans is expanding, particularly in countries like China, India, and Latin America.

2. Innovations in Coffee Preparation

Technological advancements in brewing equipment—premium coffee makers, grinders, espresso machines, pour-over kits, and cold brew systems—have enhanced convenience and quality. Consumers now seek diverse brewing methods, driving demand for a variety of coffee beans globally.

3. Expanding Coffee Shops and Cafés

The proliferation of coffee chains such as Starbucks, Dutch Bros, and independent specialty cafés is a major market driver. Coffee shops not only act as social hubs but also foster premium and ethically sourced coffee consumption. Specialty offerings, including single-origin beans, artisanal blends, and personalized brewing, encourage consumers to purchase higher-quality coffee beans.

Challenges in the Coffee Bean Market

1. Ethically Sourced and Sustainable Coffee

Growing consumer demand for sustainable and ethically sourced coffee presents challenges for small-scale producers. Obtaining certifications like Fair Trade or Organic requires significant investment, expertise, and adherence to labor and environmental standards.

2. Rising Demand for Premium Coffee

Premium coffee production requires intensive farming, strict quality control, and sustainable practices. Arabica beans are vulnerable to pests, diseases, and climate fluctuations, making production riskier. Meeting the growing demand for specialty coffee increases costs for smaller growers while supporting higher-value markets.

One minute it’s warm evening laps in a vest, the next it’s headtorch weather and a chilly breeze that turns your nipples into knives.

High street clothing brand, H&M, clearly clocked the shift, because it’s just announced a new men’s running capsule as part of its Move activewear collection, designed for the those who still turn up when the light’s going and are still there when it's back.

The new drop is all about keeping things ultralight, breathable and quick-drying. H&M Move says the range is inspired by modern running subculture, like the after-work 10Ks, the late-night track meets, so you get clean cuts, reflective accents and sensible storage without fussy details.

What’s in the drop

The collection comes in the form of a head-to-toe line-up. Expect tees and long sleeves, half-tights and shorts, a windproof water-repellent running jacket (£54.99), accessories and a few specialist pieces.

DryMove - H&M Move’s moisture-wicking fabric - is the common thread, appearing on the regular-fit running tee and short running shorts, through to running tights. If you just want a cheap training top, there’s even a boxy-style sports t-shirt with DryMove priced at just £12.99.

Low-light details are everywhere, too, with reflective motifs on a running cap, laser-cut ventilation on the lighter tees, bonded taping that keeps seams neat, and pockets that actually hold gels, keys and a phone, hopefully, without rattling around.

Fit and availability

The full new Move collection officially drops 3 October in selected stores but a bunch of pieces are already live and available to buy now from H&M.com if you want to get a head start.

For example, the DryMove running tee (£27.99), boxy sports tee (£12.99), running jacket (£54.99), shorts (£32.99), running tights (£19.99) / short running tights (£15.99), 3-pack DryMove socks (£9.99) and the reflective cap (£12.99) are all up now. Sizing runs from XS right up to 3XL.

Nothing here is too shouty, which is nice - it seems to be a straightforward kit that does the job and won’t sting the wallet, especially if you’re topping up for darker months.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2vquQEdpsc4vuHeeQAoTEa.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 12:36:13.449137

Anderson has worked at Thrivent alongside financial consultants Tim Urness and John Severson since 2019. Her former position spanned office management, new process initiation and team support. Anderson now holds FINRA Series 7 and Series 66 securities licenses, allowing her to meet with clients, develop and deepen relationships, and be a financial resource for her friends, family and community.

Anderson will support clients in all stages of their financial journey. With the belief that money is a tool, not a goal, she is passionate about a purpose-based approach to financial advice. She takes time to understand her clients’ unique goals and priorities, helping them develop a holistic financial strategy. Through her work, she wants to help people plan confidently, enabling lives full of meaning and gratitude.

Anderson prioritizes a balance between her career and her family life, being a mother of three young children who all go to school and play hockey in Alexandria. She and her husband, Cord, enjoy meeting new people through activities with the kids, and love watching them grow and make their own connections with others.

You can find Julie at the Thrivent office north of Cub Foods (2308 S Broadway St, Ste 4) and schedule an introductory meeting with her online at connect.thrivent.com/sage-creek-financial-consultants or 320-763-5100.

For the fourth year in a row, Zimny Insurance Agency has earned the 2025 Best Practices Agency status, joining an elite group of independent insurance agencies from across the United States.

The Best Practices Agency designation is awarded to participants in the Best Practices Study, which analyzes and documents the business practices of the highest-performing insurance agencies in the industry.

This year, 1,146 independent agencies throughout the U.S. were nominated to compete for this coveted designation and only 348 agencies scored high enough to qualify as a Best Practices Agency.

In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 Best Manufacturing Stocks to Buy Right Now. Parker-Hannifin Corporation is one of them.

Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a global leader in motion and control technologies, is gaining attention as one of the top manufacturing stocks to watch. Known for serving aerospace, industrial, and mobile machinery markets, the company combines more than a century of innovation with financial stability and one of the longest dividend increase streaks in the S&P 500, now at 69 years.

In September 2025, PH finalized its $1 billion acquisition of Curtis Instruments, a key player in motor speed controllers, power conversion devices, and instrumentation for electric vehicles and mobile machinery. Curtis, projected to generate $320 million in 2025 sales, has been integrated into Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH)’s Motion Systems Group, expanding its electrification and hybrid technology offerings. The move aligns with growing global demand for sustainable, decarbonized solutions and strengthens PH’s positioning in the rapidly evolving industrial landscape.

Financially, the company delivered record results for fiscal 2025. Fourth-quarter sales reached $5.2 billion, reflecting 2% organic growth, while net income climbed 18% to $923 million. Adjusted earnings per share rose 7% for the year to $27.33. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) also declared a quarterly dividend of $1.80 per share, marking its 301st consecutive payout and reinforcing its shareholder-focused policies. Additionally, the company expanded its share repurchase authorization to cover up to 20 million shares, signaling confidence in long-term growth.

While we acknowledge the potential of PH as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.

The RLN project engaged all six banks participating in the GBTD initiative, along with other major financial institutions, including Citi, Mastercard, Standard Chartered, Virgin Money and Visa.

Three major use cases

Among the use cases, the GBTD project will test three main areas: online marketplace payments, remortgaging processes and wholesale bond settlement.

According to Quant founder and CEO Gilbert Verdian, the project goes beyond improving payments and is about enabling new forms of programmable money that will “fundamentally transform how value is moved and managed.”

“Our involvement underscores Quant’s leadership in digital finance, as we work alongside the UK’s leading institutions to build the infrastructure powering tomorrow’s economy,” Verdian said.

UK FCA to launch crypto regulations in 2026

UK Finance’s tokenized deposits pilot launched amid the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) finalizing its crypto regulatory framework, with the full regime reportedly expected to come into effect in 2026.

In April 2025, the UK Treasury published a policy note on “Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets,” highlighting a clear distinction between qualifying stablecoin and tokenized deposits and electronic money.

According to a report by the Financial Times on Sunday, the FCA has been speeding up crypto approvals in response to criticism recently, as the UK inches closer to adopting a full regulatory framework next year.

In the meantime, the European Union has been steadily advancing the application of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which entered full force in late 2024. While MiCA broadly regulates tokenization across various crypto-assets, tokenized deposits fall outside its regulatory scope as they remain governed under traditional banking and deposit frameworks.","https://images.cointelegraph.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=90,width=1200/https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-09/0199856d-e578-7cd1-a095-d4edc8a670a2",N,,2025-09-26 12:34:07.638442

Colorado’s state EV incentives won’t stay this generous for long.","A viral TikTok recently declared Colorado “the best place in the country” to buy an EV. That’s a bold claim. But is it true? A closer look at the state’s tax credits, exchange programs and market share suggests it just might be.

There’s plenty of attention on incentive packages for EVs since the well-publicized $7,500 federal credit for many models is set to expire on Sept. 30. But creator and transit expert Danny Katz (@danny.katz) lays out the details of several options for Colorado residents to cut their purchase price on EVs outside of the soon-to-be-gone federal incentive.

“There is a $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicles that expires on Sept. 30, but that's not the only tax credit that's available or incentive that's available,” Katz explains before introducing Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, who lists some of the state’s EV incentives.

How Colorado’s Incentives Stack Up

Here are the significant incentives in play right now for Coloradans shopping for an EV and how they compare in total savings:

Federal EV Tax Credit: Up to $7,500 for new electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Delivery must be completed by Sept. 30, 2025, to qualify. Used EVs are eligible for up to $4,000 under federal rules.

Colorado State Innovative Motor Vehicle Credit: For 2025, the base credit is $3,500 for new EVs or plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) with an MSRP up to $80,000, and there is an additional $2,500 for vehicles with an MSRP under $35,000. That brings the state credit potential to $6,000 in the right cases.

Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program: This program is aimed at income-qualified buyers who trade in older, high-emitting gasoline or diesel vehicles. The rebate can be up to $6,000 for new battery EVs/PHEVs or $4,000 for used ones. Requirements include income thresholds, vehicle age or emissions failure and caps on vehicle MSRP or purchase price.

Put together, a buyer in the right circumstances might combine all three programs to reduce the cost of a qualifying new EV by $17,000 or more.

To justify calling Colorado “the best place” to buy an EV, it helps to look at how deeply EVs have penetrated the auto market there:

In Q3 2024, Colorado briefly overtook California in terms of the percentage of new cars sold that were electric. In that quarter, about 25.3% of new vehicles purchased or leased in Colorado were EVs, compared to 24.3% in California.

However, that dominance hasn’t held steady. In early 2025, the share of new EV registrations in Colorado dropped to about 15.9% from 21.5% in Q4 2024.

Still, that kind of year-over-year growth is remarkable. Just a few years ago, EVs made up only a small fraction of new car sales in the state. In 2019, only about 2.2% of new vehicles sold in Colorado were EVs.

The savings potential in Colorado varies widely depending on the buyer. After Sept. 30, typical buyers purchasing a higher-priced EV without the trade-in benefit would still see around $11,000 in combined incentives.

How Colorado Stacks Up To Other States’ EV Incentive Packages

While Colorado’s incentives are among the strongest in the country, several other states are also offering substantial rebates, credits or bonuses, albeit with more stringent limitations. Comparing them helps clarify the extent of Colorado's advantage and in what areas it leads or lags.

California remains one of the most ambitious states. Its Clean Vehicle Rebate Project offers up to $7,500 for qualifying battery EVs and fuel-cell EVs, with somewhat smaller rebates for PHEVs. Income qualifications apply, with lower-income households eligible for larger rebates. There are also grants for low-income purchasers to help with vehicle costs. Utility- and municipal-level programs sometimes offer bonuses for activities such as replacing old gas cars or installing home chargers.

Connecticut has a tiered rebate program (known as Connecticut's Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate) that scales with vehicle type and income. As of mid-2025, standard rebates are relatively modest, but income-qualified buyers can receive significantly more. Starting in August, Connecticut cut its standard rebate for new EVs from $1,500 to $500, although the “Rebate+” program for lower-income households remains higher.

Oregon offers a meaningful option for income-qualified buyers through its Charge Ahead Rebate, which provides up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $5,000 for used ones. That program remains funded and is open to low- and moderate-income households as well as certain nonprofits. The state’s broader Standard Rebate, which offered up to $2,500 for new EV purchases regardless of income, was suspended as of Sept. 9 after funds were depleted.

New Jersey offers rebates or tax incentives up to about $4,000 for eligible battery EVs, and in many cases offers sales tax exemptions on qualifying EVs, which can significantly reduce purchase price. While these incentives are strong, they often place stricter MSRP caps or mileage/vehicle type limits than those in Colorado.

Colorado’s state EV incentives won’t stay this generous for long. In 2025, buyers can claim up to $3,500 in state credits, plus a $2,500 bonus for vehicles with a lower MSRP. But under the current law, those amounts will shrink dramatically in 2026. Because state revenue growth was projected at less than 4%, a budget trigger was activated that cuts many green tax credits in half.

As a result, the base EV credit is expected to fall to around $750 next year, though the $2,500 bonus for cars under $35,000 is slated to remain. That means buyers who wait until 2026 will miss out on thousands in savings compared to today’s deals.

On Sept. 19, a Florida judge dismissed a lawsuit brought against Hershey's last year accusing the confectionery company of deceptive marketing for various Reese's Peanut Butter products, including Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins.

In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Melissa Damian said the plaintiffs – four people who purchased Reese's Peanut Butter products in 2023 – did not provide enough evidence to allege economic injury. The customers claimed they purchased the chocolates because of ""cool"" packaging and were disappointed to find ""blank"" chocolates inside the wrappers.

Here's what to know about the lawsuit, and why it melted away.

Why was Hershey's sued? Candy didn't match packaging, customers said.

Florida residents Nathan Vidal, Debra Kennick, Abdjul Martin and Eduardo Granados sued Hershey's in May 2024, claiming that several Reese's Peanut Butter products featured ""unlawful, fraudulent, unfair, misleading and/or deceptive"" advertising, according to court documents. In addition to the peanut butter pumpkins, the customers also mentioned the peanut butter ghosts, bats, footballs and winter shapes, like the snowmen, stockings and bells.

Vidal purchased three bags of Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins in 2023 because he ""believed that the product contained a cool-looking carving of a pumpkin’s mouth and eyes,"" according to court documents. But when he opened the chocolates, which he said ""did not contain any of the artistic carvings of the mouth or eyes as pictured on the label,"" he was distraught. Vidal claimed he would not have purchased the chocolates if he knew they didn't adorn the details as pictured on the exterior packaging.

Specifically, the four customers argued that Hershey's violated Florida Deceptive And Unfair Trade Practices Act, which is designed to protect Floridians from unfair competition, deceptive acts and unethical practices.

The group demanded $5 million from Hershey's, which they claimed represented the sales of special Reese's Peanut Butter products in Florida over the past three years.

What did Hershey say? 'Reasonable customer' wouldn't be deceived.

In September 2024, Hershey's asked the court to dismiss the case, claiming the customers didn't actually sustain injury from purchasing the chocolates.

Hershey's argued the customers got ""exactly what they paid for"" – Reese's chocolates, which were not ""defective, inedible or lacked the expected delicious taste,"" court documents state.

Hershey's added that a ""reasonable customer"" wouldn't be deceived by the chocolates, especially because a ""Decorating Suggestion"" disclaimer is featured on each bag of special Reese's Peanut Butter chocolates, per court documents.

In effort to further its point, Hershey's outlined how bags of the Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins display a pumpkin chocolate with a bite out of it.

""After all, no consumer acting reasonably would expect to buy a food product with a huge chunk bitten out,"" Hershey's argued, per court documents.

Hershey's did not immediately respond for comment when contacted by USA TODAY on Thursday, Sept. 25.

What happens next?

In her ruling, Damian said the plaintiffs could file an amended complaint, a revised version of the original complaint to start back at square one.

New Rembra RT and Areta RT [1] CT platforms drive accuracy and efficiency in radiation therapy with advanced workflows and long-term value

Philips debuts helium-free [2] BlueSeal RT 1.5T 70cm MR system with AI-powered SmartSpeed Precise, expanding its leadership in sustainable MR for radiation oncology

Amsterdam, the Netherlands - At the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2025 Annual Meeting, Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, will introduce groundbreaking additions in radiation oncology: the Philips Rembra RT and Philips Areta RT CT platforms, and the latest helium-free [2] BlueSeal RT 1.5T MR system. Designed to help radiation oncology teams deliver highly accurate, efficient, and patient-centered care, innovative technologies like the new NanoPanel Precise XD detector, built for AI and the AI-based Smartspeed Precise, represent a significant step forward in tackling the growing complexities of radiation therapy planning.

Setting new standards in CT simulation with speed, accuracy, and long-term value

CT imaging is the foundation of precision in radiation therapy planning, delivering accuracy to guide treatment. But as oncology teams face mounting demands for precision, efficiency, and consistency amid staffing and resource pressures, a new era of CT simulation is rising to meet the challenge.

Philips’ new Rembra RT and Areta RT systems are designed to make cancer treatment planning faster and more accurate. These advanced scanners produce clearer, more consistent images so doctors can see tumors in greater detail and plan treatments with confidence. They also save valuable time with ultra-fast image reconstruction speeds up to 106 images per second, andeasy-to-use touchscreen gantry controls that help 91% of care teams work more efficiently [3]. A wide 85 cm extended field of view and next-generation 4DCT imaging capabilities can capture a full respiratory cycle in one scan up to 500 scan seconds with breath rates of 4-40 breaths per minute.

Beyond imaging, the systems support remote collaboration for planning and training, helping care teams stay connected and efficient without adding extra staff. And with Philips’ industry-first Tube for Life Guarantee and a design for which 20 years of service could be provided (provided commercial upgrades and maintenance), hospitals gain reliable, long-term value while keeping costs lower. Patients also benefit directly, with a high-performance table that allows flexible positioning, faster workflows that shorten waiting times, and shared-use radiology capabilities on Rembra RT to maximize department efficiency.

""Philips invented CT Simulation and introduced the industry’s first Big Bore RT system,” said Dan Xu, Business Leader of CT at Philips. ""With Rembra RT and Areta RT, we’re once again setting new standards in radiation therapy, empowering care teams with the precision, dependability, and speed they need to deliver the best outcomes for patients.”

Philips is also currently working with MVision AI to explore opportunities to include MVision AI’s Contour+ AI-powered auto-segmentation software with Philips CT simulators, including the new Rembra RT and Areta RT systems. Contour+ delivers fast and precise automatic delineation of organs at risk and lymph node areas.

Philips expands MR leadership with helium-free BlueSeal RT [4]

Alongside its newest CT innovations, Philips is introducing BlueSeal MR RT in North America [5], the company’s latest helium-free [2] 1.5T 70cm MR system designed for radiation oncology. Powered by AI-based SmartSpeed Precise acceleration software, BlueSeal RT enables enhanced simulation confidence.

MR plays an increasingly vital role in radiation therapy, enabling clinicians to visualize tumors and surrounding healthy tissue with far greater detail, which is essential for planning precise treatments. By combining sustainability with advanced imaging, BlueSeal RT transforms therapy planning with enhanced simulation confidence, reducing registration errors to help protect healthy organs. In addition, MR-only imaging with MRCAT simplifies workflows. With full MR-only simulation protocols in as little as 10 minutes, patients also benefit, experiencing shorter scans that improve comfort and overall experience, especially for those wearing a mask.

With approximately 2,000 helium-free [2] MR scanners installed worldwide, Philips is driving the shift to sustainable MR. BlueSeal RT extends this leadership into radiotherapy by addressing a key challenge for oncology departments: installing MR systems in complex clinical environments such as Radiation Oncology departments. Its light-weight, vent-pipe-free design opens new siting possibilities - whether in basements, bunkers, or higher floors - while also lowering cost and energy use through helium-free [2] operation and PowerSave+ efficiency.

""BlueSeal RT is leading the way in MR for radiotherapy,” said Ioannis Panagiotelis, PhD, Business Leader MR at Philips. ""By combining helium-free [2] sustainability with AI-powered acceleration, we’re enabling radiation oncology teams to plan and simulate with greater speed, accuracy, and confidence-while enhancing the patient experience.”

""Radiation oncology teams need transformative innovation to meet today’s accuracy, workflow, and cost challenges,” said Christopher M. Freese, MD, The Christ Hospital. ""With Rembra RT, Areta RT, and BlueSeal RT, Philips is setting new standards for precision and efficiency in radiation therapy across CT and MR.”

FrieslandCampina Wamco Nigeria Plc tumbled the NASD Over-the-Counter (OTC) Securities Exchange by 0.20 per cent on Thursday, September 25, after its share price went down by N2.13 to N57.87 per unit from the previous day’s N60.00 per unit.

The contraction in the price of the popular dairy firm depleted the market capitalisation of the unlisted securities exchange by N4.16 billion to N2.122 trillion from the N2.127 trillion it ended at midweek.

Equally, the NASD Unlisted Security Index (NSI) depreciated at the close of business by 6.95 points to finish at 3,548.11 points, in contrast to the 3,555.06 points it ended on Wednesday.

The alternative stock market ended yesterday’s trading session with no price advancer.

A look at the activity chart showed that the volume of transactions went down by 96.3 per cent to 77,963 units from the previous 2.1 million units, the value of transactions depreciated by 98.7 per cent to N3.5 million from N272.9 million, and the number of deals went down by 60 per cent to 12 deals from 30 deals.

Okitipupa Plc retained its spot as the most traded stock by value on a year-to-date basis with 160.2 million units worth N6.2 billion, trailed by Air Liquide Plc with 507.3 million units valued at N4.2 billion, and FrieslandCampina Wamco Nigeria Plc with 45.1 million units sold for N2.0 billion.

Africa Capital Alliance’s (ACA) flagship private equity fund, CAPE IV, has completed a full exit from Aradel Holdings Plc, in what is the largest secondary sale of shares in the Nigerian energy sector.

The divestment delivered over 3oo per cent return in Dollar terms, equivalent to 1,700 per cent in Naira, after nearly a decade of investment in the indigenous upstream oil company.

ACA sold its 15.93 per cent stake, representing 691.96 million shares, for N387.2 billion at a market price of N559.50 per share on September 25. The transaction marks the end of a long-standing relationship between the fund and the energy firm.

A significant portion of the shares was acquired by Petrolin Ocean, which has now strengthened its position in Aradel. Petrolin, which previously held 8.11 per cent, purchased an additional 173.79 million shares valued at N96.4 billion. Thus, it boosted its stake to 12.11 percent, making it the company’s largest shareholder.

Business Post reports that in 2018, ACA converted a debt investment of N23 billion in Aradel to equity. As a result of this transaction, 36 million shares were allocate to ACA at $2.23. At the time, Aradel was valued at N145 billion, to which ACA had around 19 per cent stake.

Last year, Aradel exited NASD OTC Securities Exchange and listed on the Nigerian Exchange, listing 4.3 billion units at N702.69 billion, which amounted to a market of N3 trillion translating to a N574 billion share for ACA.

Shortly after the listing, ACA trimmed its holding by 24.7 million (0.57 per cent) in a N19.8 billion sale to boost liquidity in the market, reducing its stake to 15.93 per cent.

With this latest divestment, ACA has fully exited its position, realising N406.95 billion in total proceeds ($272 million).

The deal also shows Petrolin effort at boosting its foot print. The firm, a long-standing partner in the Aradel story and a member of the Renaissance Africa Energy consortium, tincreased stake deepens its influence in the company’s future direction.

The transaction highlights the robust value generated in Nigeria’s upstream sector. It also signals shifting shareholder dynamics that may shape Aradel’s next growth phase, which many analysts feel haven’t been utilised post-listing on the Nigerian bourse.

The 3,166,284,712 ordinary shares of FCMB Group Plc converted to equity from debt to exit the forbearance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) have been listed on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited.

The equities, valued at about N23.1 billion, were listed on the trading platform of the nation’s flagship stock exchange on Tuesday, September 23, 2025.

A notice signed by the Head of Issuer Regulation Department of the exchange, Mr Godstime Iwenekhai, confirmed the development.

Recall that in June 2025, FCMB said it planned to exit the regulatory forbearance regime of the central bank through the conversion of loans to equity as part of its broader recapitalisation programme set to conclude by March 31, 2026.

“The bank has one additional obligor (classified as a Stage 1 loan since drawdown to date) on the CBN forbearance for Single Obligor Limit (SOL).

“This Obligor will be brought within SOL limit by September 30, 2025, following the conversion to equity of a recently concluded N23.1 billion convertible loan and audited nine months projected retained earnings,” FCMB disclosed in a statement signed by its scribe, In a statement on Tuesday signed by Ms Funmi Adedibu.

“We intend to conclude this process, including downstreaming the capital proceeds to the bank by the end of July 2025, it added, noting that, “This would effectively take the Share Capital and Share Premium of the Bank to -N267 billion. Capital Adequacy will remain above the regulatory minimum of 15% for international banks post forbearance, reinforced with the addition of the converted equity by July 2025 and the planned audit of nine months retained earnings.”

“FCMB Group’s Nigerian Banking Subsidiary currently has loans under CBN forbearance (credit exposures to 3 entities and 2 obligors) amounting to N207.6 billion as at 31st May 2025 (down from N538.8 billion as at September 30th, 2024),” the bank said.

“These are currently classified as Stage 2 loans. The Bank has made provisions for these loans over the last few years, and intensified resolution efforts have led to over 60% reduction in its credit forbearance exposures.

“Once these loans exit the CBN forbearance regime, we anticipate that this would lead to an initial spike in Stage 3 loans to -11.5% of the total loan book which would decline below 10% by the end of the financial year, based on anticipated loan book growth,” it further clarified.

In the circular issued this week, NGX said it has listed the N23.1 stocks arising from conversion of mandatory convertible loan (inclusive of accrued interest) at a conversion price of N7.30 per share.

“With this listing of the additional 3,166,284,712 ordinary shares, the total issued and fully paid-up shares of FCMB have now increased from 39,605,421,562 to 42,771,706,274 ordinary shares of 50 Kobo each,” a part of the disclosure read.

Nigeria has approved the sale of TotalEnergies stake in an oil block that includes the Bonga field to Shell Plc and Nigerian Agip Exploration valued at $510 million.

The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), which is the regulator for upstream operations, signed off on a Sales Purchase Agreement (SPA) by TotalEnergies Exploration and Production Nigeria Limited to assign its entire 12.5 per cent contractor interest in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 118 to Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPco) and Nigerian AgipExploration Limited (NAE).

According to a statement, the regulator said TotalEnergies would transfer 10 per cent of its interest to SNEPco at a cost of $408 million while Agip will pay $102 million for the remaining 2.5 per cent.

The NUPRC said that pursuant to Section 95 of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, the commission carried out due diligence on SNEPco to ascertain their financial capacity and technical competence.

“SNEPco and NAE have demonstrated both technical and managerial competence to optimally contribute to the upstream operations (explore, develop and produce) in OML 118. They already maintain a participating interest in the asset.

“Based on the presentations and documents submitted, there is a clear evidence that they have access to funding to meet their financial obligations,” the commission said.

The NUPRC further stated that TotalEnergies, a committed operator in Nigeria’s vibrant upstream sector, had also paid the statutory application fee for the deal.

The upstream petroleum regulator noted that SNEPCO and NAE will bear the decommissioning and abandonment liabilities owed by TotalEnergies to the Federal Government of Nigeria with respect to the divested interest.

It explained that the divestment is subject to a ministerial consent in line Sections 95(1), (2), (7), (11) and 12 of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.

The Commission therefore expects SNEPco and NAE to pay 5 per cent and 2 per cent respectively of the transaction purse on the total value of $510 million as premium on ministerial consent and processing fees.

The assignees are also to give an undertaking in favour of the Commission that they will bear all the decommissioning and abandonment liabilities and the host community liabilities owed by TotalEnergies.

Shell is already the operator of OML 118 with a 55 per cent stake while Esso Exploration and Production help 20 per cent and Agip had a 12.5 per cent share before the completion of the sale.

The TotalEnergies divestment in Nigeria is part of efforts to halt its mounting global debt. The oil major is targeting around $3.5 billion in assets sale worldwide including oil assets and renewable projects.

Earlier in the week, the NUPRC cancelled a separate deal between TotalEnergies and Chappal for a 10 per cent stake in one of its assets, due to failure to meet financial commitments.",https://businesspost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NASD-Exchange-bullish.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:22:20.758240

New Rembra RT and Areta RT [1] CT platforms drive accuracy and efficiency in radiation therapy with advanced workflows and long-term value

Philips debuts helium-free [2] BlueSeal RT 1.5T 70cm MR system with AI-powered SmartSpeed Precise, expanding its leadership in sustainable MR for radiation oncology

Amsterdam, the Netherlands – At the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2025 Annual Meeting, Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA), a global leader in health technology, will introduce groundbreaking additions in radiation oncology: the Philips Rembra RT and Philips Areta RT CT platforms, and the latest helium-free [2] BlueSeal RT 1.5T MR system. Designed to help radiation oncology teams deliver highly accurate, efficient, and patient-centered care, innovative technologies like the new NanoPanel Precise XD detector, built for AI and the AI-based Smartspeed Precise, represent a significant step forward in tackling the growing complexities of radiation therapy planning.

Setting new standards in CT simulation with speed, accuracy, and long-term value

CT imaging is the foundation of precision in radiation therapy planning, delivering accuracy to guide treatment. But as oncology teams face mounting demands for precision, efficiency, and consistency amid staffing and resource pressures, a new era of CT simulation is rising to meet the challenge.

Philips’ new Rembra RT and Areta RT systems are designed to make cancer treatment planning faster and more accurate. These advanced scanners produce clearer, more consistent images so doctors can see tumors in greater detail and plan treatments with confidence. They also save valuable time with ultra-fast image reconstruction speeds up to 106 images per second, and easy-to-use touchscreen gantry controls that help 91% of care teams work more efficiently [3]. A wide 85 cm extended field of view and next-generation 4DCT imaging capabilities can capture a full respiratory cycle in one scan up to 500 scan seconds with breath rates of 4-40 breaths per minute.

Beyond imaging, the systems support remote collaboration for planning and training, helping care teams stay connected and efficient without adding extra staff. And with Philips’ industry-first Tube for Life Guarantee and a design for which 20 years of service could be provided (provided commercial upgrades and maintenance), hospitals gain reliable, long-term value while keeping costs lower. Patients also benefit directly, with a high-performance table that allows flexible positioning, faster workflows that shorten waiting times, and shared-use radiology capabilities on Rembra RT to maximize department efficiency.

“Philips invented CT Simulation and introduced the industry’s first Big Bore RT system,” said Dan Xu, Business Leader of CT at Philips. “With Rembra RT and Areta RT, we’re once again setting new standards in radiation therapy, empowering care teams with the precision, dependability, and speed they need to deliver the best outcomes for patients.”

Philips is also currently working with MVision AI to explore opportunities to include MVision AI’s Contour+ AI-powered auto-segmentation software with Philips CT simulators, including the new Rembra RT and Areta RT systems. Contour+ delivers fast and precise automatic delineation of organs at risk and lymph node areas.

Philips expands MR leadership with helium-free BlueSeal RT [4]

Alongside its newest CT innovations, Philips is introducing BlueSeal MR RT in North America [5], the company’s latest helium-free [2] 1.5T 70cm MR system designed for radiation oncology. Powered by AI-based SmartSpeed Precise acceleration software, BlueSeal RT enables enhanced simulation confidence.

MR plays an increasingly vital role in radiation therapy, enabling clinicians to visualize tumors and surrounding healthy tissue with far greater detail, which is essential for planning precise treatments. By combining sustainability with advanced imaging, BlueSeal RT transforms therapy planning with enhanced simulation confidence, reducing registration errors to help protect healthy organs. In addition, MR-only imaging with MRCAT simplifies workflows. With full MR-only simulation protocols in as little as 10 minutes, patients also benefit, experiencing shorter scans that improve comfort and overall experience, especially for those wearing a mask.

With approximately 2,000 helium-free [2] MR scanners installed worldwide, Philips is driving the shift to sustainable MR. BlueSeal RT extends this leadership into radiotherapy by addressing a key challenge for oncology departments: installing MR systems in complex clinical environments such as Radiation Oncology departments. Its light-weight, vent-pipe-free design opens new siting possibilities - whether in basements, bunkers, or higher floors - while also lowering cost and energy use through helium-free [2] operation and PowerSave+ efficiency.

Bacteria and algae represent two fundamental groups of organisms in ecosystems, each with distinct physiological characteristics and specific ecological functions. Through the establishment of a symbiotic relationship, these organisms combine their strengths to form a powerful “biological alliance,” where both contribute essential roles. Algae are able to absorb nutrients and HMs from wastewater and produce oxygen via photosynthesis (Eq. 1), offering support for the metabolism of aerobic bacteria12. Meanwhile, bacteria undertake the task of degrading organic matter and releasing substances like inorganic carbon (Eq. 2), which contributes to the growth of algae19. This intricate biological interaction leads to the establishment of a highly synchronized symbiotic system, referred to as the ABSS. However, the symbiotic relationship between bacteria and algae is not stable and is susceptible to prevailing abiotic factors. Some studies have found that the symbiotic relationship between algae and bacteria depends on temperature and nutrient utilization22. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the symbiotic relationship between bacteria and algae is crucial for ABSS.

Symbiotic relationship between bacteria and algae

According to the different interactions in ABSS, the symbiotic relationships between bacteria and algae are mainly divided into mutualism, commensalism, and parasitic19. Figure 2 depicts the symbiotic relationship between bacteria and algae and its characteristics.

Mutualistic symbiosis refers to an ecological process in which two species benefit from each other, typically through the exchange of metabolic products. One of the most common forms of mutualism is the production of oxygen by algae through photosynthesis, which serves as an electron acceptor for bacteria degrading organic matter23. In turn, bacteria release CO2 and other compounds, supporting the photosynthetic autotrophic growth of algae. Additionally, mutualistic relationships can involve the complementary exchange of essential nutrients between algae and bacteria, helping each overcome limitations in key trace elements, thereby promoting their growth and reproduction. For example, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae can mutually metabolize and exchange available nitrogen and carbon sources24. Research by Coope et al. 25 demonstrated that the bacterium Dinoroseobacter shibae provides vitamin B12 to promote the growth of the green algae Ostreococcus tauri, while the algae reciprocate by supplying fixed carbon. Also, Rawat et al. 26 reported that bacteria release siderophores to help microalgae overcome iron uptake limitations, while the microalgae release amino acids and other organic compounds to support bacterial growth.

In a commensalism relationship, only one species benefits, while the other neither benefits nor suffers23. As a result, there are two possible scenarios of commensalism between bacteria and algae. One scenario is when bacteria benefit, such as when microalgae release organic carbon (OC) to promote bacterial growth, without receiving any return27. The other scenario is when algae benefit, for example, some bacteria provide vitamin B12 to facilitate the growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, while these bacteria cannot utilize the fixed carbon released by the algae28. Chen et al. 18 also reported that bacteria can secrete the signaling molecule indoleacetic acid (IAA) to promote the growth of microalgae, which is not reciprocated by the bacteria.

Parasitism benefits one species while harming the other. Many bacteria produce toxins that inhibit algal growth or kill algae by disrupting cell wall synthesis and blocking the respiratory chain29. For example, Bacillus velezensis V4 can release bacteriocins to lyse cells of Chlorella and Scenedesmus sp30. Similarly, algae can produce microcystins that inhibit or poison bacteria31. Frazzini et al. 32 reported that extracts from Chlorella can inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli O138. Additionally, there exists another form of parasitism that creates competition for nutrients or oxygen33. This can result in the growth rate of a particular species being hindered and eventually surpassed by its competitors after several generations.

In summary, bacteria and algae form the ABSS through various symbiotic relationships. From the mutually beneficial and win-win collaborative symbiosis to the parasitic relationship with a biased interest, these ecological associations constitute the core mechanism of the ABSS for treating HM-containing wastewater. During the treatment of HM-containing wastewater, in addition to the crucial carbon-oxygen exchange between bacteria and algae, the two also form a deep symbiotic relationship through nutrient conversion. Bacteria decompose complex nutrients into small molecular forms that are more easily utilized by algae, enabling the rapid growth of biomass, thus enhancing the purification efficiency of the ABSS for HMs. Organic substances such as polysaccharides and amino acids secreted by algae can serve as carbon sources and nutrient factors for the growth of bacteria. This symbiotic effect endows the ABSS with excellent environmental tolerance, enabling it to exhibit remarkable advantages in treating high-concentration HM-containing wastewater. However, the symbiotic relationship between bacteria and algae is dynamic and highly susceptible to environmental factors like temperature and light, which can in turn affect the performance of ABSS.

Mechanisms of ABSS in HM-containing wastewater treatment

In treating HM-containing wastewater using ABSS, not only do the individual mechanisms of algae and bacteria come into play, but also their synergistic interactions, and ABSS activates specific treatment mechanisms designed for different HMs.

Mechanisms of algae in HM-containing wastewater treatment

Many studies have shown that algae exhibit a high degree of tolerance and affinity for HMs, endowing them with the ability to remove HMs (Table 1). Sargassum dentifolium efficiently removes Cr(VI) through ion exchange of cell-surface carboxyl groups and complexation of cell-surface hydroxyl groups with Cr(VI). At the optimal conditions of pH 7.0 and 50 °C, 99.68% of 100 mg/L Cr(VI) can be removed by its dry matter within 12 h9. Gracilariacorticata conducts biosorption of cobalt using cell-surface carboxylate and carboxyl groups, attaining an 87.8% removal efficiency of 50 mg/L cobalt within 60 min at pH 5 and 29.85 °C34. Within 3 days at pH 7 and 30 °C, Chlorella vulgaris removes 6 mg/L Zn (II) via biosorption and bioaccumulation, attaining a removal rate of 99%35. Due to the abundant functional groups on their cell surfaces, these algae exhibit a strong biosorption capacity for HMs; however, as the biosorption rate of living algal cells is relatively slow, they are widely processed and utilized as biosorbents. Differing from dead algal cells, living algal cells are capable of removing HMs not only via biosorption but also through bioaccumulation.

The biosorption process depends largely on the composition of the algal cell wall. Algal cell walls contain calcium, magnesium, and sodium ions that can exchange with HM ions. Additionally, the cell walls feature negatively charged functional groups, such as amino and carboxyl groups, which provide numerous binding sites for HM ion adsorption36. These functional groups display specific affinities for different HMs. The nitrogen atom in the amino group has a lone pair of electrons and can form an amino cation upon protonation. This allows for effective adsorption of hexavalent chromium through coordination and electrostatic attraction37. In contrast, the sulfur atom in the thiol group can form extremely stable coordination bonds with Hg(II). This also enables simultaneous biosorption through multiple functional groups.

Part of the HMs that have been biosorbed enters the bioaccumulation process. After entering the algal cytoplasm via transporter proteins (e.g., Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Proteins (NRAMP) and Fe-Transporter (FTR) families), HMs bind to phytochelatins (PCs) or metallothioneins (MTs) to form complexes38. With the help of glutathione synthetase (GSH), PC formation starts with -Glu-Cys- binding initiation, which binds HM ions via sulfhydryl groups39. This binding reduces the toxicity of HM ions and promotes their intracellular transport and storage. Additionally, algae utilize enzymatic mechanisms to carry out oxidation and reduction processes, transforming toxic HMs into less harmful or non-toxic forms. These intracellular pathways may achieve compartmentalized storage of HM ions.

Mechanisms of bacteria in HM-containing wastewater treatment

Many bacteria can adapt to environments containing HMs and remove them. Table 2 summarizes the removal effects of most bacterial strains on HMs reported previously. Thermophilic B. cereus SO-16 can achieve 100% removal of 5 mg/L Mn(II) through biosorption and bioaccumulation under the conditions of 16 h, pH 7, and 60 °C40. Pseudomonas cremoricolorata first transports Hg(II) into the cell with the help of merT and merC proteins, and then the merA reductase reduces Hg(II)41. It reaches an 87% removal rate within 24 h at pH 8 and a temperature of 30 °C. Bacillus xiamenensis PbRPSD202 removes 99.19% of 100 mg/L Pb(II) through biosorption, bioaccumulation, and bioprecipitation at pH 6 and a temperature of 35 °C42. Most of these bacteria can remove HMs within a relatively short period of time and possess a rich enzyme system, which enables them to precisely regulate the process of HM removal. The high reproduction rate and environmental adaptability of bacteria enable them to rapidly colonize diverse environments, and through the synergistic actions of biosorption, bioaccumulation, and bioprecipitation, they can further enhance the efficiency of HM removal43,44.

The biosorption exhibited by bacteria is primarily attributed to the peptidoglycan in their cell walls, which is a complex structure composed of linear chains of sugars and peptide chains. The sugar chain consists of the disaccharides N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylglucuronic acid linked by β1-3 or β1-4 glycosidic bonds. Gram-positive bacteria possess cell walls with multiple layers of peptidoglycan and phospholipid, while Gram-negative bacteria have cell walls containing merely a single layer of peptidoglycan. This structural difference in the cell wall results in Gram-positive bacteria being able to adsorb more HM ions than Gram-negative bacteria40. Biosorption of HMs by bacteria can be classified into physical adsorption, ion exchange, and complexation, which are the mechanisms based on the composition of the cell wall. These mechanisms involve interactions with HMs through van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, ion exchange, and the binding of functional groups on the cell wall to form stable complexes. The biosorption of HMs by bacteria may result from these mechanisms acting independently or in combination. Lactobacillus plantarum MF042018 adsorbs cadmium and lead through physical adsorption and complexation44.

The bioaccumulation of bacteria begins with the transmembrane transport of HM ions through transport proteins such as α-helical proteins and β-barrel proteins. Bacteria such as Cornebacterium and Pseudomonas can passively transport arsenic and mercury through α-helical proteins45. In addition, there are transporter proteins that can use ATP hydrolysis to release energy to transport HM ions, such as ABC transport proteins. After entering the bacterial cell, HMs are accumulated in various means, including reduction, methylation, metal chelator production, and compartmentalization. HMs can be methylated via the S-adenosylmethionine, methylcobalamin, and N-methyltetrahydrofolate pathways46. HMs can bind to chelators like metallothionein, ferritin, and glutathione, with all these binding modalities converting HM from highly toxic substances into less toxic products.

Bioprecipitation is a metabolism-dependent process, primarily involving reduction and the formation of sulfides and phosphates. Many anaerobic or partially anaerobic bacteria utilize enzymes or electrons to reduce HMs and form precipitates. For instance, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 reduces U(VI) to produce a black U(IV) carbonate precipitate47. Sulfate-reducing bacteria convert sulfate to sulfide, which then reacts with HMs to form insoluble metal sulfide precipitates. Phosphatase-producing bacteria convert organic phosphates into inorganic forms, which combine with HMs to form phosphate precipitates.

Synergistic effects of ABSS in HM-containing wastewater treatment

In ABSS, bacteria and algae are interconnected through extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which enable cooperative interactions such as material exchange and energy transfer. Consequently, the mechanisms underlying HM-containing wastewater treatment in ABSS are intricate and multifaceted. As depicted in Fig. 3, involving both the individual removal mechanisms of single algae or bacteria towards HM and the synergistic effect between them, the removal mechanism of HM by ABSS shows that their synergistic removal effect on HM often occurs in EPS.

During the biosorption of HMs in ABSS, biosorption occurs on both microbial cell surfaces and within the EPS48. Composed primarily of proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids, EPS possess functional groups similar to those of cell walls, providing binding sites for HM adsorption. This process involves ion exchange and complexation, while the interaction of phosphate, carbonate, and sulfate ions with HM ions in EPS can lead to HM removal via precipitation.

The biosorption occurring on the microbial surface and within the EPS often interact, thereby boosting the overall biosorption capacity of ABSS48. EPS secreted by bacteria can, to some extent, mitigate the inhibitory effects of HMs on algae and increase the specific surface area of algal cells, thus expanding the number of available adsorption sites49. Meanwhile, the EPS secreted by algae also contribute to promoting bacterial growth. The secretion of these EPS collectively enhances the adsorption capacity of microorganisms for HMs in ABSS. Furthermore, the close cooperation between bacteria and algae in ABSS may enhance nutrient availability, thus promoting the growth of algae50. This leads to an increase in the production of EPS, which enhances the effectiveness of the algal biosorption mechanism and ultimately improves the overall adsorption capacity of the ABSS. The ABSS can also create microenvironments conducive to surface complexation, further enhancing the chelation of HM ions. All these effects make the ABSS show excellent biosorption capacity.

ABSS not only capitalizes on the inherent accumulation mechanisms of algae and bacteria but also further bolsters the overall bioaccumulation capacity of the system via siderophores or extracellular polysaccharides generated by specific bacteria. Siderophores are molecules that bind to HM ions and help them to cross the cell membrane, which enhances the accumulation of HM ions by algal cells26. Extracellular polysaccharides promote the accumulation of HM ions in cells by forming a matrix that effectively traps them and enhances cellular uptake51. Moreover, bacteria within the ABSS are capable of generating extracellular enzymes. These enzymes can efficiently facilitate the dissolution and transformation of HM ions, thereby rendering these HM more readily accumulated by cells.

Regulatory mechanisms of influencing factors

The main influencing factors of the ABSS are light intensity, pH, temperature, carbon sources, and HM concentration. Deeply analyzing the influencing factors enables the clarification of the interaction patterns and intrinsic operational rules during the treatment of HM-containing wastewater by ABSS.

Light intensity

In ABSS, photosynthetic algae rely heavily on light intensity for metabolism, generating ATP and NADPH in the light reaction phase, while most non-photoautotrophic bacteria can not directly use light energy. The growth rate of algae increases with light intensity within a certain range, reaching its maximum at the light saturation point, beyond which growth is limited21. At this point, the oxygen production through photosynthesis of algae reaches its optimal state, which can significantly boost the activity of aerobic bacteria, enabling the ABSS to achieve its maximum HM removal capacity.

pH

pH influences both the surface charge of microbial cells and the physicochemical state of HM ions52. At low pH, the microbial surface carries a positive charge, which electrostatically repels HM cations, hindering their adsorption53. As the pH increases, the deprotonation of negatively charged functional groups on the microbial surface exposes active sites, enhancing the adsorption of HMs. This pH increase also promotes the activity of most microbial enzymes, thereby boosting the HM removal mechanisms. However, at high pH, the formation of hydroxides competes with electrostatic interactions between microorganisms and HM anions, leading to a reduced adsorption capacity.

HM concentrations

The increase in the concentration gradient of HMs can enhance the driving force between the liquid phase and microorganisms, thereby surmounting the mass transfer resistance. But after reaching a certain concentration, the removal of HMs by ABSS stops increasing, as further increases in HM concentration saturate the adsorption sites on the microbial surface, preventing any further enhancement of adsorption capacity. Meanwhile, the higher the concentration of HMs, the greater the damage to microorganisms.

Temperature

Temperature variably affects HM-containing wastewater treatment in ABSS. Firstly, changes in temperature can change the growth rate and enzyme activity of bacteria and algae, which has a direct effect on the performance of ABSS54. Secondly, the temperature can affect the stability and solubility of HMs, further influencing the removal effect of HMs by ABSS. Finally, temperature changes regulate biosorption’s thermal effects, shifting the adsorption equilibrium position.

Carbon sources

Concentration and type of carbon source influence microbial metabolism and proliferation, which is critical for treating HM-containing wastewater by ABSS. Either too high or too low a concentration of carbon sources can limit the removal of HMs in this system, as both bacterial and algal life activities depend on carbon sources. Furthermore, the type of carbon source utilized also affects the HM removal capacity of ABSS. Algae absorb inorganic or simple organic carbon sources for photosynthesis, while bacteria utilize complex organic carbon sources for metabolic activities.

Algae/bacteria ratios

Algae/bacteria ratios directly affect the synergistic effect between the two and further influence the removal capacity of ABSS for HMs55. An excessively high inoculation ratio will lead to competition for resources such as nutrients and living space, resulting in oxygen deficiency or nutritional imbalance. Meanwhile, an excessively high inoculation ratio will obstruct the light radiation received by individual algae, limiting the photosynthetic efficiency of algae. An excessively low inoculation ratio prevents sufficient contact between bacteria and algae, leading to insufficient signal exchange, thus restricting the symbiotic effect. Therefore, the optimal ratio of algae to bacteria can balance resource competition and the symbiotic effect, thereby enhancing the removal efficiency of HMs by the ABSS.

Differences in treatment mechanisms for varying HMs

ABSS demonstrates diversified HM removal mechanisms that are highly contingent upon the species of HMs. Marked discrepancies exist in the removal processes of Cr(VI), Cd(II), and Pb(II), encompassing distinctive extracellular and intracellular interactions, as well as variations in transporter-mediated uptake (Fig. 4).

The extracellular removal mechanisms of ABSS for different HMs vary

Positively charged Cd(II) and Pb(II) undergo electrostatic attraction and complexation with hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the ABSS surface56,57. Pb(II) and Cr(VI) participate in ion-exchange reactions with sodium and magnesium ions on the ABSS surface56,58. Under acidic conditions, protonated amino groups on ABSS bind to negatively charged Cr(VI) via electrostatic attraction. Moreover, the strong oxidizing Cr(VI) is readily reduced to Cr(III) extracellularly59. Subsequently, Cr(III), Cd(II), and Pb(II) combine with anions to form precipitates, facilitating their removal.

Significant disparities exist in the transport proteins employed by different HMs

Cr(VI), owing to its structural similarity to sulfate anions, enters cells via the sulfate transporter protein SULTR260. For the cellular uptake of Cd(II), a diverse array of transporters, such as IRT1, NRAMP1, CrMTP4, and ABC transporters, are utilized, collectively mediating its entry into the cell61,62. As for Pb(II), transmembrane transport is predominantly mediated by the PbrT and PbrA transporter proteins56,63.

The intracellular mechanisms of different HMs showed significant differences

Upon entry into the cell, Cr (VI) undergoes various metabolic pathways: some of it is reduced to Cr (III) by chromate reductase, cytosolic thiols, or GSH; some of it is bound to the Alr0975 protein in the PC or chelated with GSH; and some of it is immobilized in the membrane by binding to the LCI1 channel of the membrane proteins or through ion-exchange with the membrane of the vesicle-like organisms60,64.

Upon entering cells, Cd(II) preferentially reacts with sulfur ligands. With the assistance of thioredoxin A (TrxA) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), cysteine desulfurization generates reactive sulfur species that precipitate as CdS with Cd(II)65. Cysteine’s sulfhydryl groups also form thiol salts with Cd(II) for excretion. Iron-sulfur clusters (iscS) supply sulfur for Cd(II) binding66. Phosphate forms compartmentalized complexes with Cd(II), while flavonoids chelate it, reducing its toxicity62.

After entering cells, Pb(II) is removed primarily through precipitation and chelation. Phosphatase PbrB hydrolyzes organophosphorus compounds, releasing inorganic phosphate that forms insoluble lead phosphate with Pb(II)63. Meanwhile, phytochelatins, metallothioneins bmtA and smtAB chelate Pb(II) for intracellular sequestration67. Iron carriers from non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) or polyketide synthases (PKS) further bind Pb(II), preventing its entry and reducing free ion concentration68.

Treatment process of ABSS

In practical applications, to optimize HM-containing wastewater treatment, an appropriate ABSS treatment process should be chosen based on factors such as wastewater characteristics and effluent standards. Depending on the growth states of microorganisms, ABSS can be categorized into suspended growth and attached growth processes19, as illustrated in Fig. 5. These processes for treating wastewater containing HMs have different reaction conditions and treatment effects respectively (Table 3).

Suspended growth process

In suspended growth processes, bacteria and algae remain in a suspended state, typically involving both open and closed bioreactors. The high-rate algal pond (HRAP) is currently the most commonly used open bioreactor69. and its brief process and actual diagram are shown in Fig. 5a. HRAP is a complex ecosystem constructed on the basis of traditional biologically stabilized ponds by adding algae and bacteria, designed as a channel for raceway ponds. Algae in HRAP produce abundant dissolved oxygen, which both promotes organic matter degradation by aerobic bacteria and serves as aeration. So HRAP is much easier to operate, and its energy and equipment costs are much lower than traditional treatment processes70. However, it is difficult to separate the biomass in HRAP, and an additional harvesting device needs to be connected after its treatment71. Besides, HRAP is easily limited by environmental factors, including temperature fluctuation, heterotrophic contamination, and low light utilization, etc. Tangahu et al. 20 showed that the chromium removal efficacy of the ABSS operated in HRAP is susceptible to pH, temperature, and agitation speed.

Closed bioreactors can rigorously control and monitor cultivation conditions, significantly increasing microbial concentrations. This feature not only allows them to overcome the sensitivity of open bioreactors to external environmental influences but also far surpasses open bioreactors in terms of treatment efficiency and biomass productivity72. Photobioreactor (PBR) is a typical closed bioreactor that provides controlled and suitable environmental conditions such as light, nutrients, and temperature73. Common photobioreactors are flat-panel and stirred-tank reactors as shown in Fig. 5b. The flat-plate PBR features a large illuminated surface area, with its entire plane accessible to light irradiation. This design results in high light utilization and low mechanical requirements for flat-plate PBRs. However, the flat-panel PBR also has some problems, such as a large footprint, high construction cost, and light attenuation caused by internal organisms74. The stirred-tank PBR is equipped with stirring devices and internal or external lighting systems, creating a highly controllable mixing environment for microorganisms. This design features excellent heat and mass transfer properties, but there are significant variations in local shear forces75. Muñoz et al. 76 indicated that the ABSS achieved a maximum adsorption of 8.5 ± 0.4 mg/g for copper in a stirred tank PBR.

Attached growth processes

Compared with the suspended growth process, the attached growth process has better wastewater treatment, higher contaminant tolerance, higher biomass productivity, and easier biomass harvesting77. In attached growth processes, algae and bacteria adhere to carriers with rough surfaces or porous structures for growth, primarily including hybrid biofilm (HB) photobioreactors and algal turf scrubbers (ATS). The HB photobioreactor is constructed by the algal-bacterial biofilm formed on the carrier (Fig. 5c). The HB photobioreactor exhibits strong shock load resistance, superior contaminant removal efficiency, and low energy consumption, offering enhanced nutrient removal and biomass recycling capabilities compared to traditional biofilm reactors78. Orandi et al. 79 used a similar hybrid biological membrane photoreactor, achieving a removal rate of 50% for both copper and nickel from synthetic acidic mine wastewater. Similarly, Zhao et al. 80 employed a comparable hybrid membrane photoreactor to remove all chromium and nickel from sludge supernatant, along with 80% of total phosphorus and 87% of total nitrogen, achieving a biomass production rate of 7.0 g/m²/d within 1.3 days.

ATS system employs solid substrates within shallow flow channels to provide an optimized environment for the growth and harvesting of mixed-community biofilms, primarily composed of algae and bacteria (Fig. 5d). This system effectively removes dissolved pollutants and collects biomass while leveraging the synergistic effects of periphytic plants to improve water quality69. Compared to other processes, the ATS technology, which involves periodic scraping and collection of algal biofilms into designated containers, offers significant advantages in biomass harvesting81. It not only greatly enhances the convenience and efficiency of biomass recovery but also features low energy consumption and construction costs82. Furthermore, more frequent harvesting operations with ATS can substantially increase biomass yield. Sutherland et al.83 observed that weekly harvesting increased denitrification and biomass productivity by about 60% compared to biweekly harvesting and strip harvesting.

As illustrated in Fig. 5e, the HB photobioreactor achieves superior HM removal while simultaneously harvesting the highest biomass in a single operation. Operated under highly controlled conditions, HB photobioreactors optimize both algal growth and pollutant removal more effectively than ATS. Additionally, their attached-growth biofilm design enhances the efficiency and convenience of biomass harvesting compared to HRAP and PBR systems.

Other emerging processes

The combination of ABSS with other processes or technologies can obviously improve the performance of wastewater treatment. The membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) is a wastewater treatment technology that integrates biofilm processes with membrane separation. When combined with ABSS, the resulting membrane aerated algal-bacterial biofilm reactor (MABAR) considerably enhances the removal efficiency of organic matter and nutrients84. In addition, MABAR is energy-efficient and can effectively address the challenges of high aeration requirements and low nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates85.

The sequential batch ABSS integrates the characteristics of the sequential batch reactor (SBR) with algal growth systems (AGS). This reactor effectively addresses challenges such as sludge bulking, low biomass concentrations, and the simultaneous removal of both nitrogen and phosphorus86. By efficiently adjusting processes such as nitrification, phosphorus removal, and carbon compound elimination, it achieves high water quality within short aeration periods while reducing operating costs87. Additionally, this reactor oxygenates, averts sludge sedimentation via thorough mixing and aeration, and efficiently eliminates diverse pollutants. Wang et al. 88 demonstrated that the sequential batch ABSS removed over 80% of Cd(II).

Algal-bacterial electrochemical systems integrate microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with ABSS, addressing inherent limitations of MFCs, such as high energy consumption. In these systems, algal photosynthesis supplies oxygen to the cathode while also serving as an electron acceptor and supporting the growth of anodic bacteria89. This integration reduces energy consumption, enhances energy cycling within the system, and enables net positive energy recovery.

Combining advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) with ABSS can effectively remove persistent contaminants that are difficult to degrade. During the operation of the process, AOPs can convert recalcitrant compounds into intermediates that can be mineralized by ABSS. Therefore, this process not only reduces the toxicity of incomplete oxidation products that may arise from the standalone application of AOPs but also enhances the overall decontamination effectiveness. Tripathy and Kumar90 combined microwave oxidation technology and columnar PBR to treat diluted leachate, achieving a total iron removal rate of 86–95% and a Zn(II) removal rate of 28%.

As shown in Fig. 6a, light intensity, pH, temperature, nutrients, HM concentration, and the inoculation ratio of algae and bacteria are the key parameters for the treatment of HM-containing wastewater by ABSS. By analyzing the influence of these parameters on the treatment effect, the operating conditions of the system can be optimized, thereby enhancing the removal efficiency of HMs. The influence of key parameters on the removal efficiency of HMs is summarized in Table 4 for reference.

Light intensity

The ABSS exhibits the strongest treatment capacity for HM-containing wastewater at this light saturation point (Fig. 6b), Figure 6b summarizes the light saturation points of some algae, and it is found that the light saturation points of most algae are within the range of 60–300 μmol/m2/s. Since algae play an important role in the ABSS, it is reasonable to infer that the optimal light intensity for most ABSSs also falls within this range. Tangahu et al. 20 revealed that the removal of Cr(VI) by ABSS consisting of Azotobacter S8 and Chlorella vulgaris could be up to 18.68% at light intensities ranging from 102 to119μmol/m2/s. The ABSS composed of Chlorella vulgaris and Enterobacter sp. MN17 also achieved a maximum removal rate of 79% for Cr(VI) within the range of 100–120 μmol/m2/s91.

pH

The optimal pH range for algal growth is between 7.0–9.0 and for bacterial growth is between 6.5–8.5, while the ABSS shows a different optimal pH range. Figure 6c shows that the optimum pH of ABSS in treating HM-containing wastewater is neutral to acidic. At pH 7, the ABSS composed of C. sorokiniana 211/8k and R. basilensis achieved a maximum removal of 79% of 20 mg/L Cu(II)76. Yang et al. 59 discovered that ABSS consisting of algal-bacterial granular sludge reached the highest adsorption of Cr to 0.9 mg/g at pH = 6. Similarly, Wang et al. 63 used fresh algal-bacterial aerobic granular sludge to achieve a maximum adsorption of 12.30 ± 0.39 mg/g of Pb(II) at pH = 6.

HM concentrations and types

As illustrated in Fig. 6d, while the amount of HMs removed by ABSS increases with the rise in the HM initial concentration, the removal efficiency of HMs by ABSS decreases accordingly. Muñoz et al. 76 observed that the ABSS of C. sorokiniana and R. basilensis increased its biosorption capacity of Cu(II) as the concentration of Cu(II) in solution increased. The maximum biosorption capacity of the system was 8.5 ± 0.4 mg/g when the initial Cu(II) concentration was 20 mg/L. Furthermore, the symbiotic system shows varying removal efficiency for different HMs (Fig. 6d). The ABSS consisting of Scenedesmus almeriensis and an activated sludge studied by Antolín et al. 92 was found to achieve 78% and 96% removal of Cu(II) and Zn(II) at the same concentration, respectively.

Temperature

The suitable temperature is necessary for ABSS to show the best performance. The ABSS consisting of Chlorella vulgaris and Aspergillus niger exhibites the highest biological activity, the largest biomass, and the highest adsorption efficiency at 25 °C93. The optimum temperature of the ABSS for HM-containing wastewater treatment is in the range of 23–30 °C (Fig. 6e). Among them, most of the ABSS have an optimum temperature at 25 °C and shows the best removal of HMs. Tangahu et al. 20 observed that the ABSS attained the highest removal of chromium of 18.68% in the range of 25–27 °C.

Carbon sources

The ABSS can show the highest removal rate only when the optimal carbon source is utilized for HM-containing wastewater treatment (Fig. 6f). The ABSS using fructose as a carbon source shows better Cr(VI) removal effectiveness than when using glucose and sucrose59. The ABSS composed of Scenedesmus almeriensis and the activated sludge removed 96% of Zn(II) when UTEA was used as the carbon source92. Apart from carbon sources, nitrogen and phosphorus sources also influence treatment of HM-containing wastewater by ABSS16.

Algae species

Algae are crucial for HM-containing wastewater treatment in ABSS. Common algae species used for HM adsorption include Chlorophyta (green algae), Phaeophyta (brown algae), Rhodophyta (red algae), and Cyanophyta (cyanobacteria) (Fig. 7). These algae vary in cell wall composition, structure, and metabolites, resulting in significant differences in their capacity for HM removal. As shown in Fig. 6g, brown algae are more prominent in the removal of HMs. This result is similar to that of Romera et al. 94, who found that among other red and green algae, the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum had the best adsorption capacity for HMs, which was twice as high as that of the other algae in the study. Chandrashekharaiah et al. 95 reported the differences in the removal rates of Pb(II) by Scenedesmus acutus and Chlorella pyrenoidosa in the symbiotic system, which were 52.2% and 32.2% respectively.

Algae/bacteria ratios

There are significant differences between algae and bacteria in terms of physiological characteristics and pollutant removal ability, resulting in different optimal ratios for different types of wastewater. The ABSS composed of Chlorella vulgaris-BH1 and Exiguobacterium profundum-BH2 achieved the highest removal rate of 78.7% for 100 ppm of Cu(II) when the inoculation ratio was 3:3, and reached the highest removal rate of 80.0% for 100 ppm of Ni at an inoculation ratio of 3:296. The ABSS composed of Chlorella salina and Bacillus subtilis showed a maximum removal rate of 51.66% for 1 mg/L of Cd(II) under an inoculation ratio of 1:455. This is because a higher proportion of Bacillus subtilis can promote the accumulation and detoxification of Cd(II) by the ABSS.

Others

The selection of appropriate bacterial species in ABSS is crucial, as it can optimize the symbiotic relationship and improve the efficiency of HM-containing wastewater treatment. Ri et al. 57 compared the removal effects of lead by four symbiotic systems respectively composed of the cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya sp. XZ1 and four different heterotrophic bacterial strains. It was found that the symbiotic system composed of Leptolyngbya sp. XZ1 and Bacillus sp. S1 not only had a high removal rate of lead up to 71.8%, but also exhibited the largest biomass. In addition, salinity can also affect the treatment effect of ABSS on HM-containing wastewater. Yang et al. 59 found that the removal of Cr (VI) by ABSS decreased drastically when NaCl was increased to 5 mg/L. Meng et al. 97 demonstrated that high salinity is conducive to the formation of a favorable symbiotic relationship in the ABSS composed of Halomonas and Nitzschia, achieving rapid biomass growth and a relatively high removal efficiency of nutrients.

Application of ABSS to HM-containing wastewater from different industries

Industrial emissions, mining activities, agricultural practices, and urban discharges can all generate HM-containing wastewater, which poses significant risks to human health and the ecological environment. As an emerging bioremediation technology, the ABSS offers an environmentally friendly and sustainable solution for effectively removing HMs from wastewater. Table 5 shows the treatment effect of ABSS on HM-containing wastewater from different industries.

Treatment of mine wastewater

HMs in mine wastewater primarily result from the mining and processing of ore, where sulfide minerals like pyrite react with water and oxygen to produce sulfuric acid, leading to the formation of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)98,99. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) utilize sulfate as an electron acceptor, reducing it to sulfide in anoxic conditions. These sulfides react with HMs to form insoluble metal sulfides, removing HMs from AMD100. However, the acidic environment, high HM concentrations, and limited carbon sources in AMD can hinder SRB growth and activity, leading to elevated chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the treated effluent.

The integration of SRB and algae in ABSS enhances AMD treatment by protecting SRB and improving efficiency. Algal photosynthesis absorbs CO2, reducing water acidity and promoting HM precipitation, while producing organic carbon (DOC) to support SRB. Moreover, EPS produced by algae helps protect SRB in AMD, while both algae and EPS possess the ability to adsorb HMs. Therefore, ABSS presents significant potential for AMD treatment applications. Sahoo et al. 100 discovered that the immobilized SRB-Chlorella symbiosis system could remove more than 95–99% of HMs in AMD. Li et al. 101 also observed that the immobilized SRB-Chlorella symbiosis system could remove 72.4–74.4% of sulfate and more than 91.7% of Cu(II) from AMD. Mining wastewater typically contains a variety of HMs, yet existing ABSS does not provide optimal removal efficacy for all types of HMs.

Treatment of animal agriculture wastewater

Animal agriculture wastewater, primarily originating from animal excreta, feed residues, and wash water, is characterized by high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen, HMs, and organic compounds, posing significant environmental risks. Conventional aquaculture wastewater treatment methods are energy-intensive and inefficient in nutrient utilization, leading to the underuse of biodegradable organic matter and nutrients in animal agriculture wastewater. Based on these concerns, the ABSS are gradually being considered as a cost-effective alternative to traditional treatment technologies for animal agriculture wastewater.

The ABSS can absorb nutrients to produce biomass while removing HMs from animal agriculture wastewater, making resource recycling possible. García et al. 102 discovered that ABSS for treating piggery wastewater achieved 94% total carbon, 100% total phosphorus, and 83% zinc removal, and increased biomass to 1328 mg TSS/L. In another of his studies, it was also observed that ABSS could remove 86%, 82%, 90%, and 98% of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and zinc from piggery wastewater, respectively, and achieved a biomass productivity of 7.8 ± 0.3 g/m²/d103. In addition, to enhance the cost-effectiveness of ABSS for treating animal agriculture wastewater, some researchers introduced photosynthetic bacteria into ABSS and obtained 87% removal of total nitrogen, 91% removal of total phosphorus, 98% removal of zinc, and biomass productivity of up to 18.4 g/m²/d for the piggery wastewater104. Along with HMs, animal agriculture wastewater contains pollutants such as antibiotics. However, the research on removing these two contaminants effectively with ABSS is insufficient.

Treatment of municipal wastewater

Municipal wastewater, originating from domestic, commercial, and service effluents, can increase HM levels and is typically treated in wastewater treatment plants before being discharged to meet regulatory standards. Most municipal wastewater treatment plants apply physico-chemical methods like UV, ozone, and chlorine for wastewater disinfection. These disinfection techniques pose risks of generating disinfection by-products, which may have adverse effects on human health105. Additionally, aeration in municipal wastewater treatment plants accounts for 50% of the total energy consumption of the facility106. Therefore, municipal wastewater treatment plants especially need a wastewater treatment technology that can avoid disinfection by-products and save energy.

ABSS generates oxygen, minimizing aeration requirements and energy consumption, while reducing the need for additional chlorination and effectively eliminating pathogens. Additionally, ABSS facilitates resource recycling, offering potential economic benefits for municipal wastewater treatment plants. Kumar et al. 107 showed that an ABSS consisting of microalgae and bacteria from municipal wastewater not only removes HMs and organic contaminants in treating municipal wastewater, but also completely reduces the total bacterial and total coliform counts while achieving 1.27 g/L biomass. Abdel-Razek et al. 108 found that the ABSS removed both 88% of cadmium, 95% of nickel, and 89% of lead, and 99% of the organophosphorus pesticide malathion, when treating a mixed wastewater consisting of municipal wastewater.

Treatment of textile wastewater

The composition of textile wastewater is highly complex, consisting of various contaminants such as organic and inorganic dyes, HMs, and nutrient salts. Traditional biological methods are often inadequate in treating textile wastewater. ABSS can remove dyes, HMs, and nutrients from textile wastewater due to its remarkable integrated decontamination capacity and resistance to unfavorable environments. Certain bacteria can decompose dyes and HMs, while algae can do photosynthesis and absorb nutrients. Another situation is that bacteria release growth factors to promote algal growth, while algae achieve decolorization and purification of textile wastewater through a series of biochemical processes. These processes include the assimilation of chromophores, the adsorption of dissolved dye molecules, and the mineralization of colored organic matter. In ABSS constructed by Mubashar et al. 91, Enterobacter sp. MN17 promoted C.vulgaris growth, which enabled this system to achieve 71.5% decolorization and remove 79%, 93%, 79%, and 74% of chromium, cadmium, lead, and COD, respectively, from 5% dilution of textile wastewater. Bashir et al. 109 constructed an ABSS that achieved both 85.7% decolourisation and 81.8% COD removal, while removing 98.2% of manganese, 94% of copper, 97.7% of chromium, 91.6% of cadmium, and 92.8% of cobalt.

HM recovery from biomass

During the treatment of HM-containing wastewater, the ABSS generates substantial biomass enriched with HMs. Without proper treatment, this may lead to solid waste pollution. Although traditional methods such as incineration and landfill disposal can be used to process this biomass, they result in resource waste and pose additional environmental problems. Therefore, the recovery of HMs from biomass not only helps reduce environmental pollution but also facilitates resource recycling. The recovery of HMs from biomass is primarily carried out through chemical leaching techniques, which involve the use of chemical reagents to treat the biomass and extract HM ions.

Various chemical reagents have been developed for the recovery of HMs from biomass, including acids, bases, chelating agents, and salts, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and potassium chloride (KCl). NaOH forms metal hydroxides through its strong alkalinity, thereby releasing HMs. HCl uses an acidic environment to disrupt algal cell walls, facilitating the dissolution of HM ions for recovery. EDTA, as a chelating agent, forms stable complexes with HM ions, significantly enhancing desorption efficiency. KCl employs ion exchange to desorb metal ions from the surface of algae, making it suitable for the recovery of positively charged HM ions.

Sathvika et al. 110 demonstrated that 1.5 mol/L NaOH can recover 95% of Cr(VI) from biomass. Katsara et al. 111 employed a mixed reagent of HNO3 and H2O2 to recover Zn from algal biomass, achieving a recovery rate of 178 g/100 g. Yang et al. 52 evaluated the application of six different chemical reagents (including KCl, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, NaOH, HCl, and H2SO4) for Cr(VI) recovery from biomass, finding that H2SO4 provided the highest recovery rate of 33.5%. These reagents each have distinct characteristics, and the choice of recovery agent should be based on the type of HM and the properties of the biomass. However, the reactivation of microorganisms and the adsorption capacity for HMs after desorption have not been fully validated and require further investigation.

Sustainability of ABSS for HM-containing wastewater

The sustainability of ABSS for HM-containing wastewater is manifested in several key aspects: resource recycling, low cost and energy consumption, and contribution to carbon neutrality.

In terms of resource recycling, ABSS can recover HMs from biomass for industries such as metal refining, battery manufacturing, and electroplating. The HM-containing wastewater generated by these industries can then flow back to ABSS for treatment (Fig. 8). Meanwhile, biomass can be converted into green products like biofuels, biofertilizers, and biochar. Integrating relevant production plants downstream of ABSS can effectively reduce the overall treatment cost and achieve resource recycling.

Regarding cost and energy consumption, ABSS is light-driven and does not require chemical reagents, thus reducing the costs associated with reagent procurement and hazardous chemicals. It has a low demand for mechanical aeration, and the proportion of aeration energy consumption is much lower than that of traditional wastewater treatment plants. Aeration usually accounts for 40%-60% of the total energy demand in traditional plants, while the power consumption of ABSS is approximately 22% lower than that of the traditional activated sludge process17,70. Moreover, the symbiotic relationship between algae and bacteria improves the energy utilization efficiency. Bacteria assist algae in nutrient cycling and decomposition, reducing the energy consumption for algae to obtain nutrients.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41545-025-00475-1/MediaObjects/41545_2025_475_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-26 12:36:18.618652

The Independent After-Action Report produced by the consulting firm McChrystal Group was commissioned by county supervisors just weeks after the Eaton and Palisades fires killed more than 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes in highly dense areas of LA County.

The report released Thursday says a series of weaknesses, including “outdated policies, inconsistent practices and communications vulnerabilities,” hampered the county’s response.

Interviews with survivors and an Associated Press analysis of available data found evacuation orders for some neighborhoods of Altadena where the Eaton Fire swept through came long after houses burned down. AP reporting also showed similar delays for the Palisades Fire, although the Los Angeles Police Department initially handled evacuation management. The report sheds more light on flaws in the county alert system.

Staffing shortages

The report cites critical staffing shortages including a high number of sheriff’s deputy vacancies and an under-resourced Office of Emergency Management. In addition, first responders and incident commanders were unable to consistently share information due to unreliable cellular connectivity, inconsistent field reporting methods, and the use of various unconnected communication platforms.

“While frontline responders acted decisively and, in many cases, heroically, in the face of extraordinary conditions, the events underscored the need for clearer policies, stronger training, integrated tools, and improved public communication,” the report says.

It is not intended to investigate or assess blame, county officials said in a news release.

“This isn’t about pointing fingers. It’s about learning lessons, improving safety, and restoring public trust,” said Supervisor Kathryn Barger, whose district includes Altadena.

The Office of Emergency Management began putting together its staffing plan for predicted heavy winds Jan. 3, four days before the Palisades and Eaton fires ignited. But an experienced staffer had been sent out of town for a training event. That meant several less-knowledgeable staffers were in key positions, according to the report.

Alerting the public

During the January inferno, according to the report, this process took between 20 and 30 minutes. That’s an improvement over the old system that took between 30 and 60 minutes for the public to receive notice of an evacuation, the report said.

Still many of the county’s methods to alert the public require opting-in.

Some of the evacuation alerts required residents to click a separate link to get complete information, hindering messaging. The communication system used for alerts did not provide complete information about the fire’s progression. Power outages and cell tower issues further hindered evacuation notices and the fire was moving too fast to keep up, the report found.

Prior to the fire, the county sent out a handful of warnings about the incoming Santa Ana wind event and amplified National Weather Service messaging on social media and in news releases, but there was unofficial, stand-alone preparedness messaging provided by the county.",https://www.parriva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aaafire1.webp,N,,2025-09-26 16:13:06.213017

Leo Suter and Sofia Barclay Feel Like There’s Still So Much to Explore With Their ‘Lynley’ Characters ""Their friendship and their partnership is built on rocky foundations.""
SUTER: That’s very true.","[Editor's note: The following contains spoilers for Lynley.]

Summary

In the first season of the British crime drama 'Lynley,' clashes with class fuel the banter between Lynley and Havers as they navigate their new partnership.

The 90-minute episodes allow the complex cases to breathe and reveal messy, human backstories.

Co-stars Leo Suter and Sofia Barclay feel that there's still so much more to explore with their characters.

In the British crime drama Lynley, a retelling of Elizabeth George’s bestselling detective novels and currently streaming on BritBox, DS Barbara Havers (Sofia Barclay) is begrudgingly paired with DI Tommy Lynley (Leo Suter). The duo are seemingly mismatched, with his aristocratic upbringing making him an outsider in a working-class town and someone Havers can easily give a hard time. But as they work together on a series of complex cases, respect grows and they actually start to rely on their partnership.

During this interview with Collider, co-stars Suter and Barclay discussed exploring the class difference between Lynley and Havers, where Lynley’s detective overcoat came from, that the extra time in having 90-minute episodes allowed them to really start to dig into who the characters are, the fun of finding their banter, how their dedication can sometimes be a disadvantage, the ultra-high stakes of episode four, what they’d like to see happen next, and the fact that they feel like they’ve barely scratched the surface with these characters.

Collider: When this came your way, what did you guys find most interesting or intriguing about it? Were you aware of the novels? Had you seen the previous adaptation? Was it just something about this version of these characters that you found most appealing? What grabbed you about it?

LEO SUTER: I had not seen the series or read the books before I had auditioned. When I got the part, I read the first book and watched the first episode of the BBC series and thought, “What wonderful characters that Elizabeth George had created and Nat Parker and co brought to life. For me, there’s something uniquely British about class stuff. There are lots of police procedural detective shows, but what was going to be fun in this one was playing with that class difference between Lynley and Havers and doing that within a modern, updated, 21st century Britain in which the class dynamic is there, but it’s more nuanced and maybe more subtle and hushed. I thought this was a great opportunity to do a genre that I had not done before, leading an audience through a murder mystery, and grapple with something as rich and delicious and complex as the British class system.

Sofia, how about for you? While Lynley is battling with the issues of class, I feel like Havers battles with how hard of a time to give other people, and I truly love her for that.

SOFIA BARCLAY: I’m glad you do. I love her too. It’s funny you put it that way. Havers is in survival mode. She just needs to get by, and she’s dealing with so many things. She judges Lynley completely, before she’s met him, and then even when she has met him. She’s very judgmental of him. She is a joy to play for that exact reason. I’m glad you said that you warmed to her for that because she is very unapologetic in the way she moves through life and I think that’s just cool.

I watch a lot of British crime dramas, and I noticed, a similarity between this series and Luther, which is that like John Luther, Lynley has a great overcoat with an upturned collar. A great coat definitely feels like a requirement for British detectives.

SUTER: That’s so true. I bought that coat for me and wore it to work two days before we started filming. The director said, “Oh, what a very nice coat.” I don’t disagree. It’s a very fine tweed coat.

BARCLAY: Lynley gets the car, he gets the coat, he gets all the swag.

The 90-Minute Episodes of ‘Lynley’ Allow for Time to Really Dig Into the Personal Side of the Characters

""There is so much there that’s in their past and that’s coming into their present.""

While American crime dramas focus more on the cases and rarely have time for the lives of the characters, British crime dramas really explore the characters and their lives at home. What did you each find most interesting about your characters outside of their work? Did it feel like having 90-minute-long episodes really allowed for extra time to not just get into the cases more deeply, but to really show that work life balance and when they aren’t finding it very well?

BARCLAY: I love that question. What’s amazing about both the characters is that Steve [Thompson] did the best job of taking all that’s in the novels, over the course of the novels, and feeding it through into the show very early on. What was so delightful, when you get the pages as an actor to audition for and you read the scripts, is that there is so much there that’s in their past and that’s coming into their present, and you have the layers and backstories that they’re trying to keep hidden, but they’re spilling into their lives. As an actor, that just makes it such a joy. The minute you get that in any script, you’re like, “God, this is going to be a really fun experience to shoot.” That’s probably one of the reasons that both of us were instinctively excited by taking on the job.

SUTER: Lynley has got a complex home relationship. I have a few phone calls back home to my mother, but I never hear her voice and neither does the viewer. So, that remains a mystery to me, what she will sound like one day. That is actually relevant for Lynley because his family life is very complicated, and he’s really shunned it. His home life is actually quite sparse. He lives in this stunning property on the beachfront, but the fridge is stocked with chips and guacamole and not much else. He finds his old university sweetheart, Helen, and they try to make a go of things, but the thing with Lynley is that his job is, far and away, the most important thing, and switching off for him and finding time is difficult.

BARCLAY: It’s so fun as a viewer. As Havers to Lynley, but also as me approaching the show as a viewer, the fact that he is the son of an Earl and the fact that he is so mysterious about it and doesn’t allude to it is so felt, even though it’s not vocalized or expressed yet as much. It’s fun to watch and to see and to speculate what that could all mean.

One of the things that I really loved about the relationship between your characters is the fact that neither of them wants to work with the other, but by the end of these episodes, they earn each other’s trust and respect. What did you guys most enjoy about the arc of where that relationship between them starts and where it ends up, and is it fun to play that conflict, as it moves toward a better place for them?

BARCLAY: Oh, yeah.

SUTER: Very good fun. There’s such a nice crackle between them. They’re both very sharp. They’re intelligent people, so their insults and their digs are good quips. Havers gets Lynley with a few gags and prods that he falls for now and then, but he’s equally able to come back with some good bites. They’re good sparring partners early on. And then, through the course of the episodes, they’re put in some quite dangerous situations at times, that are quite life or death, and there’s nothing like that jeopardy to bring people together.

BARCLAY: It’s also really fun because Leo is great. He’s such a great actor and a wonderful scene partner. To be able to chart a journey where you really are at each other’s throats, it’s really fun to play those moments where they are respecting or stepping towards each other, but the footing is unsure. Finding those moments when you see the bits of connection or the bits that are almost jovial, but then don’t really go anywhere, is really fun.

SUTER: There’s something with that whole life and art thing, whereby when you’re making a show like this that’s four 90-minute episode, it takes a long time, so by the end, you’re cream knackered. Me and Sofia go through it together, so by episode three and episode four, when these characters have formed a better team and a really close bond, we were able, with a wave and a pat on the shoulder in the makeup chat, to say more than you could in a thousand words. We were going through it together.

BARCLAY: You develop a real shorthand.

SUTER: Exactly. I’m sure Sofia would agree, when you’re playing detectives, there are tons of lines to learn and mysteries to solve, so you’re there all the time.

BARCLAY: Yeah, that’s very true.

These are not people that are just pretending to like each other or who know they have to be cordial to work together. It really feels earned by the end of these four episodes because they’ve had to rely on each other for things, or they’ve surprised each other in ways that have earned each other’s respect.

SUTER: I think 90 minutes is such a good length for a murder mystery, for all the reasons you said. But for the actual meat and bones of the mystery, it allows for wonderful dead ends, red herrings, and a satisfying ending, with space in between to get into the meat of the personal relationships. That’s why I really liked, and I think viewers will really enjoy, that 90-minute length.

In ‘Lynley,’ Partners Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers Are Dedicated to Their Jobs to Their Own Detriment

""It’s really nice and really important to see the moments when [Lynley] flounders.""

There’s a moment in a case when Lynley drops his focus on work because he’s with Helen, and Havers goes to the hospital to be with her father, and their suspect ends up nearly dead. How did each of you feel about that and how that played out for your characters? Even though it could have ultimately been worse, how much do you think all of that weighs on them?

BARCLAY: That’s such a good question. I really love that they put that there. The truth of the matter is that the two of them are so dedicated to their jobs, almost to their detriment. Those things might have been avoided if either of them was maybe less devoted to their jobs and better at not over-compartmentalizing. One of the things that ends up being a touch point to their respect for each other is the fact that when either of them do “mess up,” the other person gives them a bit of grace, and I think that is so cool. In any new relationship, when someone doesn’t judge you or doesn’t come down on you when they could and gives you that human dignity moment is really cool, and it makes you respect and appreciate them. I just really like those moments because they’re really real. Even though we are setting up a pseudo-reality, those moments feel very human, and that’s quite nice and very specific.

SUTER: So much of the time, you see the brilliant Lynley, the excellent detective that’s so sharp, etc. It’s really nice and really important to see the moments when he flounders. Going for a nice meal and a bottle of wine with Helen, whilst maybe he should be doing other things, is a huge blunder. The fact that we, as an audience, see him realizing, “I’m in trouble here and I’m going to have to talk to the higher ups,” is a good moment and really rounds out the character in a human way.

Things get pretty dicey in the fourth episode, with Helen getting kidnaped and Lynley and Havers having to get her back. What was it like to shoot an episode that high stakes and intense, with one person being held captive, another person getting hit in the head with a pipe, and somebody who’s trying to kill everybody?

BARCLAY: If you ever want to shoot those scenes, you’ve got to do it with Leo Suter because he is so good at all the things to do with stunts and that are physical. He’s an ex-Viking. He can hold an axe and run through mud at the same time, whilst wearing incredibly heavy furs, and also have a fight and make it look good. It’s incredible to do any sort of work like that with someone like him. And then, it’s just really fun and really cool to do because they put mood lighting and mist, and it feels very high stakes. Most of the time, we’re in little offices talking about very naughty subjects, so it was so different. This series is so fun to shoot because it’s so varied. When we get to do stuff like that, it’s just really cool.

SUTER: The high action at the end of episode four is in a warehouse at the end of a chase scene. A car pulls in and it’s dark and there are headlights, and that was right in the same old factory complex where the cop shop was where we did all of our interviews. Early on, our director said, “Hang on a sec, this warehouse could be a great location. Maybe we could incorporate that into an episode.” And sure enough, months down the line, when we got to episode four, the warehouse became a really good set for it. It was funny because we filmed that around Christmastime and it was actually a warehouse, so it was full of Christmas hampers. While we were running around looking for the murderer, you could get a panettone and a few mince pies. That took you out of it quite quickly. I think viewers will really enjoy that Lynley and Havers get better and better as a team and become better at getting a sense of where things are rotten. Across all these episodes, there’s obviously a crime and a murder that they have to solve, and there’s a perpetrator who did it and we end up getting them, but we’re also exposing all kinds of broken families and broken relationships, in and around these worlds where the crimes have taken place. Lynley and Havers get better as a team at figuring that out in episode four. What’s more, in episode four, the world of crime overlaps into the private lives of the characters, which is really interesting. It all gets a lot more personal for Lynley, by episode four.

BARCLAY: It’s really fun for the viewers because Lynley is a character typified by his intelligence, and he’s so small and so cerebral and so measured. To watch him also let loose and let rip and have those fight scenes and do those things, it’s really satisfying. I remember watching the monitors and being like, “That’s so cool.” When you’ve gotten used to a character being one way and then there’s totally different side of them, it’s a really fun experience to watch.

Leo Suter and Sofia Barclay Feel Like There’s Still So Much to Explore With Their ‘Lynley’ Characters

""Their friendship and their partnership is built on rocky foundations.""

The original adaptation of this ran for six seasons. Would you guys like to keep playing these characters for a bit longer? Are there things that you still want to learn about your characters, including what Lynley’s mother looks like?

SUTER: Exactly. We’ve got to find that out. I think they’re such compelling characters and wherever they pop up and whatever crimes they end up solving, they’ll do it in a really interesting way. That central dynamic between them is so rich for dramatic intrigue that it would be really fun to keep exploring. What’s nice about our series is that it feels contemporary and current. There’s so much of the world that the previous iteration lived in and that the books were set in, and so much of that has changed. Yes, we’re taking the baton on from a former show, but there’s a whole different world of the UK social fabric that we can explore through the lens of these two butting but also brilliantly complementary police detectives.

BARCLAY: I also think that we’ve barely scratched the surface. There’s Lynley’s backstory and the messiness of Havers’ family life. All of it is there in [Season] 1, but there’s so much more that could be developed. With their relationship, they do build this trust together and they do go through these very high-stakes situations which force them to come together, but they do come from such different backgrounds. They live in such different worlds that it wouldn’t take a lot to test each other’s boundaries again. Their friendship and their partnership is built on rocky foundations. The more that goes on, there’s going to just be so much more to play with. It would be such a joy to be able to do that with these characters.

SUTER: It would be lovely to see our Lynley turn up at Havers’ house, and vice versa.

BARCLAY: Oh, my God, could you imagine? I didn’t even think about that.

SUTER: I agree that we’ve barely scratched the surface. To that point, it’s only at the end of episode four that Lynley and Havers both share a loss in their family life. It’s only right at the end of four 90-minute episodes that he actually says that.

How was he holding onto that the whole time?

SUTER: He’s held onto it for a long time. It’s repression, is what it is. There’s so much more to delve into.

I don’t want Havers to lose her edge, but it feels like there are plenty of people out there in the world that she can give a hard time to, even if she likes Lynley better than she did when they started together.

SUTER: That’s very true. That’s so true.

BARCLAY: Oh, one hundred percent. I feel like she likes him a lot better by the end, but she’s not done giving him a hard time. That’s definitely there for exploring.

The proposed ACS Triparty Service builds on this foundation by integrating with The Bank of New York Mellon’s (BNY) triparty infrastructure, which handles collateral management and settlement.
The service enables Agent Clearing Members—typically larger institutions acting on behalf of smaller executing firms—to submit eligible triparty repo transactions for FICC’s central clearing.
For starters, it democratizes access to central clearing for mid-tier firms that might otherwise be sidelined by high barriers to entry.
Agent Clearing Members stand to gain enhanced margin efficiency, trimming capital requirements and freeing up balance sheets for more productive uses.","In a move to fortify the U.S. Treasury market against emerging risks, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), has filed a proposed rule change with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Announced on September 23, 2025, this filing introduces the Agent Clearing (ACS) Triparty Service—an expansion of FICC‘s existing Agent Clearing Service.

Designed to streamline triparty repurchase agreement (repo) transactions, the service promises to enhance market liquidity, slash operational costs, and align with impending SEC mandates, marking a significant evolution in post-trade infrastructure.

At its core, FICC serves as the linchpin for clearing and settling fixed income securities, processing trillions in daily transactions to ensure the smooth flow of capital in global financial markets.

The proposed ACS Triparty Service builds on this foundation by integrating with The Bank of New York Mellon’s (BNY) triparty infrastructure, which handles collateral management and settlement.

This collaboration leverages BNY’s Global Collateral Platform—the world’s largest network for Treasury triparty repo settlements—to centralize and safeguard these critical trades.

The service enables Agent Clearing Members—typically larger institutions acting on behalf of smaller executing firms—to submit eligible triparty repo transactions for FICC’s central clearing.

It accommodates two execution styles: “done-with,” where the Agent Clearing Member directly engages its Executing Firm Customer, and “done-away,” involving trades between the customer and another Government Securities Division (GSD) Netting Member or their client.

By netting these positions and optimizing collateral, the platform minimizes exposures while facilitating seamless settlement.

This isn’t just a technical tweak; it seems like a response to the SEC’s expanding Treasury clearing rules, set to mandate central clearing for cash transactions in 2026 and repos in 2027.

The benefits are multifaceted and potentially far-reaching.

For starters, it democratizes access to central clearing for mid-tier firms that might otherwise be sidelined by high barriers to entry.

Agent Clearing Members stand to gain enhanced margin efficiency, trimming capital requirements and freeing up balance sheets for more productive uses.

On a macro level, the service mitigates systemic risks by curtailing liquidity drains during defaults or market stress—think fewer fire sales spiraling into broader disruptions.

As the U.S. Treasury market, valued at over $27 trillion, grapples with volatility from geopolitical tensions and interest rate shifts, such innovations could prove invaluable in maintaining stability.

Targeted primarily at Agent Clearing Members and their Executing Firm Customers, the service fills a gap for participants in the $5 trillion-plus daily triparty repo ecosystem.

Smaller executing firms, often constrained by regulatory compliance costs, can now piggyback on larger members’ clearing capabilities without building out expensive in-house systems.

This inclusivity aligns with DTCC’s mission to foster equitable market access, potentially drawing in a wave of new users as the 2027 repo mandate looms.

Implementation is ambitiously timed for December 2025, pending SEC approval and a forthcoming public comment period in the Federal Register.

The filing (SR-FICC-2025-021) outlines detailed technical specifications, ensuring compliance with existing GSD rules while introducing safeguards like automated risk monitoring.

Industry leaders are effusive in their support.

Laura Klimpel, Managing Director and Head of DTCC’s Fixed Income and Financing Solutions, emphasized the strategic foresight:

“FICC has been keenly focused on leading the industry towards a successful implementation of the SEC’s expanded U.S. Treasury clearing rules… The proposed ACS Triparty Service, along with the recently filed Collateral In Lieu offering, demonstrate FICC’s commitment to meeting the needs of our clients.”

Nate Wuerffel, BNY’s Global Head of Market Structure, highlighted the efficiency gains:

”By leveraging the scale and connectivity of BNY’s Global Collateral Platform… this new service complements our existing suite of centrally cleared repo solutions, streamlining access to central clearing and driving greater operational efficiency across the market.”

As central clearing becomes non-negotiable under SEC guidelines, services like ACS Triparty could accelerate adoption, reducing uncleared bilateral trades that amplify contagion risks—as evidenced in the 2020 Treasury market turmoil.

By boosting liquidity and resilience, it supports the Federal Reserve’s efforts to safeguard monetary policy transmission.",https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/George-Washington-Wall-Street-NYSE-Manhattan-New-York-City.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 11:22:34.352110

ID23,JED Foundation,2025-09-26 13:07:44+00:00,Trinitonian - The Student News Site of Trinity University,Healthy Minds on Trinity's dime - Trinitonian,"Maya Shamansoorian, News, Maya Shamansoorian, News",,,,,https://trinitonian.com/2025/09/26/healthy-minds-on-trinitys-dime/,"A single survey sent out on Sept. 15 could shape Trinity’s approach to student mental health for years to come.
The JED foundation is working with Trinity to compose this four-year plan based on student feedback from the Healthy Minds Survey.
The JED Campus project assesses seven different domains that contribute to mental health and applies them to programs and policies.
“A year ago, Health Services started doing mental health screenings for all visits,” Youngdahl said.
As an chair of the Academic Honor Council, Dakour is familiar with the mental health stigma against failing.","A single survey sent out on Sept. 15 could shape Trinity’s approach to student mental health for years to come. In an effort to prevent suicide and protect student emotional health, Trinity has launched JED Campus, a four-year program aimed at pinpointing and resolving issues on campus that contribute to student well-being. A task force of students and faculty is leading the initiative in an effort to work together as a community to promote mental wellness. There are many offices involved in this task force, including Student Affairs, Wellness Services, the Dean of Students and Trinity University Police Department (TUPD).

The JED foundation is working with Trinity to compose this four-year plan based on student feedback from the Healthy Minds Survey. Andrew Wells, vice president of Student Affairs, sent out the campus-wide survey via email on Sept. 15, and it will remain open to students until Oct. 13.

Phil and Donna Satow created the JED Foundation in 2000 in an effort to prevent suicide and foster mental health after their son, Jed, died from suicide. JED Campus is an offshoot of the foundation, which is a national plan to prevent suicide and promote mental wellness on college and high school campuses. It strives to prioritize mental health beyond counseling services and the classroom, employing an interdisciplinary approach to help students practice healthy habits and feel a higher sense of belonging at university. The JED Campus project assesses seven different domains that contribute to mental health and applies them to programs and policies.

Wells spearheaded the JED Campus initiative at Trinity after witnessing its success while working at Macalester College. One of JED’s seven domains is to “Reduce Barriers to Help-Seeking.” At Macalester and Trinity, Wells said that he found students weren’t utilizing counseling services because they felt like someone else needed it more than they did.

“We have students who were meeting with me because they were in crisis that might have been de-escalated if they had known and felt confident that counseling or other resources were available and appropriate to what they were experiencing,” Wells said.

Wells said that normalizing seeking help is essential, and that with the help of JED, Trinity will be able to start initiatives to encourage students to utilize these resources. He mentioned a point made by the Director of Integrated Counseling, Health and Wellness Services, Marcy Youngdahl. She said there is “no wrong door.” Alongside Kyle Gillette, associate provost for student success, Youngdahl is co-chair of the JED Campus team and she gave an example of this approach.

“A year ago, Health Services started doing mental health screenings for all visits,” Youngdahl said. “Sometimes it’s hard to recognize if you’re having physical symptoms that might be related to a mental health condition.”

Through her work in Wellness Services, Youngdahl said she has seen a call to do more. JED offers an attainable and evidence-based approach to supporting students by establishing a network of resources. Because Trinity is such a small community, faculty and staff all play a role in this network.

“They [faculty and staff] all understand the needs of the community and what their role is in helping students. So I see this as really enhancing that network and making sure that we all have the same understanding of what our role is and digging into how can we harness that power collectively,” said Youngdahl.

Genevieve Dakour, senior neuroscience major, is a student advocate for the JED task force. As an chair of the Academic Honor Council, Dakour is familiar with the mental health stigma against failing. She observed that the high expectations come at a cost to the students, and that finding better ways to support the student body is important.

“It’s easier, in my opinion, to confide in a student than it is to confide in an adult, even if it’s someone you’re close with. So I’m really hoping that we can build that relationship and get honest feedback from people,” Dakour said.

Both Wells and Youngdahl said that student feedback is important, as the responses from the Healthy Minds Survey will determine the initiatives that Trinity will implement. Allison Martin, junior biology and philosophy double-major, said that JED has the potential to make a difference on Trinity’s campus, but that it is dependent on whether students are truly being listened to.

“I do think there’s room to improve and hopefully not have those issues anymore for future students, and not fail students in the way that other people have been failed,” Martin said.

Since JED is a four-year program, the class of 2029 will experience the full effect of these programs, and will be surveyed again in their senior year. Martin believes that this long-term approach is interesting, and said that she likes that Trinity is focused on the longevity of these initiatives. Students will see the effects of JED for years to come, and in the next 17 days, they have the opportunity to shape not only the mental well-being of their class but also that of the next generation of Trinity students.",https://trinitonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/M0dzQN13RnaydXt7n3ef0LsdkPkyiAt4pGwZPFfr.png,N,,2025-09-26 12:36:25.852442

Analysts said Webull has evolved from a niche data platform into the second-largest mobile-first brokerage in the United States, with a top-rated app and integrated desktop service that cater to active retail traders.

The firm expects the company to sustain more than 25% annual revenue growth through 2027, well above current market forecasts.

“Webull has clearly capitalized, quickly growing from a niche market data platform to the #2 mobile-first brokerage in the US,” Rosenblatt wrote.

Crypto is a key part of the bull case, the analysts added, citing a friendlier U.S. regulatory climate that has revived activity in the sector.

Webull, which spun out its crypto unit in 2023 under regulatory pressure, relaunched the business this year. At the height of the last cycle, crypto trading generated about a fifth of its revenue.

Rosenblatt also highlighted overseas expansion as a growth driver, with Webull already licensed in 14 markets including Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK, Australia and Japan.

These regions have earlier-stage retail participation and less competition in active trading, the analyst said.

Brokerage said Webull shares are not cheap, which is trading at about 10 times 2026 consensus revenue, but said the multiple looks attractive against Robinhood, which trades at 25 times.

Rosenblatt forecast faster growth for Webull given its smaller base and largely fixed costs.

The case, titled Koninklijke Philips NV Vs Visage Lines Personal Care Pvt Ltd, centres on allegations of misleading advertising, trademark infringement and unfair competition. Philips claimed that the reel disparaged its flagship OneBlade trimmer by suggesting that Bombay Shaving Company’s OmniBlade offered similar or superior features at half the price.

Senior Advocate Akhil Sibal, appearing for Philips, told the court that OneBlade has long offered anti-nick protection and both face and body functions, making the “half-price” comparison misleading.

Bombay Shaving Company, represented by Advocate Shwetasree Majumdar, argued that the reel was user-generated content created during its Razorpreneur Challenge and not a formal advertisement. The company maintained that the content was within permissible marketing limits and not disparaging.

Justice Manmeet Pritam Singh Arora, however, indicated readiness to grant an interim injunction. To avoid this, Bombay Shaving Company voluntarily undertook to remove the reel from all social media platforms within 36 hours.

On September 25, 2025, the Delhi High Court recorded BSC’s commitment, addressing Philips’ immediate concerns without proceeding to a full trial. The court also issued a summons in Philips’ suit, allowing the defendants 30 days to respond.

Of course, the Brawley GTS will be available with a variety of performance and drivability upgrades.
The Luxury 4-Season UTV World There really isn’t anything like the Brawley GTS on the market.","Customer deliveries of the Vanderhall Brawley GTS have finally begun. I first reported on this two-door, four-seater, electric luxury UTV back in my coverage of SEMA 2023. It had already been in development for 2 years at that point, with production expected in early 2024.

The pricing target has stayed about the same, with the Brawley GTS starting at $49,950. Power targets have as well, with 404 horsepower and 488 pound-feet of torque on tap. But, the company fell quite short of the 200-mile range goals, with production units delivering an advertised 140 miles of range.

“Now that deliveries have begun, customers are experiencing firsthand how different the Brawley GTS feels compared to traditional side-by-sides,” said Daniel Boyer, Sales and Marketing Manager at Vanderhall. “Any off-road purists tired of blaring motors and the dust-choked, open-air experience will appreciate its quiet power, comfort, and precision. It’s the perfect blend between a desert runner and a rock crawler.”

Vanderhall Motor Company

If you’ve heard of Vanderhall Motor Works before, it’s likely not in an off-road context. The brand is best known for its three-wheeled autocycle roadsters. Think reverse trike — like a Polaris Slingshot, but much nicer. The autocycles are all federally classified as motorcycles in the U.S., so users are required to wear helmets and drivers must have a motorcycle endorsement on their license.

Founded in 2010, the company started offering production machines in 2016. It’s based in Provo, Utah. The Brawley GTS is the company’s first foray into electric vehicles and anything with off-road capability.

Vanderhall Brawley GTS

What makes the Vanderhall Brawley GTS stand out from other UTVs is its big-power, all-electric drivetrain, and a refined enclosed, climate-controlled cabin. Off-road capability is achieved through impressive suspension, loads of ground clearance, 35-inch tires wrapped around 18-inch wheels, and a small, nimble chassis.

The Brawley GTS’s electric drivetrain consists of a quad-motor setup and a 40 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. This configuration offers 404 horsepower, 488 pound-feet of torque, 140 miles of range, and intelligent AWD. It also has a regenerative braking system to help keep the batteries topped off and the brakes operating at maximum capability.

That is a lot of power in such a small machine! While the range number isn’t all that impressive to look at, it’s actually more than enough for some big day-trip UTV adventures.

The cabin features seating for four adults, with all four seats heated. It also has heating and air conditioning, so you can get out and play year-round. The fully enclosed cabin should also do a great job of keeping the dust and weather out, while the big upper and lower windows in the doors offer a great view of the world around you.

Of course, the Brawley GTS will be available with a variety of performance and drivability upgrades.

The Luxury 4-Season UTV World

There really isn’t anything like the Brawley GTS on the market. The closest UTV would have to be the Polaris XPEDITION, as it also offers an enclosed, climate-controlled cabin in a capable off-road package. However, it is gas-powered, loud, and much less refined for similar money.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/09/GJVanderhallBrawleyGTS-4.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 10:09:14.666206

If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.

An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

In particular, CS Venkatakrishnan warned the Chancellor against “milking the financial sector” by introducing a new tax on banks.

In an interview with CNBC, he said: “It stifles competition, stifles growth. You need to encourage it to grow, not tax it out of existence.”

The comments come after the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank, which is seen as being close to the Government, called for a windfall levy on the banking sector.

Speculation of higher taxes on landlords, investors and higher earners is also rife, with Ms Reeves facing a gap in the public finances widely thought to be worth tens of billions of pounds.

One estimate, which Ms Reeves has rejected, put the figure as high as £50bn.

In a research paper, the IPPR argued the move would help recover losses for the taxpayer that have resulted from the Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme after the financial crisis.

This essentially saw the Bank create money and use it to buy bonds from the banking sector, giving them reserves on which they then accrued interest.

Now, Threadneedle Street is selling off those bonds at a loss and paying out higher interest rates to the banks.

The IPPR says these losses are worth £22bn a year and urged a tax on deposits similar to that launched by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.

News of the think tank’s proposals earlier this year sent shares in listed British banks, including Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Natwest tumbling, knocking billions of pounds off their combined worth.

Mr Venkatakrishnan has also previously criticised the idea of a windfall tax for having “facile and fallacious logic”.

He said the tax would result in less hiring and “less credit into the UK economy” from banks, which would be forced to rein in lending to British businesses.

Charlie Nunn, chief executive of Britain’s largest lender Lloyds, also previously urged Ms Reeves against a tax raid, claiming it would damage the country’s growth ambitions.

On Friday, a Treasury spokesman said: “We are a pro-business government, and the Chancellor has been clear that the financial services sector is at the heart of our plans to grow the economy.

“This is why we have taken action to boost investment, such as the Leeds Reforms, which is cutting red tape to boost the City’s competitiveness and has put the UK on course to be the number one destination for financial services firms by 2035.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/H.Dlm_H8Phti6D_JmV8X6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/756ee3e6dd0f10da2ede331524736f17,N,,2025-09-26 12:34:25.399613

Now in its 21st edition, the report finds that banks face an uphill battle, with satisfaction levels particularly low among small (15%) and mid-sized merchants (22%). Despite this, 66% of merchants still prefer traditional providers for their financial services needs representing a significant opportunity ahead.

Banks risk losing relevance with merchants

According to the new report, banks have deprioritized the merchant services business, citing margin compression, increasingly complex infrastructure, and hefty operational costs, so PayTechs have stepped in to fill the gap. While 70% of merchants value high payment success rates and reliable infrastructure in a digital-first environment, only 19% of banks feel confident in their own ability to deliver these services. Similarly, 69% of merchants demand fast and seamless onboarding, yet just 13% of banking executives believe their institutions are fully capable of delivering this service.

The report also highlights major challenges in bank onboarding of merchants, which can take up to seven days, with an average cost of up to $496. PayTechs, by contrast, can enable merchants to go live in under 60 minutes for as little as $214. This slow and cumbersome process costs merchants both revenue and patience, turning many into flight risks.

“As many banks focus on the card issuing business over merchant acquisition, gaps have emerged in servicing merchants, enabling agile, digital-first competitors to win market share,” said Jeroen Hölscher, Global Head of Payment Services at Capgemini. “With 40% of merchants on the move, the message is clear: banks risk falling out of the merchant ecosystem entirely. To recover, they need to eliminate the friction that costs merchants time and money, and embrace the possibilities offered by Generative AI. Those who act swiftly and put merchants at the center of their strategy will be best placed to compete with PayTechs in a new era of commerce.”

PayTechs winning the innovation race

When it comes to the pace of innovation, PayTechs are outpacing banks, creating a significant disparity. For example, 70% of PayTechs have deployed payment orchestration – a critical enabler for the intelligent routing of transactions – compared to just 47% of banks. A further 41% of banks report adopting GenAI across their operations, compared with 60% of newer entrants. Likewise, PayTechs are shaping market expectations in line with regulatory shifts, with nearly half prioritizing Central Bank Digital Currencies and stablecoins, and 59% looking into digital identity frameworks, versus only 23% and 38% respectively of banks.

Gaps in fraud prevention and payment processing present another area for improvement. Only 26% of bank executives express confidence in offering advanced fraud prevention and data security. Merchants feel this strain acutely, reporting losses of about 2% of total revenue to payment fraud, and up to 9 hours of downtime annually due to unreliable systems.

New digital payments mix surges as cards lose share worldwide

Over the past decade, global non-cash transactions have expanded fourfold, with nearly 90% occurring in retail and B2C environments. In 2024, volumes are estimated to have reached over 1.6 trillion, with projections suggesting they will exceed 3.5 trillion by 2029.

Globally, instant payments and digital wallets are gaining influence across the payment mix, rising from 13% in 2020 to 25% in 2024. In contrast, the share of cards across the payments mix is expected to decline from 65% to 52% during the same period, even as the total number of card transactions continues to grow.

Asia-Pacific led the surge recording nearly 800 billion digital transactions in 2024, with an expected 21% year-over-year growth in 2025. In contrast, North America recorded approximately 256 billion digital transactions in 2024 with slower growth (7%) projected for the coming year, as cards continue to dominate the payment mix.

Banks must seize the opportunity

The combination of rising transaction volumes in e-commerce, combined with stickiness of the payments business, position merchant servicing as a prime opportunity for banks to deepen ties beyond processing. Banks can leverage their unique strengths, including deep trust and power of working capital, built over generations to win back business. Specifically, merchants cite banks’ strong brand reputation (78%), perceived stability and long-term presence in the market (49%), and broader suite of financial products (46%) compared to PayTechs.

Merchants appear willing to switch back to traditional providers if banks and payment providers can offer embedded, industry-specific value-added services such as smooth integration with food delivery platforms for restaurants or seamless loyalty programs for retailers. Eight in ten merchants also say they would consider switching to a bank if it could offer all the services of a PayTech at the same cost.",https://financialit.net/sites/default/files/capgemini_11.png,N,,2025-09-26 09:04:21.726832

J&J has several partnerships and collaborations that support the healthcare sector.","The healthcare industry accounts for around 4% of the world's carbon emissions according to the World Economic Forum.

In order for nations to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement, this sector needs to decarbonise and lessen its impact on the climate.

Johnson and Johnson (J&J) is focused on the healthcare sector and is best known for its brands like Tylenol, Neutrogena, Listerine and Nicorette, amongst various other household staples.

J&J has been ranked tenth in Sustainability Magazine's Top 250 World's Most Sustainable Companies 2025 list for its work surrounding lowering emissions and promoting a circular economy.

What J&J is doing to reduce emissions

J&J says that it has been working towards climate related goals for more than 30 years.

It has set out clear science-based targets, including:

Using 100% electricity derived from renewable sources by 2025

By 2030 to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 44%

For 80% of suppliers to have emissions reduction goals supported by science based targets

Achieve net zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2045

In order to tackle climate challenges, J&J partners with various others with the aim to drive innovation, support decarbonisation and improve environmental footprint.

It also aims to support a diverse energy mix, with a goal of reducing carbon emissions through boosting energy efficiency.

Paulette Frank, Chief Sustainability Officer at J&J, says: “We are wasting no time making progress because we know there is no time to waste, the world needs bold climate action to advance both human and planetary health.”

How can the healthcare sector support a circular economy?

The company is working towards a circular economy with the implementation of several initiatives.

Alongside hospitals in Europe and New Zealand, J&J is supporting a movement to recycle disposable medical instruments that were originally designed for single use.

J&J has implemented the Safe Returns program, allowing customers to return home administered devices back to the hospital and working towards recycling or reusing the products.

The company has also taken part in the Digital Health in a Circular Economy collaborative, working towards tackling the effects of digital health services on the planet.

Within J&J’s Immunology self injectable device line, plastic trays have been replaced with a fibre-based material that can be recycled like cardboard.

How is decarbonisation related to pharmaceuticals?

In order to meet the needs of patients, doctors, nurses and customers, J&J says it has advanced climate adaptation strategies to support the reliability of operations and supply chains throughout the changing environment.

The USDA announced on Thursday that some packages of Marketside Linguini With Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes (Lm).

The agency said that this item was shipped to Walmart locations nationwide with the establishment number “EST. 50784” or “EST. 47718” inside the USDA mark of inspection. The press release lists the following product as the subject of the alert:

12-oz. clear plastic tray packages labeled “MARKETSIDE LINGUINE WITH BEEF MEATBALLS & MARINARA SAUCE” with “best if used by” dates SEP 22, 2025; SEP 24, 2025; SEP 25, 2025; SEP 29, 2025; SEP 30, 2025; and OCT 01, 2025.

The USDA says that the producing company of the pasta collected samples of it as part of the ongoing investigation regarding a listeria outbreak linked to alfredo meals from June. The USDA said that the test confirmed that the linguine pasta was positive for Lm, and further testing is happening to find out if the Lm is genetically related to the specific outbreak strain. The agency continues to coordinate with the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state public health partners.

The USDA said that eating food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and their newborns. Reports said that some of the symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsion, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract.

The agency said that the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn in pregnant women. The USDA also said that serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. The infection is treated with antibiotics. People in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food, according to the USDA.

The agency said that customers who have purchased the pasta products should not eat them and either throw them away or return them to the store where they purchased them.

The retail behemoth will now deliver chilled and reconstituted prescription medications, such as insulin, GLP-1s like Ozempic, and pediatric antibiotics, directly to consumers' homes, putting pharmacies on notice.

The decision makes Walmart (WMT) the first major national store to provide both cold-chain pharmaceutical delivery and basic needs in one order. It's a big deal, both for Main Street and Wall Street.

Walmart's pharmacy makes more than 30% of its money from refrigerated prescriptions. Since its delivery service started last year, the company has already made over 4 million pharmacy deliveries, making it a major player in the market.

The idea is simple: Add high-value medications to Walmart's logistics system, packing them alongside groceries. The goal is to improve customer loyalty via Walmart+ memberships and pressure rivals like CVS, Walgreens, Amazon Pharmacy, and others.

For investors, it's not just making life easier for shoppers. Walmart's cold-chain project might revolutionize the economics of last-mile health care, a $600 billion industry that has been hard to reform for a long time.

Walmart’s pharmacy expansion gains scale

Walmart has been prepping for this move for over a year now. The company tested pharmacy delivery in 2024 and then made it available at all of its locations in early 2025. Since then, it has handled more than 4 million delivery requests, some of which were completed in as little as nine minutes, a major accomplishment.

Adding cooled and reconstituted medicines greatly increases Walmart's reach. These drugs, which include insulin, weight-loss medicines like Ozempic, and antibiotics for kids, make up almost a third of all sales at Walmart pharmacies. They may now come to the door in the same bag as groceries and other things for the house.

Walmart is able to do this because of its cold-chain infrastructure, which includes insulated packaging that blocks light and real-time monitoring via its app. An electronic signature must be given upon delivery.

These procedures ensure the medicine reaches its destination securely and provide customers with the peace of mind they expect at a pharmacy counter.

Walmart is also adding the service to Walmart+, its monthly subscription. Members receive free delivery from the drugstore, while non-members have to pay for delivery. That structure not only makes people more likely to sign up, but it also keeps more customers in a loyalty program that is already the basis of Walmart's digital strategy.

Walmart’s financial muscle backs the move

It's not cheap to send out cold-chain medicines. However, Walmart can afford to spend money that would sink smaller rivals because of its scale, financial stability, and operational leverage.

Walmart's U.S. business had $681 billion in revenue and $29.3 billion in operating earnings in fiscal 2025. Margins in that sector have gone up a little bit. The gross profit as a percentage of sales went from 23.7% to 24.1% last year. That cushion gives Walmart some breathing room as it plans its logistics around cold-chain costs.

More Health Care:

Americans' health insurance bills could surge by 75% next year

Walmart forms bold new health care partnership for affordable medicine

25% of Americans Are Burned Out Before 30

Adding more e-commerce options gives you even more assistance. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, global online sales rose 22% over the same time last year. This shows that Walmart's shift to digital is gaining traction on a large scale. Each refrigerated prescription adds high-value items to the basket and spreads fixed shipping costs across more revenue.

The market potential is also quite high.

The US prescription drug market is worth roughly $600–650 billion a year. Biologics that need to be kept cold and GLP-1 drugs are two of the fastest-growing segments. If Walmart can get even a tiny part of this volume via home delivery, it may turn its healthcare business from a cost center into a growth engine.

Key financial markers:

Revenue: $681 billion in FY2025, up from $648 billion in FY2024.

Gross margin: 24.1% in Walmart U.S., modestly higher than FY2024.

Operating income: $29.35 billion in FY2025 for Walmart U.S., up from $27.01 billion in FY2024.

E-commerce growth: +22% global net sales YoY in Q1 FY26.

Cash generation: Walmart continues to deliver strong operating cash flow, supporting heavy investments in logistics and technology.

Pharmacy market: $600–$650 billion U.S. prescription drug market, with cold-chain drugs becoming a bigger share of sales growth.

For investors, the data are important because they demonstrate why Walmart can make a pharmaceutical investment that smaller competitors may be hesitant to match. It's not simply offering a new service; it's using financial size to possibly change the economics of last-mile healthcare delivery.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA5MTcwOTg1NzY3Njc1NzQ4/maxcare-electric-heated-throw-blanket.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 09:04:56.747736

He then struck off on his own to start a private assets investment firm, which he launched in January 2020 only for the pandemic to upend his plans.
He also rejects suggestions that active fund managers like M&G, which pick and choose investments, are being slowly killed off by cheaper, index-tracking passive rivals, arguing that this more volatile world of higher interest rates is “a golden age for active asset management”.","• Prudential spin-off M&G misses target despite return to growth

“No franchises, one restaurant run by the family — that’s how it should be,” says Rossi, who lives not far away in Chelsea and will have family and friends over in the evening for his birthday. “They do simple ingredients, but that’s what food is about.”

It’s a bit like his approach to turning around M&G, he says.

A venerable name in British asset management that created the first unit trust in 1931 and now oversees assets of about £355 billion, the group was acquired by Prudential in 1999 for £1.9 billion as part of a push by the insurance giant to bolster its investment range.

Twenty years later M&G was revived as an independent company again, when in 2019 the Pru demerged its UK and European operations into a separately listed company on to the London stock market.

M&G shares made their debut at 220p, in a listing that valued the business at £5.7 billion, but the stock soon slumped, knocked by the turmoil caused by the Covid pandemic as well as broader questions about the company’s structure. Spanning a life insurance and pensions division, an asset manager and a wealth business, some investors and analysts have viewed the business, which employs about 8,400 people, as unwieldy and a prime candidate for a takeover and break-up.

When Rossi joined in October 2022 and succeeded John Foley, the chief executive who had led the business through its Pru demerger, M&G shares were languishing at about 167p. They now stand near 250p, propelled higher by a turnaround of the business by Rossi, who earned almost £2.6 million for his efforts last year.

“I came up with a very clear, simple strategy. Three ingredients: financial strength, simplification and growth,” he says. “You can have great ingredients, but if you don’t know how to mix them, your plate will not be good.”

It has involved a cost-cutting programme to find £230 million of savings by the end of this year, including a voluntary redundancy scheme during which 226 people left, as well as a push to expand M&G’s overseas customer base, with 58 per cent of its external assets now coming from international clients, up from 37 per cent in 2019.

This diversification is set to continue after M&G announced a tie-up with Japan’s Dai-ichi Life in May, a deal that should raise the British group’s profile in Asia and is expected to generate at least $6 billion of new business flows into its funds over five years. It involves the Tokyo-based insurer acquiring a 15 per cent stake in the London-listed company.

Rossi has also built its footprint in the fast-growing private markets, with M&G buying a majority stake in P Capital Partners earlier this year in a move that has boosted its assets in this area to about £77 billion.

Yet despite the turnaround, speculation that M&G is a bid target has not gone away, with Australia’s Macquarie rumoured to have been a possible suitor two years ago and, more recently, the American investment giant Apollo.

Rossi won’t be drawn on the speculation, insisting that “we have a strong independent future in front of us”, and dismisses suggestions that M&G should be broken up.

“Why would I separate something which is giving me a competitive advantage over others?” he asks over the hum of the restaurant, which has filled up for lunch as we wait for our food to arrive: buffalo mozzarella to start for Rossi, followed by chargrilled chicken paillard with spinach, while I have ordered tuna carpaccio and roast fillet of hake. It’s a working day and Rossi has a board meeting after our meal, so we stick with mineral water.

Running a company had long been Rossi’s ambition. Born to a Swedish mother and an Italian father, as a child he “liked to lead” and was always the captain in team sports, although he was “never the best at sport”, he concedes.

Thanks to his father’s job as a senior executive at Fiat, the family moved frequently when Rossi was young, and by the age of 15 he was in London, where he was a pupil at the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in South Kensington.

He then went to Sapienza University of Rome, where he studied economics and commerce, after which he joined Olivetti, the Italian manufacturer of computers, calculators and fax machines, before embarking on an MBA at INSEAD (European Institute of Business Administration) in Fontainebleau in France. He took a job subsequently at General Electric, where he worked at its lighting business in Enfield in north London and then moved to GE Capital, its financial services arm.

• How FTSE 100 fund manager M&G engineered a smash-hit song

However, most of his career has been spent rising through the ranks at Axa, the French insurance and investment group, which took him to Paris, Milan, Dubai and finally back to London, where he was the chief executive of its fund management business. He then struck off on his own to start a private assets investment firm, which he launched in January 2020 only for the pandemic to upend his plans.

A believer that “if you win, good, if you fail, fail quickly”, he moved on, becoming a senior adviser at Boston Consulting Group and taking other non-executive roles, before being headhunted for the M&G job.

A self-described “true European” who speaks Italian, Swedish, English and French fluently, as well as being able to get by in German and Spanish, Rossi believes that recent worries in the Square Mile and in Westminster that London’s status as a global financial centre is fading are overdone: “We’ve been too negative all the time.

“We have the best universities in the world in this country. Everybody wants to come here. The talent you can attract here, you can attract nowhere else.”

• ‘Fewer non-doms left than feared’ after Rachel Reeves’s budget

Still, he notes that the government’s abolition of the non-dom tax regime, which includes an inheritance tax crackdown and which has been blamed for spurring some wealthy individuals to leave the UK, meant that the country “might have lost some people”, although he says he has no plans to go anywhere, even though he is affected by the changes.

He also rejects suggestions that active fund managers like M&G, which pick and choose investments, are being slowly killed off by cheaper, index-tracking passive rivals, arguing that this more volatile world of higher interest rates is “a golden age for active asset management”.

It’s certainly a boom time for investing in Europe, with M&G, like other fund management groups, detecting a shift among their clients to diversify investments away from the US following the upheaval caused by President Trump’s sweeping tariffs in April.

Rossi says the pivot actually started last year, before Trump rattled markets with his trade policies, when the valuation gap between highly rated American assets and European assets left the latter looking “extremely attractive”.

Our meal is over and Rossi, who declines dessert and a coffee, “I only drink coffee in the morning, I’m already very energised”, has his board meeting to attend. He insists on ordering an espresso for me before he has to dash off and wants to leave on an optimistic note.

“People are pushing down too much on this country,” he says. “We should be prouder about what we have and what we do.

“It’s like seeing the glass half full or half empty. We should always say it’s half full, and it can become fuller.”

The aim is to establish ammonia bunkering hubs in Japan as part of ITOCHU’s efforts to promote the use of ammonia as marine fuel.
ITOCHU placed an order in June 2025 with a domestic shipyard for an ammonia bunkering vessel as part of an integrated project.
After demonstrating ammonia bunkering in Singapore with this vessel, ITOCHU plans to develop a bunkering business in Singapore while also studying the development of an ammonia supply chain in Japan.
Uyeno Transtech will provide information for the bunkering vessel and support negotiations with authorities concerning vessel operations.","ITOCHU Corporation announced on September 25, 2025, that it has concluded a joint development agreement with Toray Industries and Uyeno Transtech for an ammonia bunkering hub in Japan.

The agreement covers joint studies and confirmation of safety operations and necessary facilities, obtaining permits from Japanese authorities, and examining commercial terms for ammonia bunkering.

The aim is to establish ammonia bunkering hubs in Japan as part of ITOCHU’s efforts to promote the use of ammonia as marine fuel.

The initiative follows the International Maritime Organization’s draft revisions to its convention, which include phased conversion of marine fuel to low greenhouse gas alternatives and economic incentives for zero-emission or nearly zero-emission vessels, with the goal of reaching net-zero emissions from international shipping by around 2050.

As ammonia is expected to be used as a zero-emission marine fuel, stakeholders across the maritime sector, including cargo owners and fuel producers, are considering its development and use.

ITOCHU stated that the establishment of an ammonia bunkering hub will strengthen ties between the marine and fuel industries and that it will hold discussions with relevant companies to expand a stable ammonia supply chain in Japan.

ITOCHU placed an order in June 2025 with a domestic shipyard for an ammonia bunkering vessel as part of an integrated project.

After demonstrating ammonia bunkering in Singapore with this vessel, ITOCHU plans to develop a bunkering business in Singapore while also studying the development of an ammonia supply chain in Japan.

The company may later relocate the vessel to Japan, depending on initial demand. According to ITOCHU, it will continue to promote its integrated project for ammonia-fueled vessels under its management policy “The Brand-new Deal – Profit opportunities are shifting downstream –,” while working on early social implementation of ammonia-fueled vessels.

The companies defined their roles under the agreement. ITOCHU will coordinate all subjects, including those related to the bunkering vessel and ammonia as marine fuel. Toray will handle matters concerning equipment and facilities on land, supply information on ammonia handling and procurement, and negotiate with authorities regarding its facilities. Uyeno Transtech will provide information for the bunkering vessel and support negotiations with authorities concerning vessel operations.

ITOCHU Corporation is a Japanese general trading company headquartered in Tokyo. It engages in domestic and international trading, investment, and business development across sectors including energy, chemicals, food, textiles, machinery, metals, and ICT.

Toray Industries, Inc. is a Japanese multinational corporation headquartered in Tokyo. It operates primarily in advanced materials, with businesses spanning fibers, textiles, plastics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and environmental engineering.

H&M is making some major moves, ramping up store openings in Brazil and India while dialing back in Europe and the US – debuting its first Brazilian store in August and planning seven more by 2026.

What does this mean?

With shoppers tightening their wallets in Europe and new US tariffs taking a toll, H&M’s turning its attention to emerging markets for fresher opportunities. The fashion giant has trimmed its global store count by 19% since 2019, hitting a nine-year low of 4,118 as it streamlines in saturated regions. This year, H&M plans to shut 200 more stores where demand has stalled but will still launch eye-catching flagships in trendy zones like Paris' Le Marais and Shanghai's Huaihai Road.

While Zara-owner Inditex is also consolidating, H&M is leaning into markets where the runway still looks wide open and local rivals are less entrenched.

Why should I care?

For markets: Retailers look far and wide for fresh momentum.

H&M and Inditex have trimmed thousands of stores since 2019, pressured by the rise of e-commerce and changing shopping habits.

The Downstream Solutions Challenge spotlights scalable innovations across design, collaboration, logistics and finance.

This year’s winners – Schneider Electric, Vestas, DHL and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria – show how business can deliver systemic change.

Tackling climate change requires bold action on Scope 3 downstream emissions, which typically include those generated during the use of sold products, the end-of-life treatment of sold products, downstream transportation and distribution, the processing of sold products and investments.

Understanding and addressing Scope 3 downstream emissions is increasingly significant in sustainability and climate reporting, as these emissions often represent the largest share of a company’s total carbon footprint.

By measuring and managing these emissions, organizations can identify opportunities for product innovation, engage with value chain partners and contribute to global climate goals.

For the 133 members of the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, Scope 3 downstream accounts for 67% of their value chain emissions, equivalent to 3.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2e) equivalent, roughly the same as India’s annual CO2e emissions (from fossil fuels and industry only, as per Our World in Data figures with further BCG Analysis).

The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders’ Downstream Solutions Challenge aimed to highlight companies that are pioneering scalable, innovative and collaborative approaches to Scope 3 downstream decarbonization.

By focusing on four categories – sustainable design, collaboration, smart logistics and financing – the challenge highlights solutions that not only reduce emissions but also unlock business value, resilience and long-term competitiveness.

Sustainable design: Schneider Electric

Product design is where downstream impact often begins. The materials chosen, the way systems are powered and how they are maintained or recycled all shape emissions across the entire lifecycle. Sustainable design can deliver exponential benefits, including lowering costs, enhancing safety, ensuring regulatory compliance and reducing Scope 3 emissions.

Schneider Electric’s AirSeT technology is a breakthrough in medium-voltage switchgear, replacing sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a greenhouse gas with 24,300 times the global warming potential of CO2, with pure air and vacuum technology.

Unlike incremental improvements, AirSeT eliminates SF6, reducing regulatory risks, lowering long-term costs and improving worker safety.

To date, AirSeT has avoided more than 1.2 million tons of CO2e, contributing to Schneider’s goal of saving or avoiding 800 million tons of CO2 by 2025. Fully compatible with existing infrastructure, digitally integrated and externally audited, AirSeT is not just a product; it is a scalable solution for climate-resilient energy systems.

Collaboration: Vestas

No company can decarbonize its value chain alone. Collaboration between suppliers, customers and industry peers is essential for scaling new technologies and aligning market incentives. In hard-to-abate materials such as steel, joint action can break cost barriers, reduce investment risks and send powerful demand signals that reshape entire industries.

Vestas has embraced this challenge by pioneering the use of low-emission steel in wind turbine towers, produced in partnership with ArcelorMittal using scrap and renewable electricity.

With steel representing up to 50% of a turbine’s lifecycle emissions, this innovation, it says, cuts emissions by 66% per kilogram of steel, achieving up to 52% reductions in onshore towers and up to 26% reductions in offshore towers.

By engaging both suppliers and customers, such as Baltic Power and Vattenfall, Vestas created a self-reinforcing demand signal that accelerates the adoption of its products. This initiative shows how collaboration can extend beyond pilots to systemic change.

Smart logistics: DHL

Transportation and distribution are among the most visible sources of downstream emissions. Every product that reaches a customer carries a carbon footprint associated with its transportation.

As global supply chains expand, sustainable logistics has become a decisive lever, not just to reduce emissions but also to meet procurement requirements, strengthen brand reputation and improve air quality in cities.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus is reshaping logistics by embedding sustainability across air, ocean, road and warehousing. By using sustainable aviation fuel, bio-LNG (liquefied natural gas), hydro-treated vegetable oil and battery-electric vehicles, the programme enables insetting, cutting emissions directly within the supply chain.

In 2024 alone, GoGreen Plus reduced 1,598 kilotons of CO2e, verified by independent third parties. Its book-and-claim model makes the solution globally scalable, already used by more than 300,000 customers.

Partnerships such as Formula 1 have amplified its visibility worldwide, accelerating adoption and setting a new industry standard for sustainable logistics, already used by more than 300,000 customers of all sizes and across all industry sectors.

Financing: BBVA

Even the best technologies cannot scale without capital. Financing plays a catalytic role in downstream decarbonization, enabling suppliers and customers to invest in cleaner processes, equipment and systems. By embedding climate ambition into financial products, banks can unlock transformation across entire value chains.

BBVA’s Sustainable Ecosystems initiative integrates advisory services, supplier classification and targeted financing to accelerate Scope 3 reductions. It helps clients diagnose emissions and then mobilize funding to address them, bridging the gap between ambition and implementation.

For instance, in the automotive coatings sector, BBVA structured financing that enabled downstream garages to install solar panels and adopt energy-efficient equipment. This not only reduced emissions but also improved competitiveness and resilience across the value chain. Globally deployable and sector-agnostic, the model exemplifies how finance can turn climate commitments into measurable results.

The winners of the Downstream Solutions Challenge demonstrate that decarbonization is not just possible, it is already happening. From clean electrification to green steel, sustainable logistics and climate-aligned finance, these solutions prove that private sector innovation and collaboration can unlock transformative climate impact.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large__iorwy9ttij3hbAE6haRDC8hSpXhurvLURiB04jZpRc.JPG,N,,2025-09-26 09:03:54.233347

I enjoy the simplicity of this out-of-home project for OREO. VML took the reality of a pedestrian crossing and put a playful cookie twist on it. It engages the audience and makes people double-take while walking. The best part is that the campaign solely relies on OREO cookies' iconic shape and recognisable pattern, and brand. For me, this one just works.

Gucci - The Tiger

Chosen by Laura Swinton, editor-in-chief

Watching the new half hour Gucci film all the way though? I’ll be honest, I did not see that for me. Self-indulgent, painfully arch high fashion ‘art’ tries my patience. But I did, I watched it all… and loved it! The camp! The craft! The cast!

Demi Moore stars as the fictional Barbara Gucci, troubled matriarch and ‘owner’ of California, plagued by self doubt and troubled dreams. She’s mother to Ed Norton (Moore is 62 and Norton is 56 - ok she’s his step mother but still, this is the level of silliness we’re dealing with here), Elliot Page doing a twitchy Roman Roy impression and a beleaguered Kiki Palmer. Between Alia Shawkat as the new girlfriend and Ed Norton’s Buster Bluth-inspired perpetual student it really is ‘Arrested Development, but make it fashion’. A spiked round of champagne propels the family and their journalist guest (Ed Harris) towards psychedelic, psychic collapse.

There’s a moment of sound design genius when Ed Norton interacts with a doppelganger who communicates in the language of radio static and… it’s compelling in a way that I can’t understand.

Spike Jonze and Halina Reijn co-direct the film which is also a significant statement from the fashion house’s new creative director, Demna. The film launches the new season’s collection, in lieu of a catwalk show, and was screened at Milan Fashion Week.

KPN - Everyone Except

Read more.

Chosen by Paul Monan, head of creative excellence

With children across the Netherlands recently returning to school for the start of a new year, Dutch telco KPN has teamed up with Dentsu Creative Amsterdam and a range of other partners to launch 'Everyone Except' – a new campaign that’s centred on online exclusion for young people. It's a follow up to the hugely successful 'A Piece of Me' campaign, which focussed on online shaming, and is built around the insight that 23% of youngsters are excluded online at least once a month (according to new research by online abuse charity, Helpwanted).

The short film, produced by Dark Alley Pictures, is soundtracked by Dutch singer/songwriter S10 and follows the story of a teenage boy swept along and then ostracised by his group of 'friends'. The uplifting ending, in which the group disintegrates and supports the protagonist, delivers KPN's message – stand up for each other, both online and off. It's nice to see KPN continuing to build upon the brand platform that it's constructed over the last few years: utilising local artists, creating original soundtracks, and telling difficult stories in an attempt to improve the digital lives of today’s youth.

Claude - Keep Thinking

Chosen by Alex Reeves, managing editor, EMEA

I’m in favour of Anthropic’s ‘Keep Thinking’ for one simple reason: it purports to protect the bit that matters – our human thinking power. The line rejects AI-as-shortcut hype and reframes Claude as a partner for tougher, slower, more deliberate work. That’s the creative stance the world needs right now. And I say this as someone who uses AI to help me write all the time. Mother’s platform lands a welcome corrective to the current “move fast” narrative. If AI is going to be useful to makers and marketers, it should expand our capacity to think, not replace it. ‘Keep thinking’ says exactly that.

The human bringing this AI-funded piece of filmmaking to the screen is Daniel Wolfe. And as we agreed in our editorial Work of the Week meeting, he pretty much never misses. The film feels confidently restrained: no tech dazzle for its own sake, just considered craft that turns criticisms of gen AI into an invitation. You can feel the pause before action, the space where thought happens. That gives the idea moral weight and creative credibility.

Volkswagen Australia - Why the Long Car?

Chosen by Zara Naseer, EMEA reporter

While the rest of the world races to be the most future-facing of them all, Volkswagen Australia and DDB Sydney are offering respite from the modern cacophony with an homage to the past. Specifically, to the brand’s 1960s print ads.

Icons like ‘Lemon’, which featured a simple image above detailed columns of copy, have been cleverly reinterpreted in motion. The opening shot mirrors the composition exactly, but a new element is added when the camera pans round to reveal the full length of the car, a sausage dog alongside as a charming comparison.

It’s an elegant update on a classic that I imagine car and advertising fans alike will appreciate. Plus, it’s the first in a series – so stay on the lookout for more.

Apple – The Ultimate Pro

Chosen by Zhenya Tsenzharyk, UK editor

When I saw that Apple released another iteration of its 'Shot on iPhone' films I thought, surely the brand has run out of ideas now. Well, I was proven wrong and in serious style too. We know that films can be shot on iPhone and many have been like Sean Baker's 'Tangerine', where the medium added to the frantic, personable narrative.

For the iPhone 17 Pro, Apple and Park Pictures offer us, the viewers, something that does feel new: filmmakers in the frame, with direction from Seb Edwards and a classic soundtrack courtesy of 'Come Rain or Come Shine' by Connie Francis. Epic and cinematic in scope – what we've come to expect – it breaks the so-called fourth wall to show us how the magic is made and the people who make it happen. It's an impressive showcase of the iPhone’s new tech but, to me, it's really an ad about what can be achieved when a powerful tool is in the hands of makers with a vision.

Created in-house and directed by Reset’s Jessica Lee Gagné, these films certainly prey on my weakness for practical effects.

Scrubs are usually thought of as a purely functional barrier — built to withstand all manner of bodily fluids and long shifts. But this new ad for FIGS scrubs deftly reimagines them as a global symbol of a shared profession. Produced by NativeFour, the beautifully shot film travels through Tokyo, London, Mexico City and Los Angeles, and captured healthcare workers in their own working environments. The resulting film is a reminder that even the most functional of products can be reframed with good craft and emotion.

Pepsi - The Recycling Rethink

Chosen by April Summers, North America features lead

Pepsi has teamed up with Special Australia and TOMRA to dramatically up the stakes of container recycling in New South Wales. ‘The Recycling Rethink’ is an initiative that will run from now until 22 November 2025, and will reward those who recycle a Pepsi can or bottle through a Return and Earn reverse vending machine. Ranging from the standard 10c refund all the way up to $50,000 via a unique QR-coded voucher, the incentive hopes to gamify recycling, transforming a dull transaction into a moment of excitement.

Backed by OOH, social, online video and messaging directly through Return and Earn’s network, the campaign hopes to prove that sustainability can be as responsible as it is rewarding. For PepsiCo, it’s a really smart move. Not only does it boost both recycling rates and brand preference, but it also has the potential to prove that well-researched incentive design can nudge behaviour while earning cultural attention.",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2025-09/NEW-Work-of-the-Week-26.9.25.Twqx24F2.png,N,,2025-09-26 07:06:55.010540

That could mean increased levies on imported face masks, syringes and infusion pumps as well as robotics and industrial machinery like programmable computer-controlled mechanical systems and industrial stamping and pressing machines.

“At this stage, details are limited, and a range of potential outcomes remain under discussion,” Philips told Reuters in an emailed statement.

Shares in the Dutch healthcare technology company were down almost 3% at around 0845 GMT, and those of its European med-tech peers Siemens Healthineers, Coloplast, Sonova, Demant, GN Store Nord, Smith+Nephew fell between 1% and 4%.

I think that my mum was my friend.” Johnson now has three children of his own: daughters, Simone, 24; Jasmine, 9; and Tiana, 7.","Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is speaking out about the last time he talked to his late father, Rocky Johnson, with whom he had a deeply complicated relationship.

The 53-year-old actor said they fought over his father’s memoir. Johnson said Rocky’s book contained quotes, ostensibly written by him, that gave his dad credit for his success.

“It hurts,” he told The New York Times Magazine in an in-depth interview published Sunday.

Johnson’s father, a former pro wrestler himself, had just published Soulman: The Rocky Johnson Story, at the time, and Johnson said he was shocked to read that he had written the foreword for the book — even though he hadn’t.

“It just completely crossed the line,” Johnson said. “It goes back to the attention, the narcissism.”

In fact, Johnson said their 2019 blow-up was the biggest fight he’d had with his father since 25 years earlier, when he decided he wanted to follow in his dad’s pro wrestling footsteps.

Rocky Johnson told his son at the time: “What do you think you possibly have to offer?”

Johnson’s family moved often when he was a kid, and his dad, frequently on the road as a wrestler, often didn’t have time for him.

His parents’ relationship was also volatile to the point where they sometimes lived apart.

Johnson said that was kind of a relief from the fighting.

He also attributed the most painful moment in his life to his father.

When he was 15, he said he and his mother were evicted from their apartment in Hawaii. His mum Ata Johnson asked his dad to let Dwayne stay with him in Tennessee, where he was living at the time, so she could settle things in Hawaii, then drive out and join the two of them.

“It hurt my heart,” Johnson said of seeing his mum’s reaction to the eviction notice left on their door. But he said his father told her, “No problem, I’ve got an apartment.”

However, when Johnson arrived in Nashville, his father was nowhere to be found. Instead, he was greeted by a man named Bob, who drove him to a motel, introduced him to another man named Bruno — whom, incidentally, Johnson is still friends with — and told him he’d be living there.

The Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw actor said he realised instantly that his dad was living with another woman, and when his mother arrived after driving from San Francisco in a Ford Thunderbird purchased by her husband, she found out, too.

“My heart hurts when I think about that,” Johnson said. “The pain that my mum was driving with: Like ‘What is my life now? That whole time?’”

When she arrived at the motel, and was met by Bruno and Rocky, who began talking in circles, she knew.

“That was it. Within five minutes it all just …. It wasn’t even an explosion. It was just a — collapse,” Johnson explained.

He said he learned to think of himself as the main man in his mother’s life, and he was the one who saved her from attempted suicide after that drive to Nashville.

The look on her face, he said, still haunts him.

The rest of his father’s 2019 memoir, Johnson said, was filled with fiction.

“Growing up with my dad, I know the truth to all these stories, and they’re not in this book. If the truth is blue, the story is red,” he explained.

Eventually, Johnson got it pulled from bookstore shelves.

Johnson learned his father had died as he was driving to set on the first day of filming Red Notice in 2020.

He thought at first maybe he should go home and be with his family, but then he remembered one of his father’s many mantras that, no matter what, the “show must go on.”

So he went to work.

It was at his dad’s funeral that he said he realised his dad had been a great friend to so many others, including wrestlers like Hulk Hogan and Triple H.

“Wildly enough, my old man was just this amazing friend,” he said. “Complicated husband. Complicated dad. But an awesome friend to everyone else.”

Asked if he thought he was more his father’s friend than his son, Johnson said no.

“He wasn’t my friend either,” he answered. “I wish. I think that my mum was my friend.”

“After four years of share price decline and index exclusion pressure, investor interest in Croda remains anchored to a mean-reversion thesis,” Barclays said.
In its revised forecasts, Barclays projected adjusted EBIT of £293 million and adjusted PBT of £267 million for fiscal 2025.
Croda is now taking a proactive approach to cost discipline; its savings programme offers upside to consensus,” the analysts said.","Investing.com -- Barclays upgraded British speciality chemicals company, Croda International (LON:CRDA) to “overweight” from “equal weight,” saying the chemicals company’s turnaround potential, activist investor involvement and cost savings program improve its risk-reward profile after a prolonged period of weakness, in a note dated Friday.

The brokerage lowered its price target to GBp3,100 from GBp3,600, implying about 16% upside from current levels. Croda shares are down about 70% from their late 2021 peak, compared with a 26% gain for the .

“After four years of share price decline and index exclusion pressure, investor interest in Croda remains anchored to a mean-reversion thesis,” Barclays said.

The brokerage said activist investor Standard Latitude’s entry marks “a potential turning point, introducing the prospect of more decisive strategic action at a time when management have been initiating early steps toward a turnaround.”

Barclays pointed to Croda’s £100 million cost-savings program as a central driver of potential recovery.

“We believe the market underappreciated this initiative at H1, but if successful, it could become a key driver of share performance,” the analysts said. The program, focused on tighter cost discipline, could provide upside to consensus expectations.

The report also noted challenges in Croda’s lipid business, pointing to missed opportunities during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout when the company lacked intellectual property–protected ionisable lipids, leading Pfizer to choose another partner.

Barclays said the lipid market is now likely oversupplied but could still present activist-led restructuring opportunities.

Standard Latitude’s involvement could accelerate portfolio changes, the bank said, with divestments seen as likely.

“With valuation at trough levels, cost discipline expanding, and now the potential for activist driven divestments, which our report highlights are likely needed, we think Croda’s risk reward now skews more positive,” the analysts said.

In its revised forecasts, Barclays projected adjusted EBIT of £293 million and adjusted PBT of £267 million for fiscal 2025.

Both estimates are broadly in line with consensus but down from previous forecasts of £295 million and £273 million, reflecting reduced expectations in Life Sciences due to U.S. pharmaceutical headwinds.

The brokerage said it is introducing a sum-of-the-parts analysis alongside a discounted cash flow model in valuing Croda, noting “multiple potential opportunities across the portfolio to accelerate Croda’s turnaround.”

Barclays added that concerns over commoditisation in Croda’s markets may be overstated.

“Commoditisation concerns could be overdone. Croda is now taking a proactive approach to cost discipline; its savings programme offers upside to consensus,” the analysts said.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEBAG0BO_L.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 12:34:32.182229

Alex Holland, Principal Threat Researcher, HP Security Lab, comments: “Attackers aren’t reinventing the wheel, but they are refining their techniques.
To date, HP Wolf Security customers have clicked on over 55 billion email attachments, web pages, and downloaded files with no reported breaches.
HP Wolf Security is world class endpoint security.
HP Wolf Security provides comprehensive endpoint protection and resiliency that starts at the hardware level and extends across software and services.","HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) today issued its latest Threat Insights Report, revealing how age-old living-off-the-land (LOTL) and phishing techniques are evolving to bypass traditional detection-based security tools. LOTL techniques – where attackers use legitimate tools and features built into a computer to carry out their attacks – have long been a staple of the threat actor toolkit. However, HP Threat Researchers now warn that the growing use of multiple, often uncommon, binaries in a single campaign is making it even harder to distinguish malicious versus legitimate activity.

The report provides an analysis of real-world cyberattacks, helping organizations to keep up with the latest techniques cybercriminals are using to evade detection and breach PCs in the fast-changing cybercrime landscape. Based on the millions of endpoints running HP Wolf Security1, notable campaigns identified by HP Threats Researchers include:

Fake Adobe Reader Invoice Signals New Wave of Ultra-Polished Social Engineering Lures: Attackers embedded a reverse shell – a script that grants attackers control over a victim’s device. The script was embedded in a small SVG image, disguised as a very realistic Adobe Acrobat Reader file, complete with fake loading bar – giving the illusion of an ongoing upload, increasing the chances victims will open it and trigger an infection chain. Attackers also geofenced the download to German speaking regions to limit exposure, hinder automated analysis systems and delay detection.

Attackers Hiding Malware in Pixel Image Files: Attackers used Microsoft Compiled HTML Help files to hide malicious code within image pixels. The files, disguised as project documents, concealed an XWorm payload in the pixel data, which was then extracted and used to execute a multi-step infection chain involving multiple LOTL techniques. PowerShell was also used to run a CMD file that deleted evidence of files once they’d been downloaded and executed.

Resurgent Lumma Stealer Spreads via IMG Archives: Lumma Stealer was one of the most active malware families observed in Q2. Attackers distributed it through multiple channels, including IMG Archive attachments that use LOTL techniques to bypass security filters and exploit trusted systems. Despite a law enforcement crackdown in May 2025, campaigns continued in June and that the group is already registering more domains and building infrastructure.

Alex Holland, Principal Threat Researcher, HP Security Lab, comments: “Attackers aren’t reinventing the wheel, but they are refining their techniques. Living-off-the-land, reverse shells and phishing have been around for decades, but today’s threat actors are sharpening these methods. We’re seeing more chaining of living-off-the-land tools and use of less obvious file types, such as images, to evade detection. Take reverse shells as an example – you don’t have to drop a fully-fledged RAT when a simple, lightweight script will achieve the same effect. It’s simple, fast and often slips under the radar because it’s so basic.”

These campaigns show how creative and adaptive threat actors have become. By hiding malicious code in images, abusing trusted system tools, and even tailoring attacks to specific regions, they’re making it harder for traditional detection tools to spot threats.

By isolating threats that have evaded detection tools on PCs – but still allowing malware to detonate safely inside secure containers – HP Wolf Security has specific insight into the latest techniques used by cybercriminals. To date, HP Wolf Security customers have clicked on over 55 billion email attachments, web pages, and downloaded files with no reported breaches.

The report, which examines data from April-June 2025, details how cybercriminals continue to diversify attack methods to bypass security tools that rely on detection, such as:

At least 13% of email threats identified by HP Sure Click bypassed one or more email gateway scanners.

Archive files were the most popular delivery type (40%), followed by executables and scripts (35%).

Attackers are continuing to use .rar archive files (26%), suggesting attackers are exploiting trusted software like WinRAR to avoid raising suspicion.

Dr. Ian Pratt, Global Head of Security for Personal Systems at HP Inc., comments: “Living off the land techniques are notoriously difficult for security teams because it’s hard to tell green flags from red – i.e. legitimate activity versus an attack. You’re stuck between a rock and a hard place – lock down activity and create friction for users and tickets for the SOC or leave it open and risk an attacker slipping through. Even the best detection will miss some threats, so defense-in-depth with containment and isolation is essential to trap attacks before they can cause harm.”

This data was gathered from consenting HP Wolf Security customers from April – June 2025 with investigations conducted by the HP Threat Research Team.

Growth is driven by the rising prevalence of cardiovascular disorders, increasing public access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs), the expansion of ambulance services, and technological advancements in defibrillator devices. The market is also benefiting from the aging global population, growing awareness of heart health, and regulatory initiatives mandating life-saving devices in public spaces.

Defibrillators are life-saving devices designed to restore normal heart rhythms in patients experiencing sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), atrial fibrillation, or coronary artery disease (CAD)-related cardiac events. These devices deliver controlled electric shocks to correct irregular heartbeats, making them essential in emergency medical care. Adoption is rising not only in hospitals but also in public spaces, home healthcare, and alternative care settings, emphasizing timely intervention during cardiac emergencies.

Market Overview

According to the World Heart Report 2023, over 500 million people worldwide suffer from cardiovascular disorders, and the American Heart Association (2023) projects that more than 12 million people will be affected by atrial fibrillation by 2030. Additionally, the British Heart Foundation (2024) estimates around 200 million people globally suffer from coronary artery disease.

Technological innovations are transforming the defibrillator market. Patch-based wearable defibrillators by Element Science, approved in the UK and CE-marked in Europe in 2024, offer non-invasive options for at-risk patients. Similarly, Medtronic’s Aurora EV-ICDTM MRI SureScanTM Extravascular Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator and Epsila EVTM MRI SureScanTM defibrillation lead, approved in 2023, allow advanced cardiac monitoring with reduced procedural complexity. These innovations enhance accessibility and improve patient outcomes.

“I wouldn’t dare have an expectation for an audience to receive anything in any sort of specific way,” Mr. Johnson said.
“Somewhere in the 150s,” Dmitry Shapiro, a co-owner of the baths, said after checking the temperature in the Russian Room.
“There’s a vulnerability to it.” Mr. Johnson got the room’s attention by asking everyone to clap once.
The theatergoers cheered, filing out of the Russian Room and into the cold plunge.","Style|Half Naked and Sweating With Strangers, for Art

If the subway is the great equalizer, so is the sauna, where social classes dissolve into a shared suffering. On a humid, rainy night, theatergoers gathered at the Russian and Turkish Baths in the East Village for a taste of both.

Attendees old and young stripped down to swimsuits and navy robes to see “Dutchman,” a play set in a sweltering, un-air-conditioned subway car. It’s the second time the production has been staged at the bathhouse on 10th Street. In 2013, Mr. Johnson, primarily a visual artist and filmmaker, adapted and directed Amiri Baraka’s 1964 play about race and sex, and, inspired by his weekly shvitz, staged it in a sauna.

“It felt so natural,” Mr. Johnson, 48, said of the dramatic setting. “It’s almost strangely obvious.”

Now, the one-act play is back for a five-night run to mark the 20th anniversary of Performa, the New York performance-art biennial. The revival also coincides with Mr. Johnson’s first major museum survey, on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum through mid-January.

“I wouldn’t dare have an expectation for an audience to receive anything in any sort of specific way,” Mr. Johnson said. “I would like for them to be really present. And I think I’ve created a condition, and the circumstance, to which that presence is almost guaranteed.”

It is not a show for the faint of heart. Racial slurs are hurled multiple times, and, in temperatures that far exceed most home thermostats, one could actually faint.

“Somewhere in the 150s,” Dmitry Shapiro, a co-owner of the baths, said after checking the temperature in the Russian Room. Lower than the 194 degrees it’s typically set to, but hot enough to dry out beef for jerky.

The evening began in the bathhouse’s restaurant, where attendees lounged in their matching wrap-tie robes, without their phones, and chatted beneath the “Russian Home Cooking” menu (daily offerings include “beer shrimp,” tuna salad and Anna’s borscht).

“I think even the way we’re entering into this is part of the experience,” said Alexandria Pang, 35, a global luxury brands director and a member of Performa’s young visionaries steering committee. “There’s a vulnerability to it.”

Mr. Johnson got the room’s attention by asking everyone to clap once. He then warned that we’d soon all be “on top of each other” and asked more experienced sauna-goers to sit higher up.

“Heat rises,” he said. “It’s a simple science lesson.”

Attendees clutched the railing as they descended the stairs, careful not to slip, to the cavernous baths, where the play unfolded over three spaces: The Turkish Sauna, a rest area and the Russian Room, the spa’s crown jewel.

The group of 40 crammed into the wooden benches as the actors, lit entirely by flashlights, took the center of the room, inches from the audience’s faces.

In “Dutchman” a Black man named Clay meets a white woman named Lula. The premise is simple: She approaches him on the train, they flirt. But what ensues is a volley that devolves into a pressure cooker of aggression.

The show, a tight 45 minutes with dialogue so sharp it bites alongside the heat, stars just two actors: Jerod Haynes and Tori Ernst.

It’s a return to the role for Ms. Ernst, who played Lula in the 2013 staging when she was 22.

“It’s sort of that old saying of like, ‘Wow, this piece is still relevant, how amazing and how sad,’” she said. “I think that that’s really struck me this time around.”

Ms. Ernst, hair in a high ponytail and clad in a red bikini, red lipstick and a black mesh dress, taunts Clay with seductive advances, then swings into wild monologues oscillating from the dismissive, “You’re a well‐known type,” to the surreal, “You look like death eating a soda cracker.”

As the heat took hold of the audience, shoulders began to slump, plastic popped as guests reached for their bottles, and some ditched the robes entirely.

By the time the show reached the Russian Room, Lula’s flirtation was no longer eccentric. She shrieked and moaned and cooed in baby voice, rabid with racist remarks.

Everyone in the room was agitated. Breathing had become more labored. Suddenly, audience members turned their water bottles onto themselves. One man seated closest to the sauna stove stood up and sat back down, pacing vertically as he seemed to weigh the costs of exiting before deciding to ride it out.

“The heat is the main character,” Mr. Haynes said. “It forces you to confront what’s in front of you.”

As Clay grew taller, the audience withered. When he erupted, his rage, no longer contained, gained speed like a salad spinner. Droplets flung from his mouth and hands, joining the room’s sweat.

The audience had become their fellow subway passengers, wiping brows underground right along with Lula and Clay, until the climactic finale, when they became something darker: witnesses to murder.

As Lula’s knife fell to the ground, the audience was both stunned and ready to clap.

The actors collected bouquets of roses and took a bow.

“Now let’s get out of here,” Mr. Haynes said, using an expletive. The theatergoers cheered, filing out of the Russian Room and into the cold plunge.

Vibe coding might not topple traditional web tools anytime soon.","The AI-fueled vibe coding boom, in which anyone can create an app or website with a few text prompts, may already be losing steam.

New research from Barclays shows that traffic to some of the buzziest services, including Lovable and Vercel's v0, has slumped after peaking earlier this year.

Google Trends data analyzed by Barclays tells the same story: a summer surge followed by a slowdown.

The drop-off raises tough questions for startups that flaunted exponential annual recurring revenue growth just months ago. Analysts wrote that much of that revenue comes from month-to-month subscribers who may churn as quickly as they signed up, putting the durability of those flashy numbers in doubt.

""This waning traffic begs the question on whether app/site vibecoding has peaked out already or has just had a bit of a lull before interest ramps up,"" Barclays analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.

While these young companies have disclosed surging ARR, they could have ""questionable economics,"" the analysts wrote, noting that sales gains like this could come from short-term subscribers who might not stick around. (ARR is a common industry metric that extrapolates monthly revenue streams into an annualized figure.)

Back in August, I warned you about ""inference whales"" messing with the business models of vibe coding services. Heavy users racked up huge costs, forcing some leading startups to raise prices and make other changes to avoid big losses.

Raising prices can dent user growth, that's for sure. The Barclays note highlighted recent traffic declines at several top vibe coding sites:

Lovable, which hit $100 million ARR in June, is down 40%.

Vercel's v0 has seen visits plunge 64% since May, according to data Barclays shared with investors this week. (Vercel recently put security measures in place to prevent unauthorized bot access to v0 outputs, so this may have contributed to some traffic decline.)

Bolt.new slipped 27% since June.

Even Replit, one of the more resilient players, has cooled, with traffic slipping slightly.

Eric Simons, CEO of Bolt.new, told me recently that vibe coding services are seeing higher customer churn and need to expand into stickier offerings.

Indeed, in August Bolt.new rolled out new features and an updated subscription aimed at keeping customers engaged for longer.

""This is the problem across all these companies right now. The churn rate for everyone is really high,"" Simons said. ""You have to build a retentive business.""

Don't write off vibe coding yet, though. The tools, which blur the line between drag-and-drop builders and full-on coding, are still in the experimental stage. They're most popular with AI-native early adopters, who use them to sketch out ideas but often hit a wall when the code gets messy. For mass-market users, that last 5% of polish remains a potential sticking point.

Legacy players still see potential. Wix bet on vibe coding to expand its market with its recent acquisition of Base44, an AI-native site builder. Rivals like GoDaddy are also eyeing the field.

""It seems to us that 'everyday' consumers are still very much in the experimentation stage of AI chat interfaces such as ChatGPT, let alone having familiarity or experimenting with adjacent 'vibe coding' solutions,"" the Barclays analysts wrote.

The retailer launched exclusive morning hours for executive members in June, along with an additional Saturday evening hour for all US members.
The changes were designed to “increase value and convenience,” Costco President and CEO Ron Vachris said on the earnings call.
“We estimate these incremental hours have added about 1% to weekly US sales since implementation,” Vachris said, noting that executive members also receive a $10 monthly credit on Instacart purchases over $150.
“This has been very well received by our members.” The new perks have helped drive a “meaningful increase in upgrades” from gold-star members to executive memberships, he added.","Costco Wholesale announced its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 earnings results Thursday, touting its new global locations, digital upgrades and the impact of its expanded hours for executive members.

The retailer launched exclusive morning hours for executive members in June, along with an additional Saturday evening hour for all US members.

The changes were designed to “increase value and convenience,” Costco President and CEO Ron Vachris said on the earnings call.

“We estimate these incremental hours have added about 1% to weekly US sales since implementation,” Vachris said, noting that executive members also receive a $10 monthly credit on Instacart purchases over $150. “This has been very well received by our members.”

The new perks have helped drive a “meaningful increase in upgrades” from gold-star members to executive memberships, he added.

In the fourth quarter, Costco opened 10 new warehouses, including a relocation in Canada, its 24th warehouse in Korea, its second warehouse in Sweden and five in the US.

For the fiscal year, the retailer added 27 new warehouses — 24 net new locations — bringing its global footprint to a total of 914 warehouses, according to Vachris.

“We plan to open another 35 warehouses in fiscal year [2026], of which five are relocations,” Vachris said. “We continue to see significant opportunities for expansion, both domestically and internationally, across the markets where we currently operate.”

The company now has 81 million paid members, up 6.3% from last year. Renewal rates were 92.3% in the US and Canada and 89.8% worldwide, Gary Millerchip, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said on the earnings call.

“The decline in renewal rates was largely attributable to a higher number of online sign-ups entering the renewal rate, and this quarter included a large Groupon campaign in December 2023 entering the calculation,” Millerchip said.

Quarterly net sales rose 8% to $84.4 billion, up from $78.2 billion a year ago. For the fiscal year, net sales climbed 8.1% to $269.9 billion, compared with $249.6 billion last year.

The retailer also recently celebrated a few milestones, including the 40th anniversary of its $1.50 hot dog and soda combo, as well as replacing Pepsi products with Coca-Cola in its food court, Vachris said.

“Reflecting on fiscal year 2025 overall, our merchandising and operations team did a fantastic job delivering strong financial results while also investing in our employees and improving value and convenience for our members,” Vachis said.

“Our merchants adjusted their plans to mitigate tariff impacts and source items that our members need, while delivering the lowest price at the best value offers quickly and efficiently adapted to pay raises.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/112165543.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-26 06:04:15.821015

Funding to deepen within oncology With its new funding, Thyme Care plans to deepen its impact across the oncology landscape.
Its hybrid care model integrates with more than 1,000 oncologists through Thyme Care Oncology Partners, ensuring patients receive continuous support alongside clinical expertise.
“Thyme Care can balance these needs and is already making early progress with Fortune 500 companies.
This approach aligns directly with our mission to scale specialist-led, value-based care for complex conditions in employer-sponsored insurance.”","Cancer patients often encounter treatment denials, high drug costs, and hurdles that delay or prevent timely, affordable care. Thyme Care was founded to address these pain points. By offering value-based cancer care navigation, it guides patients through every phase of the journey, from initial suspicion to post-diagnosis, while reducing the financial and emotional strain of treatment.

Turns into a unicorn!

In a recent development, Thyme Care has raised $97 million in its Series D round, pushing its valuation beyond $1 billion. This is twice its value in mid-2024 when it secured $95 million. With this round, the total capital raised by the company accounts for $275 million.

Investors include CVS Health Ventures, Foresite Capital, Andreessen Horowitz’s Bio + Health fund, Concord Health Partners, Town Hall Ventures, AlleyCorp, and Frist Cressey Ventures. They were joined by new strategic investors such as Morgan Health, Humana, Texas Oncology, and Memorial Hermann Health System.

Funding to deepen within oncology

With its new funding, Thyme Care plans to deepen its impact across the oncology landscape. The company plans to target new breaking points in the cancer journey that drive up costs and cause friction for patients.

A major focus will be on strengthening its technology platform. Thyme Care intends to hire senior tech leaders to advance its AI-driven strategy, enabling the development of new member-facing applications and improved tools for care teams. At the same time, the company will continue expanding partnerships with both national and regional health plans to reach more patients across the U.S.

Founders with expertise

Founded in 2020 by Robin Shah, Bobby Green, M.D., and Brad Diephuis, Thyme Care brings together deep oncology and healthcare experience. Shah and Green are both alumni of Flatiron Health, a company known for transforming cancer data and analytics. Their leadership, combined with Diephuis’s role as president and COO, has fueled Thyme Care’s rapid growth and operational strength.

The company combines 24/7 cancer navigation services with oncologist-led interventions, technology-driven tools, and data insights. Its hybrid care model integrates with more than 1,000 oncologists through Thyme Care Oncology Partners, ensuring patients receive continuous support alongside clinical expertise.

This infrastructure has already scaled quickly from managing 10,000 patients in 2024 to 80,000 today.

The road ahead

The company is well-positioned to scale its integrated oncology infrastructure further. With major healthcare players now invested in its future, Thyme Care is set to expand its reach, improve patient access to timely and affordable treatments, and ultimately reshape how cancer care is delivered in the U.S.

By aligning patient support with financial sustainability, Thyme Care’s approach offers a roadmap for the future of value-based oncology care, one where patients are guided, costs are controlled, and outcomes are prioritised.

“The raise is overwhelmingly backed by strategic investors across the oncology care delivery landscape, including payers, providers, employers, and health systems who deeply understand the complex needs of oncology populations and who see firsthand the impact of Thyme Care’s model,” said Thyme Care President and Chief Operating Officer Brad Diephuis, MD. “This is evidence that oncology can lead the way in building scalable models of shared accountability and impact that healthcare has long needed.”

“The system was not designed for people with cancer, and too often patients fall through the cracks,” added Thyme Care Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Robin Shah. “My co-founder, Dr Bobby Green, and I have seen this from the inside out for decades. We’ve witnessed it at the bedside in community practices and in building national infrastructures at Flatiron Health and OneOncology, and we founded Thyme Care to change it. Our next chapter is about scaling what works while exploring new ways to tackle the barriers that still make cancer care harder than it needs to be.”

“Employers increasingly identify cancer as a top driver of their health care spend. At the same time, they care deeply about offering their employees access to high-quality, personalised cancer care, given the heavy burden that a diagnosis places on patients and their families,” said Dan Mendelson, CEO of Morgan Health. “Thyme Care can balance these needs and is already making early progress with Fortune 500 companies. They’ve demonstrated better coordination of patient care, improved outcomes and reduced costs. This approach aligns directly with our mission to scale specialist-led, value-based care for complex conditions in employer-sponsored insurance.”",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Thyme-Care-founders.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 06:04:09.015655

Hudson has announced that it has signed an agreement to represent H&M locally, with the first store set to open in 2026.

For years, Maltese shoppers could only get their H&M fix while abroad, but soon the globally loved brand will be available right here at home.

The first store will feature womenswear, menswear, kidswear and even home collections, giving Maltese customers access to the full H&M experience for the very first time.

“Hudson is extremely excited to commence this journey with H&M which culminates years of discussions to bring one of the most requested brands to the Maltese consumer,” Hudson Holdings Group Chairman Alfie Borg said, adding that the brand’s arrival is “a testament to Hudson’s reputation as a retail operator”.

Sam Miller, Head of Franchise H&M, added: “We’re thrilled to bring H&M to Malta with our partner Hudson, making elevated fashion and lifestyle accessible to everyone, while inspiring self-expression and creativity.”

This move follows Hudson’s partnership with H&M in Morocco earlier this year, where stores in Rabat and Marrakech have already reopened under Hudson’s management.

With its focus on style, value and sustainability, H&M’s Malta debut is being seen as a major milestone in local fashion retail.

The proposed fund, titled the Bitwise Hyperliquid ETF, was introduced through an S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday. If approved, it would directly hold HYPE and give investors exposure to the digital asset within a regulated investment structure.

According to the filing, the ETF would allow investors to gain direct access to HYPE by holding tokens in a trust. Coinbase Custody Trust Company has been named as custodian for the assets.

The New York-chartered trust company will secure digital assets and offer insurance through private carriers, although it is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

Bitwise HYPE ETF filed under the ‘33 Act

According to the prospectus, the proposed investment vehicle will issue shares on a continuous basis, with the number of shares left indeterminate under the registration.

The asset manager has gone the commonly used Security Act of 1933 route for its HYPE ETF filing, which requires a review timeline and rule change from regulators before it is approved.

The ‘33 Act is different from traditional funds regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which classifies funds as investment companies or a commodity pool, like the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF.

The SEC approved the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF filed in late June in just under 90 days, clearing the fund for launch on September 18, Cryptopolitan reported.

The filing also clarifies that Bitwise, as sponsor, will not fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Bitwise is also planning to offer the proposed product with the use of in-kind creations and redemptions. This means investors could exchange shares of the ETF for actual HYPE tokens instead of cash, which would directly link the trust to the asset’s liquidity.

The S-1 does not yet specify the exchange where the product would be listed, the ticker symbol under which it would trade, or the fees charged to investors. Approval of the product will also require a Form 19b-4 filing to formally kick off the SEC review that could take up to 240 days.

As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier this month, the SEC under chair Paul Atkins passed new generic listing standards for crypto ETFs that remove the need for the agency to scrutinize each product individually. If the underlying token has been traded for six months on a CFTC-regulated market, approval timelines may be shortened.

Bitwise ETF filings still pending approval

Bitwise has been expanding its roster of crypto-focused ETFs after its first proposal for a spot Bitcoin ETF BITB was approved by the SEC in January 2024, alongside 11 other investment vehicles from other issuers.

According to the asset manager’s website, under custodian Bank of New York Mellon, BITB has 74,070,000 outstanding shares and about $4,417 billion assets under management.

In July, Bitwise attempted to convert its flagship BITW crypto index fund into an ETF, which had initially received SEC approval, but was then placed on hold, delaying its launch.

The firm has also pursued single-asset funds for altcoins, filing for a spot XRP trust with the SEC in October last year, which was followed by filings from Aptos and NEAR products. Each of these proposals was submitted through the SEC’s EDGAR system, initiating lengthy review periods under which the agency has up to 240 days to issue a ruling.

So far, the Commission has exercised its authority to extend these reviews, with deadlines for Bitwise’s altcoin ETF proposals currently pushed to late 2025.

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

International Petroleum Corporation (""IPC"" or the ""Corporation"") (TSX, Nasdaq Stockholm: IPCO) announces that it has successfully completed a private placement of USD 450 million of senior unsecured bonds. The bonds will have a tenor of five years and a fixed coupon rate of 7.50 percent per annum, with interest payable in semi-annual instalments.

Arctic Securities and Pareto Securities acted as Global Coordinators and Joint Bookrunners, Clarksons Securities acted as Joint Bookrunner and SB1 Markets acted as Co-Manager, in connection with the bond placement.

William Lundin, IPC's President and Chief Executive Officer, comments: “We are pleased to have taken advantage of favourable conditions in the debt capital markets to refinance our existing bonds. As part of IPC’s prudent approach to business stewardship, we believe that this was an opportune time for IPC to refinance and extend the maturity of our bonds to October 2030, supported by the long-life nature of IPC’s production profile and reserves. IPC has been performing very well operationally and financially in 2025 across all of our areas of operations, including the transformational Blackrod Phase 1 development project which remains on schedule and on budget.“

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains statements and information which constitute ""forward-looking statements"" or ""forward-looking information"" (within the meaning of applicable securities legislation). Such statements and information (together, ""forward-looking statements"") relate to future events, including the Corporation's future performance, business prospects or opportunities. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable laws.

All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, forecasts, guidance, budgets, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as ""seek"", ""anticipate"", ""plan"", ""continue"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""may"", ""will"", ""project"", “forecast”, ""predict"", ""potential"", ""targeting"", ""intend"", ""could"", ""might"", ""should"", ""believe"", ""budget"" and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be ""forward-looking statements"". Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: the settlement of the bond offering, the listing of the bonds on the Oslo Stock Exchange, the use of proceeds of the bonds, the credit ratings of the bonds, and development of the Blackrod project in Canada, including estimates of resource volumes, future production, timing, regulatory approvals, third party commercial arrangements, breakeven prices and net present value.

The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC, including expectations and assumptions concerning: the potential impact of tariffs implemented in 2025 by the U.S. and Canadian governments and that other than the tariffs that have been implemented, neither the U.S. nor Canada (i) increases the rate or scope of such tariffs, or imposes new tariffs, on the import of goods from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas, and/or (ii) imposes any other form of tax, restriction or prohibition on the import or export of products from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas; prevailing commodity prices and currency exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; interest rates; future well production rates and reserve and contingent resource volumes; operating costs; our ability to maintain our existing credit ratings; our ability to achieve our performance targets; the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals; the performance of existing wells; the success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing, location and extent of future drilling operations; the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions and that we will be able to implement our standards, controls, procedures and policies in respect of any acquisitions and realize the expected synergies on the anticipated timeline or at all; the benefits of acquisitions; the state of the economy and the exploration and production business in the jurisdictions in which IPC operates and globally; the availability and cost of financing, labour and services; our intention to complete share repurchases under our normal course issuer bid program, including the funding of such share repurchases, existing and future market conditions, including with respect to the price of our common shares, and compliance with respect to applicable limitations under securities laws and regulations and stock exchange policies; and the ability to market crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully.

Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks.

These include, but are not limited to: general global economic, market and business conditions; the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves, resources, production, revenues, costs and expenses; health, safety and environmental risks; commodity price fluctuations; interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; marketing and transportation; loss of markets; environmental and climate-related risks; competition; innovation and cybersecurity risks related to our systems, including our costs of addressing or mitigating such risks; the ability to attract, engage and retain skilled employees; incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions; failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions; the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; geopolitical conflicts, including the war between Ukraine and Russia and the conflict in the Middle East, and their potential impact on, among other things, global market conditions; political or economic developments, including, without limitation, the risk that (i) one or both of the U.S. and Canadian governments increases the rate or scope of tariffs implemented in 2025, or imposes new tariffs on the import of goods from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas, (ii) the U.S. and/or Canada imposes any other form of tax, restriction or prohibition on the import or export of products from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas, and (iii) the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on other countries and responses thereto could have a material adverse effect on the Canadian, U.S. and global economies, and by extension the Canadian oil and natural gas industry and the Corporation; and changes in legislation, including but not limited to tax laws, royalties, environmental and abandonment regulations. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.

Additional information on these and other factors that could affect IPC, or its operations or financial results, are included in IPC’s annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2024 (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"", ""Reserves and Resources Advisory” and “Risk Factors”), in the management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 (See ""Risk Factors”, “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" and ""Reserves and Resources Advisory"") and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities, including previous financial reports, management’s discussion and analysis and material change reports, which may be accessed through the SEDAR+ website (www.sedarplus.ca) or IPC's website (www.international-petroleum.com).

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service issued a public health alert Thursday for Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce sold in 12-ounce clear plastic trays. The affected products have ""best if used by"" dates ranging from Sept. 22 through Oct. 1, 2025.

The meals were distributed to Walmart stores nationwide and are labeled with establishment numbers ""EST. 50784"" or ""EST. 47718"" inside the USDA inspection mark.

Officials discovered the contamination during an ongoing investigation into a listeria outbreak linked to chicken fettuccine alfredo meals. Tests confirmed the pre-cooked pasta used in the linguine dishes tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Officials are still determining whether it matches the specific outbreak strain.

Customers who bought these products should not eat them and should either throw them away or return them to their store. Items have been pulled from store shelves but the ready-to-eat meals may still be in home refrigerators or freezers.

Listeria infections can be especially dangerous for pregnant women, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems. The bacteria can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that may lead to fever, muscle aches, headaches, stiff neck, confusion and loss of balance.

For pregnant women, listeria can cause miscarriages, stillbirths or life-threatening infections in newborns. While less common, healthy adults outside high-risk groups can also become ill.

People in high-risk categories who develop flu-like symptoms within two months of eating contaminated food should seek medical attention and inform their healthcare provider about the potential exposure.",https://media.cbs8.com/assets/CCT/images/e0b99a95-7a47-4e03-b7f8-1892de1697fd/20250926T033023/e0b99a95-7a47-4e03-b7f8-1892de1697fd_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 01:01:52.384290

In-store is no exception, though it can be more difficult to measure, said Milena Krasteva, head of product for Best Buy Ads.
The activation could give members behind-the-scenes content or special offers, in addition to the physical, in-store activations.","Beginning next year, Best Buy will offer “takeover packages” to allow advertisers to appear throughout the in-store shopping experience, the company said Tuesday as part of its first-ever Best Buy Ads showcase event. Separately from the takeover piece, the company also announced new partnerships on campaigns with the NFL, TMRW Golf League and Dude Perfect, though it declined to share any further details on what those campaigns entail. It also said it will roll out new channels for measurement and self-service reporting features over the next year, aimed at allowing brands to better track results and optimize campaigns.

The store takeovers will allow brands to appear throughout a store’s footprint, interior and exterior, over a 30-day period — such as on windows, the entrance, physical displays, TV walls, PC displays, interactive screens and checkout counters. The takeovers will not add new screens but will allow the general ability for brands to fully own most of the store and leverage existing screens or physical assets in new ways, the company said. There are new opportunities for advertisements on existing digital screens in Geek Squad areas, store pickup, and the POS system and digital screens in the mobile department.

Lisa Valentino, president of Best Buy Ads, told Modern Retail that this comes as Best Buy has gotten many questions from advertisers on how they can use the retailer’s thousands of stores to their advantage. She said the program will be open to both brands found in stores as well as non-endemic brands, which could include theatrical or streaming titles, quick-service restaurants, video games or automotive brands. The opportunity will also be open to third-party sellers from the company’s new online marketplace that launched this summer who want an in-store presence through advertising.

“We’ve spent the last several months really thinking about what kind of real estate we can unlock and assemble, and so, today we’re going to unveil that for the market,” Valentino said. “Looking at just some of the playbooks of some of our other RMN brethren, we want to be as flexible and as open for business across categories as possible.”

The in-store takeovers will add new real estate for campaigns to play on and allow the entire store — from the TV wall to the PC monitors — to work together in concert, Valentino said. Best Buy did 3,000 campaigns as an RMN last year and expects to double that this year, according to Valentino, driven by an in-house creative agency and 70,000-square-foot creative hub called Best Buy Studios, which opened in 2023.

The ad placements “can all be telling a sequential story as consumers come into the store, and we want to help enable that creatively,” Valentino said.

Best Buy’s Chief Marketing Officer, Jennie Weber, describes the in-store takeovers as a top-of-funnel asset that drives brand awareness. “The advertisers will really sense that the consumers are seeing their ads,” Weber said in an interview. “It is right in the customer journey, so it helps them really make decisions.”

Weber added that, through studies of the customer experience, she believes the company has a good sense of what would be a distraction or interrupt the shopping journey.

“The placements in the store are really curated to actually enable and improve that customer experience,” Weber said, adding that the goal is to prioritize the customer experience and layer this on in a way that meets the needs of advertisers. “For example, we keep our sight lines really clear. The signage that we’re adding doesn’t disrupt that. We make sure we’ve got really clear wayfinding for customers when they walk in; this package does not disrupt that.”

Of course, measurability is key for brands to determine the success of retail media activations. In-store is no exception, though it can be more difficult to measure, said Milena Krasteva, head of product for Best Buy Ads. She said the company will look at how many units were sold as well as any other metrics that non-endemic brands may be interested in. For example, movie studios may want to track ticket sales or restaurant chains may want to track app downloads.

“It’s not just about making sure the experience was meaningful, but it’s also about making sure that it was impactful,” Krasteva told Modern Retail. “Whether you’re buying awareness, consideration or performance, it’s all about performance, at the end of the day.”

Additionally, the retailer will offer the opportunity for advertisers to be visible in the area of the store where customers pick up items. According to Valentino, 30-40% of all online sales are picked up in stores. One example of a recent large-scale activation that both relates to pickup and demonstrates how Best Buy can work with brands was the Nintendo Switch 2 launch in June. Valentino said because 70% of its Switch 2 preorders wanted to pick up from the store, the stores held midnight releases for the first time in years. The company also brought in gaming trucks where gamers could try the new console.

The midnight releases “became a huge social frenzy,” Valentino said. “The amount of buzz we got socially was unexpected. I think it blew past all of our expectations, but it was also a huge payoff for Nintendo.”

Best Buy execs believe this demonstrates how the company hopes to be collaborative with brands and with non-endemic advertisers.

“We’ve gotten questions from, ‘Can we put a car in your store?’ to ‘Can we offer quick-service discounts?’ … Ninety-three percent of a lot of big quick-service restaurants are in a one-mile radius of a Best Buy,” Valentino said. “And so, we have this opportunity to think about all the ways in which we can bring these products to life.”

The big difference between Best Buy’s and other retail media networks is the specificity of the company’s consumer electronics-focused audience, said retail media analyst Andrew Lipsman of Media, Ads + Commerce.

“That specificity can be a blessing and a curse,” Lipsman said. “It’s a blessing because it’s high-relevance for those who are typically going to advertise there, but the downside is simply that it’s not as wide a set of advertisers — hence why creating this non-endemic opportunity is so critical. Otherwise, if your growth remains strictly from endemic advertisers, then it limits the potential you really have to grow by growing those accounts.”

In the non-endemic realm, Valentino — who has roots in film as a former Disney executive — imagines a hypothetical large-scale activation around a new, big action movie that could tap into the 100 million members of Best Buy’s loyalty programs. The activation could give members behind-the-scenes content or special offers, in addition to the physical, in-store activations.

“There are different ways we can attach assets to make this really feel impactful and big,” she said. “We do think it’s going to inspire a higher level of creativity with brands … doing something that is award-winning from a creative standpoint and really breaks through.”",https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/BestBuyAds_Unpacked_InteriorIllustrations5.png,N,,2025-09-26 01:01:28.831719

MiCA-Backed Euro Stablecoin Coming Next Year

On September 25, Dutch lender ING released a joint statement from the banking consortium regarding the Euro stablecoin project.

The stablecoin is designed to comply with MiCA regulations and is expected to be issued in the second half of 2026.

This recent push for a euro-backed stablecoin comes as French bank Société Générale’s Forge subsidiary announced that its USD-backed stablecoin, USDCV, will debut on Bullish Europe as its initial listing venue.

The initiative by leading European banks aims to create a trusted European payment standard within the digital ecosystem. It also aligns with the EU’s broader goal of providing a local alternative to US-dominated stablecoins while strengthening Europe’s strategic autonomy in payments.

The founding banks have also set up a new company based in the Netherlands, ING’s home country.

This entity will manage and oversee the development of the stablecoin. Speaking on the development, Floris Lugt, digital assets lead at ING, said:

“Digital payments are key for new euro-denominated payments and financial market infrastructure. They offer significant efficiency and transparency, thanks to blockchain technology’s programmability features and 24/7 instant cross-currency settlement. We believe this development requires an industry-wide approach, and it’s imperative that banks adopt the same standards.”

ING stated that the planned euro stablecoin is designed to enable “near-instant, low-cost payments and settlements.” It will provide round-the-clock access for cross-border transactions

The euro stablecoin will also support programmable payments and improve processes for supply chain management and digital asset settlement. It will cover assets ranging from securities to cryptocurrencies.

Digital Euro on Backtrack?

The announcement of a joint stablecoin initiative by major European banks comes as European Central Bank Executive Board member Piero Cipollone projected that the EU’s digital euro could be launched by 2029.

This is in contrast to the early 2025 development, which showed that the bank is pitching Digital Euro in answer to Trump’s stablecoin push.

Cipollone said the European Parliament is expected to present a general framework for the proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC) by May 2026.

Given the slow progress of the EU’s CBDC, under discussion since 2020, some commentators online have described the new stablecoin launch as a potential “digital euro obituary.”

1. Between Blockchain Ideals and Reality

From the beginning, blockchain technology has been built around two core principles: 1) radical transparency where all transactions are publicly visible and 2) decentralization where systems operate without central control. While these ideals shaped the early evolution of blockchain, the reality has diverged significantly.

In the early stage, early adopters developed services around transparency and decentralization. But adoption was limited to niche communities. As broader participation became necessary, it became clear that fully replacing existing systems with blockchain infrastructure was impractical.

For financial institutions, the challenges were even more pronounced. Radical transparency meant that trading strategies and corporate financial data could be exposed. Decentralization conflicted with the need for control and governance.

As a result, the foundational ideals of blockchain clashed with institutional requirements for privacy, oversight, regulatory compliance, and scalability. Institutions recognized clear benefits—such as real-time settlement and capital efficiency—yet most remained at the pilot stage.

Sustained growth, however, cannot rely on a small base of ideological supporters. Institutional adoption and broader market expansion require approaches that prioritize practical needs over philosophical purity.

2. Canton Network: A Pragmatic Approach

The Canton Network emerged to address the tension between blockchain’s ideals and institutional realities. Unlike earlier blockchains that relied on absolute models, it introduces flexibility that allows institutions to choose how information and control are managed.

This approach reflects the practical needs of financial institutions. Some information must be fully transparent to regulators but shielded from competitors. Client privacy must be protected while still enabling internal audits. Traditional blockchains, with their binary model of full disclosure or complete opacity, could not accommodate these nuanced requirements.

Canton Network differentiates itself through the Canton protocol, which enables institutions to meet regulatory requirements and manage risk while preserving blockchain’s benefits of real-time settlement and capital efficiency. This positions it as infrastructure that supports the transition from pilot projects to large-scale institutional adoption.

At its core, the Canton protocol enables independent control over applications and transactions, configurable privacy through a unique ‘proof of stakeholder’ consensus model, and interoperability across separately operated systems.

2.1. Institutional-Grade Workflow Design

This is enabled with Daml, a functional programming language designed specifically to automate multi-party financial workflows securely and efficiently. By leveraging Daml, Canton Network offers an alternative to existing smart contract frameworks such as Ethereum’s Solidity, delivering an architecture tailored to institutional use cases.

Daml structures contracts around rights and obligations, aligning directly with the nature of financial transactions. Every financial agreement can be broken down into a transfer of rights and a set of obligations.

For example, in a lease contract, the tenant has the right to occupy the apartment but the obligation to pay maintenance fees, while the landlord has the right to receive the deposit but the obligation to provide access to the property. Daml encodes such relationships precisely in executable form.

In unison Daml and Canton link disparate systems into a single automated workflow through smart contract-level atomic composability. In this model, all interdependent steps succeed together or fail together, ensuring transactional integrity.

A real estate transaction illustrates this: once the buyer deposits funds, the loan review begins automatically; upon approval, title transfer proceeds. Each stage is bound by clearly defined rights and obligations, and the entire process is treated as one indivisible transaction. If any step fails, the system reverts to its original state.

Equally important is the system’s flexibility and controllability. Contracts can be modified with mutual consent, allowing adaptation to unexpected changes such as regulatory shifts or court rulings.

By leveraging Daml, the Canton Network delivers the operational conditions institutions require: explicit definition of rights and obligations, workflows tailored to practice, and built-in adaptability and governance. This enables institutions to meet compliance and privacy demands without compromising efficiency.

2.2. Regulation and Privacy

The primary obstacle for financial institutions adopting blockchain is regulation, which is closely tied to data privacy and operational control. Among the most significant barriers is the Basel Accords, the international standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision under the Bank for International Settlements. Although not legally binding, these standards are typically implemented through national legislation, giving them practical force.

Under Basel rules, uncollateralized assets issued on public blockchains fall into “Group 2,” carrying a risk weight of up to 1250 percent. In practice, this means holding blockchain assets worth 100 million KRW requires regulatory capital of 1.25 billion KRW, rendering large-scale use uneconomical.

The Canton Network addresses this issue through a “public permissioned” architecture. Like the internet, which is open but restricts access to sensitive platforms such as banking websites, Canton combines openness with granular access control.

This is achieved through the aforementioned feature of sub-transaction level privacy. Only the parties directly involved in a transaction can view and record the specific data relevant to them, while other participants see nothing beyond what they need to know. In a delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction, for example, the bank would only view the cash transfer, while the securities depository would only view the securities transfer.

Daml smart contracts allow fine-grained control over data access and actions, ensuring that tokenized traditional assets can qualify as “Group 1” exposures and avoid punitive capital charges. The same mechanism also supports selective disclosure for auditors, enabling oversight without compromising confidentiality.

Canton thus resolves a key trade-off that constrained earlier blockchains. Full transparency on public chains undermines confidentiality, while full opacity on private chains impedes interoperability. By offering selective transparency, Canton enables institutions to comply with regulation and protect privacy at the same time.

2.3. Performance at Financial System Scale

For blockchain to be viable in capital markets, it must operate at the scale of existing financial infrastructure. Daily turnover in foreign exchange alone exceeds USD 7.5 trillion, and combined volumes across equities, bonds, and derivatives reach tens of trillions. Institutions therefore require blockchain systems that can match existing performance benchmarks, remain stable during peak periods, and support continuous 24/7 operation.

Canton Network addresses this requirement through a “network of networks” architecture. Unlike traditional blockchains that operate as a single monolithic system, Canton is structured like a transportation grid, where multiple subnetworks interconnect to balance load and ensure resiliency.

Participant Nodes: Nodes representing institutions, validating only their own transactions, and able to host multiple parties securely.

CSPs (Canton Service Providers): Regional infrastructure providers that connect participant nodes and deliver services aligned with local regulatory requirements.

vCSP (Virtual CSP): A global synchronization layer that provides the common backbone for cross-application and cross-regional settlement, with the first production example currently operated by over 30 major institutions.

This layered design functions like an urban transport system. Participant nodes resemble buildings, CSPs serve as regional road networks, and the vCSP acts as the highway connecting regions. Nodes can connect to multiple CSPs, transactions can reroute if one path is congested, and capacity expands by adding new CSPs.

A cross-border transaction between Samsung and Apple illustrates this process.

Samsung’s node connects to a Korean CSP holding digital KRW, while Apple’s node connects to a U.S. CSP holding digital USD. Both are also linked to the global vCSP. When Apple places an order, a smart contract escrows USD 100,000. Once Samsung confirms shipment, the escrow automatically releases funds to Samsung. The process completes within minutes, compared to the two to three days typical for international wire transfers.

Here, the Korean CSP validates Samsung’s KRW activity, the U.S. CSP validates Apple’s USD activity, and the vCSP ensures atomic settlement across the two networks. In parallel, other CSPs can process unrelated transactions (e.g., LG–Sony or Google–Microsoft trades), multiplying system throughput. Because CSPs operate independently, overall capacity scales with the number of providers.

This parallelized approach enables concurrent execution across synchronization domains. Today, Canton processes over four transactions per second and has recorded more than 3.5 million Canton Coin–related events in a single day. Digital Asset and its institutional partners have successfully executed on-chain U.S. Treasury transactions and repo trades, demonstrating continuous settlement capability even over weekends.

3. Building the Canton Ecosystem

Canton Network addresses the classic “chicken-and-egg” problem in blockchain adoption, where services do not emerge without users, and users do not join without services. It does so through a distinctive incentive and distribution model.

At the center is the Canton Coin, the network’s native digital currency. Unlike many blockchain projects where tokens are pre-mined and allocated disproportionately to founders or venture investors, Canton Coins are distributed solely on the basis of contribution to the network. There are no pre-allocations to venture capital or foundations. Participants earn coins only by providing tangible value—whether by operating infrastructure, developing applications, or conducting transactions. In effect, distribution resembles wages paid for work performed.

A second feature is the burn-and-mint equilibrium mechanism. Transaction fees paid by users are burned, permanently reducing supply, while new coins are minted as rewards for contributors. This creates a balance between usage-driven scarcity and contribution-driven issuance.

Reward allocation also evolves over time. In the early phase, higher rewards go to super-validators responsible for establishing the network’s infrastructure. As the system stabilizes, the share of rewards shifts toward developers building applications and services. This mirrors the development of a new city, where initial investment focuses on roads and utilities, followed by growth in retail and service providers.

4. Canton Network’s Path Forward

Since its official launch in July 2024, Canton Network has demonstrated strong growth by proving practical value to financial institutions, beyond technical milestones.

This progress is reflected in capital raising. In June 2025, Canton secured USD 135 million in a round led by DRW Trading and Tradeweb, with broad participation from major traditional finance firms. These institutions are not only investors but also active contributors to service development and operations.

The value of assets processed is even more striking. Tokenized assets on Canton exceed USD 6 trillion, larger than the GDP of most countries. The network also processes more than USD 280 billion in daily U.S. Treasury repo trades.

Concrete adoption cases are emerging. On August 12, 2025, Bank of America, Circle, Citadel Securities, DTCC, Société Générale, and Tradeweb executed the first weekend on-chain funding transaction involving U.S. Treasuries and USDC, signaling the emergence of a 24/7 capital market.

Stablecoin settlement is another area of traction. Circle integrated USDC with Canton, emphasizing the role of privacy controls, while Paxos joined as a validator. Institutions highlight the ability to meet regulatory requirements while keeping transaction details confidential in intercompany payments.

Looking ahead, broader adoption is expected, particularly in RWA tokenization. Real estate, commodities, and art are likely to follow, enhancing liquidity well beyond the current USD 6 trillion already tokenized.

Long term, Canton points toward a blockchain-based global capital market operating around the clock, unconstrained by time zones or borders. Developments such as Nasdaq’s application to support tokenized equities underscore this shift.

Canton thus positions itself as infrastructure optimized for the transition underway—bridging blockchain’s advantages with institutional requirements. Its trajectory will be shaped by how effectively it continues to balance ideals with real-world demands.

“We're focusing, yes, on capital markets, yes, on leasing, but also on services talent and talent across the board,” she said.
The brokerage has added more than 30 capital markets teams in the last year, Malkin said.","Cushman & Wakefield has been on a hiring spree in 2025, starting with its top positions.

Over the past couple of weeks alone, Cushman has named new leaders in three key markets, all leaving development shops to join the global brokerage.

It’s part of a broader push to expand its ranks and capitalize on a rebounding market, said Victoria Malkin, Cushman & Wakefield’s president of the Americas.

All told, the brokerage more than doubled its 2024 full-year recruitment numbers across the business in the first nine months of 2025.

The firm has brought on three managing principals since Sept. 15: Chris Ahrenkiel in Atlanta, Anders Pesavento in Minneapolis and St. Paul and Shawn Jackson in Seattle and Portland. Combined, the trio brings over seven decades of CRE experience to the firm, with each new hire leaving leadership roles at development firms.

Ahrenkiel joins Cushman after a stint at Selig Enterprises, where he led the firm’s office division and leasing efforts at Google-anchored 1105 West Peachtree. Pesavento previously worked at Ryan Cos. as senior vice president on the capital markets team, and Jackson comes after serving as an executive vice president of asset operations at Urban Renaissance Group.

Malkin said when building its roster of talent, Cushman considers each market carefully to determine what background makes the most sense: an internal hire, someone at a competing brokerage firm or a leader from the investment world. She said the company likes to hire people from a multitude of backgrounds.

“There are times that we really look and value that investor perspective of understanding how our clients think and operate, how they look to service providers as their partner and what we can do to continue to push the needle,” Malkin said.

Cushman overhauled its Americas structure about a year ago, which Malkin said was designed to improve how the firm advises clients and to strengthen both capital markets and occupier services.

Malkin said the company is in a strong financial position and poised for growth, and that it sees an active market ahead.

“We also have a market that is improving in front of us, and now is our time to continue to build our bench and fill key gaps and make sure we have the right professionals to serve our clients across markets and product types and specializations,” she said.

The brokerage is following through on a growth strategy it began in earnest late last year, one in which talent is a “critical component,” CEO Michelle MacKay said in April. The recruiting push is only a couple of years removed from a bumpy 2023, in which Cushman cut $130M in costs, or 10% of its general and administrative spending.

MacKay said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call in August that the capital markets brokers it has hired this year have brought in triple the revenue as those it brought on in 2024.

“We're focusing, yes, on capital markets, yes, on leasing, but also on services talent and talent across the board,” she said.

The early returns are promising. Cushman’s capital markets revenue grew by 26% in the second quarter, with the company still in the “very early stages” of its talent acquisition plans, MacKay said.

The brokerage has added more than 30 capital markets teams in the last year, Malkin said.

“We are incredibly focused on recruitment and growth this year,” Malkin said. “We are seeing the growth from the investments we made in the business come to fruition.”

Cushman isn't the only national brokerage firm putting new faces atop major regional offices.

Think It's Too Late to Buy IBM?","Key Points

IBM's WatsonX AI platform order book exploded from $2 billion to $7.5 billion in one year.

Despite gaining 114% in three years, IBM stock still trades at a discount to the average S&P 500 company.

After years of stagnation, IBM has transformed into a legitimate player in the enterprise AI revolution.

10 stocks we like better than International Business Machines ›

Good old International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) is treading new ground after all these years. On Sept. 23, Big Blue's stock is trading just 8% below the brand-new record highs it reached over the summer.

The thing is, I think this centennial tech titan is just getting started. Here are my top three reasons why it's not too late to buy IBM stock today.

1. IBM's AI party is just getting started

IBM was a bit late to the artificial intelligence (AI) party, but the company is showing up in style.

The WatsonX generative AI platform had $2 billion of firm orders in the summer of 2024. That order book rose to $7.5 billion by Q2 2025. That figure also excludes IBM's plethora of AI services not named WatsonX, like the Granite platform for cloud-based AI services, IBM's custom AI agents, and the AI-focused version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

2. A Big, Blue serving of market momentum

As a result of the booming AI sales, IBM's revenues are growing at rates the company hasn't seen consistently since 2011 -- and Wall Street is noticing. The stock has gained 27% over the last year and 114% in three years, though it should be said that Big Blue's stock started from a deeply undervalued position in 2022.

You might see this price chart as a reason to stay away from IBM's soaring stock, but market momentum can be a funny thing. Sometimes it makes sense to buy a surging stock, and IBM falls in that category.

3. The stock still looks affordable

You see, IBM's stock still looks cheap, despite recent overperformance. Shares are changing hands at the perfectly reasonable valuation ratios of 22.7 times forward earnings (forward P/E) and 20.7 times trailing free cash flow (P/FCF). The average S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stock sports a forward P/E ratio of 24 and P/FCF of 29.9. This red-hot AI stock isn't exactly on fire sale anymore, but it's a significant discount to IBM's long-term business prospects.

Those looking for value stocks to add to their portfolio may want to use this list as a starting point for further investment research.

Why Focus on Undervalued Energy Equipment & Services Stocks?

Value investors seek to buy stocks at a discount to their intrinsic value. Long-term returns show that such strategies are advantageous. Value stocks, as a group, tend to outperform growth stocks over extended periods of time. Typically, value investors perform financial analysis of numerous metrics, don’t follow the herd and are long-term investors.

AAII’s A+ Investor Value Grade is derived from a stock’s Value Score. The Value Score is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of the price-to-sales ratio, price-earnings ratio, enterprise-value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, shareholder yield, price-to-book-value ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. The score is variable, meaning it can consider all six ratios or, should any of the six ratios not be valid, the remaining ratios that are valid. To be assigned a Value Score, stocks must have a valid (non-null) ratio and corresponding ranking for at least two of the six valuation ratios.

What Goes Into AAII’s Value Grade?

Stock evaluation requires access to huge amounts of data as well as the knowledge and time to sift through it all, make sense of financial ratios, read income statements and analyze recent stock movement. AAII created A+ Investor, a robust data suite that condenses data research in an actionable and customizable way suitable for investors of all knowledge levels, to help investors with that task.

AAII’s proprietary stock grades come with A+ Investor. These offer intuitive A–F grades for more than just value. It is possible for a stock to appear cheap based on one valuation metric but appear expensive on another. It is also possible for one valuation ratio to be associated with outperforming stocks during certain periods of time but not others. Some stocks may even have null values for certain metrics like the price-earnings ratio or the price-to-book ratio but not others. An example of this would be a company with losses instead of profits or a negative book value because of heavy borrowing. Negative earnings or book value result in non-meaningful ratios that are left blank or null.

6 Undervalued Energy Equipment & Services Stocks

Of course, there are countless value stocks that are worth mentioning, but this is a concise list of the top 6 undervalued stocks in the Energy Equipment & Services industry for Thursday, September 25, 2025. Let’s take a closer look at their individual scores to see how they measure up against each other and the Energy Equipment & Services industry median.

The Value Grade is assigned based on how each stock’s composite valuation compares to all other stocks.

The process for assigning grades starts with each variable for a given stock. The percentile rankings for all valid ratios that a stock has are calculated. So, for instance, a stock could have a price-to-book ranking in the 43rd percentile, a price-earnings ranking in the 67th percentile, a price-to-sales ranking in the 23rd percentile, etc. Then, those rankings are averaged for each stock. (A minimum of two valid variables are required, though all six will be used if available.)

Once the average of the individual variables is calculated, that average is ranked against all stocks. Put another way, each stock’s composite valuation is compared to all other stocks. These ranks are then sorted into quintiles from the cheapest 20% (a grade of A) to the most expensive 20% (a grade of F).

As always, we recommend that you conduct proper due diligence and research before investing in any security. We also suggest that investors utilize numerous grades, not just value, when it comes to deciding whether a company is a good fit for their allocation needs.

When you look at Helmerich & Payne, Inc.’s price-to-sales ratio at 0.64 compared to the industry median at 0.78, this company has a lower price relative to revenue compared to its peers. This could make Helmerich & Payne, Inc.’s stock more attractive for value investors.

Now, let’s assess Helmerich & Payne, Inc.’s EV/EBITDA ratio, also known as enterprise multiple. At 4.5, when compared to the industry median of 7.1, the company may be considered undervalued in relation to its peers. Value investors could use the enterprise multiple to identify stocks that are considered overvalued or undervalued relative to their industry.

Shareholder yield is the sum of a stock’s dividend yield (paid over previous 12 months minus special dividends) and the percentage of net share buybacks over the previous 12 months. Helmerich & Payne, Inc.’s shareholder yield is higher than its industry median ratio of 0.80%. Value investors may look for an attractive shareholder yield because it can be a powerful tool for identifying if the company has a good management team.

As one of the most common value metrics, the price-to-book ratio evaluates a company’s current market price relative to its book value. Helmerich & Payne, Inc.’s price-to-book ratio is lower than its industry median ratio of 1.19. This could make Helmerich & Payne, Inc. more attractive to investors looking for a new addition to their portfolio.

New data from Trellis data partner GlobeScan shows that 85 percent of people around the world believe large companies should actively encourage governments to take stronger action on climate. While the percentage of those who strongly agree has slightly declined over the last few years, the overall consensus remains clear: People expect business to lead on climate advocacy. Only 15 percent of respondents express disagreement, underscoring the enduring public mandate for corporate climate leadership.

Support is especially strong in emerging markets, where citizens are looking to business as a catalyst for progress:

Kenya (94 percent)

Nigeria (94 percent)

Vietnam (93 percent)

Indonesia (92 percent)

Even in countries where climate policy is politically sensitive, such as Germany (70 percent) and the Netherlands (72 percent), strong majorities still support corporate engagement. In the U.S., where there has been significant pushback against corporate climate activism, as much as 78 percent of the public want companies to engage the government on climate action.

What this means

The public is not just open to corporate climate advocacy; they expect it. This presents a strategic opportunity for businesses to step into a leadership role that goes beyond internal sustainability efforts. Advocacy can build trust and legitimacy, especially in regions where climate impacts are felt most acutely. At the same time, silence or neutrality may be perceived as indifference.

At a lower price point but luxury nonetheless.

In my opinion, Loro Piana has a lot more personality, preppy classics with a quirky flair – as we’ve seen on Jeremy Strong. None of the Gwyn pieces, to me, have that character. I’m not saying they’re in competition, my point is the market, and who this is for and who it would appeal to. Because at the more affordable range for the mall shopper, there’s Banana Republic. Slightly above that is Reformation and even Ralph Lauren, with a certain section of their line. A higher jump from there is where you find a brand like Veronica Beard, for example. And Nili Lotan – similar energy to Gwyn and also sold at Goop. And then Loro Piana and The Row at the top. Who’s the person bypassing these options and choosing Gwyn? Not that they aren’t out there, I’m just curious who they are and how many there are.

Consumers want financial companies they can trust. Is your bank, broker or insurer on this most-trusted list? Check out our 2025 list and find out more about why building and keeping customer trust is vital to these companies.

Americans are feeling a bit more optimistic and resilient about their financial situations this year, despite stubborn high prices, interest-rate uncertainty and fast-changing U.S. policy on trade and tariffs.

Consumers are looking for the best deals, whether that's for groceries or in the companies they do business with. This makes it more critical than ever for financial firms to earn and maintain their customers' trust.

This trend is seen in Investor's Business Daily's sixth annual report on the Most Trusted Financial Companies. This independent customer survey, co-branded with MarketWatch, shows that over the past three years the highest IBD Trust Index score has risen from 85.3 in 2023 to 89.9 in 2025 for the top company on the list (out of a possible 100). This year, that company is USAA.

USAA serves active military members, their families and veterans. It tops the list of the 30 most trusted financial companies for 2025. Divisions of USAA (its credit-card, home- and automobile-insurance, and bank operations) account for four of the top 10 spots on the list. USAA also ranked highest on our lists in 2022 and 2023.

For this year's list of the Most Trusted Financial Companies, IBD and polling partner TechnoMetrica asked thousands of customers about their online brokers; fund companies; wealth managers; credit-card companies; banks; and auto, home and life insurers. The survey ranks companies in eight areas customers deem most important, including financial soundness, prices and confidence in management. We identify the 30 Most Trusted Financial Companies and the top four in each of eight business categories.

Financial companies where people put their money and trust

Customers ranked USAA's credit-card division as No. 1 on the list, followed by USAA's home-insurance and auto-insurance divisions in second and third place, respectively.

USAA customers lauded the company's customer service as ""fantastic,"" and appreciated products and services to support family members.

Michael Moran, president of USAA Bank, told IBD, ""We have a clear sense of mission: [to] ensure the financial security of our membership. That mission drives everything we do. We're proud of the trust we've built with our members by being there in the moments that matter as well as for their everyday needs.""

Financial companies' soundness is critical

In the 2025 IBD survey, customers declared financial soundness and security to be the most important attribute of the companies they trust. Quality of products and services offered was a close second. How well companies protected their privacy and security, along with ethics and values, also were of importance.

For IBD's list of the Most Trusted Financial Companies in 2025, we asked more than 6,200 survey participants about how they judged the financial soundness of the companies they do business with. The survey was conducted from May to July by IBD polling partner TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence.

There were again eight categories of companies in this year's survey: ETF/fund companies; online brokers; wealth managers; credit-card companies; banks; and life, home and auto insurers.

Financial companies vie for eight trust attributes

Our survey covered eight areas of trust. The attributes for the 2025 IBD Most Trusted Financial Companies survey were financial soundness, quality of products and services, ethical business practices, privacy and security, customer service, prices, sensitivity to customer needs, and confidence in company management.

The first phase of our survey was conducted in March and April. The purpose of that phase is to identify the trust characteristics, or attributes, that are most important to consumers.

Financially sound/secure received the highest weight (19%) in our study, topping our list of the most critical trust factors for financial companies. Quality of products/services took the second spot (17%), followed by the commitment to protecting the privacy and security of personal data (15%).

More than 90% of survey respondents said trust was ""very important"" in their relationships with financial firms.

The second phase of the survey was conducted from May to July. Using the eight trust attributes arrived at in Phase 1, respondents evaluated the company they most often utilize in each of the eight business lines.

Our survey not only tallies the 30 most trusted financial companies but also reveals the most-trusted companies in the eight categories of financial companies.

Schwab tops most-trusted investment companies

A standout this year, Charles Schwab (SCHW) swept the investing group, ranking first among ETF/fund companies, online brokers and wealth managers. Schwab's investing divisions also took three of the top 10 places in the overall trust rankings.

""Trust is everything,"" Rick Wurster, CEO of Schwab, told IBD. ""We strive to earn our clients' trust by putting them at the forefront of every decision we make and by treating them the way we would like to be treated. We are here for them when and where they need us.""

Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard are among the perennial favorites in the wealth-management categories of the survey. Fidelity topped the categories in 2024 and scored a hat trick in 2023.

Fidelity Investments' ETF/fund division, online brokerage and wealth-management division placed highly not only in the investing categories but also claimed three spots in the overall most-trusted list.

Other companies among the four most trusted in the investing categories include JPMorgan Funds (JPM); E-Trade, a division of Morgan Stanley (MS); and U.S. Bank, part of US Bancorp (USB).

Banks rise in trust index

Banks as a group are climbing in the IBD Trust Index. The group rose a step again this year, beating out insurers. But banks still lag investment and credit-card companies.

Joining USAA on the list of the four most-trusted banks are Chime, a fintech company that partners with FDIC-insured banks; Capital One Bank, part of Capital One Financial (COF); and Chase Bank, owned by JPMorgan Chase.

""Customers want more than just services,"" Andy Navarrete, head of global enterprise affairs at Capital One, told IBD. ""They're looking for great value, personalized guidance, compelling experiences and simple tools that make managing money feel less intimidating and more empowering.""

Most-trusted credit-card companies

Among credit-card companies, four stood out for customers in our 2025 survey.

They were USAA; American Express (AXP)); Discover, which was acquired this year by Capital One Financial; and Chase.

USAA, American Express and Discover also were the top three credit-card companies in the 2024 Most Trusted Financial Companies special report.

The top 10 on our most-trusted list

Financial-services firms have faced both internal and external challenges garnering the trust of their customers. Those that focus on the attributes in our 2025 survey, especially financial soundness and quality products, should be recognized for their successes.

These companies' divisions round out the top 10, ranked according to their IBD Trust Index score:

-- USAA, credit cards

-- USAA, home insurance

-- USAA, auto insurance

-- Schwab, ETF/fund companies

-- Fidelity, ETF/fund companies

-- USAA, banks

-- Vanguard, ETF/fund companies

-- Schwab, online brokers

Pivotal Manufacturing Partners and Declaration Partners acquired a 165K SF property 20 miles outside of Boston at 117 Hospital Road in Devens for $74M, the buyers announced Wednesday. The seller was King Street Properties.

The buyers secured $53M in acquisition financing from Goldman Sachs, Cushman & Wakefield announced Thursday.

Cushman & Wakefield's John Alascio, Alan Blank, Alex Lapidus, Rob Borden, and Heather Brown represented the borrowers in the transaction.

""As artificial intelligence and robotics continue to penetrate industrial supply chains driving new requirements for infrastructure, we are excited to own and operate this trophy real estate asset with specifications tailored to this next generation industrial renaissance,” Pivotal Manufacturing Partners Managing Partner David Robbins said in a statement.

The facility is home to Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a fusion power company that has been headquartered there since 2022. The company agreed to buy a 47-acre plot of land in Devens from MassDevelopment in 2021 and sold 11 acres of the site to King Street Properties through a sale-leaseback agreement.

CFS is a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Plasma Science and Fusion Center.

The company has made several major breakthroughs just within the last year, including entering into a power agreement worth more than $1B and securing $863M in fundraising last month. CFS is also on track to build the country's first commercial fusion power plant in Chesterfield, Virginia.

Nuances for Kiwi managers Chris Douglas, partner at Mapua Wealth, said it was for that sort of reason that it had been difficult for fund managers to outperform for a long time.
Lee said there were a number of reasons why active managers might underperform but one was fees.
Research consistently shows that the average active fund earns negative risk-adjusted returns once all fees, transaction costs, and other expenses are accounted for.
These costs create a high hurdle that managers must overcome to break even with a low-cost index fund.","Avoiding too much exposure to the United States in the first half of this year might have served active investment managers well, but they aren't generally delivering better returns than the market overall, new data indicates.

S&P Dow Jones Indices has published its mid-year Spiva Scorecard, which shows that 60 percent of actively managed global equity funds in New Zealand were able to outperform the S&P World Index in the first half of this year.

This is based on returns net of fees.

The scorecard looks at the performance of actively managed funds against benchmarks over a number of time horizons.

Active managers are those who select investments for their funds, to try to beat the market. In contrast, passive funds tend to aim to track an index.

S&P Dow Jones Indices head of index investment strategy Sue Lee said the global index was usually where active managers did not do well.

Listen to No Stupid Questions with Susan Edmunds

""If you look at the 10-year or 15-year performance rate, 100 percent of [managers] we examine actually underperformed the benchmark, so this 60 percent outperformance rate is actually very unusual, and one of the highest we've seen in New Zealand.""

She said it could be because of how managers dealt with US investments earlier this year.

""If you look at everything in the same currency, in USD, a lot of developed markets and emerging markets actually outperformed the US market peak, partly driven by the sharp depreciation of the US dollar...I think a lot of [active managers] actually had underweight in the US equities and if they have done that, they outperform the benchmark.""

New Zealand equities also lagged other markets in the first half of this year, partly because of concerns about the local economy.

Lee said 62 percent of actively managed New Zealand equity funds underperformed the S&P/NZX50 in the half-year.

She said there were a small number of stocks in New Zealand that had high index weightings, such as Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Auckland International Airport and Infratil.

""Active managers will be evaluated against the benchmark and how they how they positioned in these three stocks relatively to benchmark can actually be a very big factor in New Zealand ... these stocks did really well the past years and ... they became such a high weighting in the index.

""But then in the first half [year], that kind of flipped and each of these stocks underperformed the benchmark.""

She said any manager who had less exposure to those big stocks would have outperformed.

Nuances for Kiwi managers

Chris Douglas, partner at Mapua Wealth, said it was for that sort of reason that it had been difficult for fund managers to outperform for a long time.

""Globally if you didn't hold Invidia, Facebook, Google Amazon, Microsoft, it's going ot have a big impact on the performance of your funds.

""That's certainly been a headwind for sure over the last five or ten years for any active manager.""

He said there were some nuances to keep in mind in New Zealand.

The ""global equity"" fund universe here would include global infrastructure investments, for example. ""That gets caught up in the data and shows they've under performed but they should be in their own peer group in another market ... sometimes when you're looking at the broader peer groups they have, within New Zealand there's some different funds that are quite different characteristics to what a global equity fund would be [overseas] ... it's not always an apples versus apples comparison.

""The structure of the product, the biases it might have, the indices tracking which might not always nicely match what the S&P indexes are.""

Lee said there were a number of reasons why active managers might underperform but one was fees.

""Fees really add up over time and passive funds usually have a much better cost compared to active funds.""

Costs biggest deterrent

University of Auckland finance lecturer Gertjan Verdickt said it was ""exceptionally challenging"" for active managers to consistently outperform a passive index.

""First and foremost are costs. Research consistently shows that the average active fund earns negative risk-adjusted returns once all fees, transaction costs, and other expenses are accounted for. These costs create a high hurdle that managers must overcome to break even with a low-cost index fund.

""Second, our markets are reasonably efficient. This means that finding genuinely mispriced stocks is a challenging task, and doing so consistently over extended periods is even more difficult. Industry scorecards from around the globe confirm this, showing that the percentage of active funds that underperform their benchmarks almost always increases over longer time horizons, such as 10 or 15 years. Outperformance is the exception, not the rule.""

Verdickt said managers would chase returns.

""If you are a manager with a bad year, you will likely copy the strategy of a winner - making that strategy obsolete. Similarly, investors chase returns: if you invested in a loser, you will switch toward a winner. However, not every strategy can handle a significant inflow of capital.""

He said the most powerful predictors of future success were not the specific stocks a fund holds, but rather characteristics of the fund itself.

""The two that stand out are fund momentum (a fund that has been performing well tends to continue performing well) and fund flow (skilled managers tend to attract new investment).""

He said best-performing funds were often those that are ""too small"" in relation to their manager's capabilities.

""This implies that top managers are exploiting market inefficiencies before the broader market catches on and floods the fund with so much capital that the strategy becomes diluted.

""It's a common belief that a key benefit of active management is the ability to protect capital in a downturn ... However, my view is that the evidence on this is mixed: Recent analysis that tested top-performing strategies across different market cycles found that, while they did perform somewhat better during recessions, the difference was not statistically significant. This suggests that while some individual managers might successfully navigate a downturn, it isn't a guaranteed feature of active management as a whole.""

He said people should also remember that performance data was flattered by survivorship bias.

""A huge percentage of funds-in some cases up to half over 15 years-are merged or liquidated. These are typically the worst performers, and when they are removed from the data, the average performance of the remaining funds appears much better than reality. Any sound analysis must take this into account.""",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--FiVyvoz0--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1643826055/4NZW75H_copyright_image_140486?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-09-25 19:10:28.602479

This led to two questions: Why should businesses focus more on sustainable waste management?
And what can they do to make their sustainability efforts work?
Additionally, a 2023 Inside Higher Ed survey revealed that 45% of students considered environmental sustainability in their enrollment decision.
Sustainable waste management is not just about ticking boxes anymore.","Be it discarded to-go containers tossed in airports, soda cans discarded in stadiums, or excess food composted on university campuses, nearly all organizations and businesses generate large amounts of waste every day. In response, many invest heavily in sustainable waste management systems. But their efforts often fail to deliver results. The problem isn't a lack of intent, but rather poor integrated planning, operational inefficiencies, failure to adapt to changing demands, and inadequate employee and public engagement. This led to two questions: Why should businesses focus more on sustainable waste management? And what can they do to make their sustainability efforts work?

From rising global temperatures to overflowing garbage, the world is facing urgent environmental challenges. Hence, businesses now shoulder a responsibility that extends beyond market share and profit margins. The growing responsibility has moved sustainability from the sidelines to the centre of corporate discussion, making it a business imperative rather than an option.

As consumers become more environmentally aware, a brand's reputation is increasingly tied to its sustainability goals. A company's clear demonstration of environmental, social, and ethical efforts builds customer trust and loyalty. ""The best thing that can happen from a brand perspective is that their sustainability goal is reflected in brand value,"" says Julianna Doherty, the CEO of Recycle Away.

Recent research shows that sustainability not only reduces waste management costs and improves brand value but also significantly influences consumer behavior. People who were once concerned about price tags and brand values are now shifting their focus towards sustainable businesses, even if it means paying more. A study published by Brand Finance reveals that 11.9% of supermarket shoppers and 9.1% of apparel consumers decide their purchasing choice based on a brand's sustainability values. Additionally, a 2023 Inside Higher Ed survey revealed that 45% of students considered environmental sustainability in their enrollment decision.

However, despite this realization, many businesses still treat recycling and waste management as an afterthought rather than integrating them into their core strategy. According to research, 58% of businesses do not even maintain any formal record of their waste management practices, an oversight that can lead to reputational, environmental, and financial consequences.

Some well-intentioned, eco-conscious companies sometimes opt for the easiest and fastest solutions, rather than the most sustainable ones. For them, the extra effort required for effective recycling is often unnecessary. ""People sometimes assume that one size fits all,"" remarks Doherty, highlighting the need for customized approaches. On the other hand, a few companies spend large sums on new technologies but fail to ensure effective execution and management, leading to poor outcomes.

However, blending design-first thinking with human-centered strategies can dramatically improve waste management efficiency. Since collection and first sorting begin at the bin level, people's perception of trash bins directly influences their behaviour. By redesigning trash bins, using colour coding, clear universal signage, and strategic placement, businesses can improve waste separation and reduce the costs and effort associated with recycling. ""Colour and signage are important in making effective waste streams. Without them, people get confused about whether to use the bins or not, leading to waste contamination,"" advises Doherty.

Sustainable waste management is not just about ticking boxes anymore. It's about designing smarter systems that encourage people to use them in order to create a better environment. With the right mix of planning, tools, and public engagement, businesses can turn waste into a powerful opportunity for revenue and reputation.",https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4623789/recycle-away-systems-solutions.png,N,,2025-09-25 21:05:40.399119

Starting Nov. 10, Rima Abdul Malak will succeed Fouad Khoury Helou as Executive Director and member of the management committee.

L’Orient-Le Jour recently celebrated its centenary, marking a century of independence, editorial freedom, and journalistic rigor. Its longevity owes much to a constantly evolving newsroom, continuous renewal, and unwavering commitment to digital transformation — without ever compromising its mission.

Free from state or political funding and supported by shareholders committed to editorial independence, L’Orient-Le Jour represents a singular voice in the Arab media landscape, offering a pluralistic, free, and sovereign vision of Lebanon, in constant dialogue with its diaspora. Guided by humanist principles and rejecting all forms of fanaticism, it defends the rule of law, cultural and religious diversity, integrity, transparency, and freedom of expression.

A French-Lebanese national, former French Minister of Culture Rima Abdul Malak has consistently championed these values throughout her career, spanning humanitarian work, diplomacy, and cultural policy — from her work at Paris City Hall to the Elysée presidential palace, and from New York to refugee camps around the world. Building on a century-long legacy of resilience in the face of regional upheavals, she will lead L’Orient-Le Jour into a new phase of development: expanding its international reach, broadening its editorial offerings, driving digital innovation, and engaging new audiences — all while remaining true to its founding values.

""Rima Abdul Malak will bring renewed energy to extend the newspaper’s reach, adapt its business model to new industry challenges, and strengthen its influence both in the Middle East and internationally. Determined and sensitive, she has always defended press freedom and supported civil society in Lebanon. Her international experience, strategic and operational skills, and deep attachment to Lebanon and its diaspora are essential assets to secure the future of L’Orient-Le Jour at the helm of a committed team,"" said Nayla de Freige, Chair of the Board of Directors of the L’Orient-Le Jour Group.

""Nothing is more essential today than the cause of information. Defending it is a democratic struggle, the foundation of freedom, justice, and trust. In a world shaken by geopolitical crises, disinformation, and polarized opinions, L’Orient-Le Jour plays a crucial role in fostering informed and free public debate. I am honored to dedicate my energy to this next chapter of its history, consolidating its independence, amplifying its impact, and strengthening the vital link between Lebanon and all those around the world who continue to believe in its future,"" stated Rima Abdul Malak.

On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, Nayla de Freige wishes to commend the dedicated work of Fouad Khoury Helou, Group Director since 2021, who successfully expanded the newspaper’s audience while maintaining its financial stability despite the multiple crises that have shaken Lebanon and the region in recent years.

""I leave my position satisfied to have successfully guided L’Orient-Le Jour through a challenging security and economic context. I extend my gratitude to the shareholders, the editorial and administrative teams, and the readers of L’Orient-Le Jour, a newspaper that remains, in my eyes, one

of Lebanon’s strongest symbols,"" said Fouad Khoury Helou.

Born in 1979, Rima Abdul Malak spent her early years in Beirut before her family fled the civil war and settled in Lyon. A Political Science graduate, she began her career in international solidarity, working in Palestinian territories for CCFD (Catholic Committee Against Hunger and for Development), and later directed Clowns Without Borders, providing psychosocial support to children affected by war and poverty.

Culture soon became her main focus: at the Institut Français (French Institute), the Paris City Hall under Mayor Bertrand Delanoë, and as a cultural attaché in New York, fostering exchanges between France and the U.S. In 2019, she became the culture advisor to President Emmanuel Macron, playing a key role during the Covid pandemic to protect, through unprecedented measures, the press, artists and cultural institutions.

From 2022 to 2024, she served as France’s Minister of Culture, the first French-Lebanese in a French government. Her priorities included youth, heritage, creation, and media independence. She strengthened public broadcasting, promoted media literacy, supported press cartoonists, and prepared the ‘États Généraux de l’Information’ (a collective 9-month study by a French independent organization on the right to information). At the European level, she contributed to the Media Freedom Act which aimed to protect the freedom of journalists and media pluralism.

Since leaving government in January 2024, Rima Abdul Malak has been actively involved with several Lebanese institutions, including the Samir Kassir Foundation for Press Freedom, the Sursock Museum, Metropolis Cinema, and Saint Joseph University (USJ).

She sits on the Board of Reporters Without Borders, the international committee of ALIPH (The International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage), and chairs the jury of the ‘Planches Contact’ photography festival in Deauville. She also founded the “Rima Poésie Club » (Rima Poetry Club) and has produced several performances centered around her passion for poetry.

A distinctive figure in the French-Lebanese cultural dialogue, her career reflects a steadfast belief that words, arts, and ideas can help shape the future.

Founded in 1971 from the merger of L’Orient (founded in Beirut in 1924 by Georges Naccache and Gabriel Khabbaz) and Le Jour (founded in Beirut in 1934 by Michel Chiha), L’Orient-Le Jour is Lebanon’s only French-language daily. Its Board is chaired by Nayla de Freige and its team comprises over 100 professionals, including around 60 journalists.

The newspaper has given space to some of the most prominent thinkers, columnists, writers, and journalists of modern Lebanon. A standard-bearer of the Francophonie, it strives to provide independent, rigorous, and high-quality reporting for all those connected to Lebanon and the Middle East.

L’Orient-Le Jour is overseen by a management committee including Nayla de Freige (CEO), Elie Fayad and Anthony Samrani (Editors-in-Chief), Ludovic Blecher (Board Executive Member), Emilie Sueur (Director of Digital Development), and Nicole Karkour (Marketing Director). Starting Nov. 10, Rima Abdul Malak will succeed Fouad Khoury Helou as Executive Director and member of the management committee.

Since its founding, the newspaper has upheld democratic values, pluralism, openness, and cultural and religious dialogue. It won the 2022 ‘Grande Médaille de la Francophonie’ from the Académie Française, and the 2021 ‘Albert Londres’ Prize — awarded to journalist Caroline Hayek. Its credibility is recognized internationally for analysis quality, reliability, and insight into Middle Eastern affairs.

In June 2025, L’Orient-Le Jour became the first Lebanese media outlet — and one of the few in the Middle East — to receive the Journalism Trust Initiative (JTI) certification, developed by Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Modeled on an ISO standard, this certification serves as a mark of professionalism and transparency.

In 2020, the group launched its English-language sister publication, L’Orient Today, distributed digitally.

Founded in Beirut in 1929 by the poet Georges Schehadeh and taken over in 1955 by Salah Stetie, L’Orient Littéraire is the cultural supplement of L’Orient-Le Jour, covering all news related to books and literature in Lebanon. It showcases the best Lebanese and Arab voices writing in French, with Alexandre Najjar as editor-in-chief since 2006.

The L’Orient-Le Jour Group is fully independent, receiving no funding from political parties or governments. Revenues come from newspaper sales, subscriptions, partnerships, and advertising.

The Société Générale de Presse et d’Édition, a Lebanese public limited company, publishes L’Orient-Le Jour. Its shareholders are primarily the Edde family, the Helou family, the Choueiri Group, and the Pharaon Group. All shareholders are committed to upholding the integrity, independence, and editorial freedom of the newsroom.

Anyone under the age of 18 is strongly advised by children’s media safety and mental health organizations to stay away from popular artificial intelligence companions — social chatbots programmed to use human-like features and develop human-AI relationships.

Still, 72% of teens reported using AI companions at least once, according to a July survey by Common Sense Media, a research nonprofit that advocates for children’s online safety. More than half of teens also said they interacted with these platforms at least a few times a month.

Additionally, 1 in 3 teens said they’ve used AI companions “for social interaction and relationships, including role-playing, romantic interactions, emotional support, friendship, or conversation practice,” Common Sense Media found.

But parents and researchers are sounding the alarm that AI companions pose serious risks to children and teens, which can include intensifying mental health conditions like depression, anxiety disorders, ADHD and bipolar disorder.

Megan Garcia testified last week on the suicide death of her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, during a U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism hearing on the harm of AI chatbots. Setzer, she said, “spent his last months being manipulated and sexually groomed by chatbots designed by an AI company to seem human, to gain trust, and to keep children like him endlessly engaged by supplanting the actual human relationships in his life.”

Last fall, Garcia said she became the first person in the U.S. to sue an AI company in a wrongful death lawsuit as a result of her son’s passing. Garcia’s lawsuit against Character Technologies — the company behind the AI companion tool Character.AI, which her son used — is still pending in the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Florida Orlando Division. Other defendants in the case include the company’s founders and Google, which holds licensing rights for Character.AI.

Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission announced in September it is seeking information from seven tech companies regarding how their AI companion tools “measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.” Some of the companies involved in the FTC’s probe include Character Technologies, OpenAI, X, and Meta.

Notably, OpenAI, also announced it will begin implementing guardrails to better protect teen ChatGPT users this month, including new parental controls.

What can schools do?

The Jed Foundation, a nonprofit for youth suicide prevention that also warns against the use of AI companions among minors, recently penned an open letter to the AI and technology industry calling for it to “prioritize safety, privacy, and evidence-informed crisis intervention” for children and teens using their tools.

AI companions are “a serious issue,” said Laura Erickson-Schroth, chief medical officer at The Jed Foundation. “It’s really providing this kind of emotional support that isn’t coming from a human being, and it’s also providing incorrect guidance, frequently, to young people, giving them misinformation.”

As K-12 leaders navigate the prevalence of AI companions among their students, Erickson-Schroth recommends that they first develop an AI strategy districtwide in partnership with parents, students and community members. That should include conversations around ways certain AI tools may help or misinform users in schools and address concerns around student data privacy and data security, she said.

When it comes to the use of AI-based mental health tools in schools, Erickson-Schroth stressed that the technology “should always augment and not replace the caring adults in a young person’s life.”

Some promising AI tools can be useful for supporting student mental health, she said, such as personalized AI apps for meditation, mood tracking or gamified experiences that promote self-care. Some AI tools can even supplement therapy to help young people develop cognitive behavioral therapy skills.

However, she said, “when you think about young people engaging with emotionally responsive AI by themselves — without any structure around it — that’s when I think it gets really scary, because young people’s brains are still developing.”

Digital literacy programs are also key for addressing this challenge, Erickson-Schroth said. That can include classroom lessons that allow students to act as detectives regarding these AI tools.

PALO ALTO, CA, UNITED STATES, September 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- For organizations choosing new notebooks for their teams, artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical consideration. As AI becomes a part of every business workflow, it’s more and more critical to invest in devices that can handle on-device AI processing smoothly and quickly. Of course, notebooks still need to deliver good battery life and strong performance for everyday work applications, and depending on the industry, performance for resource-intensive and graphics-intensive apps may also be a consideration.

Principled Technologies (PT) compared an HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 processor to a Dell Pro 14 Plus laptop powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro and a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 laptop powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro. PT found that the HP system delivered advantages in a number of areas, including multitasking performance and AI performance. The PT report covers these results and what they mean, as well as looking at privacy protection, thermal performance, serviceability, battery life, and more.

According to the report, “For the demands of next-gen workloads, your teams need a system

and processor designed to handle AI and other rising applications. Delivering high performance scores, a workday’s worth of battery life, and comfortable physical user experiences, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC we tested also featured quickly serviceable components, a helpful built-in AI assistant, and intelligent privacy features. Compared to a Dell Pro 14 Plus and a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, each powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro, the AMD Ryzen™ AI 7 PRO 350 processor-powered HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC is a powerful and performant choice for the AI era.”

Meghan Markle made a sparkling statement at a charity event in Santa Barbara this weekend, debuting a dazzling new piece from her go-to jeweler, Logan Hollowell.

The Duchess of Sussex, 44, wore the 14-karat gold Queen Water Drop Moonstone Ring, which features a pear-shaped moonstone surrounded by a halo of white diamonds and retails for $4,195.

Her choice to wear a ring named “Queen” wasn’t lost on royal watchers, especially given her complicated relationship with her official title. Since stepping back from royal duties in 2020, the Duchess has carefully curated her public image — and her jewelry choices often speak volumes.

The piece may also carry a symbolic tribute to Harry’s late mother — moonstone is associated with the goddess Diana, as noted on the jewelry brand’s website.

For the charity event, Markle paired the diamond sparkler with a Carolina Herrera navy sleeveless button-down dress ($2,490) cinched at the waist and caramel leather Ralph Lauren Tenney pumps, letting her jewelry take center stage. She added her Cartier Tank Française watch, stacked with her signature Cartier Love bracelet and finished the look with a Jennifer Meyer mini-bezel tennis bracelet.

The ring — which Markle wore to Kevin Costner’s One805LIVE! charity concert — marks the latest addition to her growing Logan Hollowell collection. The mother of two has been a longtime fan of the Los Angeles-based brand, frequently sporting its celestial-inspired pieces.

Most notably, she has worn the brand’s constellation necklaces representing her children Archie and Lilibet during several public appearances, including her 2021 birthday announcement of her 40×40 mentorship program.

This January, the actress and businesswoman returned to Instagram after a five-year hiatus with a new profile photo in which she wears her Logan Hollowell diamond tennis necklace ($26,995).

Capital Rx markets itself as a transparent PBM, meaning discounts it receives from pharma manufacturers for favorable placement of a drug on a health plan's formulary are passed onto employer and plan clients. For context, the “Big 3” PBMs (CVS Health’s Caremark, Cigna’s Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth’s Optum Rx) have long been accused of engaging in spread pricing and rebate holding for profit.

Zooming out: The Big 3 PBMs control ~80% of the market. They’ve gained significant influence over prescription drug costs and patient access to medications due to their vertical integration with major health insurers. This has allowed the Big 3 to create drug benefit contracts that are often intentionally complex and contain opaque clauses, making it difficult for employer customers to understand their true costs and savings.

Yes, but: As healthcare and prescription drug spending keep rising for self-insured employers and their workers, businesses are increasingly jumping from one of the Big 3 to a newer PBM that promises pricing transparency and a greater share of rebates.

That’s due, in large part, to shifting federal guidelines that have narrowed the pool of people who are eligible for this year’s COVID-19 vaccine. In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines, but limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain health problems. Previous booster shots had been recommended for everyone six months of age and older.

CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

Last week, a top vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also voted to change the recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine to allow individuals over six months of age to access the vaccine after discussing their options with a health care provider, though the panel fell short of issuing a blanket recommendation. The panel also rejected a proposal to require a prescription to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

The new recommendations must now be formally approved by the acting CDC director before they can take effect.

In some states, top officials have implemented new policies to ensure that residents can access COVID-19 shots. But Georgia has so far been slower to respond to the changing guidelines.

Ahead of last week’s ACIP meeting, the state’s Department of Public Health announced that it would be halting distribution of the newest version of the COVID-19 vaccine to local health departments until after the federal panel issued its annual recommendations. On Monday, DPH spokesperson Nancy Nydam Shirek said that the agency is holding off on issuing statements until the CDC officially approves the recommendations.

Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at my local pharmacy?

In the U.S., pharmacies — rather than doctor’s offices — have increasingly become the venue where many Americans seek common vaccines like those for the flu, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV.

Part of the reason for that is convenience, according to Ashley Chinchilla, who works as the associate director of the Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences program at the University of Georgia’s College of Pharmacy.

“Pharmacies tend to have a little more flexible hours than a lot of other locations that offer vaccines,” Chinchilla said. “We tend to be open a little bit later. A lot of them have at least some weekend hours, and so for people who are working full time, it’s sometimes a little bit easier to get to a pharmacy than to another location.”

In Georgia, pharmacists can typically administer vaccines as long as they have an agreement with a supervising doctor, which most pharmacies do. But, Chinchilla added, “the state law that allows pharmacists the authority to administer vaccines under protocol without a prescription is tied to the ACIP recommendation.”

That means pharmacists practicing in Georgia are unable to administer an updated COVID-19 vaccine until the CDC formally approves the recommendations, and as a result, many pharmacies are still requiring a prescription for anyone seeking the vaccine.

At CVS, Georgia is one of five states where prescriptions are still required before pharmacists can administer a shot. Florida, Louisiana, Utah, West Virginia and the District of Columbia also require residents to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine prescription.

“Once the CDC approves ACIP’s recommendations, we’ll be able to offer the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines — without a prescription — in these states,” said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault.

Walgreens, which is offering updated COVID-19 shots in every state except Georgia, Louisiana, Utah, and the District of Columbia, said that it is also waiting for the CDC director to adopt ACIP’s updated recommendations before their pharmacists can administer the vaccine.

“Once that happens, Walgreens will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide, including in Georgia, to individuals three years and older, no prescription required,” Walgreens spokesperson Brigid Sweeney said.

Representatives for Kroger and Publix, which also operate in-store pharmacies, did not reply to requests for comment.

Where can I access the COVID-19 vaccine in my area?

Dr. Joanna Dolgoff, a pediatrician based in Hiram and a member of the Georgia chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that shifting policies on vaccine access have caused confusion among many of her patients over access to the vaccine.

“I think parents are very confused about what’s going on with the COVID vaccine,” she said. “They’re hearing all different things. They don’t really know what to believe. So I think there’s a lot of confusion out there.”

Her advice for parents and others who are seeking a COVID-19 vaccine is to check with their local primary care provider to get the most up-to-date and accurate information.

“Talk to your doctor, make sure that you will have access to the COVID vaccine,” Dolgoff said. “Find out where, locally, that vaccine is being offered, so that you go to the right place.”

Dr. Cecil Bennett, a family medicine doctor based in Newnan, said his office will be following recommendations from organizations like the American Academy of Family Physicians, which advises everyone six months of age and older to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. He also urged patients to follow the advice of reputable, science-based organizations.

“The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, are dependable organizations that are not a part of the political spectrum,” he said. “CDC, NIH, FDA have proven to be political entities and no longer scientific and dependable entities. So patients should rely on their doctors more now for proper advice and not listen to what they hear on television from political bodies.”

I don’t have a primary care provider. Can I still get a COVID-19 vaccine?

If you don’t have a primary care provider, you’re not alone. Georgia has broad primary care provider shortages across most of the state, impacting all but three of its 159 counties.

If the ACIP recommendations are approved by the CDC’s acting director, Georgia residents will likely be able to access COVID-19 shots at their local pharmacy without needing a prescription. But until that happens, residents may be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19 at retail clinics, which are typically operated out of grocery stores, pharmacies, and other retail establishments.

Common retail clinics include CVS’ MinuteClinics and Kroger’s The Little Clinic, which offer scheduled appointments as well as walk-in visits.

Thibault, the CVS spokesperson, said that MinuteClinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and therefore “are not subject to the same rules that apply to [a] pharmacy and do not require a prescription from patients to be able to administer the vaccine.”

Sep 25, 2025 Share

Humana is being required to cover more than $32 million in attorneys’ fees following its $90 million settlement of a federal False Claims Act case, even as a looming appellate challenge raises questions about the future of whistleblower litigation in the United States.

The lawsuit, filed in 2016, alleged that between 2011 and 2017 Humana deliberately inflated the bids it submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). By overstating its projected costs, the complaint argued, Humana secured more favorable terms for its contracts, ultimately leading to substantial overcharges to the government. “This is the first case of its kind to resolve allegations of fraud in the Part D contracting process,” Phillips & Cohen said in a statement at the time of settlement.

Humana did not admit liability in the agreement and maintained it had complied with federal rules. The company said it chose to resolve the matter to avoid the expense and uncertainty of prolonged litigation.

Chief U.S. District Judge Greg Stivers in Louisville, Kentucky, ruled this month that the insurer must pay legal fees and costs to the lawyers for Steven Scott, a former Humana actuary whose allegations of Medicare Part D fraud were resolved last year. “The first case of its kind to resolve allegations of fraud in the Part D contracting process,” Scott’s counsel, Phillips & Cohen, said previously in a statement about the settlement.

Scott was represented by Kellogg Hansen and Phillips & Cohen. His share of the recovery amounted to nearly $26.1 million, equivalent to 29 percent of the government’s settlement, according to court filings. Attorneys argued they were entitled to fees above the $10.44 million Scott had already paid them under a contingency arrangement. While Stivers permitted substantial additional recovery, he rejected a larger request for $41 million, finding that “shockingly high” rates could not be justified for Kentucky, though he agreed to apply higher national benchmarks according to Reuters.

The fee order comes as the False Claims Act’s “qui tam” provisions face their most serious constitutional test in decades. Last year, U.S. District Judge Kathryn Mizelle in Florida ruled that allowing private citizens to litigate on the government’s behalf amounted to an improper delegation of executive authority. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has urged the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold Mizelle’s finding. The Justice Department, by contrast, has defended the law. Oral arguments are expected in December.

The outcome matters not only for insurers but for all sectors reliant on federal reimbursement. In 2023 alone, whistleblowers initiated 979 suits under the statute, producing $2.4 billion in settlements and judgments, according to the Justice Department.

Whistleblowers typically receive between 15 and 25 percent of recoveries when the government intervenes, and up to 30 percent if it declines. In Scott’s case, the government chose not to intervene, giving him the right to a larger share.

A volatile landscape for health insurers

Humana’s exposure mirrors wider industry vulnerability. In July, Omnicare, a CVS Health subsidiary, was ordered to pay nearly $949 million in damages for allegedly billing Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for invalid prescriptions. The unit has since filed for bankruptcy protection. “Given that ruling and a number of other issues facing our business, we now are taking necessary steps to move forward and ensure the continued delivery of safe and reliable pharmacy service to our customers,” said Omnicare President David Azzolina.

For insurers active in Medicare and Medicaid markets, these developments illustrate both the financial stakes and the regulatory uncertainty surrounding federal reimbursement. Should the 11th Circuit limit or strike down the False Claims Act’s qui tam provisions, the enforcement landscape would be transformed – reducing exposure to whistleblower suits but potentially inviting other forms of government oversight.

For now, the Humana decision ensures a significant payday for the whistleblower’s lawyers, while the larger question of the statute’s constitutionality remains unsettled.

Earlier, Rahiri worked with South Auckland communities to improve outcomes for Māori patients after bariatric surgery.

Now, training to become a surgeon herself, is another way of leading culturally safe surgical care for whānau Māori.

“One of the projects that I'm leading right now, that's quite exciting, is centred on weight-loss outcomes after surgery. This is an area in Aotearoa, unfortunately, that is still growing in the sense that it urgently needs compassion, surgical excellence and equity embedded within its delivery,” says Rahiri.

Rahiri is the only New Zealander and one of four across Australasia to win the regional section of the prestigious international awards.

The win comes hot on the tail of her winning the John Corboy Medal, the highest honour for a surgical trainee from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.

Rahiri’s PhD, Exploring Māori Experiences of Bariatric Surgery, uses a kaupapa Māori approach to redesign surgical pathways, ensuring care is equitable and culturally safe.

In 2024, she won an early career excellence award from the University of Auckland.

Rahiri is the founder of Te Piringa Kōtuku – a Kaupapa Māori Surgical and Primary Health Research Institute and a pioneer of initiatives including Te Poka Pū – National Māori Surgical Interest Group to support and advance Māori into surgery.

“This Fellowship is not just recognition of my work – it acknowledges the communities, mentors, and whānau who have shaped me,” says Rahiri. “As a doctor, researcher, and mother of three daughters, I want my girls to know they can stand tall in any space they choose. And it reminds me that the work to transform surgery for Aotearoa is only just beginning.”

The L’Oréal–UNESCO For Women in Science Fellowship programme, now in its eighteenth year in Australia and New Zealand, champions equality and visibility of women in STEMM. Each Fellow receives $25,000 to further their research, with flexibility to use the funding in ways that matter most to them.

Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences deputy dean Professor Matire Harwood, who received the same fellowship in 2017, says she’s over the moon that Jamie-Lee has received the award, which will help her continue to create meaningful medical outcomes for Māori.

“She’s an amazing researcher and clinician who always gives to her community, as well as an amazing mum and partner,” Harwood says.

Alex Davison, chief executive officer at L’Oréal Australia & New Zealand, says:

""This Fellowship is more than an award; it’s an intergenerational commitment to help women overcome systemic barriers, build leadership skills, and inspire the next generation of scientists.

“With the recent international expansion of Foundation L’Oréal’s For Girls in Science programme and the rollout of UNESCO’s ‘Imagine a World with More Women in Science’ campaign, we’re seeing increased global demand for initiatives that elevate female voices in science.

“This is echoed through government policy. These programmes work together, recognising young girls inspired by science today who become the Fellows of tomorrow, and we are proud to echo these sentiments through our For Women in Science programme.""",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 17:13:25.150647

A handy, high-quality TV that slots into any room in your home

The picture on this Philips Smart TV looks good even if you’re sitting close. HD keeps text clear, and cartoons look bright and fun from a few feet away. Sports look good, without blurring, and older shows look clean. The edge around the screen is tight, so it blends in with shelves and stands instead of standing out too much.

Roku makes having a small TV simple. You can pin your go-to apps to the front page, continue watching shows right where you left off, and search to easily find where you can watch the next part. Free channels with ads are great for quiet afternoons, and you can block purchases and shows that are not suitable for kids. The phone app features the same buttons as the regular remote, along with a keyboard for logging in. Additionally, you can use headphones for private listening late at night.

The TV connects to everything you need. HDMI works for consoles and streaming devices, and ARC sends sound to a soundbar with one cord. A USB port allows you to view photos, and Wi-Fi connectivity is seamless. It’s lightweight, making it easy to mount, but it also comes with its own stand. Turn it on, select what you want to watch, and it remembers where you left off last time, so you don’t need to navigate through menus every time.

This small TV’s size is excellent for tight spaces and close couches. It gives kitchens a screen for recipes and news. Guest rooms get movies without needing a huge TV. And offices get dashboards that can switch to games on the weekend.

“There’s not enough capacity available in the United States or supply available in the United States,” Beekhuizen added.
So as a result, we have no choice but to import that key raw material for our product.” Dive Insight: Campbell’s has employed several mitigation strategies to offset tariff expenses, including collaborating with suppliers, finding alternative sources, employing productivity and cost savings efforts and price increases.
The food maker has found some success, particularly with its Rao’s brand of premium pasta sauce, by working with Italian suppliers to fight tariffs.
Campbell’s is also continuing to evaluate alternative sources for many of the goods it imports, including tinplate, but transitioning is a protracted process.","Dive Brief:

The Campbell’s Company said a lack of domestic supply of certain steel derivatives used for canning limits its ability to fully offset the impact of tariffs, according to CEO, President and Director Mick Beekhuizen.

The food giant expects to mitigate 60% of tariff costs in fiscal 2026, but over half of its projected tariff exposure is tied to Section 232 duties on steel and aluminum, said EVP and CFO Carrie Anderson on a Sept. 3 earnings call.

“There’s not enough capacity available in the United States or supply available in the United States,” Beekhuizen added. “If it was available, we would buy it locally. We’re not able to do that. So as a result, we have no choice but to import that key raw material for our product.”

Dive Insight:

Campbell’s has employed several mitigation strategies to offset tariff expenses, including collaborating with suppliers, finding alternative sources, employing productivity and cost savings efforts and price increases. However, the food company still expects tariff-driven expenses to reach about 4% of the costs of products sold in fiscal 2026, which began Aug. 4.

The food maker has found some success, particularly with its Rao’s brand of premium pasta sauce, by working with Italian suppliers to fight tariffs.

“We have some flexibility with some production in Georgia, and we’re working with the co-manufacturer on that with our partner in Italy,” Beekhuizen said on the Sept. 3 earnings call. “However, there is also only so much we can do around that.”

While some levers exist for certain goods, limited tinplate capacity poses a larger challenge which could drive price hikes and financial strain, particularly for Campbell’s meal and beverage business, executives said.

“We’re limited to where we can source tinplate. And as a result, we do have to look at some surgical price increases, and so that’s built into our plan as well,” Anderson said at Barclays 18th Annual Global Consumer Staples Conference 2025 on Sept. 4.

Campbell’s is also continuing to evaluate alternative sources for many of the goods it imports, including tinplate, but transitioning is a protracted process.

“So sometimes that’s taking a little bit longer, particularly if you want to switch suppliers because we want to make sure that we maintain the quality of our product and maintain that consumer proposition,” Beekhuizen said on the Sept. 3 earnings call.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/c3rUzDpz9qUOQmE4Io31GxTQEn2MJZVNivukcgasEBE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE4MzA5NTIzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-25 16:11:28.149460

So far in two games this season, Fields is 19-of-33 passing for 245 yards with 1 TD and 0 INT.","QB Justin Fields is set for a non-contact practice on Thursday, though HC Aaron Glenn said that the Jets' starter remains in the concussion protocol.

""So again, he still has to go through the whole protocol before he's totally cleared,"" Glenn told reporters ahead of Monday night's game at Miami. ""But I like where he's at.""

If Fields, who sustained a concussion on a hit by Joey Bosa in the Week 2 game against Buffalo, is deemed recovered from the head injury Glenn said: ""If he's cleared, he's starting.""

If Fields isn't ready, Tyrod Taylor would again lead the Green & White offense as he did last week at Tampa Bay.

The last time Fields played against Miami, he authored an epic performance.

It was during the 2022 season when the Dolphins visited Chicago's Soldier Field and Fields, in his only game against Miami in his four-year NFL career, was calling signals for the Bears. In that game he rushed for 178 yards — including a highlight-reel 61-yard touchdown — on 15 carries and threw for 3 TDs while posting a 106.7 passer rating. He accounted for the Bears' 10 longest plays from scrimmage in that game with runs of 61, 17, 17, 14, 13 and 12 yards and passes of 18, 16, 12 and 12 yards

His rushing total in the game set an NFL record for rushing yards by a quarterback in a regular-season game, surpassing the 173 yards by Michael Vick on Dec. 1, 2002 in an overtime win over the Vikings. Fields also became the first player in league history to rush for at least 140 yards and throw 3 or more TD passes in a game since at least 1950.

So far in two games this season, Fields is 19-of-33 passing for 245 yards with 1 TD and 0 INT. He has carried the ball 17 times for 97 yards (5.7 per carry), including a long gain of 33 yards, with a pair of TDs, 7 first downs while averaging 48.5 yards a game rushing.

In the past two games the Jets were forced to play from behind and last week scored 21 points in a furious fourth-quarter rally against the Bucs.

""We have to start fast,"" Glenn said, no matter if it's Fields or Taylor at quarterback. ""And another thing, what we talked about today, man, we have to have a high level of execution, and that's in all three phases, the offense, defense and special teams. Now we have to run the ball better. Listen, I know we were going against three really good teams that we played, but that doesn't matter to me.

""I have an expectation of this team on how we operate, and I'm not going to stand down from that, and our guys won't stand down from that. And they know for a fact that we have to prove it in those areas, we have to get our running game going, which opens up our passing game. We all know that, and we want to make sure we execute at a high level all three phases.""

Glenn and the Jets are also dealing with injuries to other players. LBs Quincy Williams (shoulder) and Marcelino McCrary-Ball (hamstring) have been placed on injured reserve and ""will be out a while,"" Glenn said. He said that edge Jermaine Johnson (ankle) and newly acquired CB Jarvis Brownlee Jr. (ankle) are week-to-week. RB Kene Nwangwu (hamstring), WR Josh Reynolds (hamstring), DT Jay Tufele (illness) and S Tony Adams (hip) all returned to practice.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/sxs1vdtij8vs8d5plznq,N,,2025-09-25 16:11:18.242778

Even as emissions regulations tighten across Europe, the company has somehow managed to squeeze more power and efficiency out of one of its 3.0-liter engines.

More Power, Fewer Emissions

The uprated 3.0-liter powertrain will be introduced to the M340i xDrive Sedan and M340i xDrive Touring in Europe starting this autumn. When working in conjunction with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, the engine now pumps out 387 hp and 398 lb-ft (540 Nm). These figures represent gains of 18 hp and 30 lb-ft (40 Nm) over the current version of the same engine in European specification.

This new powertrain will be added to the M440i xDrive Coupe, M440i xDrive Convertible, and the M440i xDrive Gran Coupe. Additionally, the M240i xDrive Coupe now comes standard with the more powerful six-cylinder as well.

Thanks to the extra grunt, BMW has been able to shave off 0.1 seconds from each model’s 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time. Perhaps more impressive are the improvements in fuel efficiency. In the case of the M240i xDrive Coupe, BMW says that fuel consumption has been reduced to 8.0 l/100 km (29.4 US mpg) over the previous engine’s 8.7-8.8 liters/100 km (26 US mpg) on the combined WLTP cycle. At the same time, CO2 emissions have also been cut from 199-200g/km to 183g/km.

BMW 3-Series and 4-Series models with the same engine are even more efficient. The M340i xDrive Sedan sips 7.5 l/100 km (31.3 US mpg) while the Touring is rated at 7.9 l/100 km (29.7 US mpg). The M440i xDrive Coupe, Convertible, and Gran Coupe are rated at 7.7 l/100 km, 7.7 l/100 km, and 7.8 l/100 km (30.5 – 30.1 US mpg), respectively.

It’s worth noting that the North American-spec M340i has already been delivering these figures since last year.

As a kid in Seattle, New York Fashion week felt like a far away land, completely out of my reach.
When we get to the Ralph’s Club New York event, I’m struck by the ambiance they’ve curated for the night.
Usher Talks Ralph’s Club New York Where do you wear your Ralph’s Club NY?
Shooting the Ralph’s Club New York campaign was an incredible experience, truly a masterclass in collaboration and vision.","I wake up during fashion week the same way I wake up every morning: later than I said I would, a much needed iced-coffee quickly in hand, listening to NPR on my phone. On paper it’s a typical morning, but internally I’m waking up with a rising ball of anxiety in my chest (a larger one than is normal before I’ve taken my daily Wellbutrin). It’s my first fashion week and I get to do it as an editor at i-D, a childhood dream come true.

I can’t help but fear that the “I’ve never done this before” of it all might be radiating off of me. I’m hoping a couple sprays of Ralph’s Club New York, Ralph Lauren’s newest fragrance adding the perfect touch of masculine intrigue to my aura for the day, and a good pair of sunglasses, will mask the nerves. I’m feeling the need to pinch myself as I get ready, it’s as if I’m in my very own fairytale, only this time the princess is riding the subway and femme-ing it up for the day in what feels like light drag. In all honesty I have hardly any idea what to expect, they didn’t cover “how to behave at a fashion show” in my degree but, as always, I’m eager to learn. As a kid in Seattle, New York Fashion week felt like a far away land, completely out of my reach. Now, it’s my job.

My first event of the day is the Anna Sui show, which she’s holding at the iconic Chelsea Hotel. Anna is a staple of Girl World and I’m lucky enough to be attending the show wearing pieces from her Fall Winter 2025 collection (a particularly exciting moment for a newbie like me). As I’m walking up to the hotel, the cameras are flashing and I’m reminding myself in my head that I actually am supposed to be here. I do my best to contain myself as I walk through the doors to see a copy of Anna’s new book, “The Nineties,” on each seat. I make notes of the soundtrack as I’m currently in the process of curating my music for the season.

After a fabulous show, some exciting celeb spottings (hi Sofia Coppola!), and a visit with my fellow i-Diva Nicolaia, I’m headed back downtown. My friend Ryan’s brand Saturn Los Angeles is part of an Epōc studios Discovered Brand streetwear pop-up so I make a stop in the village to say hi and check out the clothes. Before I know it I’m skipping happy hour to head home to catch up on our fashion week content for socials and get ready for the Ralph’s Club event.

Tonight, Ralph Lauren Fragrances are bringing some of New York’s finest to the financial district’s Hall des Lumiéres, in the old Emigrant Savings Bank Building, to launch the Ralph’s Club New York fragrance with the face of its campaign, Usher. Being the paramount fixture of American luxury, I’m expecting Ralph Lauren to draw many of the city’s premier gentlemen. As such, I’m feeling extra pressure to put my best foot (and look) forward. The fragrance itself is juicy, bursting with blackcurrant and sandalwood providing the perfect masculine finishing touch to balance out my glam for the night.

On the train to the party, I look back on the past few years of my life with my best friend (who also happens to be my +1). We lived together for an intern spring and summer just three years ago, and now we’re both in the city full time with big girl jobs. In just a matter of months I went from an anxious student who didn’t know what was coming next, to a (still anxious) editor at my dream magazine. After years of hard work, building up my portfolio and experience at my school’s student fashion magazine, this is my life! Three months in, I’m still waiting for it to feel real.

When we get to the Ralph’s Club New York event, I’m struck by the ambiance they’ve curated for the night. The atmosphere perfectly complements the seductive fragrance. Though I’m wearing some of my favorite heels and jewelry, I feel like I’m walking into a proper gentlemen’s club, suited for any and all with exquisite taste. The venue is breathtaking, it smells like Ralph’s Club New York and champagne, there’s Stevie Wonder playing, and I’m feeling like a bona fide gent. We take a lap, say hi to friends and colleagues, and sample the fragrance on an art-deco cardstock diamond from a sleek metal tray—all handled by white-gloved attendants. A little while later, Usher arrives to greet the crowd and join the party. With a drink in one hand and a mic in the other, he stands above the party to share some words on the enchanting glamor of New York—which has been distilled into a bottle and labeled Ralph’s Club New York.

After a very long day, we make a stop for pizza on our way home to keep me from getting too hangrumpy (my personal alternative to hangry). I’m ready for some sleep and a little time to unwind and feel deeply impressed by my colleagues whose fashion month continues into Europe (I’m grateful to be opening and closing with New York for my first time around). As the week goes on, I can’t help but feel like my favorite Lebron meme: smiling through it all, can’t believe that this is my life.

Usher Talks Ralph’s Club New York

Where do you wear your Ralph’s Club NY?

Usher: Ralph’s Club New York has become a true signature for me. It’s the kind of fragrance you reach for when you want to make an authentic statement, without saying a word. It is perfect for a night out, whether that’s a quiet dinner in the city or an evening connecting with friends. It just has that magnetic quality that elevates any occasion.

What are your favorite smells?

Scent is powerful. For me, I gravitate towards things that have a dynamic opening – a real vibrant energy, like a juicy fruit. And then it needs to evolve into something smooth, warm, and sophisticated, like a rich wood or a creamy vanilla. That’s why Ralph’s Club New York truly resonates with me. It has that distinctive blackcurrant that gives you that initial bright hit, and then it settles into that perfect blend of bourbon vanilla and sandalwood, which is just pure class.

Tell me about shooting the campaign. Any fun stories from set?

Shooting the Ralph’s Club New York campaign was an incredible experience, truly a masterclass in collaboration and vision. The energy on set was palpable, and everyone – from the creative team to the crew – was focused on capturing the essence of the fragrance.

Do you remember the first time you listened to Frank Sinatra?

Absolutely. It wasn’t just a listening; it was an awakening. There was such a command in his voice, an effortless cool, and a storytelling ability that just drew you in. It was pure sophistication, a master at work. He shaped the landscape for so many artists who came after him, and his influence is still felt today.

Talk to me about adapting such a classic. What are your favorite versions?

Adapting a classic, whether it’s a song or a concept, is about paying homage to the original while finding your own truth within it. It requires deep respect for the foundation but also the courage to bring a fresh perspective. My favorite versions are always those where an artist understands the core of what made the original timeless, but then infuses it with their unique voice, allowing it to resonate with a new generation without losing its soul.

The campaign is all about experiencing a side of New York that’s both old and totally contemporary. You’ve lived in so many places, do you see yourself as a New Yorker?

New York has a spirit unlike anywhere else. It’s a city that constantly reinvents itself, yet always holds onto its incredible history and cultural depth. While I haven’t spent my entire life here, I’ve certainly experienced its transformative power. The energy, the diversity, the relentless pursuit of greatness – it’s infectious.",https://i-d.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/RLF02_3d5192.png,N,,2025-09-25 15:14:44.032664

Top Democrats unloaded on the White House for turning up the pressure in Washington’s funding standoff, instructing agencies to prepare for mass layoffs if Congress fails to pass a spending bill by Oct. 1.

In a memo from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), seen by Politico and published in full by Puck, the administration signaled it is prepared to go further than the usual furloughs seen in past shutdowns.

“RIF notices will be in addition to any furlough notices provided due to the lapse in appropriation,” the document states, using the government’s term for a “reduction in force.”

The directive also warned that “programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown,” casting blame on Democrats for risking job losses.

Democratic congressional leaders responded by accusing the White House of weaponizing federal employment to pressure the opposition.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries went further, directly attacking OMB director Russell Vought as a “malignant political hack.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer protested that the tactics were “nothing new” and warned any firings would be challenged in court.

“This is an attempt at intimidation,” he said. “Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one — not to govern, but to scare. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government. These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uR0BjIJZfr4gkgynK6iL8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mediaite_845/2615b2366afc49c5584141e990f6e0f1,N,,2025-09-25 19:10:19.730429

Should You Invest $1,000 in CVS Health Right Now?
Before you consider CVS Health, you'll want to hear this.
MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and CVS Health wasn't on the list.
While CVS Health currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","One of the best ways for any investor to lock in additional portfolio upside is to start exploring areas where few others are willing to venture, especially when those are the least popular ones in the entire market.

In the consumer staples sector, one company (usually a quiet one) is starting to break into new 52-week highs. This theme is likely to continue.

Shares of CVS Health Corp. NYSE: CVS are now one of the hottest performers in the industry, especially as its market share has directly increased from the decreased footprint seen in its closest competitor, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. NASDAQ: WBA, a company that has been closing more and more physical locations each quarter.

That open field ahead could be one reason markets have become bullish on CVS, but that’s not all.

That's what investors dig deeper into the company's finances to consider where those could expand in the coming quarters. Today’s bullish section seems to be merely a shadow of the future potential this company can offer.

More than that, steady and predictable companies like CVS will probably become preferred now that the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has called the stock market a “Highly valued ""asset.

Newfound"" Optimism for CVS Stock

This $96.8 billion company has a wide road ahead of it in terms of size expansion, and its new 52-week high price could be the market pricing in this simple fact. More than just a 70.1% rally on a year-to-date basis, there are other fundamental reasons why CVS is going to be a winner for all its shareholders.

Shareholders, including Ameriprise Financial, increased their holdings by 5.2% as of August 2025, bringing their stake to a new high of $565.4 million as of today. As bullish as this may seem, this latest addition was only a shadow of the overall $3.3 billion in institutional buying of CVS stock that took place over the past quarter alone.

There must be a reason deeper than just technical momentum to explain why all this new optimism has been coming into CVS. This one must be coming from the financials themselves, especially as Barclays analyst Andrew Mok raised his price target on CVS stock to a new high of $87 per share, implying 14% additional upside and a new 52-week high.

That being said, this view is significantly higher than the consensus target of only $78.25 per share for CVS. This isn’t where the benefits end, however.

Strong Financials Boost Shareholder Confidence

Management knows that this expanding market share, following the competition’s de-competition, presents an opportunity to reward shareholders willing to stick by CVS through thick and thin. This is why the stock now pays $2.66 in dividends, translating to an annualized yield of 3.5% to beat inflation rates in the United States.

Here’s how to make sense of all this bullishness going on around CVS today.

As of the company’s latest quarter, which reported a net earnings per share (EPS) of $1.81, 24% above the MarketBeat consensus of $1.46, the stage has been set for an unexpected streak of financial outperformance ahead.

In the company’s press release, investors will see the leading key performance indicators (KPIs), such as net revenues reported at $98.9 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 8.4%. This is no easy task for a company operating in one of the economy's most traditional (and relatively steady) areas.

Not only did revenue increase from last year, but efficiencies also improved. Not many people know that CVS has strong connections to government health programs, which directly benefit the company in medicine and service inflation (which has been high over the past 12 months).

This direct aid has enabled CVS to reinvest in technology efficiencies, resulting in a smoother connection between caregivers and patients, which reinforces the strength of its expanding market share. The question now is whether these reinvestments are being made in good faith, particularly the shareholder dividend program.

Investors can answer this by examining the cash flow statement, measuring whether free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) is increasing in line with the rest of the company's finances. With $185.1 billion in free cash flow, CVS has more than enough room to keep affording (and expanding) its dividend program moving forward.

All these investments and government aid will likely send CVS into another earnings beat in the coming quarters, where investors can lock in new upside opportunities for their portfolios in a less crowded stock than the other hot names in the market today.

(part 2) | The Drum,Oscar Quine,,,,,https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/09/25/what-do-you-need-do-make-sure-your-brand-ai-ready-part-2,"Here are the strategies, opportunities, and challenges you should consider to ensure your brand is ready for this brave, new, LLM-enabled future.
Content categorization, taxonomies, FAQs, transcripts, tables and multimodal assets all help AI parse your content and trust your brand.
As AI tools favor authoritative, high-quality sources (think major news outlets and official websites), it’s crucial to keep brand information accurate, consistent and up to date across credible channels.
“The relationship between AI search tools and digital media outlets is not a balanced one.
And the more your brand is cited in reputable, locally relevant sources, the more confidently AI tools will surface you in their answers.","From virtual assistants to voice-led discovery, the way consumers find what they want is changing. Here are the strategies, opportunities, and challenges you should consider to ensure your brand is ready for this brave, new, LLM-enabled future.

Annaleis Montgomery, SEO account director, Tug Agency: “Appearing in AIOs, LLMs, AI Mode and social search all feed into each other and are all based on your website and how crawlers see the website as an entity. To optimize your content for search, it still needs to be website first; brand messaging is consistent, content is helpful and relevant and this is then demonstrated and reiterated across trusted and primary sources (and your social media platforms). Linking to or from these sources is vital in building your site as a trusted entity and one that LLMs are likely to advocate for.

“Creating topical authority still stands, but has evolved into understanding your audience and what prompts they are searching for. We are leaning away from individual keyword improvement to a cluster of terms or prompts that your website is satisfying. Leveraging AI measurement tools can also help you identify gaps in misunderstanding or opportunities for content creation.”

Anisha Kshetrapal, performance marketing consultant, Rika: “It’s already well-established that AI-driven search is shaping consumer behavior at scale, with Bain and Company estimating that about 80% of consumers rely on generative agents for at least 40% of their searches. Yet, many brands and their tech teams haven’t updated their digital properties or strategies to keep pace.

“At Rika, we began this journey with our clients over 18 months ago and one standout success is De’Longhi, spotlighted by OpenAI in a recent press release for the launch of the product recommendation feature.

“So, how can you replicate that? We’ve identified three pillars that make the difference. Firstly, content structure. AI rewards depth and clarity. Brands need to move beyond keyword tactics and build content that answers real questions with authority. EEAT principles (experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness) are central. Content categorization, taxonomies, FAQs, transcripts, tables and multimodal assets all help AI parse your content and trust your brand.

“Secondly, technical fundamentals. An API-first CMS, site speed, UX (great frontend) and schema markup are as important as ever. In the answer-engine era, they decide whether AI can crawl, contextualize and interpret your content. And thirdly, brand strategy. The more a brand is recognized and referenced, the more likely it is to be recommended. Above-the-line investment keeps you in the consideration set more than you know.”

Eli Ferrara, head of creative innovation, FCB Canada: “To win in the age of AI search, brands must go beyond traditional SEO and focus on shaping their narrative. AI models draw from both training data, which can be over a year old and largely outside of a brand’s control, and real-time web data, where brands do have some control. This is where the battleground lies. As AI tools favor authoritative, high-quality sources (think major news outlets and official websites), it’s crucial to keep brand information accurate, consistent and up to date across credible channels.

“Adding to the complexity, these models don’t always pull from the same sources, so ongoing monitoring matters. New tools now track how brands are represented across AI models, giving marketers a way to spot gaps and update content strategically. If you don’t shape the data around your brand, the AI will do it for you…and you may not like the result.”

Dennis Kirschner, CMO and co-founder, ShowHeroes Group: “To enhance their visibility in AI search results, brands should prioritize investing a significant portion of their marketing and communication budget into the open web. AI search tools primarily draw data and insights from premium publications on the open web. By focusing on these sources, brands can connect directly with the materials that inform AI overviews.

“The relationship between AI search tools and digital media outlets is not a balanced one. These tools extract data from publications, often with minimal compensation for the content creators. So, by investing more in the open web, brands not only improve their search visibility but also support digital publications and their high-quality editorial output, contributing to the long-term viability of the digital publishing industry.”

Jonathan Hassell, CEO, Hassell Inclusion: “The same way that accessibility helps SEO, accessibility can help improve your standing in AI search. While the exact methods AI tools use to determine which sources to display remain unclear, making your content accessible significantly increases the chances of being recognized.

“Take video content; it’s one of the most consumer marketing formats, but AI struggles to summarize it without a clear transcript. Providing accurate transcripts not only ensures your brand and names are spelled right, it also helps AI interpret, trust and understand your video content.

“The more accessible and well-structured the information on your site, posts, or documents, the more confident AI will be in using them as reliable sources. If images need to be scanned to read the text in them, AI is less likely to select your content, making accessibility a crucial strategy for standing out in AI search results.”

Conor Wynne, creative technology director, Verve The Live Agency: “Since the get-go, SEO has spat out one-size-fits-all results: glossy pages stuffed with meta tags, often making it hard to find what you actually want. But the demographic raised on 5G and web3 know exactly what they’re after. They don’t just want an answer, they want their answer, shaped around taste, context and nuance.

“That’s why AI feels so natural in 2025. It’s not a pile of links; it’s a conversation. It can zoom out when you’re exploring something new, or dig deeper when you need detail. And now, after some bumps, it’s pulling from places that actually feel credible: licensed feeds alongside the messy brilliance of Reddit threads and communities. That blend of fact-checked reporting and human insight is a potent mix.

What fascinates me most is the (maybe unwarranted) trust we’re putting into AI. We trust it not because it’s always right, but because it feels more personal, like it gets what we actually mean, not just what we typed. That’s exactly how audiences approach live experiences, too. Generic doesn’t cut it any more. We expect things to be tuned to our world.”

Shannon Millard, vice-president, platform solutions, Epsilon: “People are drawn to the kind of curation AI seems to offer. Like asking a knowledgeable friend, they’re starting to expect much more specificity. It’s not ‘sports underwear’ any more, it’s ‘what underwear is good for running in the summer and stops chafing?’ That’s the sort of query that AIs are picking up and brands need to write for.

“Review your site, your app and how you show up on retailer pages so the product data is structured in a way that machines can make sense of. Adjust titles, product descriptions and metadata to genuinely answer questions. Natural language is what AI understands best, so use it. And don’t stop at describing what a product is, explain why it’s useful in different contexts, for different people, across different needs.

“But remember, search is just one touchpoint in a much bigger journey. People are still influenced by emails, shop experiences, TV placements and app connections. Brands that combine answers to specific, human questions with consistent visibility across channels will be best placed to keep customers coming back.”

Dane Buchanan, global chief data and analytics officer, M+C Saatchi Performance: “AI search is rewriting the rules of discovery. For over 25 years, Google has defined how people find your brand. Now LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Perplexity and Gemini, are competing to be the first stop for answers – and brands can’t afford to sit it out.

“There’s no rulebook yet, but three levers matter: what’s in an LLM’s training data (often 6–18 months old), how your brand appears on today’s live web and the context of a user’s prompt. While brands can’t control these directly, they can shape them.

“The winning move? Create content that works for humans and machines: clear, distinct and grounded in real consumer needs. Back it up with credible proof, make it crawlable and diversify formats – text, video, structured data, FAQs and reviews. Then track how you show up across platforms. Once you have a benchmark, test, optimize and repeat.

“Stop chasing keywords. Start building cultural and credible brand-led signals that AI can’t ignore.”

Lorraine van den Biggelaar, head of organic performance, Locaria: “In the AI search era, authority wins. A well-thought-out keyword mapping strategy is no longer good enough. We are no longer competing for keyword rankings on a page-by-page basis; we are competing to become a source for LLMs. And they’re looking at how your brand is presented as well as how it relates to every other source mentioning it. It’s no longer just about the overall structure and content of your site; it’s about contextual authority and consistency across everything that’s out there.

“That all sounds great, but how do you apply this to your brand strategy? And if you’re active in multiple languages and markets, how do you take control? A few tips. Firstly, publish fact-rich, credible content, ideally containing first-hand knowledge and information from recognized experts. For brands that are active in multiple markets, this means going beyond simple translation. You need native-language content shaped by local search habits, cultural nuance and region-specific terminology. And the more your brand is cited in reputable, locally relevant sources, the more confidently AI tools will surface you in their answers.

“And finally: practice patience. Establishing a reputation, especially across multiple markets, takes time and should be part of your long-term strategy, because meaningful authority isn’t built overnight.”

Cora Lin, VP analytics, Jack Morton: “AIO – or, as we like to call it, GEO (generative engine optimization) – might sound complex, but succeeding in AI search actually hinges on simplicity. Forget technical overhauls; focus on clear, human-friendly content.

“The key? Strong, well-structured content offering valuable, accessible information. Ensure high website usability with easy navigation for both users and AI. Provide clear context, using structured formats such as lists and headings. Minimize jargon and instead opt for concise, engaging language. After all, people use AI to distill complex information into direct answers. Brands can win by mirroring this: being direct and easy to understand from the outset.

“If you’re already prioritizing clear, structured content, you’re well-positioned for GEO. Test your content by summarizing it with an AI engine to ensure key takeaways are easily understood and align with your brand’s message. In the age of AI, simple and accessible wins.”",https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/marten_newhall.jpg?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format,N,,2025-09-25 16:11:42.982971

This shift suggests increasing maturity in India’s commercial real estate investment landscape and growing comfort among domestic investors with large-scale commercial real estate exposure.","A domestic real estate fund has acquired a 2.4 million square foot office campus in Chennai from Singapore’s Keppel group for ₹2,550 crores, marking the largest transaction ever completed by an Indian fund in a commercial real estate sector traditionally dominated by international capital.

Prime Offices Fund (PRIME), managed by Nuvama and Cushman & Wakefield Management Private Limited (NCW), announced the acquisition of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum-certified campus located in Porur, Chennai. The transaction represents a complete buyout from Keppel’s real estate division and establishes a new benchmark for domestic institutional investment in India’s rapidly expanding office market.

Chennai is witnessing a surge in office space absorption, led by increased demand from Global Capability Centres (GCCs), Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) companies, with the city recording the second-largest absorption among metros after Bengaluru in the first half of 2025. The Porur campus serves a diversified tenant base comprising both global capability centers and domestic technology companies, positioning it strategically within Chennai’s most attractive office corridor.

NCW represents a 50:50 joint venture between Nuvama Asset Management Limited and global real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield. The Prime Offices Fund achieved its first close in January 2025 with a corpus of approximately ₹1,700 crores, making this Chennai acquisition its second major investment and demonstrating rapid deployment of capital in premium assets.

Gaurav Puri, Chief Investment Officer at NCW, described the acquisition as strong validation of their investment strategy. “Chennai continues to attract deep occupier interest, especially from GCCs, and Porur stands out as a micro-market with long-term fundamentals,” he stated, emphasizing the fund’s focus on sustainability, agility, and institutional-grade quality.

The transaction occurs against a backdrop of exceptional growth in India’s commercial real estate sector. The Indian Commercial Real Estate Market is expected to reach $49.30 billion in 2025 and grow at a compound annual growth rate of 21.10% to reach $128.40 billion by 2030, reflecting unprecedented investor confidence and occupier demand.

The first quarter of 2025 maintained strong momentum in the office market with large deal closures at a sustained pace amid robust fresh leasing activity, according to market analysis from Cushman & Wakefield. This momentum has particularly benefited Chennai, where institutional-grade developments with campus-style amenities command premium valuations.

The acquired asset offers institutional-grade infrastructure with excellent connectivity to key residential and commercial hubs, addressing the evolving requirements of global occupiers seeking sustainable, performance-driven office environments. The LEED Platinum certification aligns with increasing corporate emphasis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) compliance in real estate decisions.

Sustainability demand for green-certified office spaces is expected to rise by 20% in 2025 as tenants recognize the long-term benefits of energy-efficient, eco-friendly buildings, making the Chennai campus’s environmental credentials particularly valuable for long-term value creation.

The transaction reinforces Chennai’s emergence as a preferred destination for institutional real estate investment, benefiting from its established technology ecosystem and competitive operational costs compared to traditional markets like Bengaluru and the National Capital Region (NCR). Porur specifically has evolved into a micro-market with strong infrastructure development and occupier interest from multinational corporations.

For Keppel, the divestment represents part of broader portfolio optimization strategies as the Singapore-based conglomerate focuses on core business segments. The transaction multiple achieved reflects premium valuations for well-located, sustainably developed office assets in India’s tier-one markets.

PRIME’s investment philosophy centers on acquiring future-ready, sustainable, performance-led assets in strategic micro-markets that cater to evolving global occupier needs. The fund targets prime commercial office assets across key high-growth micro-markets throughout India, with particular emphasis on ESG-compliant developments serving blue-chip tenants.

The landmark deal demonstrates growing sophistication among domestic institutional investors and their ability to compete effectively against international capital pools for marquee assets. This shift suggests increasing maturity in India’s commercial real estate investment landscape and growing comfort among domestic investors with large-scale commercial real estate exposure.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-09-25 15:12:45.869203

The ""game-changing"" addition will be implemented in three New Jersey store locations.

On September 17, a ShopRite store in Clinton, New Jersey, announced the introduction of AI-powered shopping carts at the location.

Caper Cart, the carts being added to the chain, were developed by Instacart, a San Francisco-based company that operates delivery and pick-up services from grocery stores across the U.S. and Canada.

'IT'S THAT EASY'

The store said in a Facebook post that the cart automatically clips coupons for shoppers and shows the aisle location of items on sale in the store.

The cart can also scan and weigh items placed in it, providing consumers a running total for their shopping spree.

ShopRite shoppers can also experience a quicker checkout with these carts.

Customers can add a payment method to their Price Plus account, receive a one-time code to their phone and walk out of the priority exit near the first register.

""It's that easy!"" the retailer said.

The carts are equipped with a screen that displays prices to customers.

It also features a camera that helps recognize what products shoppers add to their cart.

The screen can also be used to select produce items which the cart can then weigh to add a total price to your list.

Two other ShopRite locations in New Jersey will receive Caper Carts.

The towns include Flemington and Greenwich Township, according to Lehigh Valley Live.

MyCentralJersey reported the Clinton and Flemington stores will have 30 AI-powered carts while the Greenwich location will have an additional 10.

""We’re excited to introduce Caper Carts to our ShopRite stores in Flemington, Clinton and Greenwich,"" Sam Colalillo, a ShopRite owner and third-generation grocer said, per MyCentralJersey.

""Our customers now have a smarter, faster way to shop, with tools to track spending, find savings and check out directly from the cart using a saved payment method.

""It’s a game-changer for convenience and we’re proud to bring this innovation to our stores.""

WHEEL IN

The Colalillo family operates additional ShopRite locations in Bethlehem and Yardley, Pennsylvania, where they have also rolled out Caper Carts.

Caper Carts can be found in nearly 100 cities across 15 states, the company said.

These carts have rolled out in other retailers like Kroger, where the program has been dubbed ""KroGo,"" and Wegmans. The carts can be found at Wegmans Dewitt in Syracuse, New York.

On September 25, Instacart announced a new savings feature for the carts.

The cart now has eligibility tracking for Electronic Benefits Transfer for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (EBT SNAP) items.

""Together, these new Caper features make it easier for customers to access savings, maximize their benefits, and stay on budget as they shop,"" the company said.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/09/JA_Grocery_Check_Out_OP.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-09-25 15:13:15.023727

Helios AI levels the playing field for smaller food companies, unlocking enterprise-grade insights that have historically been out of reach.","Agtech company Helios AI, which specializes in AI-powered software for predicting soft commodity prices and disrupting the food supply chain, has won over Silicon Valley venture capitalists. The Tysons, Virginia-based agtech has secured $4.7 million in seed funding to finance its next phase of growth, including the launch of its AI copilot for food supply chains. Led by Collide Capital, the funding round extended other backers including S&P Global Ventures, Stray Dog Capital, Angeles VC, Equity Alliance and Supply Change Capital. Proceeds from the round will be directed toward supporting Helios AI’s recent growth, including the hiring of key talent.

Alongside the capital infusion, Helios AI has unveiled Helios Horizon, the first-of-its-kind AI-powered co-pilot that delivers actionable insights to food supply chains. The platform integrates price forecasting and climate predictions across more than 75 agricultural commodities and 2,500 price series, including staples like coffee, soybeans and cocoa.

Powered by a multi-agent AI system, where specialized sub-agents handle distinct datasets and tasks under a supervising agent, Helios Horizon provides analysis, drawing from billions of real-time signals from around the world. According to Helios’ internal benchmarks, its forecasting accuracy is five times higher than standard industry models that rely on basic seasonality and supply-demand inputs.

The capital will also support Helios AI’s expansion, including key hires as the firm builds on its commodities coverage. This follows its earlier rollout of advanced price forecasting models over the summer, positioning Helios Horizon as a tool to streamline decision-making for a wide range of users, from farmers to retailers.

Francisco Martin-Rayo, Co-Founder and CEO of Helios AI. “It’s like having a team of Bloomberg analysts in your pocket 24/7.” He added in a post on LinkedIn: “This isn’t just about technology. It’s about access. For the first time, tools once reserved for Wall Street are in the hands of everyone: from independent farmers and local distributors to CPG giants and global retailers.”

Martin-Rayo also shared the genesis of the company, explaining, “Helios AI was born from a simple but urgent belief: food supply chains deserve foresight, not just hindsight. Too many procurement leaders, growers, and food innovators are forced to react to crises instead of anticipating them. That gap has real costs — for margins, for resilience, for people.”

Collide Capital Founder and Managing Partner Brian Hollins commented, “What excites us about Helios AI is their ability to combine deep technical talent with a huge, underserved opportunity. Helios AI levels the playing field for smaller food companies, unlocking enterprise-grade insights that have historically been out of reach. In a market measured in the trillions and undergoing rapid transformation, that kind of democratization is not just disruptive — it’s inevitable. Helios AI is positioned to lead that wave.”

For investors in the agricultural sector, this development highlights the growing intersection of agtech and data analytics, where AI-driven platforms could enhance supply chain resilience amid ongoing challenges like climate risks and commodity price volatility.

ID24,J&J,2025-09-25 17:09:52+00:00,The Athletic,Eagles 'prototype' RT Lane Johnson demonstrates his value: 'Best player I've ever been around',Zach Berman,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6659872/2025/09/25/eagles-lane-johnson-value-nfl/,"During 13 seasons, Lane Johnson has developed into longtime Philadelphia Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland’s prototype for an offensive tackle.
“It’s pretty tough to re-create Lane Johnson.” You don’t need to remind the Eagles.
Correlation does not imply causation, but the sample is large enough to realize how devastating Johnson’s absence is for the Eagles’ offensive line.
“Lane Johnson is, in my opinion, no question about it in my mind that he’s the best player I’ve ever been around,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said.
The comparison grid included sacks allowed, quarterback hits allowed, quarterback hurries allowed, pressures allowed, pass block win rate, quarterback time to throw, run block win rate and team rushing yards.","During 13 seasons, Lane Johnson has developed into longtime Philadelphia Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland’s prototype for an offensive tackle. Similar to Johnson’s former linemate Brandon Brooks at guard, Johnson has the ideal combination of critical factors Stoutland seeks at the position.

There’s one problem.

“When I think of ‘prototype,’ I think of something that can be re-created,” veteran offensive lineman Brett Toth said. “It’s pretty tough to re-create Lane Johnson.”

You don’t need to remind the Eagles. When Johnson exited their Week 3 win over the Los Angeles with a stinger, the offense initially stalled. When the Eagles review film of last season’s loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ahead of this Sunday’s matchup, they’ll see how the offense was a shell itself without the six-time Pro Bowl tackle.

Since the start of the 2016 season, the Eagles have played 131 games with Johnson in the lineup. They’re 91-39-1 in those games — winning at a nearly 70 percent rate. They played 35 games without Johnson. They’re 12-23 in those games, winning at only a 34 percent rate. Correlation does not imply causation, but the sample is large enough to realize how devastating Johnson’s absence is for the Eagles’ offensive line.

“He’s the best offensive lineman that’s f—ing come through the Eagles,” center Cam Jurgens said. “You’re going to notice that — when he’s on or off the field.”

The Athletic started exploring what it is about Johnson that made him so difficult to replace last week, before the evidence again revealed just how much the Eagles miss him. To their credit, they still won the game with Fred Johnson (no relation) eventually settling into the position. But they don’t want to make a habit of it. Lane Johnson was limited at practice Wednesday, although he appears on track to play.

It could prove to be a difference. It’s been in the past. There are several reasons, and one simple conclusion.

“Lane Johnson is, in my opinion, no question about it in my mind that he’s the best player I’ve ever been around,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “He is one of the best players in the NFL, and sometimes it’s hard to see that as an offensive lineman. It doesn’t show itself, but Lane gives us so much ability to do different things because of who he is as a football player.”

Johnson did not respond with his words after he was named second-team All-Pro last season. Rather, he responded with a piece of paper taped next to his locker. It offered a side-by-side comparison to Detroit Lions offensive tackle Penei Sewell, who was first-team All-Pro. Johnson took it as a slight.

An offensive lineman’s effect on the game can be difficult to quantify — “Good days, no one said your name,” Toth said — but Johnson offered data that comes from reviewing film that demonstrates his value. The comparison grid included sacks allowed, quarterback hits allowed, quarterback hurries allowed, pressures allowed, pass block win rate, quarterback time to throw, run block win rate and team rushing yards. Johnson’s numbers were more favorable in each category.

One category especially stood out when demonstrating Johnson’s value: “Island Rate,” a metric that measures how often an offensive lineman is left on an “island” one-on-one against a pass rusher. Johnson’s listed Island Rate was 75 percent, first among his position. The Eagles’ offense often relies upon its bookend offensive tackles blocking one-on-one without the help of a defender.

“He’s a freak athlete — long, strong, can anchor very quick,” Jurgens said. “That’s what you want in this system.”

The key, of course, is Johnson’s technical ability as a blocker and his rare athleticism as a converted junior college quarterback. But his teammates push back on the supposition that it’s that simple. When you play the position, you see the subtleties of Johnson’s game.

“As far as the O-line standpoint, you know where the quarterback is going to be … (from) being detailed, and you know what the defense presents, and you know what to expect when a D-end is lined up in a different position or whatnot,” said veteran lineman Matt Pryor, who was Johnson’s teammate from 2019 to 2022 before rejoining the Eagles this season. “This is very detailed and just technically sound. Not many times he’s going to be off balance, out of place, but when he is, he’s athletic enough to recover from it, which you don’t see often.

“Just from experience, I think he’s just at that pinnacle of (the position). He’s done it so great for so long that he’s kind of hit that point to where it’s just perfection.”

Johnson’s absence affects the entire offensive line. Since 2016, the Eagles have had a sack rate of 8 percent, and the average time for the quarterback to throw is 2.87 seconds when Johnson is not on the field. When Johnson plays, the Eagles allow a sack on 6.5 percent of pass attempts and have an average time to throw of 2.92 seconds. Teammates talk about the information Johnson brings back to the sideline after the first few drives.

Johnson, 35, is the Eagles’ longest-tenured player. During the offseason, he said he was “getting close to my peak, as weird as it is to say.” He keeps signing contract extensions, prolonging a career teammates suggest will lead to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Johnson acknowledged he doesn’t recognize the music in the locker room, yet he still enjoys it. It’s easier to express that optimism about not yet peaking in June than in September after facing Steve Spagnuolo’s blitzes, but Johnson sounded just as energized this month as he did when practices were in shorts and shells.

“I feel good. As long as my back and hip aren’t too bad, I feel like I’m better than I was in my 20s,” Johnson said. “Look at movement and all that stuff. So yeah, I feel better than what I thought I’d be at 35. These guys keep me young. I’m around a lot of younger gentlemen. They keep me young and healthy.”

The worst he felt was in 2021 when lingering ankle injuries affected his physical performance and contributed to anxiety that caused him to leave the team. He’s a different person now — and a better player, too. Johnson acknowledged he thought his body would wane. It hasn’t happened. He studied athletes who’ve extended their careers into their 40s, such as LeBron James and Olympians. He’s specific about his diet and his training. Even Jalen Hurts, a devotee to regimen, marvels at the “routine” Johnson uses. Look at a picture of Johnson now compared with when he came into the league, and you would wish you aged like he did. He joked he wishes there was a combine for players 10-plus years into the league to compare how they’ve aged.

He’s at a point in his career at which the understanding of the game merges with the physical and technical capabilities. Remember: Johnson did not start playing offensive line until college. He moved from quarterback to tight end to defensive end to offensive tackle. Early in his NFL career, he was still learning the position. Now, he can teach a Stoutland meeting. Toth started doing the math in his head of how many snaps Johnson has taken — the answer is 10,915 snaps, when including the postseason — and explained how hard that experience is to replicate. A Johnson replacement does not have that convergence of skill, athleticism and experience.

“There’s always stuff to clean up, but nothing can take the place of experience,” Johnson said. “And the good thing about playing offensive line, it’s a lot different than being an aging receiver. I have to be quick in the 5-yard, 10-yard space versus running a route. So, glad I did choose to end up being an offensive lineman after all, so you can kind of age gracefully somewhat. But, yeah, I’m still fighting and still playing.”

And still fighting for awards. The NFL is introducing a “Blocker of the Year” award. Johnson wished it had been instituted before Year 13. He’d be lying if he said he was not trying to win it. And he hopes his play is enough for first-team All-Pro, too. That still matters. If his value isn’t clear when he’s on the field, just see how it looks when he isn’t there.

“I still have the spirit of still trying to prove myself, like I’m still trying to make my first Pro Bowl, trying to get on the (Pro Bowl) wall down there,” Johnson said, referencing a wall of Pro Bowlers at the team facility. “That’s how I attack every day.”

Johnson was not necessarily the prototype when he entered the league, and Stoutland put Johnson through a workout in Groveton, Texas, in his first year as offensive line coach. Stoutland sent 20 video clips to Howie Roseman in a fit of enthusiasm. Owner Jeffrey Lurie asked Stoutland about the workout, and Stoutland could only respond with, “Wow.” It’s a word he does not use often. The excitement was about what Johnson could become. Two factors made Johnson the prototype: the way Johnson developed and the way the game evolved.

“I feel like the past decade, yeah, I am a part of the new style,” Johnson said. “When I came to the league, it was really, big mauling (tackles) … so I wouldn’t necessarily be what they’re looking for. So, the game evolves. You look at linebackers now, they’re more of a safety size. … (I fit) for what we wanted to do, heavy zone, run around a lot. But yeah, I mean, I feel a lot better now in my 30s than in my 20s, just because I only take it more seriously. When you’re young, we take things for granted, and you can be reckless, but better focus in my 30s, and I enjoy that, man.”

It also helped that he played in Philadelphia for Stoutland. Johnson often thinks about how his career arc would have gone had he been drafted in the top three as opposed to No. 4 in 2013.

“I thought about what would happen if I went to Miami,” Johnson said. “Kansas City wouldn’t have been bad. Jacksonville … ”

He stopped, as if others could finish the thought.

“It’s something you can appreciate in time,” Johnson said. “I know I have.”

If a prototype cannot be re-created, Johnson is offering what he knows. His talent cannot be replicated. His experience is hard to match. But if he can help you, he will.

“The best part about Lane is that he doesn’t gatekeep,” Jordan Mailata said.

Johnson has spoken about how he’s an only child, and teammates become his family. There’s a brotherhood that does not exist in different professions, and it’s why he wants to cling to playing professional football for as long as he can. He’s been a resource for teammates who battle anxiety. He gives training and lifestyle tips. You might see players in the locker room with toe spacers at Johnson’s suggestion. He hosts teammates at his “Bro Barn” to work out with him. Mailata recently pulled a reporter aside to show off a package in his locker with a device that helps the lungs optimize breathing. It was ordered at Johnson’s urging.

“His success goes for everyone. … He’s always sharing,” Mailata said. “It doesn’t matter how good of a player he is … it doesn’t matter what you are, where you were drafted, where you come from. He’s gonna help you. That doesn’t get talked about enough.”

“I know players from around the league, when they came in the rookie year, their vets aren’t as helping as others,” Pryor said. “It’s understandable, because you never know if somebody’s in there to take a spot or not. But he’s the opposite. He’s very helpful. He’s trying to coach everybody up. But just his mindset, from doing this s— 13 years at a high level … All-Pro on and off the field. Very special person.”

Johnson thinks there’s something else those teammates have going for them: playing in Philadelphia. It can be portrayed as a challenging place to play. That might be true, but Johnson thinks the pressure and football culture helped him maximize his talent. If he were in Jacksonville, he’d still have the rare combination of athleticism and skill. He might not have found the elixir of a fan base that boos a team that’s won 19 of 20 games — while losing without Johnson on the field, of course.

“You either go up from there or go down,” Johnson said. “And it definitely amplified me.”

There will be a time when the record with and without Johnson will no longer be applicable. Another right tackle will take on the task of succeeding him rather than filling in for him. That will be daunting.

How do you replace the prototype?

“You’ve had that guy on your team for 13 years that’s just continuously performed at that level, that’s not something that many teams have ever had the privilege to have,” Toth said. “So he’s one of those stories where it’s like, appreciate it as long as you can, because what he’s done here is remarkable.”

U.S. medtech stocks fell on Thursday after the U.S. Commerce Department opened a probe into imports of medical devices, pressuring shares across the sector.

Analysts said the investigation may weigh on companies with globally sourced supply chains and create a modest overhang for the stocks.

Companies like GE HealthCare GEHC, Becton Dickinson BDX, Stryker SYK, Insulet PODD, Intuitive Surgical ISRG and ResMed RMD were among the worst performers on the S&P Health Care Equipment index (.SPLRCMED), down between 4% and 11%.

Abbott ABT slipped 1.6% and Medtronic MDT fell 2.3%, while the S&P Health Care Equipment index dropped 2% on the day.

Medtech shares have been volatile this year amid supply chain disruptions, cost inflation and softer demand in some international markets.

The medtech index has seen a modest 2.3% rise this year versus a 12.5% rise in the broader S&P 500 index SPX.

Needham analyst Mike Matson said the probe ""creates a new overhang for the already-beleaguered sector, but the actual impact of any new tariffs depends on companies' ability to pass through the costs to customers.""

Earlier this month, the Secretary of Commerce launched a Section 232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to assess how imports of personal protective equipment, medical consumables, and medical devices impact national security. The department said it would make recommendations within 270 days.

""We look forward to continuing our work with the Administration...to strengthen our already-robust and uniquely American industry,"" said CEO Scott Whitaker of medtech association AdvaMed.

Section 232 allows the President to restrict imports if they are found to ""threaten to impair"" U.S. national security.

While the list of products covered is broad, ""we don't think it's right to hit the panic button"", J.P. Morgan analyst Robbie Marcus said in a note.

JKFive years in total. I’d been thinking about the book before that, but in 2020, I started out with this idea—a silly idea, actually. It started with me wanting to write a book about three sisters who had superpowers. I thought a lot about levitation and shooting fire with your eyes. And the interesting thing about these sisters was that they resisted. They sat me down and told me in English, even though Swedish is my mother tongue: “There’s so much pressure already on us to be perfect, to be superhero-esque, and it would be great if there was a possibility for us to exist in this book and be human. Can’t you allow us to just be human with all of our flaws, with all of our mistakes, and the almostness of being human?” That was the moment that I allowed the book to be something that I didn’t want it to be. Oftentimes, the spark that starts a book for me is when I realize that the characters have enough agency to rebel.

ADWas the character of Jonas always present, or did you add the more autobiographical elements once the sisters became human?

JKThe structure was quite clear from the beginning. I just sensed that once I put fictional sister and personal memory side by side, the book vibrated with something.

ADDid you know which personal memories you were going to use? Or were you improvising?

JKI was improvising. Finding the balance between the nonfiction and the fiction was a bit tricky in the beginning. But it was a process of trusting the energy of the piece. And I think a lot about that, both in my teaching and in my creative practice. It’s so much about being honest about what moves you. I realized as a person, as a writer, as a father, I am someone who likes to be surprised. I enjoy mystery. Like the fact that Evelyn and her sisters go to New York, and Evelyn decides to stay because she feels at home there, finally, after her whole life waiting to feel at home. In a way, she disappears. That happens around the same time that Jonas loses his friend Emma to suicide. So, there’s this loss of Evelyn, and the loss of Emma, and the uncontrollable meaning that arises once you put two things together that you don’t fully comprehend. I have a feeling that this book saved me in some sense. It gave meaning to memories that I haven’t really been able to understand before, because I started looking at them through the fictional lens of the sisters. Parts of myself that I have spent years hiding and judging.

ADI was reading Mourning Diary by Roland Barthes last month, and he related writing about memory to pinning a butterfly. In other words, does writing about memory change the function of that memory permanently?

JKI had a conversation with my youngest son recently about butterflies. We were sitting in Prospect Park, and he was asking me questions like, “What are your top three bugs?” And he brought out the fact that if you are a scientist and you focus on butterflies, you must really like them; it’s a little bit strange that you pin them down. If we use that metaphor, if you really like your memories, is the real value in pinning them down and making them beautiful, stretching their wings, and being impressed by their colors? Or is the real value investigating them with the courage to say, “I may not remember this correctly. I may be wrong.” A lot of the personal memories in this book, I’ve tried to write for years. But I’ve never been able to touch them. They have felt too painful to return to. I couldn’t understand why they wouldn’t let me go. I felt like these memories were kind of pinned. At first, I didn’t think some of those memories would fit in a novel. Memories about what happened after my parents’ divorce. Memories of growing up in a country where I spent years looking for a sense of home and never found it. But also memories of just going with my dad to a tennis tournament and realizing how painful it was for him that we didn’t have a car. It’s not a big memory. But once you stay with the “smallness,” you realize that it actually contains a whole world.

ADThis is where I think “craft” as a concept gets tricky. It seems when you talk about your book that, like your memories, your sisters are in your mind as real beings, and they’re somewhat autonomous from yourself and surprising you. I feel like a lot of writers are ashamed of the idea that their characters live in their heads.

JKI think they’re ashamed because, in essence, you’re saying that the work is more important than you. And I’ve always had the feeling that what is coming out on the page is much more interesting than whatever I am. When I look in the special cemetery of my failed projects that never saw the light of day, very often the idea is too smart. It did not come from an element that I was trying to suppress or understand. It’s an idea that I came up with to create an effect in a potential reader. I’ve never been able to finish those books because I have tried to control them. With every book, I have one particular moment when I go, This thing has had an artificial heart, but that artificial heart now pumps with blood. With the sisters, it was a moment at the Cullman Center. I had just frothed some milk in this tiny kitchen at the New York Public Library, and I realized that the sisters were cursed. I saw that so vividly. They grew up with the story that someone put a curse on them, and that everything they love, they will lose. They choose very different ways to try to break the curse. Ina chooses structure. Evelyn chooses to transform herself. Anastasia chooses to inject artificial ingredients: music or drugs. And I’ve used all of those strategies myself. But my main thing that I’ve used in my life is writing, my written words, trying to break the curse that my father put on me that I would be a failure, because I’m convinced that one of the ways that we can break free from curses is by storytelling. We can tell our way free in any language.

AD You open the book with an incredible, dense party scene. On a technical level, how did you accomplish that without being muddy?

JKI think you avoid muddiness by being very hyper-clear about what is emotionally at stake for one person who is present. We know that Ina arrives at this party, and she’s way too tall to be there—and feels way too boring. She has already memorized the timetable for the night buses. She is basically counting down the seconds until she can leave. And the first thing she says to her sisters is, “You’re not going to leave me, right? We will take care of each other.” Two seconds later, her sisters are gone. Ina is by herself. And all of us have been that person at a party. So as muddy as a party scene is, as sticky as the floor is, as loud as the music is, as much as the bass is thumping, if you can get the emotional clarity, anything else becomes easy. I like the fact that the book opens with the scene where time is being inverted. It starts, it ends. It’s New Year’s Eve. They do the countdown thing, and they go ten, nine, eight . . . and then they reach zero, and Ina doesn’t kiss the man she’s met, Hector, but then someone checks the time and realizes, Hey, actually we got it wrong. Midnight is in ten seconds. They get another chance. They get another countdown. They go from ten to zero, and this time they kiss each other. So maybe that’s a lesson that we can take. Ina realized that her fear of making a mistake was worse than her fear of actually trying.

ADSince we initially recorded this interview, you’ve had the happy news that The Sisters was longlisted for the National Book Award for Fiction. How does it feel for the three of them—and for you—to be acknowledged in a country and a language that is very much relevant to both the novel and the project of writing the novel?

JKI got the happy news when I was in Korea for a book festival. It was 10 PM on a Saturday, and I was alone in a hotel room in Seoul after a day of lectures and interviews when congratulatory texts started pouring in. I couldn’t believe it. Since I didn’t have anyone to share the amazing news with, I started dancing on my own, strangely enough, to a Justin Bieber song. Then I had to stop because I had a late-night virtual mediation session with my wife to discuss our potential future in the US.

Are you ready for ? This week, Kim Kardashian announced the collaboration between her shapewear brand and the athletic-wear giant (out September 26), first teasing the drop with a star-studded campaign video, then following that up with a surprise fashion performance on the steps of the New York Public Library.

To cap things off, the business mogul co-hosted a celebratory launch event last night, held at the Nike House of Innovation in NYC. There, she turned heads in a blueberry-gray ensemble that was styled like a skintight catsuit.

Kim Kardashian arrives to the NikeSkims launch event in New York City.

While the monochromatic fit blended seamlessly, it wasn’t actually a catsuit, but rather a collection of separates. The set consisted of a long-sleeve, mock-neck top, which Kim tucked into a set of high-waisted leggings with a V-panel in the front. Both of the pieces were decorated with white pinstripes along the side, and because they were slightly sheer, she also wore a matching gray bra underneath her top.

For the event, Kim wore a spandex-y, gray ensemble from the new capsule.

The reality star accessorized the look with a matching elastic skull cap with knotted material in the back. She also added some pointy pumps, which made it seem like her bottoms were actually pantaleggings (a look that Kim’s long been a fan of, thanks to her ongoing friendship with Demna, who pioneered the design).

The pieces were decorated with white pinstripes on the side.

Jorge Martín, instead, joked about the return of the group photo of the full grid, while the focus of the day was inevitably Marc Marquez. The Spanish rider is one step away from his 9th world title and called this stage of his career a ""second life"", remember how his past difficulties have strengthened him.

Pecco Bagnaia also took the floor and described this season as disappointing, marked by too many problems, but with the goal of soon becoming competitive again.

Williams' mindset to turn the page to the next game has also enabled him to succeed.
""It's time to move on and focus on the Raiders,"" Williams said.","The belief that Johnson has in Williams was evident against the Cowboys when the coach kept the offense on the field on fourth-and-goal from the 4 late in the third quarter. The quarterback responded by throwing a touchdown pass to receiver DJ Moore.

""Him and I talk and meet every single day,"" Williams said of Johnson. ""And then getting out there on the practice field builds a lot of confidence in him to be able to call the plays whatever moment it is … whether it's fourth-and-4 on the goal line and the trust between us to be able to try and go get it. A lot of it is practice and a lot of it's us, the afterhours that we spend here.""

Williams acknowledged that he was ""a little bit more frustrated"" with mistakes in Wednesday practices last year as a rookie but has since learned that they are inevitable and just part of the preparation process.

""There are going to be hard moments in practice like today,"" Williams said Wednesday as the Bears prepared for Sunday's game against the Raiders in Las Vegas. ""It's probably one of the hardest days of a quarterback's job because all of the game plan that's going in.""

Williams said that it's important ""being able to be positive, being able to understand that it is Wednesday and a bunch of it is new and not get too frustrated and give myself a little grace on Wednesdays to be able to understand I'll go back study tonight, study tomorrow and keep studying throughout the week. And then we'll get to Sunday and be able to rep it and get out there and call those plays and be efficient and do whatever we need to do to win the game.""

Williams' mindset to turn the page to the next game has also enabled him to succeed.

""He won offensive player of the week for the NFC, and he came in [Wednesday] completely unfazed by it,"" Johnson said. ""I tried to recognize him in front of the group, and he wasn't having it. Very stoic. He's already on to the next game. He knows he needs to have an even better performance here this week to give us the best chance to win.""

""It's time to move on and focus on the Raiders,"" Williams said.

(NYSE:TRP), has unveiled plans to invest $8.5 billion over the next five years in U.S. power projects, banking on predictions of a 45 billion cubic feet per day increase in natural gas demand to meet surging power demand. According to TC Energy CEO François Poirier, gas-fired generation will power the ongoing AI build-out, adding that his company has a footprint in eight of the ten largest U.S. electric utilities.

“It’s all about energy--and natural gas is going to be the backbone,” Poirier said in an interview.

Poirier says favorable policies by the Trump administration will make it easier for the company to achieve its lofty goal, saying that time spent on permitting and construction could be cut in half. The energy executive has predicted that U.S. LNG exports will double from the current 12 bcf/d to 24 bcf/d over the next 10 years. Back in May, Poirier reaffirmed TC Energy’s capital expenditure guidance of $5.5 billion to $6 billion in the current year, and said it remains on track to place assets worth $8.5 billion into service in 2025. TC Energy reported that its projects are tracking ~15% below budget.

TC Energy is not the only organization that has predicted robust growth in U.S. natural gas demand.

Last year, Morgan Stanley predicted that the U.S. natural gas market is entering a new growth cycle thanks to the advent of AI data centers, clean energy manufacturing and the cryptocurrencies boom. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) global electricity demand increased by 4.3% in 2024, up from 2.5% growth recorded in 2023.

Meanwhile, S&P Global Commodity Insights recently predicted that natural gas will be the only fossil fuel that will increase its share in the energy mix of the United States, China, and India by 2050, even as oil and coal usage decline globally. S&P Global has projected that renewables will supply 20% of global energy by 2050, up from just 4% currently. “By 2050, gas shall be the only fossil fuel with a potential increase in the energy mix for the US, China, and India,” the report stated.

The analysts note that coal-to-gas substitution has been driving the energy transition in the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia while India has been lagging here. India’s energy mix remains heavily skewed towards fossil fuels, with oil and gas accounting for 77% of primary energy use while renewables contribute just 2%. However, S&P Global has predicted that fossil fuels’ share in India’s energy mix will fall to 66% by 2050, while renewables will rise to 16%. India will mainly use natural gas as a transition fuel during this period, as a more flexible and cleaner alternative to coal.

But it’s not all tailwinds. Some warn that gas-powered generation could soon face significant headwinds due to manufacturing constraints.

According to Wood Mackenzie, the gas turbine market could face ""turbo lag"" from 2025-2040 due to rising costs, manufacturing constraints and competition from renewables. WoodMac notes that global orders of gas turbines jumped 32%Y/Y in 2025, driven by projections for a big load growth from AI. electrification and hydrogen production. However, the global data and analytics provider has warned that rising capital costs coupled with power prices below the cost of new gas generation could alter this trajectory, particularly in the United States. High costs of imported gas are likely to remain the main challenge for Asia despite the region’s strong power demand growth, while decarbonization goals will limit growth in Europe.

""While power markets will require natural gas-fired power as part of the energy transition through 2040, gas's role will have limits,"" said David Brown, Director of Energy Transition Research at Wood Mackenzie. ""High fuel costs in some regions, rising construction costs, and continued cost declines for renewables and energy storage will constrain gas's growth potential.""

Nevertheless, WoodMac remains bullish about natural gas power generation, predicting that the global sector will add 890 GW of new gas-fired generation capacity through 2040. The U.S. and China are expected to lead the charge, accounting for a combined 47% of global annual additions while India, Southeast Asia and the EU will account for the rest.

CVS Health (CVS, Financial) is proactively addressing potential regulatory challenges in the pharmacy benefit management sector.

The company is a major player in the healthcare industry, with significant operations in retail pharmacy, pharmacy benefit management, and health insurance.

Financial metrics indicate a mixed performance with declining margins but stable revenue growth.

Key players in the pharmacy benefit management sector, including CVS Health (CVS), are proposing voluntary adjustments to their business practices to preempt regulatory actions from federal authorities. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents major PBMs, has drafted proposals aimed at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The initiatives include expanding access to affordable biologic alternatives and enhancing compensation to rural pharmacies. These measures are part of efforts to address criticism and potential regulation aimed at reducing drug prices by targeting the role of intermediaries in the healthcare market.

CVS Health Corp is a diversified healthcare company with a robust portfolio of services. Its operations span over 9,000 retail pharmacy locations across the United States, making it a significant player in the retail pharmacy sector. Additionally, CVS Health is a leading pharmacy benefit manager, processing approximately 2 billion adjusted claims annually. The company's acquisition of Aetna has positioned it as a top-tier health insurer, serving around 27 million medical members. The recent acquisition of Oak Street Health further enhances its offerings by adding primary care services, potentially creating synergies across its business lines.

With a market capitalization of approximately $94.48 billion, CVS Health operates within the healthcare sector, specifically in the healthcare plans industry. The company's strategic positioning in these markets underscores its influence and reach within the healthcare ecosystem.

Financial Health Analysis

CVS Health's financial performance presents a mixed picture. The company reported a revenue of $386.64 billion, reflecting a 3-year revenue growth rate of 10.4%. However, profitability metrics indicate challenges, with an operating margin of 2.65% and a net margin of 1.17%, both of which have been in decline over recent years.

The company's balance sheet shows a current ratio of 0.8 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.07, indicating a moderate level of leverage. The Altman Z-Score of 2.2 places CVS Health in the grey area, suggesting some financial stress, though not at immediate risk of bankruptcy.

Insider activity has shown some caution, with recent insider selling transactions totaling 7,500 shares over the past three months, which may indicate a lack of confidence in short-term stock performance.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

CVS Health's valuation metrics suggest it is trading at a relatively high level compared to historical norms. The P/E ratio stands at 20.81, close to its 1-year high, while the P/S ratio of 0.25 and P/B ratio of 1.22 are also near their respective highs.

Analyst sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with a target price of $81.06 and a recommendation score of 2, indicating a moderate buy. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 68.77 suggest the stock is approaching overbought territory.

Institutional ownership remains strong at 86.35%, reflecting continued confidence from large investors, despite recent insider selling activity.

Risk Assessment

CVS Health's financial health grades indicate areas of concern, particularly in profitability and leverage. The company's ROIC of 3.67% is below its WACC, suggesting inefficiencies in capital utilization.

Sector-specific risks include potential regulatory changes impacting the pharmacy benefit management industry, as highlighted by the recent news. Additionally, the company's beta of 0.55 indicates lower volatility compared to the market, which may appeal to risk-averse investors.

Overall, while CVS Health faces challenges in profitability and regulatory risks, its strong market position and diversified business model provide a foundation for potential long-term stability.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000AUE.png?20,N,,2025-09-25 13:16:05.791042

Plus, as part of the confirmed technical specifications, Audi's premium mid-sized sedan can be optioned with performance upgrades previously reserved for the sportier S6 for the first time.

The new A6 is due to hit showrooms in the final quarter of 2025. Prices range from $64,100 for the Premium trim, up to $67,500 for Premium Plus and $71,400 for the top shelf Prestige option. This means the entry-level A6 Premium is $3k cheaper than the BMW 540i 5 Series it will rival, and a whopping $8K less expensive than the equivalent Mercedes E450 E-Class. Put another way, you could buy an entry-level 2026 A6 and one of 10 of the ‘fastest cars on earth’ for the same price as a new V6 E450.*

It should be noted that prices for BMW’s entry-level, 255-horsepower 530i and the 255 hp Mercedes E350 start from $59,900 and $63,900 USD respectively.

Power Up To 362 HP, But Audi Still Slower Than Its Rivals

Paired with a revised seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch gearbox, Audi’s reworked 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 – the only engine option confirmed so far – sends 362-horsepower and 406-pound feet of torque to all four wheels, 27 hp and 37 lb ft increase respectively over the old model. While this does bring the A6 up short against the 375 hp BMW 540i and Mercedes E450, the A6 will nevertheless hit 0-60 MPH in 4.5 seconds. That’s just one-tenth shy of both the Bimmer and the Merc, and a sizeable six-tenths quicker than the model it replaces. Top speed is electronically limited to 130 MPH.

We should probably point out that the Audi is slightly less frugal than either of its rivals too, returning an average of 23 miles-per-gallon. The BMW and the Mercedes, meanwhile, hover around 28 and 25 MPG, respectively.

S6 Performance Upgrades Now Available; New ""Human-Centric"" Cabin

Interestingly, for the first-time, Audi’s premium mid-sized sedan can be optioned with S6 upgrades, including all-wheel steering for more nimble handling, and a rear differential than distributes torque as needed to each individual wheel. Steel sport suspension is also an option alongside adaptive air suspension (standard on the Prestige trim), the former of which drops the ride height by 0.8-inches for a more road-holding ride. All of this works in tandem with a chassis that has been re-engineered to make the A6 less gloopy than before whilst still retaining long-distance ride quality. More robust front and rear subframes help improve overall body rigidity, and lighter-weight aluminum components are incorporated into the suspension to keep the A6’s girth down. Interestingly though, Audi has not yet confirmed an overall curb weight.

Alongside a brand-new exterior design, Audi has also worked improve the “human centric” (urgh) cabin design, which was hardly a ramshackle cow shed to begin with. One of the more notable – and optional, sadly – additions is Audi’s ‘digital stage,’ which combines an 11.9-inch digital driver cluster and the 14.5-inch infotainment touchscreen into one, curving OLED screen that dominates the dashboard (whether this will inspire another one of our ‘hall of fame cabin design’ lists remains to be seen). In a neat touch, a separate 10.9-inch display is also mounted in front of the passenger with this package in pseudo-Ferrari F12berlinetta style. Audi also claims that improved seals, tire foam, bushing in the drivetrain mounts, and heavier-duty acoustic window glazing have improved cabin sound insulation by 30%.",https://static0.hotcarsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2026-audi-a6-usa-pricing-10.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-25 17:13:20.981361

Trish Donnelly, who had years-long stints at Urban Outfitters, Polo Ralph Lauren and J. Crew, is now leading Chico’s FAS as division CEO, according to LinkedIn posts Wednesday from holding company KnitWell Group and Donnelly herself.

Most recently, Donnelly was president of The Row, and also has had leadership roles at PVH, including CEO of Calvin Klein Global. She began her work at Chico’s — whose brands include its namesake and White House Black Market women’s apparel retailers and lingerie retailer Soma — this week.

Chico’s hasn’t had its own chief since Molly Langenstein’s departure in January 2024, shortly after its acquisition by private equity firm Sycamore Partners. In the newly created role, Donnelly oversees all product and customer-facing functions across brands and leads day-to-day operations of KnitWell Group’s campus.

Dive Insight:

In 2019 Sycamore Partners tried and failed numerous times to acquire Chico’s but succeeded four years later. The firm paid $1 billion in cash and swiftly moved it into its KnitWell holding company. That group also includes Ann Taylor, Loft and Talbots, which Sycamore already owned.

The retail conglomerate had been struggling for while, though it made progress during Langenstein’s four-year tenure. How Chico’s is doing now is less clear because, as a privately held company, it no longer needs to report on its performance.

KnitWell in its post called out Donnelly’s history leading multi-brand retail companies — she was CEO of PVH Americas for nearly two years, CEO of global at Urban Outfitters for five years and before that Urban’s North America president for over a year.

“Trish is an exceptional leader with a proven record of success and is widely respected for uniting teams around a shared vision and for delivering results,” KnitWell CEO Lizanne Kindler said on LinkedIn. “Her passion for retail and dedication to customers are truly unmatched.”

In her post, Donnelly said that “It’s a transformative time in retail,” and that she and the brands’ teams will be writing “the next chapter of growth for our brands.” It’s true that her experience could be transformative for Chico’s and its stable, but the company has no shortage of operational challenges, according to Liza Amlani, principal at Retail Strategy Group.

“Trish Donnelly’s appointment signals Chico’s ambition to elevate its brands and sharpen its customer strategy. Her track record at PVH, The Row, and J.Crew gives her the product, digital, and brand credibility the company has lacked,” Amlani said by email. “The challenge will be translating luxury and premium brand experience into a highly promotional, margin-sensitive environment where inventory discipline and speed-to-market are critical. If she can pair her brand vision with operational rigor, Chico’s has a real chance at reinvention. Otherwise, the appointment risks becoming more about optics than execution.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/WifqJwPLqe3-SPbABR4cFDOXVYpuKa6atlUoKqLQJIQ/g:nowe:35:208/c:1244:703/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMTg2OS5qcGVn.webp,N,,2025-09-25 13:17:40.118221

She did this in response to the FDA releasing the most restrictive COVID vaccine regulations since the shot’s inception.
Hochul’s executive order from earlier this month made it clear that people seeking the COVID vaccine do not need a prescription.
This really depends on your insurance and whether your insurer is choosing to cover the COVID vaccine right now.","We’re headed into cold and flu season and you want your shots, including an updated COVID booster. Where can a New Yorker go to get the jab?

After the Food and Drug Administration changed its regulations around the COVID vaccine this summer to limit access, New York state crafted a workaround to preserve people’s ability to get a booster. Nonetheless, confusion has reigned in pharmacies across New York City.

An executive order by Gov. Kathy Hochul technically allows pharmacies to administer the vaccine to anyone three years old and older. But the Centers for Disease Control recently changed its guidelines around the COVID vaccine that further mixed messaging, creating a choose-your-own-adventure scenario for shot-seekers.

Here’s what to know now about finding (and paying for) the new COVID shots in New York City 2025:

Can I get a COVID booster in New York City, and where?

Yes, you can, but where you get it depends on a few factors.

At CVS, Walgreens and independent pharmacies, the COVID vaccine is allowed to be administered, but availability and whether you will have to pay for it varies (more on this below).

Hochul’s Sept. 5 executive order allows pharmacies in the state to offer the COVID vaccine to those under 65 without an underlying health condition and without a prescription.

She did this in response to the FDA releasing the most restrictive COVID vaccine regulations since the shot’s inception. The federal policy said that only those 65 and older or people with an underlying condition are eligible to get the updated vaccine.

Hochul’s executive order suspends those federal rules until Oct. 5, and she may choose to extend it further.

Despite the governor’s order, availability of the vaccines is spotty in New York City. When THE CITY reached out to pharmacies across the five boroughs in recent days, many were not offering the shot, or were administering it only to certain populations.

At Esco Pharmacy in Hell’s Kitchen — where Hochul herself received the COVID booster last week — pharmacists are following FDA guidelines and not offering the vaccine to anyone between the ages of 18 and 65 who do not have a health condition.

“It is confusing to our staff and the patient, as well,” said Danny Dang, pharmacist at Esco, of the current guidelines. “We do see the benefits of the vaccination. I’ve seen a lot of patients who came to us for COVID treatment that could have been prevented by the vaccine if we had done it earlier.”

Dr. Marisa Donnelly, epidemiologist and author of the column “Your Local Epidemiologist,” explains that just because pharmacies are allowed to administer a vaccine doesn’t mean they will.

“There’s still, I think, a lot of internal policies that different pharmacy companies have,” Donnelly says. “They’re all allowed to give vaccines, but that doesn’t mean that they necessarily will. They can still go with their own guidelines and decide not to give a vaccine if they don’t want to. But they are allowed within the state.”

Who should get the booster?

Under the executive order from Hochul, everyone over three years old should be able to get the COVID shot. But, as stated above, the CDC and FDA says something else entirely, muddying the waters.

The New York City Health Department says it is especially important for the following groups of people to get the COVID booster:

All adults ages 65 and older

All children ages 6 to 23 months

People who are pregnant or recently gave birth

People of any age who have an underlying condition that increases their risk for severe COVID-19

People at high risk of exposure, such as health care workers and people living or working in a nursing home or other congregate setting

People living with someone with an underlying condition that increases their risk for severe COVID-19

People who have never been vaccinated before

Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, recommends the shot for anyone whose last vaccine was over six months ago, since immunity starts to wane after four to six months.

“On top of that, the last set of vaccines were protected against an earlier variant,” Lee says. “Right now, the variants that are circulating are different from previous, so your protection is probably even lower against the current variants. So if you haven’t gotten a vaccine for at least six months or greater, then it’s a good idea to get the vaccine, especially headed into winter.”

What about shots for city kids?

All kids three years to 18 are eligible to be vaccinated in New York State –– no prescription or underlying health condition needed. (6 to 23 month old kids are considered a high risk population and so their eligibility for the vaccine was never under threat)

However, THE CITY found that availability for shots for young people is spotty. Some independent pharmacies that are offering the vaccine for adults just don’t have it available or stocked for kids.

Lauren Naturale, a Sunset Park mom, tried to get her six-year-old daughter vaccinated before traveling for a family wedding where a lot of older people would be in attendance.

Naturale attempted to make a vaccine appointment for her daughter at CVS, but when she went to finalize, would repeatedly get an error message. She tried again the following week and was able to make an appointment. Upon arrival at a CVS that was 40 minutes away, Naturale was told the store must have miscategorized them in CVS’s system because they did not have vaccines for children under 12.

“It sounds like you can get them, it would just be great if there was clear information,” Naturale said about children’s vaccines in New York.

She wasn’t able to get her daughter one before they left for the wedding.

“Hopefully we’ll be able to make that happen when we get back to the city,” Naturale said.

Shots for all young people under 19 years old should be covered by your insurer by law. (More on this below.)

Do I need a prescription?

No, you do not need a prescription to get the COVID shot. Hochul’s executive order from earlier this month made it clear that people seeking the COVID vaccine do not need a prescription. If a provider demands one, try another pharmacy, call your local health department about finding a vaccine, or contact your primary care doctor.

What is this going to cost me?

This really depends on your insurance and whether your insurer is choosing to cover the COVID vaccine right now.

That’s because a key committee at the Centers for Disease Control — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — declined last week to recommend the COVID vaccine this season. Its recommendation is the federal standard insurers traditionally follow for coverage of all kinds of medical services.

What this means: Local pharmacies are allowed to give the COVID vaccine, but it may not be paid for by your insurance. At CVS, an out of pocket COVID vaccine could cost you up to $249.99. At Esco Pharmacy, an independent pharmacy in Hell’s Kitchen, it costs about $265, staff there said.

Earlier this month, the state’s Department of Financial Services issued guidance encouraging insurers to continue covering the COVID vaccine, but that isn’t binding. However, the letter notes that New York State law requires insurers to fully cover vaccines for children under 19, because they were deemed necessary immunizations in 2020 –– a decision that still stands.

Some insurers, like UnitedHealthcare, are choosing to continue covering the shot for everyone despite the ACIP declining to recommend the shot.

“For our standard commercial plans, we will continue to cover claims for COVID-19 vaccines with no cost share,” UnitedHealthcare said in a statement. The insurer said they recommend members who use an employer sponsored plan to confirm benefits with their specific plan.

My local pharmacy isn’t offering the shot. What now?

Dr. Lee recommends contacting your doctor’s office or the local health department if you’re having trouble getting the vaccine.

Walgreens and CVS have the COVID vaccine available for those under 65 without a health condition. But to schedule an appointment online, you have to “confirm you are eligible,” or answer yes that you have a health condition.

“My guess is the reason that that is existing is because it’s a national website,” Donnelly says. “And so I imagine that they have some of those settings for everywhere across the country, even if they don’t necessarily apply to New York State. But I do think that that’s a potential source of confusion for people.”

Dr. Donnelly worries that mixed messaging around the COVID vaccine is causing less people to get it, and even worse, sowing distrust in the medical system.

“I think the biggest issue right now is there’s so much noise around vaccines and it’s so confusing to follow,” Donnelly says. “So I think that’s actually a potential deterrent for a lot of families that want to get vaccinated, but that maybe don’t understand that they can or they are eligible now.”

What else can I do to prevent COVID?

Dr. Lee notes that while the COVID vaccine does protect against the worst outcomes of the virus, it doesn’t guarantee not getting it.

“You also want to continue to take other types of precautions, especially when you’re in a location or an area where the risk of getting infected is high,” Lee says. “Say you’re in a very crowded location, it’s still important to make sure that the area is well ventilated. That, and evidence has shown that masks can help cut down transmission. So, all of these things that came out during the beginning of the COVID pandemic still hold.”

During this time of mixed messaging, it’s important to distinguish which evidence is scientifically sound.

“If you see something that’s repeated across different respectable and evidence-based websites, then you can feel more confident that it’s a consensus that different folks have come to the same conclusion,” Lee says.

Some of the most reliable sources, he says, include international health organizations like the World Health Organization, Health Canada, and the U.K.’s The National Health Service. Major U.S. health systems like John Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, and the Cleveland Clinic also provide trustworthy guidance. The New York City’s health department is also considered one of the largest public health agencies in the world and offers evidence-based health recommendations.",https://i0.wp.com/www.thecity.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091625_hochul_covid_booster-1.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-25 13:16:11.044485

Dive Brief:

Instacart announced Thursday that it has added a new tool to its Caper Carts that helps SNAP shoppers manage their spending by tracking eligible items and providing a running total of purchases on the device’s screen.

The tech company has also added other tools to its proprietary smart carts, including on-cart loyalty signup, a Cart Cash savings program and improved product recommendations.

Dive Insight:

With the new features, Instacart aims to make it easier for smart cart users to access promotions and track their spending as they shop.

The company’s EBT SNAP tool allows users to simultaneously track running totals of both eligible and non-eligible items in real time, and builds on the company’s efforts to allow SNAP shoppers across the country to use SNAP benefits to pay for online purchases. When checking out, Caper Cart users scan a barcode on the cart’s screen and finalize payment with their EBT SNAP card.

Instacart’s new Cart Cash program, meanwhile, lets users earn cash back by achieving shopping milestones, like making a certain number of store purchases in a month, and clipping exclusive coupons. Shoppers can sign up for the program by joining a retailer’s loyalty program — a task they can now do on the cart’s screen by inputting their phone number or scanning a QR code. After users link their loyalty accounts on the Caper Carts, they can access features that incorporate their shopping preferences, like “buy again” and list building.

Instacart’s updates to Caper Cart aim to provide store in-store shoppers with many of the tools that its online shopping platform provides. The cart’s screen provides suggestions for items similar to those a shopper has bought and points users to nearby product deals as they move through the aisles. Instacart also pushes special discounts to shoppers after they check out that are redeemable on retailer e-commerce sites or apps built on the tech company’s technology.

Over the past year, Instacart has also added several other features to its Caper Carts, including gamification, on-screen advertising and location-based coupons.

In an interview last month, Instacart Chief Connected Stores Officer David McIntosh said the digital shopping experience and new savings tools have become key selling points for Caper Carts.

And yet, many retailers aren’t yet convinced that smart carts, which have been around for over 20 years, are ready for widespread adoption. Kroger, Schnuck Markets, Wakefern Food Corp. and Wegmans all offer Caper Carts in some of their stores, but none yet offer the carts chainwide.

Tech companies other than Instacart, like Veeve and Shopic, offer clip-on units that add smart-cart capabilities to regular grocery carts.

Summary

Helmerich & Payne has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 due to secular headwinds and a deteriorating oil industry outlook.

HP's earnings are highly sensitive to U.S. drilling activity, with recent OPEC production increases and oil price declines posing significant risks.

Technological advancements in drilling have reduced HP's revenue potential, resulting in stagnant earnings despite rising U.S. oil output.

Given HP's rich valuation, weak growth prospects, and high cyclicality, the stock is likely to continue underperforming and should be avoided by long-term investors.

Almost six years ago, I recommended selling Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) due to secular business headwinds and my expectations for a dividend cut. Since that article, the stock has dramatically underperformed the broad market, as

Jobless data, consumer confidence

In the U.S., the Labor Department's latest weekly jobs data showed jobless claims fell to 218,000 for the week ended Sept. 20, down 14,000 from the previous week. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the cooling labor market was overriding concerns about sticky inflation, prompting the central bank's first interest rate cut of the year.

Back in Europe, investors were also monitoring consumer confidence figures.

In their report on consumer confidence in Germany, published Thursday morning, GfK and the Nuremberg Institute for Market Decisions (NIM) said the downward trend in the consumer climate had halted due to improved income expectations.

However, Rolf Bürkl, head of consumer climate at NIM, said that market watchers should approach the data with caution.

""Whether this marks the beginning of a sustained turnaround is more than uncertain. The consumer climate remains at an extremely low level,"" he explained in the report. ""The geopolitical situation, concerns about jobs, and renewed fears of inflation are likely hinder a thorough recovery at the moment.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104370057-RTSS40E.jpg?v=1529452258&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-09-25 14:14:26.743215

ID42,Walmart,2025-09-25 16:05:28+00:00,Digiday,ChatGPT is now 20% of Walmart's referral traffic — while Amazon wards off AI shopping agents,Allison Smith,,,,,https://digiday.com/media/chatgpt-is-now-20-of-walmarts-referral-traffic-while-amazon-wards-off-ai-shopping-agents/,"Other retailers are seeing a lift, too: ChatGPT now drives more than 20% of referral traffic to Etsy, nearly 15% to Target and 10% to eBay.
To be sure, referral traffic from ChatGPT remains a sliver of the overall pie.
In August, referral traffic from ChatGPT to Amazon fell nearly 18% to less than 3% month-over-month.
Like Amazon, Walmart is developing its own shopping agents that customers can use to shop on its e-commerce site.
Max Sinclair, founder of Azoma, said his firm helps brands track and grow traffic from ChatGPT and Amazon’s Rufus.","Data from Similarweb, a web traffic analytics company, shows that one in five of Walmart’s referral clicks in August came from ChatGPT, up 15% from July. Other retailers are seeing a lift, too: ChatGPT now drives more than 20% of referral traffic to Etsy, nearly 15% to Target and 10% to eBay.

To be sure, referral traffic from ChatGPT remains a sliver of the overall pie. For Walmart and its peers, referral clicks account for less than 5% of total site visits — outweighed by direct traffic, paid channels and search engines. But the speed at which ChatGPT has climbed into the top tier of referral sources shows how how AI is starting to influence how consumers shop online. Shoppers are increasingly clicking through links inside AI chat responses, pushing major retailers into the shopping journey historically dominated by Google search. The ramifications could be huge for brands, especially as platforms like ChatGPT start enabling checkout.

A new study authored by OpenAI’s Economic Research team and Harvard economist David Deming found that around 2% of all ChatGPT queries involve shopping — about 50 million queries per day. With 2.5 billion prompts flowing through ChatGPT daily, even a small slice translates into significant shopping intent. Researchers noted that users are often asking for recommendations like “recommend a good laptop under $1,000” or “How much are Nikes,” suggesting AI tools are taking on a role once reserved for Google. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.

Separately, nearly 60% of U.S. consumers have used a generative AI tool for help with online shopping, per an August 2025 survey from Omnisend.

“We know that everyone’s using ChatGPT all the time, and everyone’s using Gemini and all the other tools all the time. So that should be reflected in the traffic a bunch of websites are getting, and that’s what the data seems to confirm,” Juozas Kaziukėnas, an independent analyst, said in an interview. He also wrote about the trend in a LinkedIn post.

Amazon bets on Rufus

The referral surge also reflects Amazon’s deliberate absence. Unlike Walmart, eBay and Target, Amazon has blocked many AI crawlers from scraping its site, Modern Retail previously reported. That means ChatGPT can’t provide real-time Amazon product links, nudging consumers toward rival retailers instead. In August, referral traffic from ChatGPT to Amazon fell nearly 18% to less than 3% month-over-month.

For Amazon, the move was defensive. The company’s marketplace is not only the largest store of e-commerce data in the world but also the backbone of a $56 billion advertising business built around shoppers browsing its site. Letting outside AI tools surface product links directly to users would risk bypassing Amazon’s storefront altogether, undermining both traffic and ad revenue.

Instead, Amazon has been laser-focused on growing its own consumer-facing AI chatbot known as Rufus, among a myriad of other AI-related investments. Rufus now appears in Amazon’s main search bar, in addition to a widget at the bottom of the screen, which opens the bot’s chat interface. Amazon has also started populating Rufus’s chatbot interface with ads. At the end of last year, Amazon said that customers have asked Rufus over half a billion questions, an Amazon spokesperson previously told Modern Retail.

Still, Amazon’s absence has effectively pulled 600 million product listings off the “agentic shopping shelf,” according to Scot Wingo, author of the Substack Retailgentic and founder of ReFiBuy, a company that helps brands and retailers optimize for agentic AI — a type of bot that autonomously completes tasks on its own, without human input. Walmart, with its 420 million SKUs, now fills more of the surface area inside AI chat results.

Amazon’s stance is notable given that major retailers like Walmart and eBay have not made any changes blocking AI bots from their sites. Like Amazon, Walmart is developing its own shopping agents that customers can use to shop on its e-commerce site. But unlike Amazon, Walmart is apparently open to a future in which consumers might rely on third-party bots to shop from its website. Walmart U.S. Chief Technology Officer Hari Vasudev told The Wall Street Journal that he expects the industry to eventually adopt common standards that would let outside shopping agents interact directly with retailers’ own systems.

Kaziukėnas said that the black-box nature of AI makes it hard to know exactly how systems decide which retailers to surface, but “it does look like there’s a preference for trusted major outlets,” he said. “There’s seemingly a tendency to pick kind of bigger retailers, as opposed to just picking any random small Shopify store.”

Monetizing AI

For now, retailers are enjoying a surge of free clicks. But that is unlikely to last. In July, the Financial Times reported that OpenAI is working on a payment and checkout system within ChatGPT that would allow users to complete purchases directly in the app. If ChatGPT is already driving tens of millions of shopping-related queries a day, the company has every incentive to capture value through affiliate fees, advertising or transaction fees, according to Kaziukėnas.

“We are now in this unique environment in time where ChatGPT is becoming important. It’s still sending lots of traffic, often to major retailers. But this will drastically change in the future if these things continue to go in the direction they’re going,” Kaziukėnas said. “This traffic will not be free in the future.” It’s a concern that brand executives have repeatedly expressed to Modern Retail.

AI companies still haven’t proven how they’ll generate enough revenue to offset the enormous costs of running the technology. Bain & Co. projects that by 2030, firms will require roughly $2 trillion a year to cover computing needs, but revenues are expected to lag $800 billion.

Agencies are already responding to the shift. Max Sinclair, founder of Azoma, said his firm helps brands track and grow traffic from ChatGPT and Amazon’s Rufus. On average, his customers have seen a sevenfold increase in visits from ChatGPT, Sinclair said.

“With ChatGPT, it’s very easy to prove ROI to our customers, because we can say, ‘This is how many visits you’re getting to your website before we started working with you. This is how many you’re getting afterward,” he said.

As AI has become more popular, brands and retailers are working to navigate a potential future where bots like OpenAI’s Operator shop on their behalf without human intervention. But whether or not fully autonomous shopping ever becomes more than science fiction, the early steps alone are enough to reshape how people shop.

“The impact of AI on shopping is a range,” Kaziukėnas said. “At the start of that range is just links in chat responses, very basic, very simple. And we are very close to that start right now. Maybe we will get to that finish point. But even if we don’t, it will be disruptive by itself.”",https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/ai-privacy-digiday.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:18:17.961842

The deal marks the first strategic acquisition in the Texas company’s history.

Tito’s officials said that the move would provide strategic sales support and expanded distribution capabilities to the blanco tequila producer, which they called one of the country’s “fastest-growing tequila brands.”

Eduardo ""Lalo"" González, the company’s co-founder, will continue to lead the business.

""My late father is the namesake of this brand, and I know he would be proud to see how far we've come,"" González said in the announcement.

Otherwise, everybody’s free speech is at risk, dependent on the political tides.” THE CHALLENGER: Helena Buonanno Foulkes sat down with me last week for a lengthy video interview.

***The Rhode Island Life Science Hub, per spokeswoman Sarah Sutton, “announced the investment of $4 million in nondilutive funding to 5 companies either relocating to Rhode Island or building their businesses in the state.","Fallout from the assassination of Charlie Kirk in Utah continues to roil American politics, media and entertainment.

The most prominent example is ABC’s decision to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel “indefinitely” following conservative criticism for these remarks: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

Closer to home, a Barrington teacher faced conservative scorn for his remarks about Kirk, and the School Committee appointed an outside lawyer to review the matter. In a statement, the Rhode Island ACLU condemned political violence since it chills and erodes the First Amendment.

“At the same time,” the civil liberties group added, “stifling controversial, and even offensive, speech in response to that violence also erodes those principles.”

Kirk has been cited as an exemplar of free speech – “Charlie Kirk was practicing politics the right way,” argued Ezra Klein – so the idea of suppressing speech in his memory strikes some as ironic. President Trump continues to wage legal fights against media organizations, even as the response of Trump’s FCC chair to Kimmel discomfited GOP senators.

Big TV corporations with local operations figure in the fallout: WPRI owner Nexstar (which is seeking FCC approval of a $6.2-billion deal) said its ABC affiliates would preempt Kimmel’s show. Sinclair (which owns WJAR and recently acquired the non-license operations of WLNE) went further, calling on the FCC and ABC to take additional action after Kimmel’s suspension.

Back in the Ocean State, the RI ACLU said the probe of the Barrington teacher highlights the danger of stifling speech: “While speech directly intended to provoke violence is not protected by the First Amendment, the ability to speak freely in one’s private capacity about public issues – including the right to criticize, challenge and denounce opposing political views, however crudely – must be safeguarded, especially when that speech is considered unpopular or provocative. Otherwise, everybody’s free speech is at risk, dependent on the political tides.”

THE CHALLENGER: Helena Buonanno Foulkes sat down with me last week for a lengthy video interview. Here are some key highlights.

***Gov. Dan McKee’s campaign has made clear that Foulkes’ role at CVS Health will be a key issue in the governor’s campaign. Asked why the central claim made in a federal lawsuit against CVS is wrong – that the company failed in its role as a gatekeeper of highly addictive drugs – Foulkes blamed the opioid crisis on Purdue Pharma and said CVS was a leader in responding. “We cut off over 600 pill-mill doctors. We did the biggest drug takeback movement the country’s ever seen. And I personally led an effort where I got together with other chain drugstore leaders to make sure we advocated for legislation to reduce the number of pills you could get when you left minor surgery,” she said. CVS, WalMart and Walgreens have paid out millions in settlements related to opioids, so should there have been more skepticism about surging opioid prescriptions? “I think it’s really easy to Monday morning quarterback,” Foulkes responded. She said pharmacists tried their best to assess whether patients had a legitimate need for medication.

***During her campaign announcement, Foulkes pledged to work energetically to grow jobs in Rhode Island. Her rhetoric on that sounded a lot like what Gina Raimondo said when she ran in 2014. Data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve shows that Rhode Island’s labor participation rate remained largely flat under Raimondo until the COVID pandemic. So why would things be any different with Foulkes? She said she would target better-paying jobs.

***Asked if she could invite anyone to a dinner party from throughout the course of human history, Foulkes picked Rosa Parks, Nancy Pelosi, George Washington, Gandhi and one of the founders of Salve Regina University.

THE INCUMBENT: Gov. McKee, not surprisingly, appears to be aiming to elevate his profile as we edge into campaign season: He urged the Public Utilities Commission to deliver at least $25 million in additional energy rate relief; McKee also directed the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner to make an aggressive review of what is driving health insurance premium increases and identify ways to confront them. McKee announced the availability of an additional $500,000 to support RIPTA; he signed on with fellow governors in a joint letter urging Congress to help reduce health insurance costs; McKee was interviewed for a PBS NewsHour piece on economic fallout from the Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind.

THE SPEAKER: As he ponders his possible entry to the race for governor, House Speaker Joe Shekarchi said Hasbro was hell-bent on leaving Pawtucket for the bauble of Boston’s Seaport District.

“They were not interested” in subsidies and land being offered by local officials in Rhode Island, Shekarchi told the Law 401 podcast from Roger Williams University School of Law. “They wanted to move for two reasons [for things] that we don’t have around: they wanted to go to a talent pool, an employment pool, that had a lot of experience in online gaming …. The other issue moving to Boston, they wanted to be near Lego .… The handwriting was on the wall for Hasbro. They really didn’t want to stay here.” That’s a contrast from May, when lawmakers made a change requested by FM to help keep the big insurer in Rhode Island.

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL: Amid news that commercial health premiums for nearly 175,000 Rhode Islanders will climb next year, AG Peter Neronha offered this comment via Bluesky: “These increases are awarded by the Health Commissioner in a vacuum – without any appreciation of the overall health care crisis in RI – and where he has offered little. Rhode Islanders have every right to be upset with the Gov for ignoring the crisis that we have been speaking about for so long.”

PVD: Providence Mayor Brett Smiley has scaled the heights of state and city government since he came to Rhode Island to manage Charlie Fogarty’s gubernatorial campaign way back in 2006. For now, Smiley remains an odds-on favorite to win reelection next year. But state Rep. David Morales (D-Providence) argues Smiley isn’t doing enough to tackle the capital city’s affordability crisis, and he announced his challenge to Smiley this week.

“It’s time City Hall worked for us,” Morales, 27, said while unveiling his run via video this week. “For too long, politicians like Brett Smiley have asked us to trust their experience while working families are struggling to get by. The cost of living is crushing us.” (Smiley’s campaign said he’s focused on governing and touted his experience in finance, management and government.) Smiley has a big edge in campaign fundraising, and he’s built his recognition and political relationships over time. Morales hopes to channel the paradigm-shift of Zohran Mamdani. Will it be enough to build a citywide coalition and chip away at the incumbent’s East Side base? (You can watch my recent interview with Morales to get a better sense of him.) For now, it’s worth noting how one of the candidates for an open Ward 2 seat, Jill Davidson, worked with Morales before his recent departure from the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council.

DISMAL SCIENCE: A few economic notes ….

***With President Trump pursuing a remake of the Federal Reserve, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will keynote the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce’s Economic Outlook Luncheon on noon Tuesday at the Crowne Plaza in Warwick.

***The Rhode Island Life Science Hub, per spokeswoman Sarah Sutton, “announced the investment of $4 million in nondilutive funding to 5 companies either relocating to Rhode Island or building their businesses in the state. With these most recent awards, RILSH has now deployed a total of $16M since its launch to RI-based companies.” However, there are more grim tidings about Boston’s “biotech winter,” as Kara Miller reports in the Globe.

***The number of Rhode Island based jobs rose by 500 from July to August, as the state’s unemployment rate fell from 4.8 to 4.6%, per the RI Department of Labor and Training.

***Paige Parks from Rhode Island KIDS COUNT warns that greater efforts to address childhood poverty in the state are vital “since children who live in poverty, especially at a young age, have worse outcomes as adults.”

HOUSING: House GOP Leader Michael Chippendale (R-Foster) led the charge last week in asserting that RIHousing, the state’s housing finance agency, spends too much on administration and not enough on developing housing. He said there should be an audit to dig deeper. The quasi-public agency rejects Chippendale’s criticism.",http://warwickonline.com/images/og-warwick.png,N,,2025-09-25 13:16:15.962111

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.","Investors in Kraft Heinz Co (Symbol: KHC) saw new options become available today, for the November 7th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KHC options chain for the new November 7th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $23.00 strike price has a current bid of 4 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $23.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $22.96 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KHC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $26.36/share today.

Because the $23.00 strike represents an approximate 13% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 75%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.17% return on the cash commitment, or 1.47% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Kraft Heinz Co, and highlighting in green where the $23.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $27.00 strike price has a current bid of 50 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of KHC stock at the current price level of $26.36/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $27.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.32% if the stock gets called away at the November 7th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KHC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Kraft Heinz Co, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing KHC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $27.00 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $27.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

The Shanghai Summer International Consumption Season, running from July to October each year, has become a signature event showcasing the city's culture, travel, sports, and entertainment.
Global retailers further enriched the season with flagship openings and new retail experiences.
""Shanghai's dynamic business environment and diverse, open-minded consumer base provides IKEA with a valuable platform for innovation,"" said Cindy Ruan, vice president, Communication & Public Affairs, IKEA China.
In terms of store displays, IKEA Shanghai has actively embraced local characteristics by capitalizing on three major trends among shoppers: the coffee culture, the elderly shoppers' group, and the pet economy.","Editor's note:

As global investors recalibrate amid uncertainty, Shanghai remains a magnet.

The figures tell part of the story. As of the end of June this year, the number of foreign-invested entities paying taxes in Shanghai rose 18.7 percent compared with 2020. In the first seven months of 2025 alone, 3,624 new foreign firms registered, a 3.1 percent year-on-year increase, bringing in close to US$10 billion in fresh capital.

Behind these numbers lies a larger question: how will Shanghai sustain its appeal while much of the world economy slows? In the months ahead, this column will explore how policy changes, corporate strategies, and on-the-ground dynamics continue to shape investment in the city.

This episode looks at how global retailers are shaping the city's retail scene with fresh offerings.

The Shanghai Summer International Consumption Season, running from July to October each year, has become a signature event showcasing the city's culture, travel, sports, and entertainment.

This year, Shanghai rolled out a range of tailored experiences for international travelers and customers, from pop culture and fitness to traditional aesthetics and urban discoveries, along with perks such as multi-day tour passes. The city is also leveraging shopping festivals, exhibitions, and sports events to boost inbound tourism.

From January to June, the city welcomed 4.248 million inbound tourists, up 38.5 percent year-on-year. Sales of tax-free goods for tourists surged 85 percent, with purchases under the ""refund on purchase"" scheme soaring 28.1 times compared to the previous year.

Global retailers further enriched the season with flagship openings and new retail experiences.

Coach

In May, American fashion brand Coach opened its first resort retail store in China at Shanghai Disney Resort, combining shopping with social spaces and offering signature collections alongside Disney-exclusive editions. Adjacent to the shopping area, the Coach Café serves classic coffee beverages, specialty pastries, and other signature treats.

Coach has rolled out a series of targeted service initiatives across its multiple stores in Shanghai, including multilingual assistance and payment convenience, tax-free shopping guidance and tax refund services, city-specific customized offerings, and digital support solutions.

These are all designed to enhance the shopping experience for international visitors.

""We remain committed to pioneering new localized consumer experiences, unlocking more possibilities for a better life for consumers, and injecting fresh momentum into Shanghai's development as an international consumption hub,"" said Liliana Lucioni, president of Coach China.

Through diverse and innovative business models, it keeps up efforts to help build Shanghai's reputation as a premier launchpad for new products. Coach is focused on delivering products and experiences that resonate with Chinese consumers and align closely with local preferences, she noted.

The first Coach Coffee Shop was unveiled at Shanghai New World Daimaru last year, representing the global fashion house's latest venture into crafting interactive experiences for local consumers' evolving appetite and desire for self-expression.

The many successful pilot and debut products as well as new initiatives and achievements have inspired us to continue bringing more opportunities for a better life to Chinese consumers, she said.

L'Oréal

L'Oréal – a Paris-based international company rooted in Shanghai for 28 years – has staged immersive activations, bold product innovations and engaging consumer touchpoints during the summer consumption season, and has blended technology, art and lifestyle to make beauty Shanghai's latest calling card and ignite a surge in summer consumption.

In July, L'Oréal AirLight Pro Hairdryer was launched, which aims to deliver an unparalleled drying and styling experience for salon clients, following its debut at last year's China International Import Expo.

The ""Lancôme Génifique Ultimate Lotion Launch Event"" was a two-day limited-time urban water park hosted at the Jing'an Kerry Centre in August. It staged a160-meter pool, a semi-transparent blue lifebuoy canopy, and giant product models to create a stunning visual juxtaposition and attendees experienced and shared the product's key selling points organically, sparking a viral ""urban water fun"" trend.

Creating these immersive experience scenarios and fostering emotional connections is the latest response to consumers today who seek not only products, but also the emotional value and the experience behind them.

""Shanghai is the ideal global launchpad for many new brands and products. Leveraging the city's vibrant consumer market and forward-thinking consumer mindset, we will continue to launch more new products and brands here, solidifying Shanghai as the premier destination and trendsetter for global beauty trends,"" said Lan Zhenzhen, chief corporate affairs and engagement officer of L'Oréal North Asia and China.

L'Oréal is boosting research and innovation investment in Shanghai. Through open innovation programs like BIG BANG, it encourages startups and SMEs to accelerate their innovative efforts, aiming to catalyze significant advancements in beauty technology solutions and reshape the future of beauty.

Apart from product offerings, it's also leading the way with new consumption concepts: the pioneering ""The Beauty of Longevity"" concept was unveilded earlier this year in Shanghai, and it intends to drive innovation, deepening partnerships with industry players, and bringing the ""New-Age Beauty"" concept to a wider audience.

IKEA

IKEA's Xuhui outlet was unveiled in Shanghai 27 years ago as the Swedish furniture giant's first physical store in China and amidst a rapidly evolving retail landscape, it keeps on focusing on the genuine needs of Chinese families, offering integrated home furnishing solutions tailored to Chinese consumers' preferences, becoming their trusted ""home furnishing expert"".

""Shanghai's dynamic business environment and diverse, open-minded consumer base provides IKEA with a valuable platform for innovation,"" said Cindy Ruan, vice president, Communication & Public Affairs, IKEA China.

IKEA has consistently deepened its local connections in the city by offering products, solutions, and professional services tailored to the needs of local consumers, she explained.

A series of refreshing summer drinks were offered in its restaurants in Shanghai stores during the hot weather to diversify the beverage menu for shoppers.

Six home living scenarios were set up inside the ""IKEA Blue House, Home's Hidden Playbook"" time-limit exhibition in early September.

Staged at Tank Shanghai art park, it's part of the Shanghai Summer tailor-made events to introduce new products as well as new brand positioning to Chinese consumers to enhance home living experiences.

In the new fiscal year starting on September, the group plans to introduce over 1,600 new furniture and home goods items, 23 new product collections, and more than 50 new food offerings, hoping to align with consumer's lifestyle needs and expectations.

PALO ALTO, CA, UNITED STATES, September 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- For organizations choosing new notebooks for their teams, artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical consideration. As AI becomes a part of every business workflow, it’s more and more critical to invest in devices that can handle on-device AI processing smoothly and quickly. Of course, notebooks still need to deliver good battery life and strong performance for everyday work applications, and depending on the industry, performance for resource-intensive and graphics-intensive apps may also be a consideration.

Principled Technologies (PT) compared an HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 processor to a Dell Pro 14 Plus laptop powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro and a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 laptop powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro. PT found that the HP system delivered advantages in a number of areas, including multitasking performance and AI performance. The PT report covers these results and what they mean, as well as looking at privacy protection, thermal performance, serviceability, battery life, and more.

According to the report, “For the demands of next-gen workloads, your teams need a system

and processor designed to handle AI and other rising applications. Delivering high performance scores, a workday’s worth of battery life, and comfortable physical user experiences, the HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC we tested also featured quickly serviceable components, a helpful built-in AI assistant, and intelligent privacy features. Compared to a Dell Pro 14 Plus and a Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, each powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V processor with Intel vPro, the AMD Ryzen™ AI 7 PRO 350 processor-powered HP EliteBook 8 G1a 14 inch Notebook Next Gen AI PC is a powerful and performant choice for the AI era.”

Johnson & Sons for falsely marketing their packaging as recyclable",Not Available,,,,,https://www.phillyvoice.com/philadelphia-bimbo-sc-johnson-plastic-bags-recycling-lawsuit/,"Philadelphia is suing two major manufacturers for allegedly mislabeling plastic bags as recyclable.
The lawsuit says the companies are misleading consumers into thinking that if they recycle the plastic bags, they will be made into new products.
Philadelphia banned all single-use plastic bags and non-recyclable paper bags in 2019 in an effort to reduce waste and save money.
Residents used nearly 1 billion plastic bags a year — bags that littered local streets and waterways and got caught in recycling plant machinery, creating dangerous conditions, according to the city.
""Largely due to manufacturers' deceptive statements to consumers that they can recycle plastic bags, plastic film is the number one contaminant causing problems for Philadelphia's municipal recycling system,"" the lawsuit says.","Philadelphia is suing two major manufacturers for allegedly mislabeling plastic bags as recyclable.

Bimbo Bakeries, a bakery product manufacturer with its U.S. headquarters in Horsham, Montgomery County, and S.C. Johnson & Son, a household supply manufacturer, have engaged in ""parallel deceptive marketing,"" leading consumers to think they can buy the companies' products without contributing to plastic waste, according to a lawsuit the city filed Tuesday in the Court of Common Pleas with co-counsel Hausfeld LLP, a Philadelphia firm.

Language and symbols – including the chasing arrows symbol – used on Bimbo's plastic film bread bags and on S.C. Johnson's Ziploc bag packaging ""is profoundly misleading at best,"" the lawsuit says. ""Even if it is theoretically possible to recycle plastic bags under limited circumstances, technical and economic realities foreseeably make it so that no matter how hard consumers try to recycle those plastic bags, those bags will nevertheless almost always go to waste.""

Bimbo brands include Thomas', Sara Lee, Entenmann's, Arnold, Freihofer's and Stroehmann Pennsylvania Dutch Bakers. S.C. Johnson has owned the Ziploc brand since 1998, according to the lawsuit.

The city is seeking injunctions against the companies to revise their labels related to recycling, and suing for an undisclosed amount of damages.

Bimbo said in an emailed statement that it is ""committed to zero waste across our operations, including consumer packaging, and to being a strong partner in every community we serve, especially our hometown of Philadelphia.""

The company had not yet been served with the complaint and would review it upon receipt, Bimbo said.

S.C. Johnson & Son did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit says the companies are misleading consumers into thinking that if they recycle the plastic bags, they will be made into new products.

""Companies that label their products with the goal of implying their product is recyclable when it isn't are not just breaking the law, but they are violating public trust and contributing to waste,"" Mayor Cherelle Parker said in a press release.

The bank’s stress test, published in Navigating Nature Risk: Applying the TNFD’s LEAP Framework, analysed 250 mines linked to 30 companies and about 9,000 European power facilities. It found that transition risks such as higher water prices, stricter pollution rules, expansion of protected areas and increased minerals recycling pose the greatest threat to miners.

Power companies faced smaller potential earnings declines of around 10%, mainly due to physical risks such as droughts and floods.

The World Economic Forum estimates that adopting nature-positive practices could unlock over $430 billion in cost savings and new revenue across the mining and metals value chain by 2030. Yet nearly three-quarters of mining assets overlap with sensitive locations, most commonly areas of high physical water risk. Copper mines, concentrated in water-stressed countries such as Australia, South Africa and Chile, were the most exposed.

Barclays said biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation are emerging as systemic financial risks. “These risks are increasingly materialising across our clients’ operations,” said Marie Freier, head of sustainability.

Things to Know Ahead of UNFI’s Q4 Earnings

UNFI is expected to have been pressured by the cybersecurity incident disclosed in early June, which forced management to shut down IT systems and disrupt distribution. The company expects the cyber incident to reduce fiscal 2025 net sales by about $350 million to $400 million and lower adjusted EBITDA by $40 million to $50 million, leading to a total estimated net loss of $50 million to $60 million, which includes the estimated tax impact.

The company has also been dealing with the financial impact of exiting its relationship with Key Food and closing the Allentown distribution center. The contract has been terminated with a $53 million fee that is set to be recognized in the fiscal fourth quarter. These factors are expected to have impacted the top and bottom lines in the to-be-reported quarter.

Despite these near-term challenges, UNFI continues to demonstrate growth and operational resilience, supported by strong demand in its wholesale segment and ongoing consumer interest in natural and organic products. Strategic initiatives, such as expanding its customer base, optimizing the distribution network and investing in automation, have improved efficiency and market reach. Lean management practices have further enhanced execution, aligning supply with customer needs and driving cost savings.

The MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 in 19.5'' for steer and drive axles is designed to take on the challenges of regional and urban transport.

It offers exceptional safety and versatility year-round, in any weather conditions and on any road.

It is essentially designed for trucks that make frequent deliveries on short or mid-distance routes.

The MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D 19.5'' line is available in several sizes (285/70R19.5 since June 1, 2025 and 245/70R19.5 and 265/70R19.5 since September 1, 2025) and approved for most global markets.

Mileage (1), outstanding braking performance (2), versatility and robustness for enhanced safety and durability.

The MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 19.5'' line stands out thanks to its:

Enhanced mileage (1) : MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 tires offer up to 30% more mileage on the steer axle and 15% more mileage on the drive axle compared to the previous generation, for less frequent replacements and lower fleet operating costs.

Outstanding long-lasting braking performance (2): An internal test performed under the supervision of DEKRA in June 2025 showed that when worn down to 3.5 mm of rubber, MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 tires achieved wet braking distances up to 8 m shorter than their competitors (41.36 m vs. 49.29 m), a boon for drivers in urban and suburban areas.[1]

All-season versatility: The 3PMSF marking guarantees consistent year-round performance for safety and easy handling in any weather and road conditions.

Enhanced robustness and retreadability: Innovative Duracoil technology ensures a more robust, longer-lasting casing to limit unplanned downtime and maintain the tire's performance throughout its lifespan.

Optimized rolling resistance (3): These Class C tires save users an average of €705/year/truck and can reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 1 tonne/year/truck compared to the previous generation.

Electric vehicle compatibility (4): With higher load indices in 245/70R19.5 and 285/70R19.5 (e.g. +300 kg per axle compared to the previous line in 285/70R19.5, for up to 6.3 tonnes per axle with the new line), these tires are designed for the increasing popularity of electric vehicles, since they can bear the extra weight of batteries and meet the specific needs of electric trucks.

Last-mile delivery is a major challenge for regional and urban transport.

Increasingly congested city centers and tighter environmental regulations are making last-mile delivery a crucial but often expensive phase for fleet managers.

Last-mile delivery can be stressful for drivers due to frequent braking in heavy traffic, difficulty accessing certain areas in bad weather, road conditions, and low-emissions zone restrictions.

Those demanding conditions are when MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 tires show their full potential: high mileage, outstanding braking performance, all-weather versatility, and high load indices. So many features designed to bring fleet managers and drivers peace-of-mind for urban and regional deliveries, while controlling costs and ensuring optimal safety for every trip.

Michelin's innovation and technological expertise for total performance with no trade-offs

Innovation is central to Michelin's approach: it invests over one billion euros in research and innovation every year and holds over 12,000 active patents worldwide.

The MICHELIN X® MULTI Z2 & D2 features Duracoil, Powercoil, and Regenion technologies, which are the products of decades of expertise and know-how.

A light, robust, and flexible casing:

Duracoil: A high-quality nylon reinforcement on the bead wire provides effective protection for the casing, ensuring greater stability on the road and extending the tire's lifespan.

Powercoil: New, lighter yet more robust steel cables improve rust-resistance, optimize endurance, and enable increased load capacity, which is key for electric vehicles and intensive use.

A self-regenerating tread sculpture:

Regenion: This award-winning technology is based on self-regenerating tread sculptures produced using 3D metal printing to ensure optimal grip and longevity for treads, while also reducing fuel consumption.

With over 130 years' experience, Michelin continues to support transport professionals with reliable and innovative solutions designed for contemporary challenges, confirming its commitment to safety, sustainable mobility, and total performance with no trade-offs.

H&M CEO Daniel Ervér said: “Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit compared with the same quarter last year.
“This is also reflected in the reception we received on the launch of H&M in Brazil in August.
With the H&M brand’s global strength and a locally relevant customer offering, we have taken an important step into a large fashion market.
The operating profit for the nine-month period amounted to SEK12.03bn with an operating margin of 7.1%.","During the quarter ending 31 August 2025 (Q3), H&M’s operating profit grew 40%, reaching SEK4.91bn, up from SEK3.51bn in the previous year quarter.

H&M’s operating margin now stands at 8.6%.

H&M CEO Daniel Ervér said: “Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit compared with the same quarter last year. The increase in profit shows that we are on the right track as a result of the progress we have made in our plan.

“This is also reflected in the reception we received on the launch of H&M in Brazil in August. With the H&M brand’s global strength and a locally relevant customer offering, we have taken an important step into a large fashion market. We see good potential to grow both in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America.”

H&M’s overall performance in Q3

During the third quarter, H&M’s sales rose by 2% when adjusted for currency fluctuations.

However, there was a 4% reduction in the number of stores compared to the same period in the previous year.

The company’s gross profit remained stable at SEK30.14bn, translating to a gross margin increase to 52.9%, up from 51.1%.

Performance in nine months

H&M experienced a consistent performance with a 2% rise in net sales in local currencies during the first three quarters.

Gross profit for this period stood at SEK88.74bn, corresponding to a gross margin of 52.5%.

The operating profit for the nine-month period amounted to SEK12.03bn with an operating margin of 7.1%.

The company anticipates that sales for September 2025 will align with those from the same month in the previous year.

“In an environment of ongoing uncertainty with cautious consumers, all of us within the H&M group are consistently focusing on our customer offering – always giving the best value for money. Our strong culture, together with good cost control and flexibility, allows us to continue building a stable foundation for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth in an increasingly complex environment, while taking additional important steps towards our ambitious sustainability goals,” Daniel Ervér added.

Store closures and currency impacts cause H&M’s sales to decline amid surge in profit

Chloe Tedford-Jones, apparel analyst at GlobalData says: “Continuing its trend from the previous quarter, H&M’s group sales fell 3.4% to SEK59.0bn in Q3 FY2024/25, however, this was partially hindered by the strength of the Swedish Krona, as sales in constant currency grew 2%. This led sales for the first nine months of its financial year to be down 1.9%, and remain flat in constant currency. H&M attributes its Q3 decline to the continued optimisation of its store network, evidenced by the closure of 135 underperforming locations, while it is also impacted by its ranges remaining less enticing than competitors with better fashion credentials such as Inditex. While the short-term impact of store closures has led the brand to expect sales in local currencies to remain flat in September, cost saving measures have already led to some improvement in operating profit, which rose 40.1% to SEK4.9bn in Q3. This corresponded to an operating margin of 8.6%, an improvement of 2.7ppts on the same period last year, driving a c9% increase in its share price in early morning trading.

“Western, Eastern, and Southern Europe were the group’s best performing regions in Q3, with sales rising 3% in local currencies, likely helped by improving consumer confidence as economic headwinds subside, as well as strong brand visibility. Asia, Oceania and Africa was the group’s worst performing region, where sales fell 2%, carrying out the most store closures in this market as the group continues to crack down on low profitability stores. The combination of cautious consumer spending and the negative impact of ongoing store optimisation limited the group’s performance in its home region of the Nordics, with sales remaining flat. North and South America rose 1%, aided by store openings in new locations, especially in Latin America, with the opening of H&M in Brazil in August of 2025 being well received, and the group planning further expansion in the region.

“Net sales for its Portfolio brands increased by 1% in local currencies in Q3, as stronger fashion credentials at fascias like ARKET and COS boosted sales amid low consumer confidence. The group continues to optimise its store footprint, with over 200 store closures planned for 2025. A large proportion of these closures are for Monki, however, the group plans to refurbish many of these into Weekday stores, a brand with better perceived fashion credentials, particularly among Gen Zs. This is likely to have a negative impact on sales in the short term, however early signs of improvement in local currencies point to a successful transition to growth in the future. The group is also investing in flagship store improvements through curated offerings and technological integration, while also improving its omnichannel offering by upgrading its online channel, allowing online sales to reach over 30% of the group’s revenue in the quarter.

“At the heart of the group’s turnaround is a renewed focus on marketing, with the eponymous H&M brand generating buzz by holding its first fashion show in seven years at London Fashion Week this month, using talent such as Romeo Beckham, Lila Moss and Lola Young to ensure maximum reach among the brand’s core audiences. As H&M continues to redefine itself against ultra-fast fashion and premium competitors, the brand must continue to improve its fashion credentials through marketing and celebrity endorsement..”",https://www.just-style.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2025/09/HM.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:16:30.795668

Dive Brief:

Kraft Heinz is piloting an AI agent to help employees better access information about the company’s ketchup production process, with plans for more use cases down the line.

The tool, called The Cookbook, went from idea to prototype in fewer than three months, the company told CIO Dive. It was created in partnership with Microsoft and built using Azure OpenAI. Workers have access to 150 years of Kraft Heinz expertise in ketchup production.

“With the stroke of a keyboard or tap on a tablet, users will be able to ask The Cookbook questions on everything from the thickness and color of a batch of Heinz Tomato Ketchup to insights about the efficiency of our production processes,” the company said. The Cookbook is still in the early stages, with just a select group of U.S. team members having access. The company declined to say how many.

Dive Insight:

Kraft Heinz is adding an agent to its AI portfolio in pursuit of efficiency and knowledge preservation. Prior to The Cookbook, the company launched TasteMaker, which was designed to accelerate product development and marketing.

“This is not the first AI agent to be deployed at Kraft Heinz,” Pat Nestor, head of decision intelligence products and platforms, said in an email to CIO Dive. “We continue to explore integrated AI solutions that can drive scalability and connectivity across the organization, unlocking further value for the business, our people and consumers.”

The new tool comes after the global food and beverage giant has honed its innovation funnel, driven in part by efforts to identify the right use cases and formulate business value assessments to track success.

Nestor told CIO Dive earlier this year that the company works to pressure test use cases upfront and monitors AI projects using a mix of quantitative and qualitative metrics. The process helps ensure allocated resources are going to the right use cases and avoid dead-end projects that are plaguing businesses across the economy.

This year, 42% of companies are abandoning the majority of their AI projects, up from 17% in 2024, according to an S&P Global Market Intelligence report published in March. CIOs and their enterprises often grapple with connecting use cases to business goals, sifting through vendor hype and failing to prioritize responsible practices, among other implementation challenges.

Kraft Heinz executives have touted a number of beneficial, worker-facing AI use cases, such as within the pickle-producing process and across its supply chain.

“We aim to use key learnings and insights from The Cookbook pilot to scale to other brands, products, and Kraft Heinz businesses, and we are currently in the process of exploring additional use cases for the technology,” Nestor said Tuesday. “We know it’s essential that we preserve and protect our subject matter experts’ knowledge and commitment to quality.”

Despite the AI inroads, significant changes lie ahead for Kraft Heinz.

The food and beverage giant is planning to reverse much of its $46 billion merger from 2015 and split into two companies, with one focusing on sauces, spreads and seasonings, and another housing grocery staples, such as Lunchables and Oscar Mayer. Splits and mergers often include technology hurdles, from migrating workloads to untangling tech debt.

The company has run up against many of the same challenges that others in the industry face, including changing consumer patterns and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In general, the focus on technology has sharpened in the wake of the turmoil as businesses pursue ways to alleviate pressure.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/FQOib67aFQ7NSDw6-jgUTkQfPmpg6n7jinsgQErYkyk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzEyMTY4MzgzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-25 10:09:19.899593

A large proportion of these closures are for Monki, however, the group plans to refurbish many of these into Weekday stores, a brand with better perceived fashion credentials, particularly among Gen Zs. This is likely to have a negative impact on sales in the short term, however early signs of improvement in local currencies point to a successful transition to growth in the future. The group is also investing in flagship store improvements through curated offerings and technological integration, while also improving its omnichannel offering by upgrading its online channel, allowing online sales to reach over 30% of the group’s revenue in the quarter.

“At the heart of the group’s turnaround is a renewed focus on marketing, with the eponymous H&M brand generating buzz by holding its first fashion show in seven years at London Fashion Week this month, using talent such as Romeo Beckham, Lila Moss and Lola Young to ensure maximum reach among the brand’s core audiences.

The company, however, cautioned that tariffs on imports would weigh more heavily on margins in the current quarter.
The result followed two consecutive quarters of falling earnings and was driven by a 2% rise in local-currency sales alongside improved efficiency.
Despite the profit beat, H&M warned that tariff-related costs would be more pronounced in the current quarter, which runs through November.
With the prospect of higher US tariffs, H&M has also been working to diversify its supply chain by sourcing closer to its second-largest market after Germany.","Swedish fashion retailer H&M posted a larger-than-expected rise in third-quarter profit on Thursday, supported by well-received autumn collections, a stronger product mix and tighter cost control. The company, however, cautioned that tariffs on imports would weigh more heavily on margins in the current quarter.

In a statement, H&M said its autumn collections had been “well received.” Chief executive Daniel Erver, who took over in January 2024, said the company was “taking further steps in the right direction” as he continued efforts to improve profitability and sharpen the brand’s appeal against fast-fashion rivals such as Shein and Inditex’s Zara.

Operating profit for June to August rose to US $ 531 million, up from US $ 380 million a year earlier, and beating analyst expectations of around US $ 400 million in a poll conducted by LSEG. The result followed two consecutive quarters of falling earnings and was driven by a 2% rise in local-currency sales alongside improved efficiency.

Despite the profit beat, H&M warned that tariff-related costs would be more pronounced in the current quarter, which runs through November.

Analysts at JP Morgan said the performance could prompt higher expectations for the full year, although they noted that H&M’s comments on tariffs were more restrained than anticipated. Both JP Morgan and Alphavalue welcomed a 9% drop in inventory levels, with the retailer reporting stronger full-price sales as shoppers purchased more items in season.

H&M said markdowns in the third quarter were slightly higher than a year earlier and are expected to rise further in the fourth quarter, partly because Black Friday falls one day earlier this year.

Sales fell to US $ 6.2 billion from US $ 6.4 billion, slightly above analyst expectations of US $ 6.15 billion. Local-currency sales in September were expected to remain flat compared with an unusually strong figure in the same month last year.

The company, whose customers are considered more price-sensitive than those of Inditex, has faced sustained pressure as consumers cut spending amid higher living costs. With the prospect of higher US tariffs, H&M has also been working to diversify its supply chain by sourcing closer to its second-largest market after Germany.",https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HM-reports-stronger-than-expected-Q3-profit-but-warns-of-tariff-impact.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 09:14:08.542323

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Swedish fashion group H&M reported on Thursday a substantially larger than expected rise in third-quarter profit as customers responded well to its autumn collections, although the company warned of a tariff-related impact in the current quarter.

Shares in the world's second-largest listed apparel retailer soared 10% in mid-morning trade, taking a year-to-date rise to 16%.

""The autumn collections have been well received,"" H&M said in a statement.

NEW CEO TARGETS FASHION-CONSCIOUS SHOPPER

Daniel Erver, CEO since January 2024, has been working to improve profitability and appeal to shoppers with trendier styles, aiming to compete with fast-fashion rivals Shein and Inditex's Zara as the sector contends with disruption from U.S. tariffs.

""We are taking further steps in the right direction,"" he said on Thursday.

After two consecutive quarters of falling earnings, H&M said June-August operating profit jumped to 4.91 billion crowns ($523 million) from a year-ago 3.51 billion supported by a 2% increase in local-currency sales, a stronger product mix and tighter cost control.

Analysts polled by LSEG had on average forecast a profit of 3.68 billion crowns.

H&M cautioned that tariffs on imports would weigh more heavily on margins in the current quarter, which runs through November.

JP Morgan analysts said the profit beat may prompt higher expectations for the full year, noting meanwhile that the comment on tariff impact may be slightly more subdued than some had anticipated.

MORE IN-SEASON SHOPPING AT FULL PRICE

Analysts at JP Morgan and Alphavalue also welcomed a 9% drop in inventory levels as the retailer said shoppers were buying more products in season - at full price rather than in end-of-season sales.

H&M said markdowns in the quarter were marginally bigger than a year ago, and that it expects them to be up somewhat in the fourth quarter, partly because Black Friday falls one day earlier.

Sales in reported currency fell to 57.0 billion crowns from 59.0 billion, slightly above the expected 56.8 billion.

The company said it expected local-currency sales in September to be flat compared with an unusually high year-ago figure.

H&M, whose customer base is considered more price-sensitive than Inditex’s, has faced greater pressure in recent years as consumers tighten spending amid higher living costs and global uncertainty.

The outlook for higher U.S. tariffs has pushed H&M to seek suppliers closer to the U.S. market - its second-biggest after Germany, accounting last year for 13% of group sales.

But currency effects impacted growth by around five percent. Sales were up 2 percent in local currencies during the three months to Aug. 31, while store count was reduced by 4 percent versus the same time last year.

The impact of a strong Swedish krona made those numbers less rosy, with net sales falling from 59.01 billion Swedish krona, about 5.14 billion euros, to 57.02 Swedish krona, or 4.97 billion euros.

Stricter cost controls, with administrative expenses falling 5 percent to 25.17 billion Swedish krona, and one percent in local currencies, combined with a reduction in stock of 9 percent in Swedish krona and 1 percent in local currencies, helped with the boost.

“We are taking further steps in the right direction. Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit by 40 percent compared with the same quarter last year while also having reduced the stock-in-trade,” said chief executive officer Daniel Ervér.

The stronger-than-expected yet mixed results reflected Ervér’s efforts to lay the groundwork for recovery.

“We think H&M has taken various steps to improve its offer for customers, which should lead to a stronger sales performance in time. However, a lot of things have to improve together and so far the recovery has been somewhat unbalanced in our view,” RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain said in a trading note.

“We see potential for H&M to move closer to a double-digit operating margin goal over time, driven by gross margin gains and further cost efficiencies, but we see this as more of a longer term aspiration,” he added.

H&M has been squeezed between the Chinese low-cost, ultra-fast fashion players like Shein and Temu on the pricing end, and Inditex’s behemoth Zara, which has strengthened its fashion credibility, on the other end.

Ervér has been trying to upscale the brand and bring back its cool factor, including partnerships with celebrities such as Charli XCX, a runway show at London Fashion Week and downsizing its massive stores while upscaling their design quotient.

“Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit compared with the same quarter last year. The increase in profit shows that we are on the right track as a result of the progress we have made in our plan,” he said.

Smaller stores indicate where he wants to take the brand. “This is a good example of how we are developing the customer experience but also strengthening our brand,” he added.

H&M also launched in Brazil in the quarter, and has its sights set on expansion across Latin America.

“We continue to focus fully on updating a large part of our stores globally, with improvements in layout, presentation and tech to further enhance the customer experience, while at the same time the physical and digital channels strengthen and complement each other,” he said.

“In an environment of ongoing uncertainty with cautious consumers, all of us within the H&M group are consistently focusing on our customer offering – always giving the best value for money.”

Looking ahead, sales in early September were “on par” with the same month last year, when they rose 11 percent.

According to its nine-month interim report, which was released today (25 September), H&M Group recorded an increased operating margin of 8.6%, compared to 5.9% a year ago.

While net sales in local currencies climbed 2% in Q3, the stronger Swedish krona impacted recorded sales. The group reported SEK 57,017 million (£4.51 billion) in sales, down from SEK 59,011 million (£4.51bn).

The brand – which owns H&M, COS, & Other Stories and Arket – said gross profit in Q3 stood at SEK 30,143 million (£2.38bn), delivering a gross margin of 52.9%, up from 51.1% in the same period last year.

The report attributes the margin enhancement to improvements across supply chain operations and favourable external cost factors, offsetting some adverse currency effects.

On the cost side, the group reduced selling and administrative expenses by 5% in SEK terms to SEK 25,167 million (£1.99bn).

The company highlighted that cost control has been a critical lever in strengthening profitability.

As of 31 August 2025, the group operated 4,118 stores globally — a net reduction of 180 stores (–4%) year-on-year. During the first nine months, 36 new stores opened and 171 closed.

Over 30% of H&M’s sales now occur online and the business said it is enhancing customer experience via upgraded store layouts, tech investments, and tighter alignment between physical and digital channels.

H&M launched its first store, and an online presence, in Brazil at end of August 2025, with further store openings planned across Latin America. Other planned expansions include El Salvador, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Malta, via franchise, as well as the first COS store in India.

H&M expects sales in September 2025 to match last year’s levels in local currency terms, but said this must be viewed against strong comparatives from 2024.

To mitigate pressures ahead, H&M says it will lean on supply chain flexibility, pricing strategy and cost control.

Robyn Duffy, consumer markets senior analyst at RSM UK, said the latest results show H&M’s “turnaround strategy is making progress”.

“Despite sluggish sales growth of just 2% in local currencies, operating profit surged 40% on the back of tighter stock management, an improved gross margin and firm cost control. A sharper product mix and faster stock turnaround reduced inventory by 9% year-on-year, easing markdowns and lifting margins.

“Overall, H&M is showing clear progress on its turnaround journey. The next challenge will be sustaining profitability while continuing to invest in product, customer experience, stores and digital capability to reinforce its global position.”

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Swedish fashion group H&M reported on Thursday a substantially bigger rise than expected in third-quarter profit as shoppers took to autumn styles, but warned of higher tariff related costs in the current quarter.

The world's second-largest listed apparel retailer predicted the cost of tariffs on imports would have a bigger impact on gross margin in the three months through November.

H&M is trying to boost profitability and attract shoppers through trendier clothes to compete with Shein and Inditex' Zara, while U.S. tariffs disrupt the fast-fashion industry.

""The autumn collections have been well received,"" H&M said in a statement.

Following two consecutive fiscal quarters of falling earnings, June-August operating profit was 4.91 billion crowns ($523 million) against a year-earlier 3.51 billion and a mean forecast in an LSEG poll of analysts of 3.68 billion, on sales growth measured in local currencies of 2%.

H&M said it expected local-currency sales in September to be flat compared with a high year-ago figure.

It said markdowns in the third quarter were marginally bigger than a year earlier, and that it expects them to be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter, partly because Black Friday falls one day earlier.

In reported currency, sales fell in the third quarter, to 57.0 billion crowns from 59.0 billion against an expected 56.8 billion.

H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB Nine-month report 2025

Third quarter (1 June 2025 — 31 August 2025)

Sales in local currencies increased by 2 percent in the third quarter, with 4 percent fewer stores at the end of the quarter compared with the same point in time last year. Converted into SEK, net sales amounted to SEK 57,017 m (59,011). Net sales in SEK were negatively affected by a currency translation effect of around 5 percentage points due to the strengthened Swedish krona.

Gross profit amounted to SEK 30,143 m (30,133), which corresponds to a gross margin of 52.9 percent (51.1).

Selling and administrative expenses decreased by 5 percent to SEK 25,167 m (26,602). In local currencies these expenses decreased by 1 percent.

Operating profit increased by 40 percent to SEK 4,914 m (3,507), corresponding to an operating margin of 8.6 percent (5.9). An improved customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control have contributed to the increase in profit in the quarter.

The result after tax increased to SEK 3,212 m (2,3061), corresponding to SEK 2.01 (1.441) per share.

Cash flow from operating activities increased to SEK 9,985 m (8,215).

The stock-in-trade decreased by 9 percent to SEK 37,938 m (41,738) and the composition of the stock-in-trade is assessed to be good. Currency adjusted the stock-in-trade decreased by 3 percent compared with the previous year. The stock-in-trade in SEK represented 16.4 percent (17.8) of rolling 12 months sales.

H&M opened its first store as well as online in Brazil at the end of August, which has been very well received by customers.

Nine months (1 December 2024 — 31 August 2025)

In local currencies net sales increased by 2 percent in the first nine months of the financial year. Converted into SEK, the H&M group’s net sales amounted to SEK 169,064 m (172,285).

Gross profit amounted to SEK 88,737 m (91,357). This corresponds to a gross margin of 52.5 percent (53.0).

Selling and administrative expenses amounted to SEK 76,594 m (78,612). In local currencies these expenses were on par with the previous year.

Operating profit amounted to SEK 12,031 m (12,682), corresponding to an operating margin of 7.1 percent (7.4).

The result after tax amounted to SEK 7,753 m (8,6011), corresponding to SEK 4.86 (5.351) per share.

Cash flow from operating activities amounted to SEK 22,714 m (24,782).

The autumn collections have been well received. In local currencies the H&M group’s sales in the month of September 2025 are expected to be on par with the same month last year. Sales development in September 2025 should be seen in the light of high comparative figures from last year.

H&M ranks as number 1 out of 200 fashion companies in the latest What Fuels Fashion? report by Fashion Revolution, which evaluates companies transparency on decarbonisation and other sustainability areas.

“We are taking further steps in the right direction. Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit by 40 percent compared with the same quarter last year while also having reduced the stock-in-trade,” says Daniel Ervér, CEO.

Comments by Daniel Ervér, CEO

The positive sales trend continued in the third quarter. Sales increased by 2 percent in local currencies during the period, while at the same time the number of stores decreased by 4 percent at the end of the quarter compared with the same point in time last year.

Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit compared with the same quarter last year. The increase in profit shows that we are on the right track as a result of the progress we have made in our plan.

This is also reflected in the reception we received on the launch of H&M in Brazil in August. With the H&M brand’s global strength and a locally relevant customer offering, we have taken an important step into a large fashion market. We see good potential to grow both in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America.

In September we opened a new flagship store in Le Marais, Paris, with a specially curated assortment, presentation and interior design concept. This is a good example of how we are developing the customer experience but also strengthening our brand. Another example is the upgrade of our digital store that was rolled out earlier this year. We are getting positive feedback from our customers and can see that the digital store has made an important contribution to the profitable growth in the quarter. We continue to focus fully on updating a large part of our stores globally, with improvements in layout, presentation and tech to further enhance the customer experience, while at the same time the physical and digital channels strengthen and complement each other.

In an environment of ongoing uncertainty with cautious consumers, all of us within the H&M group are consistently focusing on our customer offering – always giving the best value for money. Our strong culture, together with good cost control and flexibility, allows us to continue building a stable foundation for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth in an increasingly complex environment, while taking additional important steps towards our ambitious sustainability goals.

The European standard Optigal® range is engineered to perform in harsh environments, offering unmatched corrosion resistance and durability.
Optigal® Prime offers a 15-year warranty and advanced finishes such as Silicon Modified Polyester (SMP), Super Durable Polyester (SDP), and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF).
Manufactured at AM/NS India’s advanced facility in Pune, Optigal® Prime reflects the ‘Make in India’ mission and meets strict sustainability standards.","Chennai: ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India) has launched Optigal® Prime – a high-performance, colour-coated steel engineered to stringent European standards – in Jammu & Kashmir. The Union Territory’s intense cold, long monsoons, and freeze–thaw cycles often lead to rust and erode steel’s structural integrity, driving demand for highly durable steel that resists corrosion. Optigal® Prime is designed to meet this urgent need, making it ideal for mountain homes as well as large-scale, high-end infrastructure and construction projects such as state-of-the-art airports, railway stations, highways, and other critical developments across the region.

Developed by ArcelorMittal – one of its parent companies, Optigal® range sets a new benchmark for durability. The product’s debut in Jammu & Kashmir strengthens AM/NS India’s leadership in pioneering a new market segment for high-quality C4 specialty steel – a grade previously unavailable in the country, making the company the sole domestic producer.

Mr. Ranjan Dhar, Director and Vice President of Sales & Marketing at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India) said, “Optigal® Prime’s availability in Jammu & Kashmir reiterates our commitment to provide quality, durable, and sustainable innovations to our diverse range of customers, be it individual home builders or customers involved in large-scale projects. The European standard Optigal® range is engineered to perform in harsh environments, offering unmatched corrosion resistance and durability. We believe this offering will play a key role in building future-ready constructn and infrastructure across the region which is quality conscious. This new offering is available for the first time in India, outside of Europe where it has been a favourite product.”

Mr Dhar also highlighted AM/NS India’s recent contributions to the region’s infrastructure transformation, including supplying steel for two iconic projects: the world’s highest rail bridge – ‘Chenab Bridge’ (with 100% of steel supplied); and India’s first and only cable-stayed rail bridge – ‘Anji Khad Bridge’ (with 70% of steel supplied).

Optigal® Prime offers a 15-year warranty and advanced finishes such as Silicon Modified Polyester (SMP), Super Durable Polyester (SDP), and Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF). Designed for roofing, cladding, and a range of architectural applications, it is built for environments that demand resilience. The technology of Zinc-Aluminium-Magnesium coating used for it provides up to three times the protection against corrosion and weathering compared to conventional coatings.

Six specialised variants, High Gloss, Anti-Dust, Anti-Graffiti, Anti-Static, Anti-Microbial, and Cool Roof, make Optigal® Prime a versatile range of high-performance steel. Whether used in sloping mountain home roofs or cladding for public buildings that face year-round weather swings in Jammu and Kashmir, the variants are built to ensure endurance without compromise.

Manufactured at AM/NS India’s advanced facility in Pune, Optigal® Prime reflects the ‘Make in India’ mission and meets strict sustainability standards. It features low Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), contains no heavy metals or hexavalent chromium, and is fully recyclable. The company currently produces seven lakh tonnes of colour-coated steel annually, with plans to reach 1 million tonnes.",https://pimwp.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/2025/09/Farhana-PIM-Template-1.png,N,,2025-09-25 15:12:33.931072

Privia Health is acquiring a value-based primary care business from Evolent Health as the physician enablement company continues to expand its care delivery network into new geographies.

Evolent has agreed to sell its accountable care organization business, called Evolent Care Partners, for $100 million in cash, the companies announced aftermarket Tuesday. Another $13 million is contingent on the ACO’s performance in traditional Medicare’s largest value-based care program in 2025.

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and positively contribute to Privia’s adjusted earnings next year. Analysts said the deal is favorable for both parties.

Dive Insight:

Privia Health is one of the biggest physician enablement companies in the U.S., with a footprint in 15 states and Washington, D.C. The company, which went public in 2021, helps medical groups, hospitals and other providers implement value-based care arrangements in which financial payouts are tied to patient outcomes, care quality and other metrics instead of being based on the volume or complexity of services provided.

Through the acquisition, which Privia is financing with cash on hand, Privia is adding Evolent Care Partners’ more than 120,000 lives in the Medicare Shared Savings Program, various commercial programs and Medicare Advantage. The deal brings Privia’s total number of attributed lives in value-based care arrangements to 1.5 million across both new and existing states, the Virginia-based company said.

Analysts estimate roughly 70,000 to 80,000 of those lives are in MSSP, a program that represents a significant earnings contributor for Privia. Participating ACOs, or groups of providers that link up to take on financial risk, are paid a portion of the savings they generate for Medicare, with the goal of improving outcomes while lowering costs by incentivizing providers to better manage patient care.

Outperformance in MSSP was behind Privia’s decision to raise its guidance for 2025 results in August.

Bringing Evolent Care Partners onboard gives Privia a chance to hike the ACO’s shared savings rate to its own level, analysts said. Evolent Care Partners had a shared savings rate of 5.9% in 2024, which — although decent — is lower than Privia’s 9.3% savings rate across its ACOs, according to a CMS database and company data.

“We see potential for [Evolent Care Partners] to generate additional earnings through [Privia] improving MSSP performance over time,” TD Cowen analyst Ryan Langston wrote in a note on the acquisition.

Evolent Care Partners is also affiliated with more than 1,000 doctors, so the deal includes access to a large potential customer base for Privia’s technology and services platform.

Overall, Evolent estimates that the assets being sold to Privia represent roughly $10 million in adjusted earnings before taxes and other accounting adjustments.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/93IiP8ViBH4r9xt0RR4Xsu5K_sj6UTU3zvWY-U7-kjY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTMwMjQ4MTE5XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-25 08:08:07.857993

Fortive Corporation (NYSE: FTV) is what you get when industrial know-how meets the software age. The company makes gear, software, and services for industrial, safety, and healthcare markets—think Fluke test tools, safety and asset-management platforms, even diagnostic equipment for labs and clinics. Since spinning off its Precision Technologies arm (now called Ralliant) in June 2025, Fortive has focused even more on boosting productivity, safety, and healthcare solutions. Its two main segments—Intelligent Operating Solutions (IOS) and Advanced Healthcare Solutions (AHS)—help lay the digital tracks for what’s often called Industry 4.0 (that’s the smart, connected next chapter for factories and hospitals). Fortive faces off with the likes of Emerson Electric, Rockwell Automation, and Schneider Electric in automation; Keysight Technologies, Mettler-Toledo, and Cognex in test and inspection; and Thermo Fisher Scientific and Danaher in diagnostics. What sets Fortive apart? Recognizable brands, powerful software, lots of recurring revenue, and a relentless improvement drive thanks to its in-house playbook, the Fortive Business System.

Recent Performance

Over the past year (through September 24, 2025), Fortive shares dropped 13.8%. That’s a far cry from the S&P 500, which climbed 16.2%—putting Fortive over 30 points behind the market. Much of that shortfall can be traced to the spinoff of Ralliant in June, which shrunk Fortive’s revenue and left investors guessing about the transition. On top of that, weaker orders from industrial customers (thanks to tariffs and general macro jitters) left core revenue flat in the second quarter and pushed Fortive to just miss earnings expectations. It all adds up to cautious sentiment and a share price lagging its peers.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Fortive is planning for mid-single-digit core revenue growth and high-single-digit adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth in the medium term. Tailwinds from digital transformation in manufacturing and infrastructure are expected to help, but recent results have been slow—Q2 2025 revenue from continuing operations came in at $1.02 billion, down 0.4% year-over-year, and core growth even dipped 0.7%. Management is guiding for full-year revenue between $6.2 and $6.4 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.50–2.60. Those forecasts are underpinned by steady software and service revenues, some targeted acquisitions in IOS, more safety and compliance offerings, and incremental help from cost cuts and buybacks. Over the long haul, trends like predictive maintenance, connected worker solutions, and lab automation could help Fortive outpace the broader sector—if it succeeds in selling more software to its existing customers and making the most of its platform investments.

Quality & Moat

Fortive’s profitability is consistently strong: in Q2 2025, its adjusted EBITDA margin hit 28.4%, and operating margin clocked in at 16.8%. That’s right in line with its last five years (16.6% average), but a little below the market’s 18.7%. What really stands out is free cash flow yield, at 6.3%—that’s way above its own five-year average (2.4%) and the market’s (1.9%), thanks to tight working capital management and a chunky $345 million in buybacks in the first half of 2025. Return on invested capital (ROIC) comes in at 6.8%, slightly under its own average and trailing the market’s 11.1%, so there’s work to do on being more efficient with its money. Fortive’s moat is built on its stable of niche, mission-critical brands and its proven Fortive Business System, which spreads best practices and keeps the agility high. Management’s made a habit of disciplined investing—shedding businesses like Precision Technologies, cherry-picking M&A deals, and keeping the cost base healthy even in rocky markets.

Valuation

At a forward P/E of 24.3x, Fortive trades a bit cheaper than the market average of 25.9x. Its EV/Sales ratio sits at 3.5x—again, below both its own five-year average of 4.2x and the market’s 4.7x. Investors are clearly factoring in stagnant top-line growth, but Fortive’s strong cash flow, resilient margins, and chances for growth in software and services could set the stage for a higher valuation if momentum picks up.

Market Sentiment

Since the spin-off, investors have been pretty cautious—Fortive’s 50-day price trend is down slightly (–0.53%), but volatility is actually lower than the wider market (19.3% versus the S&P 500’s 23.1%). That points to a steady, if subdued, trading pattern. Short interest is moderate, around 2.9% of Fortive shares (down from 3.6% earlier this year), so there isn’t a wave of bearish bets. Almost all shares (about 95%) are held by institutions, and analysts’ consensus price target sits at $81.15—suggesting a good chunk of potential upside if growth perks up. Insider ownership is minimal (under 1%), and there haven’t been any big insider stock moves since the split.

Key Risks

Cyclical End-Market Exposure: If industrial capital spending takes a dive—say, from a manufacturing slowdown, energy sector weakness, or worsening global tensions—orders for Fortive’s instrumentation and connected solutions could dry up fast.

Tariff and Trade Uncertainty: Anywhere tariffs on Chinese imports stick around or go higher, Fortive might have to eat those costs or pass them to customers—either way, it could mean lower sales and squeezed margins.

Post-Spin Execution: After separating from Precision Technologies (now Ralliant), Fortive faces classic reshuffle risks: getting integrations right, making smart bets with the cash, and delivering promised cost savings. If any of those fall short, it could hold back performance.

Competitive Pressure: Tough competition from giants like Honeywell, Danaher, and Emerson—not to mention nimble software and automation specialists—could chip away at Fortive’s market share and pricing power.

Financial Leverage: With net debt running 1.89 times EBITDA (above the market average of 1.37x), Fortive carries moderate debt. If interest rates surge or cash flow slows, repaying that debt could get more challenging.

Bull Case

Undervalued Relative to History: Both EV/Sales and forward P/E are below Fortive’s typical levels and underneath the market’s, hinting at room for the valuation to bounce higher if growth steadies.

Strong Free Cash Flow: A free cash flow yield above 6% gives Fortive plenty of wiggle room for buybacks, paying down debt, and making deals that drive value over the long haul.

Digital Transformation Tailwinds: Industry 4.0 isn’t just a buzzword here—growing demand for automation, predictive maintenance, and connected workforce tools could help Fortive’s IOS segment outgrow the market.

Spin-Off Clarity: With the Ralliant spinoff complete, management can double down on its priority areas—like software, services, and healthcare diagnostics—which could surface hidden value.

Disciplined Capital Allocation: Management’s repeat use of the Fortive Business System and steady buybacks have a track record of boosting returns on invested capital over time.

Bear Case

Slowing Revenue Growth: Core revenue trends have been flat or negative recently, raising doubts about the health of demand and suggesting few reasons to expect an immediate turnaround.

Modest ROIC: Return on invested capital remains well below the market average, signaling Fortive isn’t getting as much bang for its buck as investors would like.

Macro and Tariff Headwinds: With ongoing trade and tariff uncertainty and a sluggish global economy, there’s a risk that customers keep deferring spending and margins stay under pressure.

Execution Risk Post Spin: If Fortive doesn’t invest the Ralliant proceeds wisely—particularly into fast-growing software offerings—its growth story could stall out even further.

Cyclicality in Market Crashes: History shows that Fortive underperforms the S&P 500 during big market selloffs, typically falling further and taking longer to recover—making it a riskier ride when markets get rocky.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings Release: Due out in late October 2025, this update will shine a light on post-spin organic growth, profit margins, and any refreshed guidance.

Investor Day Follow-Up: Management’s next big strategy update (date to be confirmed) promises more detail on where they’ll invest, how they see margins improving, and what M&A could look like.

Macro Data Points: Keep watch on the ISM Manufacturing PMI (out October 1) and mid-October U.S. industrial production numbers for clues on whether demand is turning a corner or not.

Regulatory Updates: New rules for U.S. healthcare devices or surprises with tariffs—especially on markets like China or the EU—could cause a material shift in Fortive’s Advanced Healthcare Solutions results.

Investment Conclusion

After offloading Ralliant, Fortive’s now a more focused industrial and healthcare tech outfit. The company boasts strong free cash flow and trades at a relatively attractive valuation, especially compared to its history.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

Handovers will start Oct. 1 and run through Jan. 1.

Fabrice Megarbane is being appointed president of the Consumer Products Division, following Perakis-Valat’s departure. Megarbane, currently the group’s chief global growth officer since January 2024, has spent the last 24 years working at the company. Among his leadership roles has been serving as CEO of L’Oréal China and president of the company’s North Asia Zone.

As chief global growth officer, Megarbane has helped shape L’Oréal’s future path. “In this critical function, he has brilliantly strategized growth, and fostered a more integrated, multizone approach across the group, including driving significant e-commerce expansion with key platforms like Amazon and TikTok,” the company said in a statement.

“He has also spearheaded several of the group’s key transformation projects, helping drive agility, optimize the group’s ways of working and ensure the company is ‘future fit,’” L’Oréal said.

While at L’Oréal China, he lassoed record market share and doubled sales. “He also positioned the region at the forefront of digital and data excellence, mastering the complexities of modern consumer engagement, and ensured all industrial sites achieved carbon neutrality by 2022.

“Fabrice’s unique blend of strategic insight, deep market knowledge and exceptional leadership qualities, proven during his transformative tenure in China and most recently as chief global growth officer, makes him the idea choice to lead our Consumer Products Division,” said Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L’Oréal, in the statement. “I am confident that he will continue to drive innovation, accelerate growth and inspire our teams in this new chapter.”

Vianney Derville is succeeding Megarbane as chief growth officer. He most recently has served as president of Europe for the group.

L’Oréal called Derville “a distinguished leader renowned for orchestrating profound transformations, driving exceptional growth and fostering strategic market leadership.”

His is a new global role in which he is meant to leverage his in-market experience, strategic vision and ability to inspire teams to accelerate L’Oréal’s growth, the company added.

Derville was appointed to his role overseeing Europe in 2016, after jobs in Japan, Spain, France and the U.S. Sales in Europe last year reached more than 11.4 billion euros, and the continent was the biggest contributor to the company’s growth overall.

“The Europe zone has also consistently gained market share and demonstrated strong online dominance,” L’Oréal said.

Derville has also been credited with bolstering public affairs within Europe, which has a complicated regulatory terrain.

“Vianney’s deep understanding of our markets, his proven track record of driving significant growth and transformation, coupled with his exceptional ability to unite and inspire teams make him the perfect choice to be our new chief growth officer,” Hieronimus said. “I look forward to working with him closely as we shape L’Oréal’s future growth trajectory, continue the ‘One L’Oreal’ transformation project leveraging AI and write the next chapter of the group’s history.”

Taking the role of president of Europe is Emmanuel Goulin, who is currently president of travel retail. The executive has been credited with navigating the post-COVID-19 world. He spearheaded the “beauty experience” in travel retail, which refocused L’Oréal’s activities in airports around the traveler’s journey. Goulin transformed the organization and optimized the company’s operational footprint in the channel.

Goulin started at L’Oréal 25 years ago. He has held positions in Japan, Hong Kong, the U.K. and France. The executive returned to Europe in 2022, taking the role of general manager of L’Oréal Italy, where he instigated double-digit growth and helped forge the group’s sustainable development.

“Emmanuel has a deep understanding of the European landscape, forged through leadership roles in three of its key markets,” m Hieronimus said. “This, together with his great track record of delivering major business and transformational impact, positions him as the ideal leader to drive innovation, accelerate growth and inspire our teams in our biggest region.”

Eva Yu is being named president of travel retail, and is to join L’Oréal’s extended executive committee. Currently president and managing director of L’Oréal Hong Kong, she will be based in both Paris and Sinagapore.

“Eva has led the subsidiary through an extraordinary evolution, resulting in a significant increase in market share, in addition to widespread recognition for its retail excellence,” L’Oréal said.

Yu started at the company in 2000 as brand manager for Biotherm in Hong Kong, where it became among the top brands market-wide. In 2011, she became the first Asian and first woman appointed managing director of travel retail in APAC, where she helmed L’Oréal’s duty-free business in 27 markets.

“Eva’s remarkable career, marked by her vision, and incredible ability to foster unity and harmonize efforts across different functions and markets, makes her an outstanding leader,” Hieronimus said.

“Her deep understanding of the Asian market and her proven track record in driving both business transformation and people development, positions her as the ideal choice to lead our strategic travel retail business into its next chapter of growth and innovation,” he said.",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Fabrice-Megarbane.jpg.jpg?crop=0px%2C110px%2C2339px%2C1308px&resize=1000%2C563,N,,2025-09-24 14:20:53.922745

For Walmart, community stores fill a strategic gap between its sprawling Sam's Clubs and shrinking hypermarkets.
From 2020 to April 2025, the retailer's store number — including hypermarkets and Sam's Club — fell from 429 to 334.
That coincided with the addition of seven new Sam's Club stores, according to data from the China Chain Store & Franchise Association.
He added ""community stores face their own challenges, having to compete head-on with 24-hour convenience stores and delivery platforms"".","Walmart Inc is betting small will be big in China. The US retailer opened its fourth neighborhood store at its China headquarters, Shenzhen, Guangdong province, on Sept 13, signaling that the compact format has found traction and is expected to scale.

Each store, about 500 square meters in size, mainly carries some 2,000 stock-keeping units or products tailored to the most frequent needs of nearby residents. In the store, food dominates — fresh produce, bakery, hot meals, ready-to-eat options and snacks — covering what Walmart calls ""five meals a day"".

Jason Yu, general manager of CTR Market Research, said community stores are becoming a vital part of Walmart's proximity retail strategy in China. Consumers today lean toward shopping close to home or using instant retail platforms for daily, high-frequency purchases, which the traditional hypermarket's all-in-one format can no longer fully satisfy.

""Smaller formats offer advantages in cost efficiency, flexible site selection and curated assortments tailored to neighborhood needs, while instant retail extends their catchment area — making the model a strong fit with Walmart's omnichannel approach in China,"" Yu said.

For Walmart, community stores fill a strategic gap between its sprawling Sam's Clubs and shrinking hypermarkets. Walmart's China net sales jumped 30 percent year-on-year to $5.8 billion in the second quarter, driven by Sam's Club expansion and its double-digit growth in transactions, as well as its e-commerce growth at 39 percent.

Sam's remains the company's profit driver in China, with 57 outlets across 25 cities. At the 2025 Walmart global investment conference, Zhu Xiaojing, CEO of Walmart China, revealed that eight Sam's Club stores in China are expected to reach annual sales volume of over 3.6 billion yuan ($500 million) per store at the end of this year.

Even so, their suburban footprint leaves downtown areas underserved.

Neighborhood markets address that gap with its bigger stores that enhance one-stop experiences and 30-minute reach by e-commerce. The compact store is intensifying its coverage by reaching customers within a 10-minute walk and sharing supply chains with Sam's to break bulk packs into smaller sizes.

The expansion comes as Walmart's hypermarket model wanes. From 2020 to April 2025, the retailer's store number — including hypermarkets and Sam's Club — fell from 429 to 334. That coincided with the addition of seven new Sam's Club stores, according to data from the China Chain Store & Franchise Association.

The decline reflects long-standing issues: sites misaligned with shifting population flows, bulk pack sizes mismatched to smaller households and rising operating costs.

Despite that, Yu said hypermarkets will still serve one-stop shopping needs, though much of that demand is being diverted to e-commerce and specialized retail channels. He added ""community stores face their own challenges, having to compete head-on with 24-hour convenience stores and delivery platforms"".

Yet demand for them remains relatively stable, and Walmart has an opportunity to differentiate through private-label products and value-added services, he added.

""The pilot stores in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, in my view, are also a signal of Walmart's intent to scale the format into China's smaller third- and fourth-tier cities,"" he said.

Government policy is lending momentum to the shift. Earlier this month, the Ministry of Commerce and eight other ministries issued a notice to accelerate the rollout of""15-minute community life circles"", underscoring support for small-footprint retail and commerce.

The latest report released by Worldpanel shows that small supermarkets grew 7.3 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2025, stabilizing overall modern trade (defined as hypermarkets, supermarkets, and convenience stores). Community grocery stores also performed well, with sales up 4.7 percent.

Competition is already intensifying. In the first half, leading discount retailers continued to capture market share through business model upgrades and supply chain optimization. Aldi advanced steadily through localization strategies: its store in Kunshan of East China's Jiangsu province set a new sales record in China.

Leveraging their experience in Shanghai, regional supply chains, and a ""high quality groceries and lifestyle products"" strategy, Aldi's penetration in the eastern region increased by 1.2 percentage points, according to Worldpanel.

Traditional e-commerce players are expanding into offline formats to break the limitation of the pure online shopping experience. JD Group's JD Mall offers immersive lifestyle solutions, while JD Fresh has accelerated its store model (central stores plus satellite community shops) in the northern region, boosting penetration by 0.4 percentage point.

In the first half, China's fast-moving consumer goods market saw moderate recovery. Price-sensitive and experience-driven consumers demand higher product quality and functionality. This pursuit drives offline and online channels to reshape the consumption landscape through both competition and complementarity, according to Worldpanel.

In offline channels, Sam's Club, Aldi, and JD Fresh precisely target consumer needs via membership formats, hard discount formats and community models. Traditional supermarkets have focused on optimizing product selection as part of their upgrades, while integrating with online-to-offline services to overcome customer traffic challenges, according to Worldpanel.",http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202509/24/68d35128a3108622d642200f.jpeg,N,,2025-09-24 16:16:30.527661

M&A as a Growth Driver

2025 started with a number of large-scale acquisitions in the MedTech sector. Among others, Stryker and Boston Scientific announced deals exceeding USD 1 billion. While the number of transactions is declining, overall deal volume is rising.

Healthcare and life sciences companies that complete more than one acquisition per year have generated an average total shareholder return (TSR) of 13.6% over the past decade, compared to just 0.3% for inactive players. Even a limited number of strategic acquisitions (>1 deal/year) has proven beneficial, with an average TSR of 11.5%. The key is not quantity, but the strategic quality of transactions.

Still, only just over half of companies in the sector pursue add-on acquisitions. Growth also comes at the cost of rising debt: companies completing three to five deals recorded 1.7 times higher net debt than non-acquirers. Venture capital activity reflects a similar trend: while Series E+ financing rounds show record deal activity (+25% in volume), pre-seed and early-stage investments are slowing.

Political Environment as a Catalyst

The change of government in the U.S. could provide new momentum. Leadership changes and staff cuts at the FDA and other agencies may benefit MedTech—particularly diagnostics, which faced tighter regulation under the Biden administration and could now benefit from some relief.

At the same time, the FTC continues to apply stricter merger control guidelines and has recently blocked Edwards’ planned acquisition of JenaValv (USD 945 million) as well as the PE-backed acquisition of Surmodics (USD 627 million). The M&A environment in MedTech therefore remains challenging.

Key Areas for M&A in 2025/26

GLP-1 drugs

The rapid rise of GLP-1 therapies has raised concerns that they could replace demand for certain MedTech devices. So far, however, demand for glucose monitors and insulin pumps remains stable, as nearly half of patients discontinue GLP-1 therapy due to side effects or costs. GLP-1 may in fact open new opportunities in orthopedics and obesity surgery, while driving proactive health management in diagnostics. According to a Strategy& survey (PwC), 76% of professionals in therapeutic instruments expect GLP-1 to have an impact, compared to only 33% in monitoring devices. Partnerships with biopharma companies, particularly around novel GLP-1 delivery methods, could become a decisive deal driver.

Artificial Intelligence

AI is emerging as a true platform technology in MedTech. Its applications go far beyond diagnostics, potentially supporting regulatory and compliance processes.

Diagnostics and life sciences

The pandemic has heightened demand for fast, reliable diagnostics. This trend is reinforced by demographic change and the growing importance of personalized medicine, often coupled with subscription models to secure long-term patient engagement.

Surgical instruments and devices

An aging population is driving demand for surgical procedures and high-quality equipment. Advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), miniaturization, precision technologies, and digitalization create significant investment opportunities.

MDR Compliance and Post-Merger Integration

MDR compliance can determine the success or failure of an acquisition. Companies should address the following issues as part of due diligence and integration:

Agreements with notified bodies: The success of a MedTech transaction can hinge on regulatory factors, most notably the involvement of the notified body (i.e., the neutral institution designated by an EU member state to conduct conformity assessments). Because cooperation agreements with notified bodies often contain differing terms and conditions, and for reasons of efficiency, it is generally advisable to establish a uniform agreement with a single body.

Deal structure: Depending on whether the transaction is structured as a share deal or an asset deal, notification of the competent authority may be required, particularly if production processes, monitoring systems, or quality assurance measures are affected.

CE marking: Verify whether certifications are valid, extensions have been applied for, and whether there are risks of restrictions, suspension, or revocation.

Transition arrangements: In the event of a change of notified body, establish clear agreements with both the former and the new institution regarding the period during which products with the old identification number may continue to be marketed and the timing for the transition to the new number.

Integrating regulatory aspects into transaction planning at an early stage is essential to mitigate risks and secure synergies.

Conclusion

Despite a complex regulatory landscape and political uncertainty, M&A remains a key driver of growth in MedTech.

Omnicare files for bankruptcy protection

CVS Health's long-term care pharmacy subsidiary Omnicare LLC and 110 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 22, seeking to resolve issues related to a recent $948.7 million U.S. Department of Justice civil judgment against the company, according to a statement.

All litigation against the debtor is subject to an automatic stay while the bankruptcy case proceeds.

The company said that it will either implement a standalone restructuring or seek a sale of its assets.

Omnicare responds to bankruptcy filing

""Omnicare has been engaged in a civil lawsuit alleging technical violations of pharmacy law based on practices the government knew about and approved,"" Omnicare President David Azzolina said in a statement.

""There were no allegations of harm to any Omnicare patients nor did the government allege that any patient got anything other than the medicine they needed when they needed it,"" Azzolina said.

""The District Court nevertheless imposed an extreme and, we believe, unconstitutional penalty,"" he said.

Why did Omnicare file for bankruptcy?

The long-term care pharmacy filed for bankruptcy protection to address a $948.7 million civil judgment against it that was awarded to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

A unanimous jury on April 29 found Omnicare, the nation's largest long-term care pharmacy, liable for alleged fraudulent dispensing of drugs without valid prescriptions to elderly and disabled people in assisted-living facilities and other residential long-term care facilities, according to a U.S. Attorney's Office statement.

After a four-week trial, the jury ruled that Omnicare billed Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for over 3 million of alleged false claims, resulting in over $135.5 million in damages, the statement said.

The government is entitled to three times the amount of the assessed damages under the federal False Claims Act, or $406,778,442, plus statutory penalties to be determined by the court.

CVS Health also found liable

The jury also found Omnicare’s parent, CVS Health Corp., liable for causing Omnicare to submit alleged false claims, the statement said.

Omnicare, which provides pharmacy services to the long-term care market, including skilled nursing facilities, independent-living, and assisted-living facilities, filed its petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, listing $100 million to $500 million in assets and $1 billion to $10 billion in liabilities.

The debtor is seeking approval for up to $110 million in debtor-in-possession financing and use of cash collateral to provide sufficient liquidity to the company while the case proceeds, according to the statement.

That’s according to S&P Global’s flash composite index, which showed that demand cooled, limiting firms’ ability to pass on higher costs from tariffs, even as input prices climbed.

Service-sector costs rose to their highest since May, but companies struggled to raise selling prices, squeezing margins.

New orders and backlogs grew at their slowest in three months, and employment dipped to a five-month low. Manufacturers saw inventories swell to record levels as sales softened.

Despite the weaker momentum, firms remained optimistic about the year ahead, citing potential benefits from lower interest rates and stronger domestic production fueled by tariffs.

Build Your Own HP Narrative If you see things differently or want to dig into the numbers yourself, crafting your own HP narrative takes less than three minutes.","If you’re holding HP (HPQ) or considering an investment, the latest earnings event is likely a key focus. This week, the company reported that both its revenue and earnings came in ahead of expectations for its fiscal third quarter of 2025. Investors are taking notice, but reactions have varied. Some view this as a sign that HP is regaining stability after a challenging year, while others point to competitive pressures and mixed analyst ratings as evidence that the company's best days may be in the past or perhaps not immediately ahead.

HP’s stock performance over the last year has reflected this uncertainty, with shares drifting lower overall despite a recent rebound. Over the past month, the stock rose nearly 2% and added about 15% over the past three months, recovering some losses but still showing a negative return for the year. While HP exceeded earnings expectations this quarter, discussions around its value compared to rival tech and AI companies remain active. The conversation has begun to shift from disappointment to cautious optimism, but the debate continues.

Following the recent positive surprise and a modest turnaround in momentum, investors may be weighing whether HP presents a bargain or if the market has already accounted for its prospects.

Most Popular Narrative: Fairly Valued

The most widely followed narrative currently suggests HP is trading very close to its estimated fair value, reflecting market consensus around its balanced future prospects and risks.

Accelerating adoption of AI-driven PCs and growth in premium device segments are fueling stronger-than-expected revenue growth, with AI PCs now over 25% of HP's mix and expected price uplifts of 5 to 10 percent, which directly supports higher top-line sales and margin expansion.

Want to know what’s powering HP’s latest valuation call? One critical assumption underpins this bold fair value. It is something even seasoned investors may overlook. Are you curious about the financial secrets behind those growth projections? Don’t miss the story behind HP’s market pricing signal and see which key numbers are moving the needle.

Result: Fair Value of $27.97 (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, competitive pressure in PCs and ongoing declines in the print segment could challenge HP’s renewed optimism and put future growth at risk.

Another View: Different Methods, Different Stories

While the analyst consensus points to HP being fairly valued, our SWS DCF model takes a different angle and currently sees the company as trading well below its calculated fair value. Which approach makes more sense for you?

And just last week, Barclays cut its Molson Coors recommendation to underweight from equal-weight.
Goyal's ability to diversify beyond traditional beer could determine whether Molson Coors remains relevant in a rapidly changing beverage landscape.
In recent years, Goyal has worked to move the company beyond its marquee beer brands Coors Light and Miller Lite.
Molson Coors said Goyal will receive an annual base salary of $1.1 million as president and CEO, along with an annual bonus with a target of 150% of his base pay.","Molson Coors shares fell about 3% yesterday to close at $45.09. The stock had declined 19% this year through the end of last week, trailing a 13% gain for the S&P 500 Index.

The company lowered its full-year guidance for the second consecutive quarter last month, citing continued pressure from weak consumer demand, falling U.S. market share and rising costs tied to aluminum tariffs.

Meanwhile, a recent Gallup survey revealed alcohol consumption among adults in the U.S. is at the lowest level on record. And just last week, Barclays cut its Molson Coors recommendation to underweight from equal-weight.

“Frankly we struggle to think of a positive catalyst for U.S. beer trends,” Barclays’ Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to investors, the latest sign that Wall Street's outlook for the sector has begun to sour.

The CEO transition comes at a critical juncture for the beer industry, which faces declining consumption and increased competition from cannabis and wellness alternatives. Goyal's ability to diversify beyond traditional beer could determine whether Molson Coors remains relevant in a rapidly changing beverage landscape.

“Molson Coors has not been very successful in attracting new shoppers to their portfolio or at keeping shoppers in their consumer base,” said Bump Williams, founder of beverage industry consultancy Bump Williams Consulting in Shelton, Conn.

Williams points to Molson Coors' flagging volume of beer and other malt-based beverages, which is down almost 7% across total U.S. retail outlets such as grocery, liquor and convenience stores, according to data his firm uses from NielsenIQ. He adds that the majority of its malt-based portfolio is declining in both volume and dollars with few exceptions.

The company has fallen behind its competitors in the innovation race, Williams noted, as it fails to keep pace with its peers now capitalizing on THC products, seltzers and other cocktail beverages.

“There needs to be a high sense of urgency to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace and not be content with sitting back on his laurels and waiting for business to fall into his lap,” Williams said.

Goyal, 49, assumes the role with more than two decades of insider knowledge — and his recent track record suggests he's grappled with the challenge of innovating as consumer habits shift. He started at the company in 2001 as a group manager and has been chief strategy officer since October 2019. He also held senior roles including chief financial officer of India operations and chief information officer for the U.K.

In recent years, Goyal has worked to move the company beyond its marquee beer brands Coors Light and Miller Lite. He helped to strike partnerships with Coca-Cola and Fever-Tree and led acquisitions of Zoa Energy — an energy drink brand co-founded by Dwayne Johnson — and Naked Life, a nonalcoholic canned cocktails maker.

“Rahul has strong institutional knowledge given his time with the company and more importantly, he is eager to bring new thinking with a focus on future growth,” Chairman David Coors said in a written statement announcing the move.

Goyal, who received his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Mysore in India and his MBA from the University of Denver's Daniels College of Business, will take over on Oct. 1. He succeeds Gavin Hattersley, who will retire from the company and its board by Dec. 31. Hattersley, who announced plans to retire in April after six years in the role, will stay on as a special adviser through the year.

Gross margin expanded as strong full-price sales and lower cotton costs outweighed inflation and tariff pressures.","Tariffs have emerged as the biggest profitability drag for lululemon athletica inc. LULU, reshaping its margin profile in fiscal 2025. The removal of the U.S. de minimis exemption, which had previously allowed duty-free shipments under $800, has added significant costs to its e-commerce model. Combined with higher reciprocal tariff rates, management now expects a 220-basis-point (bps) hit to gross margin in fiscal 2025, nearly $240 million in incremental expenses, even after mitigation efforts like vendor negotiations, supply chain shifts and modest pricing. These structural headwinds are expected to intensify in fiscal 2026, with management projecting a net $320 million margin impact despite ongoing cost actions.

In second-quarter fiscal 2025, these pressures were already visible. Gross margin contracted 110 basis points year over year to 58.5%, as higher markdowns and tariffs weighed on profitability. Markdowns alone contributed 60 bps of pressure, well above management’s forecast, as the company worked to clear seasonal inventory amid weak U.S. demand. While EPS of $3.10 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues of $2.53 billion missed the same, with flat U.S. sales and a 3% comps decline offsetting strong international growth. Operating margin fell 210 bps to 20.7%, with SG&A expenses rising 9% as lululemon continued to invest in marketing, store openings, and digital initiatives.

lululemon cut its full-year 2025 outlook, now guiding for a 300-bps gross margin decline versus prior expectations of just 110 bps. Third-quarter fiscal 2025 is set to see even steeper pressure, with a projected 410-bps drop due to tariffs, de minimis removal and fixed cost deleverage. With U.S. softness persisting and margin headwinds mounting, management does not expect meaningful relief until its product refreshes gain traction in fiscal 2026.

Margins at Risk Amid Tariff Pressures: How Peers RL & NKE Are Faring

With tariffs and the loss of duty exemptions squeezing profitability across apparel, peers like Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL) and NIKE Inc. NKE are navigating margin pressures in contrasting ways.

Ralph Lauren delivered strong margin performance in first-quarter fiscal 2026 despite tariff headwinds, aided by higher average unit retail, reduced discounting and a favorable channel mix. Gross margin expanded as strong full-price sales and lower cotton costs outweighed inflation and tariff pressures. Management noted tariffs remain the biggest headwind, particularly in the second half, but emphasized supply chain flexibility, selective pricing and cost efficiencies as key levers to offset pressure while sustaining operating discipline and long-term profitability.

NIKE’s margins remain under pressure as tariff-related costs add to ongoing challenges from discounts, supply chain deleverage and channel mix shifts. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, gross margin fell sharply, reflecting heavier promotional activity and a weaker mix, while new tariffs are expected to cut into profitability by roughly 75 bps in fiscal 2026, with the greatest hit in the first half. Management is mitigating through sourcing shifts, selective price increases and tighter expense discipline.

The retailer is focusing on enhancing the communication between the consumers and employees. The retailer is implementing massive changes to its online shopping system. This system will highlight an easier and more inclusive platform for everyone.

Details about Walmart’s massive change

The retail giant, Walmart, is about to make a massive change to expand the company’s communication between consumers and its 1.5 million employees. It has been stated that the company has detailed its uses for the upgrade of the Walmart Translation Platform. This platform has been created to make shopping a more inclusive and easier experience for everyone.

In addition, the first announcement of the Walmart Translation Platform (WTP) was made in June. The WTP provides real-time translation for about 44 different languages. It even goes a step further, however, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide a better understanding of the intention and context of the ones who will use it.

How the WTP will work

When it comes to this platform, there is a certain process that consumers need to know about. Consumers are required to type into the search bar the specific product or item they require. However, the typing aspect is in Spanish. At certain times this can be a Spanish dialect from Colombia, a Spanish dialect from Mexico, or even Puerto Rico or Chile.

According to the director of localization, content and accessibility at Walmart International, Arpitha Shetty, this means that there are different variations for different nationalities. She further stated, “So what we do is we adapt that local Spanish, that particular dialect, to the catalog in English so a user gets the best possible experience. We translate their intent, to get them what they want.”

In addition, the app is created in such a way to be able to recognize these nuances and also map the variations back to the entry to assist consumers in finding what they are looking for. For example, when Walmart cites a consumer in Quebec who is searching for a specific brand of yogurt. The consumer may enter “yogourt liberte” in the search bar of Liberte Yogurt, which is a brand, and it does not refer to freedom yogurt as a literal translation would suggest.

The impact of the platform

Through this specific AI and human linguists, the WTP would be able to recognize the difference and point the consumer to the correct product. Also, this system makes use of Walmart-specific ecommerce data to recognise and correctly translate names of unique store brands. This will assist the system when consumers enter specific brand names and may even misspell these names. The system will be able to recognise this because it also has access to the ecommerce data of Walmart.

As stated by the senior vice president and chief product officer at Walmart International, Tim Simmons, this would allow consumers to have a better shopping experience. It also gives access to cost savings to the company including am easier experience for employees.

Simmons further stated that, “Beyond the efficiencies we’ve gained employing agentic AI, we’re creating a better overall experience with the focus on cultural adaptation throughout the whole tech-stack. Running the new Walmart Translation Platform costs around 1% of the previous system. We’re saving more than $20 million, every year.”

Additionally, this system is proof that America’s retail giant, is truly out to make life easier for both its consumers and employees. As we continue to live in a world that is driven by technology it is always good to invest in these digital platforms, because it makes life easier for consumers and businesses.",https://www.eldiario24.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/walmart-ai.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 09:09:48.796649

Porter delivers first profit as revenue surges 57% in FY25

What's the story

Bengaluru-based on-demand logistics start-up Porter has reported a massive 57% jump in its operating revenue for the fiscal year 2025. The company's revenue stood at ₹4,306 crore during the period, according to financial statements filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). This revenue growth is part of Porter's overall financial improvement, which also includes turning a net loss in FY24 into a net profit in FY25.

Profit milestone

Porter turns net profit for the first time

Along with the revenue surge, Porter also managed to turn profitable in FY25. The company reported a net profit of ₹55 crore for the year. This is a major turnaround from its performance in fiscal 2024 when it had posted a loss of ₹96 crore. The improvement comes as a result of Porter's strategic expansion into new categories and geographies over the past year. The company currently has a presence in more than 25 cities.

Conclusion: A Win for Brand-Value Capture For investors, L'Oréal's pursuit of Armani's beauty division represents a strategic bet on the future of premium beauty.","In the ever-evolving landscape of the premium beauty industry, L'Oréal's recent strategic interest in Giorgio Armani's beauty division has emerged as a pivotal development. This move, framed within the context of Giorgio Armani's meticulously crafted succession plan, underscores a broader trend of consolidation in the sector, where legacy brands are increasingly being positioned for long-term financial stability and global scalability. For investors, the potential acquisition of a stake in Armani's beauty division by L'Oréal represents not just a transaction, but a calculated alignment with market dynamics that prioritize brand-value capture and strategic diversification.

Strategic Fit: L'Oréal's Beauty-Centric Playbook

L'Oréal's interest in Armani's beauty division is no accident. The French beauty giant has long adhered to a strategy of focusing on high-margin, aspirational brands within its portfolio, as seen with its acquisitions of Tom Ford and JacquemusWhat’s Next for Giorgio Armani? LVMH, L’Oreal ... - WWD[ 1 ]. Armani's existing licensing agreement with L'Oréal—set to expire in 2050—has already proven lucrative, generating €1.5 billion in revenue in 2024, or roughly 10% of L'Oréal's luxury division and 3.45% of its total group salesL’Oréal Only Interested in Armani’s Profitable Beauty Business[ 2 ]. By acquiring a minority stake (initially 15%, expandable to 54.9% over three years), L'Oréal could deepen its control over this revenue stream while leveraging Armani's iconic brand equity to bolster its premium offeringsIn Final Act, Armani Opens Door to Sale of Firm He Cherished[ 3 ].

This approach mirrors the Estée Lauder model, where brands like Tom Ford are licensed out to maintain creative independence while ensuring financial returns for the parent companyL’Oréal Only Interested in Armani’s Profitable Beauty Business[ 2 ]. For L'Oréal, the key advantage lies in its ability to integrate Armani's beauty line into its existing luxury portfolio—brands such as Yves Saint Laurent and Kiehl's—without diluting the Armani name's aspirational allure.

Premium Beauty Consolidation: A Sector in Motion

The broader premium beauty sector is witnessing a surge in consolidation, driven by the need to capture value in an increasingly competitive and saturated market. According to a 2025 McKinsey report, the global beauty industry is projected to reach $590 billion by 2030, with skincare alone accounting for 40% of total valueThe future of the beauty industry in 2025 and beyond[ 4 ]. This growth is fueled by innovation in categories like injectables and sun care, as well as a shift toward hyperpersonalization and sustainabilityThe future of the beauty industry in 2025 and beyond[ 4 ].

L'Oréal's 2024 performance exemplifies this trend. Its Consumer Products Division grew by 5.4%, driven by emerging markets and product innovations such as Elvive Glycolic GlossL'Oréal Consumer Products Division: 2024 trends[ 5 ]. The company's focus on “democratizing and premiumizing beauty” aligns with consumer demand for both accessibility and luxury, a duality that Armani's brand could amplify. By acquiring a stake in Armani's beauty division, L'Oréal would not only secure a high-margin asset but also strengthen its position in a sector where brand legacy and innovation are equally critical.

Competitive Dynamics: LVMH and EssilorLuxottica in the Frame

While L'Oréal is a strong contender, it faces competition from LVMH and EssilorLuxottica, both of which are vying for a stake in Armani's broader fashion and eyewear segmentsWhat’s Next for Giorgio Armani? LVMH, L’Oreal ... - WWD[ 1 ]. However, L'Oréal's singular focus on beauty gives it a distinct advantage. Unlike LVMH, which must balance its luxury fashion and wine portfolios, or EssilorLuxottica, which is primarily an eyewear giant, L'Oréal's expertise in beauty product development, distribution, and marketing is unmatched.

Moreover, Armani's will explicitly prioritizes L'Oréal for the beauty division, reflecting the designer's confidence in the company's ability to preserve the brand's creative identity while ensuring financial growthIn Final Act, Armani Opens Door to Sale of Firm He Cherished[ 3 ]. Pantaleo Dell'Orco, Armani's longtime collaborator, has also emphasized the importance of maintaining the brand's ethical and artistic integrity—a goal that aligns with L'Oréal's track record in managing luxury beauty brandsL'Oréal Consumer Products Division: 2024 trends[ 5 ].

Risks and Considerations

Despite the strategic rationale, risks remain. The premium beauty sector is highly competitive, with brands like Shiseido and Estée Lauder also vying for market shareThe future of the beauty industry in 2025 and beyond[ 4 ]. Additionally, integrating Armani's beauty division into L'Oréal's portfolio could face challenges, particularly in maintaining the brand's exclusivity while scaling production to meet global demand. Regulatory scrutiny in key markets, such as the EU and the U.S., could also delay the transaction.

However, these risks are mitigated by the structured nature of Armani's succession plan, which allows for a phased acquisition and provides L'Oréal with time to assess integration strategiesWhat’s Next for Giorgio Armani? LVMH, L’Oreal ... - WWD[ 1 ]. The company's existing licensing agreement also offers a blueprint for collaboration, reducing the likelihood of operational disruptions.

Conclusion: A Win for Brand-Value Capture

For investors, L'Oréal's pursuit of Armani's beauty division represents a strategic bet on the future of premium beauty. By acquiring a stake in a brand with €1.5 billion in annual licensing revenue and a legacy of luxury, L'Oréal is positioning itself to capitalize on the sector's growth while reinforcing its dominance in high-margin beauty categories. As the industry shifts toward consolidation and brand-value capture, this move could prove to be a defining moment in L'Oréal's evolution—and a compelling opportunity for those watching the premium beauty sector closely.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd264379cbc001.png,N,,2025-09-23 02:02:30.101961

Omnicare has arranged $110 million of debtor-in-possession financing, which the company’s leaders expect will provide “sufficient liquidity” to stay in business, with operations proceeding as normal throughout the proceedings, according to a press release.

“During the court-supervised process, Omnicare is continuing to provide safe and reliable pharmacy services to long-term care facilities. Omnicare customers and patients can expect to continue to access pharmacy and clinical services without disruption,” a representative for Omnicare said Monday in a statement to Skilled Nursing News.

Omnicare declined to comment on how many customers it has.

The company’s chapter 11 filing is linked to recent litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

In April, Omnicare was found liable for improperly billing the United States government, resulting in $135 million in damages in “one of the largest damages verdicts rendered by a jury in a False Claims Act case,” according to the U.S. Dept. of Justice.

Omnicare was found to have distributed drugs that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law between 2010 and 2018 and billed Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. In July, a judge ordered Omnicare to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages.

David Azzolina, president of Omnicare, said the district court imposed “an extreme and … unconstitutional penalty.”

“Omnicare has been engaged in a civil lawsuit alleging technical violations of pharmacy law based on practices the government knew about and approved,” Azzolina said. “There were no allegations of harm to any Omnicare patients nor did the government allege that any patient got anything other than the medicine they needed when they needed it.”",https://skillednursingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/10/money-1273908_1920-e1520457921451.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 04:02:00.574658

In Walmart’s latest earnings report, it revealed that its U.S. comparable sales increased by 4.6% year-over-year during the second quarter of this year. Also, according to recent data from Placer.ai, foot traffic in Walmart stores spiked by 1% during the quarter.

The increased consumer demand comes after Walmart quietly rolled out 7,400 price rollbacks during the quarter, 2,000 more than it introduced during the same time period last year, to attract price-conscious consumers.

“We’re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon during an earnings call on Aug. 21.

Walmart suffers major loss from a concerning problem

Amid higher sales, Walmart also revealed in its earnings report that its U.S. operating income only increased by 2% year-over-year during the quarter, flagging that its growth was offset by a roughly $400 million expense attributed to “higher-than-anticipated” liability claims.

Liability claims are formed when customers or employees injure themselves on a retailer’s property. Customers may also file a claim when they are harmed by a defective product purchased from the retailer.

During the earnings call on Aug. 21, Walmart Chief Financial Officer John Rainey emphasized that the inflated liability claim expense isn’t due to a higher number of claims.

“While this claim count has decreased year over year, the cost to resolve claims has risen, both for us and across the retail industry, and we’ve increased our accrual to reflect these trends,” said Rainey. “We accrued an additional $450 million over and above our planned expense in Q2, which equates to a headwind of 560 basis points to adjusted operating income growth in the quarter. We have and continue to take actions to mitigate the number and cost of these claims.”

He also said that the company expects “continued inflation in claims cost” for the rest of the year, but not at the same magnitude as it experienced during the first half of the year.

Walmart is battling a growing trend that is hurting retailers nationwide

Walmart isn’t the only company that recently sounded the alarm on higher liability expenses. Best Buy, Dollar Tree, and Dollar General have also warned analysts during recent earnings calls that liability claims are becoming a major headwind.

“This is something we’re seeing across all industry, the cost of settling claims is getting higher,” said Dollar Tree Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning during an earnings call on Sept. 3. “And therefore, while we haven’t seen any increase in the rate of claims, we are seeing those claims come in more costly.

The cost of liability claims has been skyrocketing for retailers over the past few years. This is mainly the result of social inflation, which is when the cost of insurance claims outpaces economic inflation due to broader interpretations of liability, extended legal battles, larger compensatory jury awards, growing public sentiment that injured parties should receive larger compensation and other factors.

According to data from Swiss Re Institute last year, social inflation caused liability claims in the U.S. to increase by 57% in the past decade, reaching an annual peak of 7% in 2023.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE3NjMyMDk1NzY4NDIxNzQ0/walmart-store-pharmacy.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 22:07:31.140371

Far beyond Tylenol, Kenvue has been struggling with its direction as sales have slumped.
In 1955, McNeil introduced the first Tylenol product, Elixir Tylenol, a liquid for children.
No one was ever charged in the deaths, though one suspect, who has since died, was convicted of extortion for sending a letter to Johnson & Johnson promising to stop the killings in exchange for $1 million.
Johnson & Johnson scrambled to respond, regaining public trust by quickly pulling Tylenol from American shelves and introducing new tamper-resistant packaging.","The pain reliever Tylenol is a classic American brand, with tens of millions of users and a 70-year history. The company behind it, Kenvue, is just two years old and unknown to most Americans.

The Trump administration is expected on Monday to link Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism, a connection that remains unproven. That has put Kenvue in the spotlight, faced with a growing public relations nightmare for a product that has weathered crises before. Most notably, in the 1980s, Tylenol became the textbook example of how to manage a corporate crisis, after product tampering killed seven people and triggered a nationwide panic.

Johnson & Johnson survived the traumatic episode, rescuing a product it had manufactured for decades. But in 2023, looking toward its more profitable medical businesses, the company spun off Tylenol and other consumer brands into a new business, Kenvue. Based in Summit, N.J., Kenvue also makes other nostalgic and well-known brands, like Band-Aid, Listerine, Neutrogena and Johnson’s Baby Shampoo.

Renewed public attention on Tylenol began early this month, when The Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration’s plans to release a report tying Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism. The company’s stock has plummeted by 16 percent since then, and was down by 6 percent on Monday.

Melissa Witt, a spokeswoman for Kenvue, said in a statement on Monday that “we believe independent, sound, science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.” She added, “We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.”

Researchers have studied a potential connection for years, but so far the studies have not shown that Tylenol use among pregnant women causes autism.

Kenvue has made repeated attempts to forestall Monday’s announcement, and to try to reassure customers. The company’s interim chief executive, Kirk Perry, met earlier this month with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary, to make the case that there was no link between Tylenol and autism and that the product offered a safe and important way of relieving fevers in pregnant women, according to an account in The Journal.

Ms. Witt confirmed to The New York Times that the company had “engaged in a scientific exchange with the secretary and members of his staff as it relates to the safety of our products.”

This month, the company also added language to the frequently asked questions section of its website seeking to reassure consumers that they should not be “concerned about acetaminophen and autism.”

Tylenol is the best known among some 600 products containing the active ingredient acetaminophen, an analgesic. Each week, nearly a quarter of U.S. adults use a medicine that contains acetaminophen, according to a trade group for consumer health care products.

Even with the generic competition, Tylenol still generates roughly $1 billion in annual sales for Kenvue, according to an estimate from Morningstar, the financial services company. (Kenvue does not report its revenue from Tylenol.)

“Any potential threat to the product could have a noticeable impact on the firm’s earnings power,” Keonhee Kim, a Morningstar analyst, wrote in a note to investors.

Kenvue, along with major retailers that sell their own generic versions, was named a defendant in the litigation. But a federal judge rejected those claims, dismissing them for lack of reliable scientific evidence. The families are appealing the decision.

Far beyond Tylenol, Kenvue has been struggling with its direction as sales have slumped. In July, the company ousted its chief executive, Thibaut Mongon, and replaced him with Mr. Perry, a veteran in the consumer goods business. In recent months, the company has generated interest from activist investors who have pushed for the company to be acquired, or to sell off some of its business lines.

Acetaminophen was first discovered in the 19th century, but it wasn’t until the late 1940s that researchers showed it could reduce pain and lower fevers.

At the time, research was beginning to show safety risks associated with taking too much aspirin, the leading pain reliever on the market. McNeil Laboratories, a family-owned company in Philadelphia, saw an opportunity to market acetaminophen as a safer alternative.

In 1955, McNeil introduced the first Tylenol product, Elixir Tylenol, a liquid for children. McNeil packaged the product like a cartoon fire engine and marketed it as being “for little hotheads.”

In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil. The next year, Tylenol became available over the counter, without a prescription.

Over the years, Tylenol has occasionally been subject to recalls for quality control issues. The product has also weathered a series of debates in the medical community and regulatory proposals about its known side effects, like liver damage, when taken at high levels.

In 2013, an investigation by the news organization ProPublica found that over three decades, Johnson & Johnson’s McNeil unit “repeatedly fought against safety warnings, dosage restrictions and other measures meant to safeguard users of the drug.” (The company said it takes the product’s risks seriously and always acted to mitigate them.)

By far the biggest threat to the product came in 1982, when someone tampered with capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol, lacing them with cyanide and killing seven people, including a 12-year-old girl, in the Chicago area. No one was ever charged in the deaths, though one suspect, who has since died, was convicted of extortion for sending a letter to Johnson & Johnson promising to stop the killings in exchange for $1 million.

Johnson & Johnson scrambled to respond, regaining public trust by quickly pulling Tylenol from American shelves and introducing new tamper-resistant packaging. The episode inspired a true-crime show, “Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders,” released on Netflix this year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/22/multimedia/22HS-KENVUE-01-bczl/22HS-KENVUE-01-bczl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 17:17:00.039845

The move is significant because specialty pharmacy is an increasingly important player in the U.S. health system given the flood of expensive drugs on the market derived from biotechnology. Such medicines are more complicated than pills and capsules picked up at the corner drugstore or available by mail order and often require specialized administration, refrigeration, packaging and patient instructions.

In Walmart’s case, the retail giant says refrigerated and reconstituted medicines make up 30% of the company’s pharmacy sales. Adding the new specialty pharmacy capabilities such as refrigeration allows Walmart to now be able to deliver 90% of all prescriptions.

Walmart says it’s ""the first retailer to deliver refrigerated and

reconstituted prescriptions alongside groceries and everyday essentials in a single, convenient online order."" Amazon could not be reached Monday for comment but Walgreens and CVS Health have long had the ability to deliver specialty medicines and there are grocery store chains that also own and operate specialty pharmacies where delivery is available.

“We continue to unlock new levels of convenience while also broadening access to critical medications,” said Kevin Host, senior vice president of Pharmacy at Walmart. “Adding refrigerated prescriptions to our Pharmacy Delivery capabilities is the result of listening to our customers, identifying where we can create even better, seamless experiences, and keeping the communities we serve at the heart of what we do.”

Aside from customer convenience, there is a big financial reason for Walmart to be expanding its specialty pharmacy capabilities. Specialized medications are the nation’s top sellers and a key reason healthcare costs are rising. GLP-1 weight loss prescriptions Wegovy, Rybelsus, Saxenda, Ozempic and Zepbound — specialized medications that require injection — are the “single biggest driver” of employer health costs, adding 1% to the total premium expense for 2025, according to data released last fall from the benefits consultancy Aon.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d17b5bcfc9935d5dba187e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-22 16:18:28.019872

As of 2024, 78 percent of chemicals delivered or purchased by key supplier facilities for production aligned with ZDHC MRSL.
As of 2024, 92 percent of LS&Co.’s key wet finishing facilities were ZDHC Academy participating facilities.","Levi Strauss & Co. (LS&Co.) is deepening its commitment to sustainability through targeted action across key impact areas. The San Francisco-based company’s 2024 Sustainability Goals and Metrics Report shares its progress to reaching goals pertaining to waste reduction, circularity, responsible cotton sourcing, chemical management and more.

Here’s five takeaways from the data-driven report.

Waste

LS&Co is pursuing TRUE Zero Waste certifications for its company-operated facilities.

The company’s distribution center in Henderson, Nevada earned TRUE Silver certification with a 95.2 percent waste diversion rate in 2023 into 2024. Similarly, the Northampton Distribution Center in the U.K. holds TRUE Certification and has diverted 90.8 percent of waste from landfills during the same period.

These recognitions support LS&CO.’s goal to achieve zero waste to landfill from company-operated facilities and 50 percent waste diversion across strategic suppliers by 2030. In 2024, LS&Co reports that key suppliers (which the company defines as suppliers covering more than 80 percent of its global product units) diverted 77 percent of waste from landfill—up one percent from the prior year.

Cotton

Climate change weighs heavy on LS&Co.’s sourcing. In 2024, Levi’s products were made with more than 80,000 metric tonnes of cotton. Cotton accounts for nearly 90 percent of the raw materials sourced annually for LS&Co. products.

Though the report notes how some climate modeling suggests that warming temperatures and rising CO2 concentrations may yield short-term benefits to cotton production, LS&Co. expects the frequency and severity of weather events to increase, potentially disrupting cotton supply and production.

The company aims to mitigate this risk through several programs such as being member of the U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol, the science-based, farm-level pilot program focused on advancing sustainable cotton production in the U.S. and supporting Better Cotton Initiative and the Organic Cotton Accelerator.

“LS&Co.’s suppliers purchase cotton on a global scale and ensure redundancy within our supply chain to reduce potential risks associated with supply chain disruptions, including those caused by weather variability and other climate-related issues. Consistent with LS&Co.’s overall risk mitigation strategy, our supply chain is designed to be resilient. Any associated cost increases are expected to be absorbed into business-as-usual activities and are considered in our financial planning process,” the company states in the report.

Circularity

LS&Co. is closing in on a comprehensive plan to make the company “circular ready.” The company is working with a third-party consultant on a strategy that is primarily based on the Circular Economy framework and principles of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. By 2026, the company aims to have established governance for plan execution, defined methodology and actions to reach the goal, defined target years, project plans and KPIs and alignment and integration with the company’s overall business strategy.

Chemical management

In 2024, LS&Co. achieved Champion Level status under the 2025 ZDHC Brands to Zero Program, the highest performance tier under the initiative. The Champion Level is awarded to brands that meet defined thresholds across ZDHC key performance indicators, fulfill critical milestones in the Roadmap to Zero Program and demonstrate meaningful integration of ZDHC guidelines, platforms and solutions into both corporate strategy and value chain practices.

LS&Co. continues to work toward its goal of strategic garment wet finishing manufacturing and fabric mills use 100 percent certified Screened Chemistry by 2026. As of 2024, 78 percent of chemicals delivered or purchased by key supplier facilities for production aligned with ZDHC MRSL. Additionally, 22 percent of the key wet finishing facilities’ auxiliary chemicals used for LS&Co. were certified Screened Chemistry.

The company is taking steps to further educate and support suppliers’ chemical management. As of 2024, 92 percent of LS&Co.’s key wet finishing facilities were ZDHC Academy participating facilities. ZDHC Academy provides online and in-person sources on sustainable chemical management.

Resale

Levi’s resale program, Levi’s SecondHand, lost some of its momentum. In 2024, the re-commerce platform reclaimed or extended approximately 21,000 units of clothing and resold 8,000 units, serving around 5,000 consumers. In comparison, in 2023 the platform reclaimed 20,000 units of clothing and resold 10,000 units to 7,000 consumers.

The segment’s core revenues increased 2% on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2025.

Solid momentum in the clinical diagnostics businesses, led by growth in the Beckman Colter Diagnostics unit, has been buoying the segment’s performance. In the second quarter, core revenues from the clinical diagnostics businesses rose in low single digits. In the quarter, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics unit delivered high single-digit core revenue growth outside China. This marks its fourth consecutive quarter of achieving mid-single-digit or higher growth driven by rising demand for products like DxC 500i Clinical Analyzer and DxI 9000 Access Immunoassay Analyzer.

Recovery in the molecular diagnostics business, driven by an increase in demand for non-respiratory disease tests, has been supporting the performance of the Diagnostics segment as well. However, lower sales in China, owing to volume-based procurement program and healthcare reimbursement changes, are concerning for the segment.

In the quarters ahead, Danaher’s Diagnostics segment is expected to balance these headwinds with continued product innovation and by offering a wider variety of new diagnostic tests. While challenges in China may persist, steady international growth and rising demand for advanced diagnostic solutions position the segment to remain a resilient contributor to the company’s overall performance. For 2025, Danaher anticipates core revenues from the Diagnostics segment to be flat to increase in low single-digits on a year-over-year basis.

Segment Snapshot of DHR's Peers

Among its major peers, Labcorp Holdings Inc.’s LH Biopharma Laboratory Services segment generated net sales of $784.8 million in the second quarter of 2025, up 11% year over year.

For decades, the personal computer has been the central battleground for digital conflict, the primary target for threat actors, and the last line of defense for users.

A new report from HP Wolf Security, released on September 12, illuminates a sobering reality: attackers aren’t just creating new superweapons; they are perfecting the art of digital deception, using the very tools built into our systems against us.

The report’s findings are a stark reminder that as technology advances, so does the sophistication of those who seek to exploit it. But beyond the immediate threats, this landscape reveals a more profound strategic truth.

In an industry of tech conglomerates juggling everything from cloud infrastructure to data servers, HP’s intense, almost singular focus on the PC ecosystem is proving to be a profound competitive advantage. This concentration is not a limitation; it is the driving force behind the company’s leadership in both endpoint security and the burgeoning era of the AI PC.

This week, we’ll examine how HP’s sharp focus on the PC ecosystem gives it a competitive edge. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week, a car from Audi due around 2027 called the Concept C, which is on my short list of cars I want to own in the future.

Evolving Threat: Deception Gets an Upgrade

The latest HP Wolf Security Threat Insights Report makes one thing clear: cybercriminals are masters of refinement. They are increasingly relying on “living-off-the-land” (LOTL) techniques, a notoriously sneaky method where they use legitimate, pre-installed tools within the Windows environment to carry out attacks.

As Ian Pratt, global head of security for personal systems at HP, notes, this creates a significant dilemma for security teams who struggle to distinguish “green flags from red.”

The report details several ingenious campaigns that highlight this trend:

Ultra-Polished Phishing: Attackers are moving beyond poorly worded emails. One campaign used a meticulously crafted fake Adobe Reader file, complete with a realistic loading bar, to trick users into executing a reverse shell script hidden within an SVG image. The attack was even geofenced to German-speaking regions to slow down analysis and detection by global security systems. This demonstrates a level of patience and polish designed to exploit user trust in everyday applications.

Malware in Plain Sight: In another sophisticated attack, threat actors hid malware payloads within the pixel data of image files. Disguised as project documents, these files used legitimate system tools like PowerShell and CMD to execute their malicious code and then, crucially, to delete the evidence, making post-breach forensics incredibly difficult.

Resurgent Stealers: Despite law enforcement crackdowns, the Lumma Stealer malware has returned, using IMG archive files to deliver its payload. This method leverages trusted software like WinRAR and built-in system features to bypass security filters that might otherwise flag a suspicious executable.

As HP threat researcher Alex Holland states, “Attackers aren’t reinventing the wheel, but they are refining their techniques.” By chaining together multiple legitimate tools and hiding their actions within common file types, they create a level of noise that makes traditional, detection-based antivirus software increasingly unreliable.

The data is compelling: HP found that at least 13% of email threats bypassed one or more email gateway scanners, proving that determined attackers can and will get through initial defenses.

The Power of Focus: HP’s PC-Centric Strategy

This unique corporate structure has become HP’s strategic superpower.

Unlike competitors such as Dell Technologies, whose massive portfolio spans servers, enterprise storage, networking, and cloud services, HP’s business is overwhelmingly concentrated on personal systems and printing. Since its split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), HP has been able to dedicate its engineering, research, and development resources almost exclusively to the endpoint — the device sitting on your desk or in your lap.

This focus fosters a deep understanding of the PC that a more diversified company may struggle to match. For a company like Dell, the PC is one product line among many. For HP, the PC is the core business, creating an imperative to lead in innovation, reliability, and, most importantly, security. With no sprawling enterprise division to distract, the company’s success is tied directly to the quality and security of its PCs.

This dedication has culminated in the development of HP Wolf Security, a platform that operates on a fundamentally different principle than traditional antivirus software. Instead of relying solely on detecting a threat, it operates on a Zero Trust model of containment and isolation. It assumes that a threat might get through and uses micro-virtualization to open risky attachments, links, and downloads in their own isolated containers. The malware can detonate, but it’s trapped inside a virtual machine, unable to harm the underlying PC or access user data. It’s the digital equivalent of handling a suspicious package in a bomb disposal chamber.

This defense-in-depth approach is a direct and powerful answer to the LOTL techniques highlighted in the threat report.

From Security Leadership to AI PC Dominance

HP’s sharpened focus on the PC is now paying dividends in the next major technological shift: the AI PC.

The era of the AI PC is defined by the ability to run powerful generative AI models locally on the device, thanks to the integration of neural processing units (NPUs) alongside traditional CPUs and GPUs. Achieving this requires a masterful orchestration of hardware and software — a level of integration possible only for a company with a profound understanding of PC architecture.

Crucially, security is the bedrock upon which the AI PC revolution will be built. As users begin to run AI models on their personal and corporate data locally, the PC will transform into an even more valuable target for attackers. The need for a locked-down, resilient device will be non-negotiable.

In this environment, HP’s long-term investment in hardware-based security gives it an almost insurmountable lead. The proven success of HP Wolf Security builds trust, making it a key selling point for the next generation of AI PCs. Customers will favor platforms that deliver powerful AI performance while protecting sensitive data with security rooted below the operating system at the silicon level.

The focus that built a best-in-class security suite is the same focus now building the most trusted platform for personal AI.

How to Strengthen Your Digital Security

While companies like HP are building more secure systems, user vigilance remains essential. The threats described in the report prey on human behavior. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself:

Cultivate Healthy Skepticism: As the fake Adobe lure shows, attackers are masters of disguise. Treat all unsolicited attachments and links with suspicion, even if they appear to come from a trusted brand or contact. Hover over links to verify their destination and be wary of any document that asks you to enable macros or content.

Keep Software Updated: Regularly update your operating system, web browser, and all applications. These updates frequently contain patches for security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

Use Strong, Unique Passwords and Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Never reuse passwords across different services. Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords and enable MFA wherever possible. MFA provides a critical second layer of defense that can block an attacker even if they have your password.

Prioritize Hardware-Based Security: When purchasing new equipment, look beyond simple specs. Invest in devices that have security built in from the ground up, with features like hardware-enforced isolation and below-the-OS protection. This is where solutions like HP Wolf Security truly shine, providing a safety net that software-only solutions cannot match.

Wrapping Up

The latest HP Wolf Security report serves as a crucial barometer for the cyberthreat landscape. It shows us that the future of attacks lies not in radical new inventions, but in the subtle and sophisticated perfection of old techniques designed to slip past our defenses by hiding in plain sight. Traditional, detection-based security is no longer sufficient to counter this evolving threat.

In this challenging environment, HP’s unwavering focus on the personal computer has allowed it to architect a more resilient defense. By pioneering a containment-based security model, it has created a platform that can withstand the very attacks that are designed to be undetectable. This same strategic focus is now positioning HP to lead the AI PC revolution, where performance and security are not just features, but foundational requirements.

For users and businesses alike, the lesson is clear. In an age of ever-increasing digital threats, the most secure path forward is with technology forged from a clear and dedicated vision.

Audi Concept C

Audi Concept C embodies the brand’s new design philosophy with a vertical frame front, retractable roof, and titanium-toned body, previewing the future of its all-electric sports cars.

For years, we’ve seen concept cars that feel more like fantastical sculptures than blueprints for the future. They scream for attention but often lack a clear connection to the brand that built them.

This month, however, Audi tore the veil off something truly special, Concept C. In doing so, it has not only charted its own future but has also quietly put the entire industry on notice. Concept C isn’t just a car; it’s a statement of intent, and frankly, it’s the most compelling vision of the grand electric tourer I’ve ever seen.

The immediate comparison many are making is to Jaguar’s recently teased Type 00 concept, a wild, low-slung hypercar with aggressive aerodynamics. While the Jaguar is a stunning piece of design, it feels like a beautiful outlier, a nod to past glories like the XJ220 rather than a logical next step.

The Audi Concept C, by contrast, feels like the perfect, evolutionary leap for its parent brand. It takes the sleek, muscular DNA of the current Audi e-tron GT (which I drive). It infuses it with technology and a breathtakingly futuristic design language. This is a car that could only come from Audi, embodying its core philosophy of “Vorsprung durch Technik” (Advancement through Technology).

Visually, the Concept C is a masterpiece of minimalist aggression. Its liquid-metal-effect paint flows over a body devoid of sharp creases, appearing almost organic. The traditional grille is gone, replaced by an illuminated “Digital Grille” that can display communication signals to pedestrians and other vehicles.

The technology beneath is even more radical. Audi hints at a next-generation solid-state battery platform, promising a range of over 600 miles and 10%-80% charging in under 15 minutes. The interior eschews physical screens entirely, instead projecting a fully holographic, AI-powered interface onto a crystal dashboard that anticipates the driver’s needs. It’s a seamless blend of luxury and forward-thinking tech that makes even the most advanced current EVs feel dated.

The Audi Concept C interior combines minimalist design with intuitive technology, creating a refined and distraction-free driving experience.

This car is a clear signal of where Audi’s design language is headed. The hard shoulder lines of the past decade are being softened, replaced by flowing, aerodynamic surfaces. The integration of light as a communication tool will become a signature element, moving beyond simple indicators to become an interactive part of the vehicle.

The Concept C proves that the future of car design is not about adding more screens, but about making the technology disappear into a clean, intuitive, and luxurious environment.

Of course, a vision this advanced won’t come cheap. Should the Concept C make it to production — and Audi insiders suggest a limited run is planned for the end of the decade — expect a price tag that comfortably exceeds $250,000. It will compete in the rarified air of ultra-luxury EVs, and based on this concept, it will be worth every penny. It is a masterful fusion of brand identity, stunning design, and plausible next-generation technology.

It’s not just my Product of the Week, it’s the blueprint for the car of the decade — and I really, really want one.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Investment Narrative Recap

Owning shares in Hewlett Packard Enterprise means believing in its push toward AI and hybrid cloud as growth drivers, alongside its ability to integrate Juniper Networks and execute in an evolving IT infrastructure market. The appointment of Phil Mottram as Chief Sales Officer brings experienced leadership but does not materially alter the near-term catalyst, the successful integration of Juniper, which remains the central focus. The biggest current risk continues to be execution surrounding this integration and realizing anticipated synergies, as these could impact profitability and momentum if mismanaged.

The recent $2.9 billion multi-tranche debt offering is particularly relevant, as it supports HPE’s balance sheet post-acquisition and provides liquidity for ongoing operations and investment. This announcement speaks directly to HPE’s challenge of balancing growth funding with prudent risk management, especially as increased leverage heightens the need for reliable cash flow to service debt and deliver expected value from recent acquisitions.

However, investors should also be mindful that, as integration risk comes to the forefront, ...

Hewlett Packard Enterprise is projected to achieve $44.4 billion in revenue and $2.7 billion in earnings by 2028. This outcome assumes a 10.3% annual revenue growth rate and a $1.6 billion increase in earnings from the current $1.1 billion level.

, a 3% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Seven fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community place HPE’s worth between US$17.90 and US$47.71 per share. With this wide range, the spotlight remains on whether Juniper’s integration will deliver the margin improvements essential for HPE’s next phase, explore these varied outlooks to weigh your own view.
