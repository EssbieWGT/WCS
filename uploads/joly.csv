In response, the US-listed company said: “We have no political agenda. We do not use our profits to fund any government or military operations anywhere — and never have.”

It also wrestled with new entrants into the UK’s “highly competitive” coffee market as well as cost of living pressures squeezing disposable income. A weaker consumer environment coincided with inflationary pressures for commodities such as dairy and cocoa and wage inflation.

Duncan Moir, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said: “It has been a difficult period for the sector. We navigated significant macroeconomic pressures including inflationary headwinds which have also had an impact on consumer confidence.

“We are focused on regaining momentum by strengthening and scaling how we integrate technology

across the business, building on the popularity of our Starbucks Rewards programme and further

optimising our menu to ensure we continue delivering on our core offering every time.”

The business, which opened 100 new stores last year, has 1,240 coffee shops in the UK, which comprise 378 company-owned stores and 862 run by licensees. The company has outlined plans to open a further 80 shops this year.

What's Next for Levi Strauss?

While Levi Strauss has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Levi Strauss: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.16 on $1.42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.27 on $6.27 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Apparel and Shoes is currently in the bottom 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Floor & Dcor (FND), another stock in the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2025.

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Floor & Dcor's revenues are expected to be $1.16 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Levi excluded its Dockers brand, that it’s looking to sell, from its results and adjusted its outlook to reflect an expected divestment.","[NEW YORK] Levi Strauss maintained a full-year outlook that excludes the impact from sweeping new US tariffs that are poised to significantly raise costs for multinational apparel companies.

The San Francisco-based company said its guidance for fiscal 2025 “assumes no significant worsening” of macroeconomic pressure on consumers, supply-chain disruptions, increased tariffs or similar factors. Levi sees organic revenue growth, which excludes items such as currency impact and divestments, growing 3.5 to 4.5 per cent this year.

Shares rose 2.1 per cent at 4.55 pm in extended New York trading. Since US President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on Apr 2, the stock has declined 19 per cent.

Chief financial officer Harmit Singh said it’s “difficult to forecast or plan at this stage” for the tariffs’ impact on consumers. He said the company is focused on issues it can control such as its relationships with vendors and the cost base for its products.

Chief executive officer Michelle Gass said the company is approaching the topic of tariffs with “urgency, but not being overly reactive”.

Levi is one of the first retailers to report earnings after Trump unveiled the tariffs last week.

The company says it sources about 5 per cent of its goods in the US from Mexico, a mid-single digit from Vietnam and 1 per cent from China. It works with 130 facilities in China, 50 in Vietnam, 37 in Bangladesh and 36 in Sri Lanka, according to a company website listing partners in its supply chain.

Gass said Levi sources from 28 countries, adding they are “the places that you’d expect in the apparel industry”.

“We are doing our homework,” she added, without offering more details on specific measures the company is taking to counteract the tariffs. If the company needs to raise prices, it would be “surgical”, Gass said, and be focused on new products that have resonated with shoppers.

In its release, the company said it has “secured the majority of inventory required to meet US orders” in the second quarter.

In the first quarter, the company posted earnings of 38 US cents a share, higher than the average analyst estimate. Levi excluded its Dockers brand, that it’s looking to sell, from its results and adjusted its outlook to reflect an expected divestment.

The company is focused on bolstering its namesake brand and increasing sales through its own channels, such as its stores and website.

Today’s call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed.

And now I’d like to turn over the call to Michelle. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to today’s call. I’m pleased to share that 2025 is off to a strong start, and our shift to becoming a DTC first company is driving both strategic and financial value. In q one, we exceeded expectations across sales, margins, and EPS, driven by the momentum of our strategy. We again achieved high single digit organic net revenue growth, up 9%.

Direct to consumer continues to be the primary growth driver, up 12%, fueled by positive comp growth, successful new openings, and strong e com performance. Our wholesale business delivered another quarter of positive growth, up 5%. Our US business further accelerated, up 8%, while international was strong as well, up nine percent. And we extended our market leadership with share gains across both women’s and men’s. I am proud we are able to deliver these strong results while fundamentally changing the way we work as part of our hard pivot towards becoming a best in class omnichannel retailer.

Given last week’s tariff announcements, we’re dealing with a dynamic macro environment. However, I’m confident in our ability to navigate these rapidly evolving times. As an iconic brand with more than a hundred and seventy years of history, we’ve weathered challenging times before. We have a playbook that begins with leveraging the strength of our brand and our deep connection with consumers. We know, especially during times like these, people turn to the brands they know and trust and prioritize value and quality, and that’s what Levi’s has always stood for.

Today, almost 60% of our revenue is generated outside The US. We have scale with an agile global supply chain, deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us well to navigate this time of uncertainty. I’ll now walk you through highlights from the quarter in the context of our strategy. Note that all numbers that Harmit and I will reference are on an organic basis and exclude jockers, which as you saw in our release, has been moved to discontinued operations as we explore a sale of the brand. Let’s start with our first strategy, being brand led.

The Levi’s brand was up 8% for the quarter and continued to reach new levels of strength all over the world. While many brands aspire to be at the center of culture, we are firmly there. You can see that through our partnership with the most influential artist of our generation, Beyonce. Since launching Reimagine in September of twenty twenty four, the campaign has generated more than 4,300,000,000 impressions and more than $65,000,000 in estimated earned media value, continuing to help us drive equity gains with men and women across our market. As another proof point in our ongoing efforts to drive brand heat, this last quarter, the Levi’s brand was featured in a complete unknown, a highly celebrated biopic of Bob Dylan starring Timothee Chalamet.

Bob Dylan, known for his love of Levi’s, has shaped and defined culture across many decades. To commemorate the film’s release, we launched a limited edition collection featuring some of Bob Dylan’s wardrobe staples. This example of how we lean into our legacy to spark inspiration for the future is further proof that we’re not a heritage brand, but instead a brand with heritage. We are also partnering with authentic, locally influential icons to drive brand heat and anchor the brand at the center of culture across the globe. Earlier this month, we expanded our partnership in India with Punjabi superstar Diljit Dosan and launched a new campaign in Germany with Stephanie Geisinger, strengthening our appeal with consumers in both of these important markets.

And as a testament to the strength of the Levi’s brand, we gained market share in men’s and women’s in the quarter, further solidifying our number one position in denim across both categories. And consistent with our strategy to recruit younger fans to the brand, we also grew share with our 18 30 year old target consumer demographic. These consumers transacted a higher AUR and purchased more frequently than our average consumer. Moving to product. While our history is built on jeans, our future will be built around lifestyle, always rooted in denim.

For most of our history, we’ve been known as a men’s jeans business. But to achieve our bold aspirations, we need to be more. Over the last couple of years, we have significantly expanded our head to toe offering, especially with women, while maintaining our dominance with men. This enables us to further expand our already large total addressable market. And as a result, women’s continued to accelerate, growing double digits over the last two quarters and now represents 38% of net revenues.

Tops represents more than 20% of our business, which has more than doubled over the last ten years. Inspired by denim lifestyle, newer categories such as dresses, skirts, and outerwear continue to grow at a faster pace than the rest of the business. And while we’re the leader in jeans, our portfolio beyond denim bottoms now comprises 35% of our total sales. As we diversify our product portfolio, we also remain laser focused on our core Levi’s bottoms business. And in q one, bottoms were up 9%, driven by strength in both men’s and women’s.

The continued success we’ve achieved in bottoms is attributable to our fit diversification strategy. We have a style for everyone for every occasion and for any time of year. Loose and baggy fits, which make up roughly 15% of our total bottoms portfolio, continue to be a significant growth driver. For her, we’re building on the trend with new fits. A great example is our launch of the Finch Faggy available across both DTC and wholesale, which went viral on TikTok and created tremendous interest with search volume surpassing 200,000,000.

And with men, we’ve been focused on expanding this trend through new fit launches, like the five sixty eight loose straight and the five seventy eight baggy. While there’s so much buzz around the loose and baggy trend, slim and skinny styles remain a wardrobe staple and comprise more than 20% of both our women’s and men’s bottoms businesses. We continue to infuse innovation and newness into these styles with a robust pipeline of new fits, finishes, and fabrics. Our men’s classic five eleven slim fit is a great example now offered across the range of fabric, washes, colors, as well as part of our new tech series, earning us more space in his closet. As part of our denim lifestyle strategy, tops remain a key growth category for us.

And in the quarter, tops grew 7%. We’re seeing stronger growth in our direct to consumer channel, up low double digits, where we offer our broadest assortment. There is a long runway for growth in our tops business, and the strong demand we’re seeing in our DTC channel give us great confidence that this will scale to be a meaningful part of our business over time. Our pipeline of newness and innovation remains robust, and I’m confident this will continue to drive impact and resonate with our fans. We continue to see an opportunity to further premiumize the brand with the global launch of the Levi’s Blue Tab collection.

Introduced in Asia earlier this year, Blu Tab paired our iconic Levi’s aesthetic with the quality and sensibility of Japanese craftsmanship. Our most elevated expression of denim leadership to date, the collection features iconic denim staples along with new tops, skirts, and outerwear. And building on the success of our lightweight denim collection, we’re excited to introduce our newest innovation, linen and denim, combining the authentic feel of blue jeans with soft, light linen. Now shifting to our strategy to be DTC first. Our global direct to consumer business delivered another quarter of double digit growth, up 12% and posting its twelfth consecutive quarter of positive comp.

AURs in the channel were up mid single digits as customers are gravitating to more premium products as well as an intentional reduction in promotion in our stores. DTC productivity actions, including improving the front of house consumer experience and back of house efficiency, are driving growth across key metrics, including strong conversion and traffic trends, fueling significant margin expansion in this channel. I see firsthand how our strategies and actions are driving these results when I walk our stores and get feedback from our team. Our stores today reflect a more robust head to toe offering compared to when we were mainly a men’s denim bottoms destination, and we’re now showcasing a broader denim lifestyle assortment through tops, dresses, outerwear skirts, and both denim and nondenim bottoms. Our inventory levels are healthier with better in stock availability, and we’re equipping our stylists with enhanced product knowledge and improved selling techniques.

The results of all of this work are more productive and profitable doors, increasing our conviction that we can build several hundred more stores in the future. And we are on that path today. In q one, we continued executing our retail expansion plan. Notable openings include Rome on Via Cola Di Renzo, 1 of the most renowned shopping streets in Italy, and continued expansion across Mexico and India as we grow our retail footprint in these important markets. We have abundant opportunity to increase our DTC presence in major markets all around the world, including here in The US.

Our efforts to accelerate our performance in our ecommerce business are working with a channel up 16% in q one on top of 13% in the prior year. Over the last couple of years, the team has been focused on three core areas to fuel momentum in our econ channel, including fixing the fundamentals, evolving the assortment, and elevating the consumer experience, creating a much more premium and engaging destination for the full Levi’s experience. We have upgraded the content on our site with higher quality imagery that focuses on our lifestyle assortment and enhanced storytelling. We’re featuring more use of videos on our product detail pages, which allow our consumers to see our product in motion. And we’re seeing a strong response from our consumers with customer satisfaction scores for The US E Com business rising to its highest level ever.

Today, comprising just 12% of our total company net revenues, we believe that e commerce represents another significant engine for growth. DTC ended the quarter at 52% of total global net revenues, up two points to last year, accounting for over half of our total revenue, a milestone as we transform into a DTC first company. We are also encouraged by the performance in our global wholesale channel, up 5%, driven by strong growth in The US. US wholesale exceeded our expectations in the quarter, up 9%, in part driven by door expansion and more space with our broadened lifestyle assortment. Our Levi’s women’s business was a particular bright spot, up 17%.

Consistent with our strategy to diversify our channels of business, US department stores now represent just 7%, which is less than half of what it was ten years ago. Signature, our value brand, also grew this quarter, up 19%, driven by strength in our seasonal fit. And as we look to the balance of the year, we remain prudent as respect global wholesale. We continue to expect the channel to be flat for the full year on an organic basis, and this continues to be an important profitable channel for us. Now turning to our third strategy, powering the portfolio.

Our international business represents close to 60% of our total business today, up 9% in q one, driven by growth in Mexico, The UK, France, and Germany. International growth remains an important opportunity for us long term, and we continue to believe that we are underpenetrated. Beyond yoga was up 10% in q one.

Unidentified Speaker: We

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: are continuing to focus on brand building initiatives to drive awareness and profitable growth. Customers are responding to our broad assortment of colorways and styles, as well as new products like our luxe fleece collection, expanded outerwear assortment, and our lifestyle status trousers. And comp sales in our small but growing network of stores were positive for the quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. We recognize that the environment around us continues to have uncertainty, and we’re focused on the things we can control.

Our first quarter performance demonstrates how our transformation into a best in class lifestyle retailer is accelerating both the top line and the bottom line. Our key strategies of being brand led, DTC first, and powering our portfolio, along with our efforts to rewire our company to be faster and more consumer obsessed, are working and are gaining momentum. Our team is focused on executing with excellence, and I’m grateful to our employees around the globe for their commitment to the change underway and for their unwavering dedication to consistently deliver for our fans. I am confident we have the right foundation to capture the opportunity ahead and deliver profitable long term growth for all of our shareholders. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Harmit to provide a financial overview of the quarter and our expectations for the year.

Harmit?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Michel. We started the year with momentum. Our financial results were better than expected, and our transformation to a DDC first lifestyle business is making real progress. As you saw in this morning’s press release, Dockers has been reclassified to discontinued operations. As you will notice, while Dockers was a positive contributor to sales, our gross and operating margin structure is higher, excluding Dockers, thereby improving the structural economic and profitability of our remaining business.

Our focus on structural economics is reflected in the fact that net revenues, margins, expenses, and EPS were all better than expected. While global wholesale net revenues were up for the second consecutive quarter, our direct to consumer business continues to lead our growth, with net revenues up 12% as we consistently execute the three things that matter most in this channel, what I call a trifecta, positive comp sales, opening high performing stores, and growing ecommerce profitability. Besides the double digit top line growth, our direct to consumer EBIT margins grew 500 basis points in the quarter, contributing to the company’s overall margin expansion. This is helping drive sustainable sequential progression across our p and l. Q one twenty five organic net revenues accelerated to 9% versus flat in q one twenty three and ’24.

Gross margin was a record at 62.1 this quarter versus 58.2 in q one twenty four and fifty six point five in q one twenty three. Given our expense discipline in q one, we were also able to leverage adjusted SG and A margin by 70 basis points, all of which drove 400 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion to 13.4% versus 9.4% in q one twenty four and eleven point five percent in q one twenty three. Now turning to a brief review of our results. 9% top line growth was driven by better than expected performance in both direct to consumer and wholesale channels. Two third of the growth was driven by units and a third by higher AURs.

Turning to margins, we continue to see expansion in both our gross and operating margins. Gross margin for q one was 52.1 percent of net revenues, a new record. Gross margin expanded 330 basis points relative to last year, driven primarily by the continued benefit of lower product costs, favorable channel and brand mix, and higher full price selling. Adjusted SG and A expenses in the quarter were up 2% versus prior year to $744,000,000 from higher distribution expenses driven by a transition to a hybrid 3PL structure. We were pleased to see our adjusted SG and A rate of 48.7% improve after last quarter’s elevated levels, leveraging 70 basis points versus prior year.

Gross profit dollars growth outpaced the adjusted SG and A dollar increase, delivering a flow through of 84%, driving adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 400 basis points to 13.4%. Adjusted diluted EPS came in at 38, well ahead of our expectations and up 52% to prior year. We ended the quarter with reported inventory dollars up 7% to the prior year. We feel comfortable with the level and composition of our inventory and have secured the majority of inventory required to meet US orders for quarter two. In the quarter, as planned, we closed 21 net stores as a system.

However, this consists of 30 new store openings, primarily full price Levi’s brand stores and 51 closures, which were mostly underperforming franchisee stores in China. Our disciplined fleet review process ensures that the doors we are opening are productive, and only the most profitable with the highest return opportunity remain open. In the quarter, we returned 81,000,000 to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which were up 12% to prior year. In quarter two, we have declared a dividend of 13¢ per share, an increase of 8% versus prior year. Now let’s review the key highlights by segment.

The Americas net revenues were up 11%, fueled by double digit growth across both direct to consumer and wholesale. In The US, net revenues were up 8% driven by high single digit growth in both channels. Our business in Mexico was up 6% from increased traffic in our stores as well as ecommerce growth. For the segment, strong gross margin and SG and A leverage led to operating margin of 21.7, improving three seventy basis points to prior year. Europe was positive for the third consecutive quarter.

Net revenues were up 3% in q one, led by double digit growth in key markets like The UK and Germany. Direct to consumer continued to accelerate this quarter, up 11%, supported by comp stores, ecommerce, and more full price sales. While wholesale shipping was down in the quarter, given the transition of our distribution center in Germany, we expect wholesale in this segment to return to growth in quarter two and have strong pre book orders, up mid to high single digits for spring and summer. Gross margin expansion drove operating margin to leverage a 20 basis points versus prior year to 25.6%. Asia net revenues increased 10% compared to prior year.

Direct to consumer net revenues were up 14, led by double digit growth in key markets like Japan, Korea, and Turkey. Our South Asia, Middle East, and Africa business, which includes India, was also up double digits this quarter as improved in store retail experiences drove higher UPT and better conversion rates in addition to growth in wholesale. This quarter, our China business was flat to prior year, and we continue to have modest expectations in ’25 as our work to reset this market is underway. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 200 basis points to last year from stronger gross margin. Now turning to our full year and quarter two guidance.

We had a strong first quarter with broad based strength across segments, channels, and categories delivering a notable beat for the quarter, and we saw solid trends continue through March. However,

Unidentified Speaker: as

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: you all know, there were changes to the tariff structure announced a few days ago. Given that the situation is fluid and unprecedented, the impacts are uncertain. We are in the process of scenario planning and determining different mitigation strategies. We recognize this is a quickly evolving macro situation, and we have to see where the dust settles to give you the guidance that is going to be as helpful to you as possible. For now, our full year outlook remains unchanged and includes no impact from the proposed tariffs.

Our q two outlook remains consistent with our internal plan. The impacts of tariffs will have a minimal impact to our margin structure in the quarter as most of the product for spring, early summer is already in The US. As a reminder, q two is seasonally our lowest quarter for revenue and margins in the year. For quarter two, we expect organic net revenue growth from continued operations of three and a half to four and a half percent. This excludes approximately two points of foreign exchange headwinds and one and a half points attributable to the exit of Denizen and our footwear business, which implies being flat to up 1% for the quarter on a reported basis.

Gross margin is expected to be up between 80 basis points to a hundred basis points, and adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be in the range of five and a half percent to 6%. This translates to an adjusted diluted EPS of approximately eleven to thirteen cents, which includes around 3¢ headwind from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate versus prior year. With this expectation, our profitability assumptions will be significantly higher, up approximately 20% versus h one twenty four. In closing, I will leave you with three thoughts. First, while the tariffs announced last week pose a significant challenge for us and the industry, our business and our brands have endured for one hundred and seventy years, proving our resilience.

Today, the Levi’s brand is stronger than ever with diversified global revenue, solid margin structure, a giant sourcing base with deep vendor relationships, and a strong balance sheet. We are well positioned to manage through this uncertain time. Second, we delivered strong first quarter results, and we’re starting the year with momentum. Our new products are resonating and driving market share gains. We have a robust product pipeline that will fuel growth in our denim and non denim business for the rest of ’25 and beyond.

We’re making incredible progress on growing the direct to consumer channel to a longer term goal of 55% of our business while also growing wholesale. Third, we are both transforming our business while delivering strong financial results and improving our structural economics as we continue on our path to becoming a $10,000,000,000 company with 15% operating margin. I will now open up the line for q and a.

Conference Operator: You. The floor is now open for questions. Due to time constraints, the company requests that you ask only one question. If you have an additional question, please queue up again. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing 11 again.

Our first question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Laurent?

Unidentified Speaker: Good afternoon, Michelle and Harmit. Thanks for taking our question. With tariffs front and center on everyone’s mind, can you provide a percentage breakdown of sourcing by key countries for the investors on this call? What are your suppliers saying about providing potential concessions? And then on passing some of the tariffs down the value chain, how much and when do you think you can raise pricing?

Thank you very much.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. Hi, Laurent. Thanks for the question. So let me just take a step back for a minute. And obviously, the news on tariffs is very new.

It’s fluid. This was just a couple of days ago and I think we like the industry are getting our arms around it. I would say that as we enter in this period, we are coming from a place of strength. We have momentum on the business, the brand’s never been stronger and we’ve achieved significant margin expansion. That said, we have a task force assembled assessing the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate.

And you’ve named a couple of them, but I’d first start with the structural changes, cost structure that we can make as part of our transformation initiative. As you know, we’ve made significant progress. You see it again in Q1 with margin expansion. So we will look there first on how we can accelerate further margin and cost opportunities. Point number two is, yes, we will work with all of our stakeholders.

That includes our vendors. It includes our customers as we assess and look at what opportunities we have. As it relates to our vendors, we’ve got long, deep relationships with many suppliers around the world. We source from 28 countries, 20 of which are countries that we source into The US. I’ll speak to some of the countries in a moment.

So that is definitely an area that we’re investigating. But we’re in the very early days on that, Laurent, so I’d say more to follow. And then similarly, on pricing, as we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand, that there is pricing power there. But if we do anything, it’ll be very surgical. As you saw even this past quarter, our average unit retail, their AURs were up again.

So the consumer is actually increasing prices. They buy up into more premium products. So that’s an opportunity. We’ve also been pulling back, especially in our DTC channel and some promotion. We had more full price selling.

So that whole area is an opportunity. So I would just say more to come. But really, we’re looking at those three areas, The cost structure, kind of the end to end stakeholder and supply chain, and then surgical pricing. And then specific to the supply chain, as I said, we have a global long tenured supply chain. We source from over 28 countries.

The places that we source from are the places you’d expect from the industry. Some of the key countries for us, in no particular order, are places like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam. Those, I’d say, are our top vendors. But it’s broad. And I’d say our supply chain is more agile today than it ever has been.

We make pivots all the time. We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium, and long term.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: And I think what we’ve disclosed, Laurent, into The US from China approximately 1%, into The US, from Mexico approximately 5%, and from Vietnam in the mid to high single digits into The US.

Unidentified Speaker: Very helpful. Thank you very much for your thoughts.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead, Dana.

Dana Telsey, Analyst, Telsey Advisory Group: Hi, everyone. Nice to see the progress. As you think about inventory levels, Harmit, how you planning inventory levels going forward on wholesale orders? What are you seeing from the account? And Michelle, given the Beyonce campaign and some of the other activations and collaboration, women’s business, men’s business, how you thinking of the denim market growing?

And what should we be looking at given the linen and denim and new things coming and how you’re thinking about pricing? Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Dana, a couple of things. Inventory at the end of q one was The composition of the inventory is healthy. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for The US, we have product for spring and summer. And so that’s why, you know, we gave a guidance on quarter two.

The other thing is our quarter two includes March, and the the the trends in March are stronger than how we exited the, you know, February. So that’s that’s a perspective on that business. We’re being prudent in inventory planning. You know, as we think about the year, you know, as you think about inventory, the three things, and now the fourth that we’re keeping in mind, there was getting product in for spring and summer largely because the tariff clouds were you know, there was an overhang even a couple of months ago. The second for Europe is Red Sea disruption, and and and and the and the third was generally, you know, our thinking about about the year.

So being very prudent. As a reminder for everybody, we sell a lot of coal. Right? So a lot of our product is seasonless, and we can carry it through seasons. And our balance sheet is fairly strong.

We talked about the cash position at the end of the quarter and the access to liquidity. So we are in a good spot in a lot of ways, but we’re being prudent. To your question about wholesale orders, global wholesale was up 5%. US wholesale was up nine organically. This was the second quarter where we have seen both global wholesale and US wholesale up.

And, you know, so as we think and as we’ll as we are understanding right now, there’s been no change to there’s been no change to orders in from wholesale customers. Inventory or trade inventory is, you know, very similar to 2019 levels. Just now let me share a little bit of a perspective on wholesale in Europe. Wholesale in Europe was down in quarter one. Essentially, as I said, because we are ramping up our distribution center, we expect wholesale to return to growth in quarter two.

The indicate best indication of wholesale demand in Europe is prebook, which for spring and summer is positive, and for fall is positive right now. And I think the second question, Michelle, she asked you about the denim category.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. So, Dana, thanks for the question. And I think to echo what we said in remarks, we’re really pleased with the start of the year, and the Levi’s brand has never been stronger. So Levi’s brand was at 8% in the quarter. And I think to your question, we’re seeing gains in both men and women, both in market share and in equity.

So specific to the Beyonce campaign, 4,300,000,000 press impressions, more than 65,000,000 in media value alone. But I think importantly, it’s creating a nice tailwind to everything else that we’re doing. Specific to, as we think about our transformation, we must preserve and drive the leadership position in men’s. But our intention has been to accelerate with women’s because we’re under shared there. Women’s is now 38% of our business.

Q1 was our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Like I said, we are now firmly in the number one position market share in The US, and we’re growing that, which is really exciting. Women’s was up 12% overall across all channels and geographies. And then if you look at DTC, which is really the leading indicator, up 16% in the quarter and really delivering on that head to toe lifestyle. So as we pivot from jeans to becoming DTC, becoming head to toe, we’re seeing that in our DTC results, up 12%, and we’re seeing that in women’s and in lifestyle.

So like I said, women’s up 16 and both bottoms and tops growing. The team is really nailing it in terms of driving trends and fashion fit. Diversifying the fit opportunity to strengthen loose and baggy continues, but our core remains strong. Western wear continues to trend. The list goes on.

But even in times like these, when it’s turbulent, we’re going to lean in and please our fans with delivering the highest quality product. It’s a great value and deliver that innovation. Thank you. Thanks, Dana.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead,

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Matt. Thank you.

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: So Michelle, could you elaborate on key drivers of the 9% organic growth, maybe consumer demand and market share trends that you’re seeing in The Americas? And Harmit, if you could maybe speak to the cadence of gross margin in the second quarter relative to the back half?

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Sure. Great. So I can start. I mean, one of the things, Matt, that we’re really proud of the team’s efforts this quarter is really across the board, we saw strength. So if you take our geographies as an example, so our total organic revenue is up nine percent.

We saw strength in The Americas, in Europe, and in Asia, and beyond yoga, I would say, as well, as that carries forward another quarter of double digit growth. The channels both channels were positive. DTC up 12. 12 quarter of positive growth, can speak to that in a moment, as well as our wholesale business up 5%. And I’d say it’s particular strength in US wholesale.

And then if I really double click under DTC, because the 9%, clearly the 12% is what’s fueling the majority of that. It’s now 52% of our business. As you know, our long term goal that we’ve put out there is to be at least 55%, so we’re making great progress. But if you think about DTC and look at some of the the KPIs, the key metrics there, as it relates to our owned and operated stores, positive comp sales. We saw positive traffic.

We saw positive conversion, and we saw positive AURs. E commerce up 16%, again, positive traffic, conversion, and AURs. And so when you think about this, the growth is healthy and it’s sustainable. We’re seeing both it coming through volume and units, which accounted for about twothree of the business, and we’re also seeing AURs up, which is about up onethree. So this, as we look at the trends, feel like it’s sustainable.

And it’s all coming off of the back of our key strategies. When we say DTC first, denim lifestyle, winning with women, we’re seeing that across the board. And then your second part of your question was around market share. And as I think I mentioned even in my earlier remarks, we’re really pleased to see the growth we are seeing there. Both men’s and women’s grew market share in The US this past quarter, number one in both positions across both genders.

And the other piece that we’re seeing nice momentum and growth is growing market share with youth, that eighteen to thirty year old target customer, as well as the premium consumer. So there’s just there’s just, a lot to like and a lot of momentum we’re seeing across all of our segments of the business.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: And, Matt, to your question of gross margin, which to me is a great indicator of how the brand’s doing, record gross margins in quarter one at 62.1. I think the best way to think about it is half is driven by product costs, which are not truly just straight vendor negotiation. As part of our transformation efforts, we’ll you know, we’re taking a hard look at SKUs. We have reduced our SKUs. You know, we’re taking a hard look at assortments that are not as productive, as well as our newer innovations are great margins.

So that’s one piece of it. And the other half, I would say, is a combination of mix, which is higher women’s, higher DTC, higher international, higher full price selling that Michelle referred to. There’s a there’s a real focus given that our products are hitting home. We drive higher full price selling, and we had favorable effects given our, you know, hedging strategy. Similar in for q q two.

So q two reflected margins would be up 80 to a hundred basis points, again, driven by this. And on a full year basis, a hundred basis points. To your question about cadence, first half versus second half, the first half is really strong. The second half, because our margin structure was very strong a year ago, the second half will be muted. Still up, but, you know, much lower than the first half.

And, you know, obviously, we are focused on driving more full price selling. It’s something that is difficult to predict. That’s why, you know, we continue to beat margins. I mean and the other reason that’s driving higher margin is the wonderful DTC business is higher gross margin.

Matthew Boss, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great color. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Matt.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole of UBS. Please go ahead, Jay.

Jay Sole, Analyst, UBS: Great. Thank you so much. Maybe just on the guidance for Q2, can you give us a sense of for that organic net revenue growth, how you see that by region?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. So, similar, Jay, I would say, you know, The US low to mid single digit, as you think about, you know, q two. Europe, probably mid single digit with one difference. Wholesale should return to growth given what I indicated in Asia. Again, mid single digit.

If you think of channels, BDC, you know, I would say high single digit. And global wholesale, flat to slightly up is the general thinking at this stage.

Jay Sole, Analyst, UBS: Got it. Alright. Great. Thank you so much.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you, Jay.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Ike.

Ike Boruchow, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Harmit, I think two for you. Just can you walk us through the expense deleverage that looks to be implied in the 2Q after getting some pretty good leverage in 1Q? And then it looks like the back half should go back to kind of getting nice leverage to flat.

Just what exactly are the spending dynamics kind of taking place in the second quarter? And then bigger picture for you, it sounds like there’s no revenue issues for the business at all right now. But at least over the past couple of weeks, it might be helpful. Could you talk about the brand overseas? I think there’s some growing narrative about anti American response to US brands that there is a risk to what’s going on geopolitically.

Would love to hear if you’re seeing any of that or if there’s any noteworthy developments that you’ve come across in the past couple of weeks. Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Right. So I’ll Ike, I’ll I’ll try and do this in a speed round. Right now, international business is fairly strong. We are not seeing any any impact internationally. From our perspective, you know, we’ve been here for a long, long time.

Internationally, you know, as a business, we’ve been around for, you know, over eighty years. So we’re not seeing it. You know, we’re in friends with the local consumers, connecting really well. And our new product offers that Michelle referred to are generally doing well. To your question about the quarter two guidance, so quarter two, just as a reminder, is largely, you know, is our lowest volume quarter just from the seasonality.

First quarter has December holiday. Third quarter has back to school, and the fourth quarter has the beginning of holidays. The second quarter, So seasonally, it’s the lowest quarter. In terms of SG and A increase, the first quarter was up two. We expect the second quarter to be up three.

SG and and A as a rate is in the mid fifties. It was around under 50. We still expect SG and A for the year to be around 50%, and this is prior to any actions that we take, as Michelle referred to, you know, to mitigate actions on tariff, etcetera. And the EPS decline relative to last year is primarily driven by foreign exchange and higher tax. You know, even though foreign exchange rates have improved a little from the last quarter, they’re very volatile.

They go up and down. And so our perspective is FX and higher tax will probably impact EPS adversely by about 3, you know, 3¢. But structurally, the business is in good standing. You know, gross margins, you know, we expect to be up, and organic rate to be up three and a half, 4%. You know, think of our reported revenue reported revenue in quarter two, I said it’s flat to slightly up.

And so that’s what the deleverage in terms of EBIT percentage.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. The only thing I would add to what Harmit is saying is just when you think about the whole year, know, we’re we’re obviously thinking about our strategy is to drive the top line. We’ll get some leverage there and drive margin expansion, both in gross margin over the year and in EBIT margin. And as you know, we saw progress from 2024 over 2023, and we’ve guided the year to see another level of expansion there as well. All this, of course, does not yet reflect the tariffs.

Ike Boruchow, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Got it. Thanks a lot.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Ike.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Nardone of BofA. Please go ahead,

Chris Nardone, Analyst, BofA: Great, guys. Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow ups. First on U. S.

Wholesale, can you just clarify whether your guidance is implying positive or negative growth for the remainder of this year? And then looking out, it sounds like you benefited from expanding into some newer wholesale distribution points in the first quarter. How big is this opportunity over the medium term? And do you need growth in U. S.

Wholesale to reach your medium term EBIT margin targets?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: So Chris, we’ve had two great quarters in wholesale. US and the team, big shout out to them. They’ve delivered US wholesale growth in the first two quarters. I indicated, I think, in the earlier question, q two globally, we expect wholesale to be flat to slightly up. Our expectation in US wholesale right now, we continue to be prudent, and so we think, you know, a flat number is a good number at this stage.

Obviously, we’re another quarter under the belt. We’ll we’ll talk about the the full year from that perspective. On the distribution, you are right. You know, our opportunities on distribution in The US is primarily around the categories we are growing DDC. We think we have an opportunity in women’s.

We think we we have an opportunity in tops. And as you know, you know, after the exit of Denizen and Target, we are working with our customers, in this case, Target, to try and grow our Levi’s business, and that’s making a difference. So as we think about opportunities of distribution and wholesale, there are opportunities around the company, especially as we grow the categories and, you know, both gender, women and men’s, as Michelle referred to, and the different categories as a pivot to a denim lifestyle company.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen. Please go ahead,

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Hi, thanks. Michelle and Harmit, in the past, what are your thoughts around frameworks around pricing? And also, when you look at tariffs in the past, what percentage did you absorb versus share with customers in different ways? As we look forward, if you pricing has been something that you’ve adjusted in the past and recently in terms of being prices being too high. So would you take lower margins in terms of offering the consumer a good value?

I know there’s a very dynamic situation here with tariffs and inflation.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Yes. Oliver, I’ll take that. Thanks for the question. I mean, think the word you just said is very appropriate, which is it is very dynamic right now. I mean, we’re literally this this whole situation is just a couple of days old, as you know, and I think both Harmeet and I mentioned we’ve got a really talented team right now who’s dissecting the problem and looking at all the levers that we have to address the issue, two of which you just hit on, which is we will work with our vendors, with our customers to understand the best way forward.

And then pricing is a potential lever. Would say as we think about it, we will very much think about any pricing if we do take pricing very surgically. Number one, one of the things we’ve seen our consumer do is they’re actually driving price up. We saw our AURs again this quarter increase as they gravitate to more premium products. So we expect that to continue.

There could be more pricing power in our more premium products. So we’ll look at that. Promotions. We have been surgically pulling back more in DTC, I would say, on promotions and achieving more full price selling. So that is something that

We can test pricing in our DTC channel. That’s something that we can more easily do and understand the elasticity. We have recent experience, for example, in Mexico where we successfully took some price adjustments based on the tariffs there. And then what I would say overall as we think about the Levi’s brand, we address today a broad range of price points. If you start at the core of our product, we’re at a very accessible price point in that $40.50 dollars range.

Then we do compete in the value segment with signature. It’s largely offered in some of the mass channels. That’s doing really well. We were up 19% this quarter. And then we go high end, the way from, I’ll call it, our tier two, which is in our mainline stores.

You’re seeing more and more on that of ecom. That’s where we’re in the $90.100 dollars range. And then even upwards of $200.300 dollars with Tier one and our new Blue Cab. So I share that in the spirit of we have a lot to work with here to determine what is going to be our right path forward. But it’s gonna be really important for us to be super sensitive to the consumer and make sure that we’re on the right path.

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Okay. And Harmine, can you get inventory faster, like, now in order to address what’s happening? Or what happened with the inventory you have on hand relative to the win and the the methodology for inventory valuation that we should know about with timing of prices relative to the cost of goods sold?

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. I mean, Oliver, we’re looking at all options right now. You know, I’m sure a lot of our partners and vendors are being called, you know, and so we’re looking at options. We’ve been able to successfully air freight, you know, in the past when we were chasing product. The fact that we have inventory for spring and summer is a good indication.

We’re also working on a faster go to market calendar, especially for the newer products. So, you know, we’re doing everything that we can within our means. And to your question about, you know, cost accounting and, you know, depending on where tariffs it totally depends where tariffs settle. It’s such a fluid situation, and so we’re working through it.

Oliver Chen, Analyst, TD Cowen: Okay. Thanks. Best regards.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Oliver.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead, Paul.

Unidentified Speaker: Hey, thanks guys. Can you tell you’re thinking about the various macro backdrops of the major regions that you operate in and also how you’re looking at the competitive landscape currently? You’re seeing any changes in terms of promotions, either increasing or decreasing, and just, you know, sort of what is the the backdrop that that you’re you’re thinking about by by your major regions? Thanks.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Yeah. So the good news, Paul, is, you know, q one is a good indication of the momentum of the brand. The growth was broad based. All regions were up. You know, Europe was up only three, but on an organic basis, because that was driven by the ramp up in our distribution center.

And so as we think across the world, you know, Europe, Third consecutive quarter of growth. US, Fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Mexico, Second consecutive quarter of growth. Asia, up, you know, double digits. So, generally, the momentum is strong from that perspective.

Being global and 60% international, I think, will make a difference, at least from that perspective. Consumer, generally resilient across the world. They’re responding to our new products. You know, our products offer great value, as Michelle referenced. So we’re feeling generally good from that perspective.

Unidentified Speaker: Any changes on the promotional front? That

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: you Yeah. And promotions, actually, we are tightening promotions. I mean, that’s why the focus on full price sales, you can see it in margins. So we’re not necessarily going the other way at this stage because the consumer is not giving us giving us a reason for a change. And because inventories are generally in a good spot, there’s no reason to push that down faster, push price down faster.

Unidentified Speaker: Great. Thanks, Henry. Good luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thanks, Paul.

Conference Operator: Comes from Brook Roach.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company0: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about your playbook should the macro environment worsen. What’s the cost structure of your business today? How much is fixed versus variable? And how much additional SG and A leverage can you drive this year to offset higher product costs if the macro environment worsens materially?

Unidentified Speaker: Thank you.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: It’s all it’s all being planned right now, Brooke. I think the best best proxy, unfortunately, but the best proxy recently is is 2020 and ’21, which is which was COVID. At that point, our view was, you know, fixed and variable. You know, I’d say between sixty five and seventy fixed, the rest variable. You know?

And variable, I’d also add incentives available, for example. But, you know, it’s the last thing you want to touch, especially when there’s so much momentum in the brand, I’ll put it there. I think as you think about our stores, very similar cost structure, but even then, we actually grew our store base. You know, we kept adding stores. And so, you know, we’re thinking through it.

We’re putting everything on the table right now as we think through the three levers, which is, you know, cost initiatives without compromising the long term, stakeholder management discussions, which is customers and our vendor partners, and the third is pricing, you know, options and initiatives. And so we are looking at all options, Brooke. And then we have an international business that’s very strong. Right? That could also be you know, we can drive some momentum there to offset some softness, if any, in The US.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company0: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer, Levi Strauss & Company: Thank you. Thank you, Brooke.

Michelle Goss, President and CEO, Levi Strauss & Company: Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining our call today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

Conference Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time.

The company said the workers will be laid off starting June 2, with all layoffs occurring by March 31, 2026.
A Washington Prime statement provided by a spokesperson said the layoffs follow the company's decision to sell its shopping centers.
It has sold several other Ohio properties, including Indian Mound Mall in Heath; Dayton Mall; Lima Mall; New Towne Mall in New Philadelphia; and Southern Park Mall in Youngstown.
Washington Prime said employees have long been aware of the company's direction.","Washington Prime Group, the Columbus owner of Polaris Fashion Place, is laying off 139 workers at its headquarters as it sheds its portfolio of shopping centers across the country.

Among the layoffs are seven senior vice presidents and 11 vice presidents, according to a required notice the company filed with the state of Ohio. The company said the workers will be laid off starting June 2, with all layoffs occurring by March 31, 2026. All affected workers are at the company's headquarters at 4900 E. Dublin-Granville Road.

A Washington Prime statement provided by a spokesperson said the layoffs follow the company's decision to sell its shopping centers.

""As part of WPG’s multi-year journey, the company continues to sell assets in its portfolio, with about half of WPG’s properties sold in the past year, while the remainder of the portfolio is or will soon be on the market,"" the company said.

""As a result, WPG is reducing its headcount to reflect the downsized organization,"" according to the statement.

The company's website states the company now owns more than 70 retail centers across the country, including The Mall at Fairfield Commons in Beavercreek and Great Lakes Mall in Mentor, in addition to Polaris Fashion Place. It has sold several other Ohio properties, including Indian Mound Mall in Heath; Dayton Mall; Lima Mall; New Towne Mall in New Philadelphia; and Southern Park Mall in Youngstown.

Washington Prime said employees have long been aware of the company's direction.

""The company’s strategy has been transparently communicated and understood for some time, and WPG has worked closely with employees to ensure they have the resources and support needed to help them,"" WPG said.

""WPG is providing support including a severance package, access to outplacement services including job search assistance, resume workshops, professional headshots, and a development program was launched last summer to help colleagues learn new skills and obtain certifications and degrees to help them prepare for their next chapter after WPG.""

Like other shopping center owners, WPG was crushed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which dramatically reduced mall traffic and revenue.

After filing for bankruptcy protection in June 2021, WPG announced that it would no longer be publicly traded. Instead, the company emerged from bankruptcy five months later, in November 2021, as a private firm controlled by SVPGlobal, a private investment group based in Connecticut.","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/07/NCOD/82979861007-img-polaris-entrancejpg-1-1-9-s-1440-o-4-q-l-2050879313.JPG?crop=5999,3375,x0,y313&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-04-07 19:05:56.620669

The company is also maintaining its 2025 top and bottom line guidance which excludes, it says, any impact from the recent tariff announcements.
But then they say which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements and we said we anticipate minimal impact to our second quarter margin outlook.
But again, this is why earnings season is going to be so interesting, Kenny, because we're going to get these companies to say this.
Um, but it's really again, it's not even so much about the numbers, because remember the numbers are history.","Let's take a look at what's trending after hours. We want to talk about Levi's, the denim company. Those shares are moving higher after it delivered a beat on first quarter earnings. The company is also maintaining its 2025 top and bottom line guidance which excludes, it says, any impact from the recent tariff announcements. So that's really important here, um, that I I want to emphasize here. The company's saying in a statement, Harmit Singh, who is the chief financial and growth officer, says, we're maintaining our forecast, which seems like a good thing. But then they say which excludes any impact from the recent tariff announcements and we said we anticipate minimal impact to our second quarter margin outlook. Um, Kenny Polcari, you are still with me here, and I have been I've been looking very closely at companies like this, because obviously Levi's sources a lot of its stuff from outside the US and is subject to tariffs. So you see a statement like this, and at first you say, oh, they're maintaining. That's a good thing. We're excluding all tariffs, though. Is that just because they can't

Well quantify it at this time. if they can't quantify it, but that then leaves open the door, while it sounds positive. They said they've just said we're excluding the tariffs, suggesting we can't quantify it, so we may have more negative news down the line. But the market is not taking it that way. I mean it's up a little bit. What's it up, 2% in the after hours, um, although it is down 34% in the last year. So maybe there's a little bit of a push to, but it's going to be interesting to see if there's any other further clarification, if someone starts calling them out asking them for you know, for more clarification.

It feels that way. Yeah. Right. Yes. Well, I mean, the conference calls is going to be real interesting in that regard. I am sure that analysts are going to push them on a potential tariff effect. But again, this is why earnings season is going to be so interesting, Kenny, because we're going to get these companies to say this. We're going to get um forecasts from many of them, or Right.

We won't get any. Right.

We won't get any, because they say we just don't know. What is the and what is the tariff going to be? I have no idea. Right.

And I think if you have a lot of them that say they're not going to forecast or they can't tell, that's going to be a negative, right? People are going to take it as a negative, because they're going to lose they're going to lose the guidance. They're not going to know which way to go. So that would, in my mind, it would cause uh it would cause the market to become weaker, or at least their stock to become weaker. Um, but then if we keep hearing that with more and more companies, then you know, it'll have a more broader effect.

You said this, though. Yeah. Yes, exactly. You know, we've been asking a lot of people today what they're expecting for earning season. We didn't have a chance to ask you, so.

So I so I think already, listen, I think that when we came into the year, it was supposed to be 12% year-over-year growth. I think that's been whittled back down to 7%. We've seen, you know, uh as they as they modify coming into the end of the quarter. Uh so I think that's I think I'm comfortable saying that I think that's about what it's going to be. And to Keith's point, where he said you're going to see probably a 70% B grade, which is kind of It's the game that they all play. Yes. the number, right? Right. So they they lower the numbers and then they beat it. They go, oh, look, we beat it. I got it, great. Um, but it's really again, it's not even so much about the numbers, because remember the numbers are history. When they report their history It's history. It is really about what they say going forward, and this quarter is going to be very important about what they say going forward.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UjNpulZk93jf4INRqhsn0w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-04/81221d90-13f4-11f0-bf7f-e67618f85d32,N,,2025-04-07 19:05:44.936909

“It’s dynamic, it’s new, it’s fluid and it’s changing,” Gass said of the business climate.
Levi’s set up a task force to understand how the trade change would hit its business and how it could mitigate the impact.
Adjusted earnings per share were 38 cents — 10 cents ahead of the 28 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance.
“It’s a competitive process,” Singh said of the Dockers sale.","Momentum has got to count for something — in sports and fashion.

“We had a strong quarter,” said Michelle Gass, president and chief executive officer of Levi Strauss & Co., in an interview on first-quarter results. “[Organic] sales up 9 percent kicks off 2025 in a very strong way. But not only sales, our margins were up. It’s another proof point that our transformation is working.”

But this is also one of those moments when the past has a lighter grip on the present and the future is all the more uncertain.

U.S. President Donald Trump moved on from sniping at China to launching a global trade war last week, adding on 10 percent tariffs on goods from nearly every other country. And some have been hit with much higher rates including China, which is being hit with an additional 34 percent tariff.

“It’s dynamic, it’s new, it’s fluid and it’s changing,” Gass said of the business climate. “We — and the entire industry — are facing a tremendous amount of uncertainty at this moment.”

In addition to some momentum, Levi’s has been cutting costs as it moves to a stronger direct-to-consumer stance and is also cushioned by its international business, which accounts for 60 percent of sales.

Levi’s sources from 28 countries, including China (which accounts for only 1 percent of product), Mexico (5 percent) and Vietnam (a single-digit percentage). The rest of Levi’s goods come mostly from other countries in Asia.

But there’s really no global supply chain in fashion that could skirt Trump’s tariffs.

Levi’s set up a task force to understand how the trade change would hit its business and how it could mitigate the impact.

“We’ve already been on the path to improve the structural economics of the business,” said Gass, referring to work that has seen Levi’s cut costs over the past year or so. “We will look to accelerate that and then we will work with all of our partners. And if we do take pricing, we’re going to do that very surgically. No decisions have been made.”

The speed of events on the ground — Trump, for instance, threatened China with another 50 percent tariff on Monday — makes it hard to settle on any decision.

So for now Levi’s, like the rest of fashion, is planning and watching the market closely.

First-quarter sales rose 3 percent to $1.5 billion, but were up 9 percent on an organic basis, which excludes currency fluctuations, the closed footwear and Denizen businesses and the Dockers business, which is now classified as a discontinued operation.

Net income tallied $135 million, or 34 cents a share, up from losses of $10.6 million, or 3 cents a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share were 38 cents — 10 cents ahead of the 28 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance.

Levi’s ended the quarter with $574 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion.

Harmit Singh, chief financial and growth officer, called that “a very good spot” to be in.

The company is holding Dockers for sale and was said to be in exclusive talks with brand management firm Marquee Brands. But sources said that period of exclusivity expired just as the market hit its tariff crisis, making it difficult to value the brand in the current environment.

“It’s a competitive process,” Singh said of the Dockers sale. “There are a couple of prospective buyers. We are in the middle of the sale process and it is confidential right now.”

He said the company was confident that a deal would close “sometime in 2025.”

If the uncertainty in the market has complicated the Dockers sale, Gass said Levi’s mission was still clear despite a volatile world.

“There is uncertainty at times like these,” the CEO said. “Levi’s is the type of brand that people will go to. They are going to go to brands that they trust, and we stand for the things that are really important in uncertain times, which is quality, value, taking care of our consumer. We’re going to continue to focus on great execution and operate against our playbook. That playbook is working.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Michelle_Gass_Levis.jpg?crop=0px%2C726px%2C1997px%2C1119px&resize=1000%2C563,N,,2025-04-07 18:10:54.948675

CEO notes 'uncertain environment' but touts an 'agile supply chain'

Levi Strauss & Co. on Monday reported a higher adjusted quarterly profit than Wall Street expected, and the denim and jeans maker said it was sticking with its full-year outlook - one that doesn't include the potential impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The company said it still expects a sales drop of 1% to 2% for its fiscal year, which is set to run through November, with adjusted earnings of $1.20 to $1.25 a share. That forecast, Levi's (LEVI) said, excluded any hit from ""the recent tariff announcements."" But it said it expected ""minimal impact"" to its margin expectations for the second quarter.

Levi's reported fiscal first-quarter sales of $1.53 billion, up 3% year over year. It reported adjusted earnings per share of 38 cents.

Analysts polled by FactSet expected Levi Strauss to report adjusted earnings of 28 cents a share for its first quarter, which ended on March 2. They expected sales of $1.54 billion.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" Chief Executive Michelle Gass said in a statement.

Shares rose 3.1% after hours.

The financials included in Levi's earnings release excluded $67 million in sales related to Dockers, which the company now considers ""discontinued operations.""

The company has been trying to sell its Dockers business, amid efforts to lower costs and focus more on newer jeans and other denim items. Levi's has tried to retain inflation-fatigued consumers' interest with a partnership with Beyoncé.

Levi's reported the results as new tariffs announced last week by Trump continue to roil markets. Meanwhile, jeans could be targeted for steeper trade retaliation by the European Union.

Morningstar analyst David Swartz, in a note last week, said Trump's tariffs had ""significant implications"" for clothing makers. He noted that nearly all the clothing sold in the U.S. is imported, mainly from Asia.

Levi's, in its most recent annual report, said that in its last fiscal year, it got its products from manufacturers in nearly 30 nations. No more than 30% came from any one country, that report said. The company said it sourced products from North and South Asia, the Americas, including the United States, as well as Europe and Africa. And it said that of the items it sells in the U.S., ""less than 1% are directly sourced and manufactured in China.""

Even before Trump's announcement, Levi's had forecast falling sales for its fiscal year. In January, management said ""there continues to be a lot of uncertainty related to the macro environment, potential tariffs, changes in the tax code, as well as worsening foreign exchange.""

The stock is down some 34% over the past 12 months.

The retailer has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up — a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie & Fitch ANF and Gap GAP — despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.
As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

Shares of the company, down about 22% this year, rose about 2% in extended trading as Levi maintained its full-year forecasts for sales and profit, which did not account for any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

The retailer has seen demand for wide-legged and skinny jeans hold up — a trend in line with rivals such as Abercrombie & Fitch ANF and Gap GAP — despite shoppers being selective in spending on discretionary items.

The company's finance chief, Harmit Singh, has in the past noted that a diverse supply chain with sourcing from over 25 countries gave Levi an edge over other retailers at a time when tariff risks have hit footwear and apparel retailers from Nike NKE to Target TGT.

""The company's celebrity partnerships, marketing efforts, and strong product pipeline are helping it to win over shoppers despite growing uncertainty — which bodes well for its ability to navigate an increasingly challenging macro-environment,"" said eMarketer analyst Rachel Wolff.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1% for the three months ended March 2, from 58.8% last year, driven by lower product costs and a strong direct-to-consumer channel.

As part of its plan to streamline operations, Levi said last October it was exploring a sale of Dockers, which has seen demand struggle.

""Dockers is a business that we're currently in a competitive process to sell sometime in 2025,"" CFO Singh told Reuters.

The company's quarterly adjusted earnings came in at 38 cents per share, compared to estimates of 28 cents.

It posted a 3% rise in revenue from continuing operations to $1.53 billion, which excluded sales from its Dockers brand, now reclassified as a discontinued operation.

References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.
We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment.
Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income.","Operating margin was 12.5% compared to 0.04% in Q1 2024. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 400 basis points to 13.4% from 9.4% last year on a reported basis primarily due to higher gross margin.

Gross margin increased 330 basis points to 62.1% from 58.8% in Q1 2024 primarily driven by lower product costs and favorable channel and brand mix.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $749 million compared to $756 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted SG&A was up 1.7% to $744 million compared to $731 million last year. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A was 48.7% compared to 49.4% last year.

Restructuring charges were $7 million related to Project Fuel.

Interest and other expenses, net, which include foreign exchange losses, were $15 million in the aggregate compared to $12 million in Q1 2024.

The effective income tax rate was 20.6%, compared to 15.9% in Q1 2024.

Net income from continuing operations was $140 million compared to net loss from continuing operations of $10 million in Q1 2024. Adjusted net income was $150 million compared to $100 million in Q1 2024.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.35 compared to diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.03 in Q1 2024. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.38 compared to $0.25 in Q1 2024.

Additional information regarding Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share, Adjusted free cash flow as well as amounts presented on an organic net revenues basis and constant-currency basis, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, is provided at the end of this press release.

Cash and cash equivalents were $574 million, while total liquidity was approximately $1.4 billion.

Total inventories increased 7% on a dollar basis. We have secured the majority of inventory required to meet U.S. orders for Q2.

Shareholder Returns

The company returned approximately $81 million to shareholders in the first quarter, a 12% increase over prior year, including:

Dividends of $51 million, representing a dividend of $0.13 per share.

Share repurchases of $30 million, reflecting 1.6 million shares retired.

As of March 2, 2025, the company had $560 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration date.

The company has declared a dividend of $0.13 per share totaling approximately $51 million. The dividend is payable in cash on May 9, to the holders of record of Class A common stock and Class B common stock at the close of business on April 24.

Fiscal 2025 Guidance

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Investors should consider the information contained in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024 especially in the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"", ""Summary of Risk Factors"" and ""Risk Factors"" sections and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 2, 2025, especially in the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"", section. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this press release and related conference call may not occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated or, if no date is stated, as of the date of this press release and related conference call. The company is not under any obligation and does not intend to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained in this press release and related conference call to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this press release and related conference call or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even if such circumstances or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See ""RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES"" below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by segment on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025.

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by channel on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by brand on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted EBIT and Constant Currency Adjusted EBIT margin:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Discontinued Operations - Dockers®

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced we were undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives to the global Dockers® business, including a sale or other strategic transactions. During the first quarter of 2025, we commenced a sale process of the Dockers® business with the target of completing a transaction in fiscal year 2025. As of March 2, 2025, we determined the Dockers® business met held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria.

Levi Strauss said fiscal first-quarter revenue rose, boosted by the U.S. market, and kept its outlook for the year unchanged but excluded the impact of higher tariffs from its guidance.

The apparel retailer on Monday swung to a profit for the three months ended March 2 of $135 million, or 34 cents a share, from a loss of $10.6 million, or 3 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.

Stripping out one-time items, the company's earnings per-share came in at 38 cents. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast adjusted earnings of 28 cents.

""While we recognize that we are operating in an uncertain environment, our global footprint, strong margin structure, and agile supply chain position us to navigate the balance of the year and beyond,"" Chief Executive Michelle Gass said.

Revenue rose 3.1% to $1.53 billion, excluding $67 million of revenue from Dockers after being reclassified as a discontinued brand, and boosted by a 6% increase across its core Americas region. Overall, direct-to-consumer revenue increased 9%, while wholesale fell 3%. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast total revenue of $1.54 billion.

In the U.S., revenue rose 8% on an organic basis after logging high-single digit growth in both its direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses.

The company kept its outlook for fiscal 2025 unchanged, excluding the impact from President Trump's latest round of tariffs, but said it expects a minimal impact to its second-quarter outlook.

Levi's guidance also doesn't assume any significant worsening macro-economic pressure on the consumer.

The company expects a drop in full-year revenue of 1% to 2%, and adjusted earnings between $1.20 to $1.25.

Levi Strauss maintained its full-year 2025 guidance, projecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.25. This outlook includes an approximate $0.20 impact from foreign exchange and a higher tax rate but excludes any potential effects from recently announced tariffs.

The company’s gross margin expanded 330 basis points to 62.1%, driven by lower product costs and favorable channel and brand mix. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 400 basis points to 13.4%.

Levi Strauss returned approximately $81 million to shareholders in the first quarter, including $51 million in dividends and $30 million in share repurchases.

The slight dip in share price following the earnings release suggests investors may be focusing on the revenue miss and the tariff consideration exclusion in its outlook despite the strong bottom-line performance.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LeviStrauss_800x533_L_1602145503.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 17:08:16.789003

Fiscal 2025 Guidance

Guidance for 2025 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Financial results for prior periods have been recast to exclude discontinued operations.

The company’s fiscal 2025 guidance remains unchanged other than to reflect the Dockers® business as a discontinued operation and does not reflect any impact from the recently announced tariffs.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, recessionary concerns, supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions taken in response to such tariffs, or currency impacts. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, increased tariffs and retaliatory actions, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions or divestitures impacting the previous 12 months of the reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results are helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on April 7, 2025, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended March 2, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment from continuing and discontinued operations. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (""ROIC"") as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define earnings before interest and after taxes as Adjusted net income plus interest expense and income tax expense less an income tax adjustment. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by segment on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025.

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by channel on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

The table below sets forth the calculation of net revenues by brand on an organic net revenue basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted EBIT and Constant Currency Adjusted EBIT margin:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Constant-Currency Adjusted Net Income and Constant-Currency and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The table below sets forth the calculation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share on a constant-currency basis for the comparison period applicable to the three-month period ended March 2, 2025:

Discontinued Operations - Dockers®

In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced we were undertaking an evaluation of strategic alternatives to the global Dockers® business, including a sale or other strategic transactions. During the first quarter of 2025, we commenced a sale process of the Dockers® business with the target of completing a transaction in fiscal year 2025. As of March 2, 2025, we determined the Dockers® business met held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. The supplemental table below includes our 2024 results recast for continuing and discontinued operations.

In the last reported quarter, BK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily aided by a rise in fee revenues and net interest income (NII) alongside lower provisions and non-interest expenses. Also, higher assets under custody and/or administration and assets under management balances were positives.

BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 8.01%.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Quote

The consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.49 per share, which has been revised marginally downward over the past seven days. This indicates a rise of 15.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.73 billion, implying 4.5% growth.

Factors to Impact BNY Mellon’s Q1 Results

Fee Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fees (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.39 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for the metric is $2.37 billion.

The consensus mark for financing-related fees stands at $54.7 million, which suggests a 4.1% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $54.3 million.

The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $39 million, implying a 7.1% decline. Our estimate for the same is $41.6 million.

In the first quarter, foreign exchange (FX) trading activity was driven by heightened market volatility and increased hedging demand amid global economic uncertainties. Further, higher-for-longer interest rates and concerns regarding a potential trade war, given Donald Trump’s tariff policies, weakened the dollar. Thus, increased FX trading volumes are likely to have had a positive impact on BNY Mellon’s FX revenues, partially offset by a weak dollar performance. The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues stands at $181.8 million, suggesting a jump of 19.6%. Our estimate for the same is $176.5 million.

The consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is $3.44 billion, suggesting a rise of 4.1%. We project the metric to be $3.60 billion.

NII: The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during the first quarter of 2025 amid sticky inflation concerns. This is likely to have positively impacted BK’s NII during the first quarter, given relatively higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs.

Further, the yield curve steepened during the quarter due to economic uncertainties, which is likely to have offered further support for reinvestment yields.

However, a cautious stance regarding future rate cuts by the Fed and a tough operating backdrop is likely to have subdued the overall lending scenario to some extent. Per the latest Fed data, overall loan demand improved in the first two months of the quarter.

The consensus mark for NII is pegged at $1.12 billion, indicating an 8.1% year-over-year rise. We expect NII to be $1.08 billion.

Expenses: Because of higher restructuring charges and buyouts, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. In the first quarter, overall costs are expected to increase, driven by inflationary pressure, technology upgrades and a multi-year transformation plan.

Our estimate for non-interest expenses is $3.38 billion, suggesting a 6.3% year-over-year rise.

While President Donald Trump's tariffs will not have much direct impact on eateries, another pullback in consumer spending would hurt restaurants.

Fast-food chains have historically fared the best during economic downturns.

Restaurant stocks fell in morning trading Monday, fueled by investors' fears that a recession is coming.

U.S. stocks have tumbled for three consecutive days after President Donald Trump shocked the markets with high tariffs on goods imported from key trading partners. While analysts do not expect the tariffs to hit most restaurant companies directly, the inflation that is expected to follow would put pressure on consumers' wallets and could lead to an economic downturn.

""We view the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants as manageable, with a focus on select commodity costs, but see the bigger risk as incremental pressure on consumer spending and industry demand,"" UBS analyst Dennis Geiger wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Investor concerns hit restaurant stocks across all sectors.

Shares of Starbucks fell more than 2%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its stock sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.

""Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,"" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.

Money Report

Most of the world's coffee is grown in an equatorial region that spans Latin America, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa known as the Coffee Belt. Last week, Trump slapped higher tariffs on key coffee exporters like Vietnam, Brazil and Switzerland, where beans are roasted. Like bananas and vanilla, coffee production cannot be easily shifted to the U.S. because of high domestic demand and climate limitations.

Trade tensions also put Starbucks' international sales at risk. Consumers in China, the company's second-largest market, have boycotted Western brands previously for political reasons.

Casual dining chains also took a tumble. Shares of Dine Brands, which owns Applebee's and IHOP, sank nearly 3%, while rivals Darden Restaurants and Texas Roadhouse dropped less than 1% and 2%, respectively.

Fast-casual stocks, a recent favorite of investors, also slipped. Chipotle shares slid nearly 2%, Sweetgreen's stock fell 1% and shares of Wingstop sank less than 1%.

Fast-food stocks were not spared from Monday's declines. Shares of McDonald's, Restaurant Brands International and Yum Brands all dipped in morning trading.

Historically, fast-food chains have fared the best during recessions as diners seeking cheap meals trade down from full-service or fast-casual eateries to McDonald's or Taco Bell. But last year's pullback in consumer spending saw fast-food eateries hit hard. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and pared back their orders, while consumers with higher incomes stuck to their usual dining habits, leading to same-store sales declines for quick-service restaurants.",https://media.nbcdfw.com/2025/04/108106608-17404258302025-02-24t185956z_1297819252_rc261dagdmju_rtrmadp_0_starbucks-layoffs.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-04-07 17:08:50.964434

Dive Brief:

Visits to coffee chains of all sizes are up by 29% over the past five years, according to Placer.ai data. Small and medium-sized coffee brands have seen a disproportionate benefit, however, while industry titans like Starbucks and Dunkin’ lagged.

Small chain’s visit share rose from 3.2% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2024, while medium-sized brands, like BIGGBY Coffee and Dutch Bros, saw visit share grow from 10.8% to 17.6% in the same time.

Starbucks and Dunkin’s combined share of coffee visits remains vast — 77.9% according to Placer.ai — and visits have increased in absolute terms. But the erosion of visit share could signal vulnerability for coffee category leaders.

Dive Insight:

Consumer behavior at stores, rather than simple visit data, also sheds light on shifts in coffee’s competitive landscape.

Visits lasting longer than 10 minutes increased 13.4% at small coffee chains from 2023 to 2024, and fell at Dunkin and Starbucks by 8.9%, according to Placer.ai’s data. Short visits and long visits increased at medium-sized brands.

“Smaller coffee shops are increasingly filling the niche of a relaxed, destination-oriented experience,” Bracha Arnold, a content writer for Placer.ai, wrote in a post analyzing the data.

This consumer shift toward smaller and medium-sized chains as coffee-oriented “third places” could help explain why Starbucks, after years of emphasis on speed and throughput, is returning its focus to in-store experience under CEO Brian Niccol. That move may be necessary to preserve the brand’s position in the market from competition from smaller, more local-feeling coffee shops.

“These shifts highlight the different needs that coffee shops can fill within a community, with some offering speed and convenience, while others can meet the desire for a relaxed and personalized coffee experience,” Arnold wrote in the report.

Arnold noted that coffee traffic growth slowed in late 2024, which could signal a plateau in consumer demand.

Starbucks sources coffee from the three main regions that produce it: Latin America, Africa, and Asia/Pacific.
Asia is one of the regions with the highest tariffs, and Vietnam is one of Starbucks' top suppliers, now facing a 46% tariff on goods imported into the U.S.","Over the last few quarters, Starbucks has struggled with continuous sales declines and slower store traffic due to customers opting to get their morning cup of coffee at rival coffee shops instead.

One of the many complaints and reasons for this decline is consumers' dislike of Starbucks' prices, which tend to be higher than those of most coffee shops and have risen over the years due to inflation and extra charges for customizations.

Since taking over as Starbucks' CEO, Brian Niccol has emphasized the need to bring the company back to its roots by focusing on its core products, personalizing the coffee shop experience like it once did, and keeping prices from increasing.

""I made a commitment that we’d get back to Starbucks, focusing on what has always set Starbucks apart – a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and we serve the finest coffee handcrafted by our skilled baristas,"" said Niccol in an earnings call.

Starbucks' turnaround plan is threatened by tariffs

To return the business to growth, Starbucks (SBUX) developed a turnaround strategy that aims to improve customers' overall experience by redesigning stores, optimizing efficiency, prioritizing coffee quality, simplifying its menu, and keeping prices from elevating in 2025.

Starbucks has tried to freeze prices by eliminating extra charges for milk alternatives, reducing customization options, discontinuing menu items, and providing free refills for those who consume in stores.

However, President Donald Trump's new tariffs could make Starbucks' goal of price-freezing without risking further profit losses even more challenging.

President Trump announced in February that he would implement a 25% additional tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico, a 10% tariff on China, and a 10% levy.

However, on Apr. 2, President Trump declared that foreign trade and economic practices created a national emergency. He implemented new tariffs on products imported into the U.S. from many countries, including an additional 10% baseline tariff.

President Trump claims that these newly imposed tariffs aim to combat this concern by encouraging the production and purchasing of American-based products, which will increase competitive edge, protect sovereignty, and strengthen national and economic security.

Starbucks' main product faces challenges amid tariff implementations

Although Starbucks is an American company, most of its coffee is imported from over 30 different countries worldwide. Since more than 70 countries are coffee producers, only around 1% of all coffee consumed in the U.S. is made within the country.

Starbucks sources coffee from the three main regions that produce it: Latin America, Africa, and Asia/Pacific. Asia is one of the regions with the highest tariffs, and Vietnam is one of Starbucks' top suppliers, now facing a 46% tariff on goods imported into the U.S.

Many companies from all sectors are concerned about the negative financial repercussions the implementation of these tariffs could have on their businesses since some are highly dependent on imported goods from these select countries, including Starbucks, whose coffee beans make up around 10% to 15% of its production and distribution costs.

The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care.","Simply better health.

Dear fellow stockholders:

We help 185 million Americans live their healthiest lives possible. It is a privilege to lead CVS Health®, and more importantly, to work with our more than 300,000 colleagues to deliver simply better health.

Our job has never been more important: improve the well-being of individuals across the country by making health care more accessible, simple and aﬀordable. Our unmatched combination of businesses and extensive consumer reach uniquely position CVS Health to help deﬁne the future of health care.

I am honored to have been appointed president and chief executive oﬃcer in October 2024. In many roles throughout my 39 years in our industry, I've had none more meaningful than the one I have now, supporting our colleagues as they work to improve the health of millions of people.

The health care industry is challenging and complex, but our commitment to care never wavers. From ensuring a child had access to their anti-seizure medication during a hurricane, to supporting a member through a complex transplant surgery so they could attend their son's wedding… we are there for the moments that matter most. Each of our businesses plays a critical role in achieving our mission and supporting the health of Americans. Every day, we are working hard to become America's leading and most trusted health care company.

In 2024, we generated $372.8 billion in revenue and delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.66 with adjusted earnings per share of $5.42.* Despite the challenges last year, particularly in our Aetna® business, we advanced our strategy and achieved signiﬁcant milestones.

Health Care Beneﬁts

We took decisive actions to address the long-term sustainability of our Aetna business, including product design updates that support a strong, multi-year recovery, while oﬀering members the beneﬁts that matter most. We appointed new leadership at Aetna, including a new president, chief operating oﬃcer and chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer, and strengthened business processes to drive improved ﬁnancial performance, while increasing transparency and accountability.

Our Medicare Advantage Stars capabilities represent a strength of the Aetna business. In 2024, Aetna achieved exceptional Star Ratings with 88 percent of our Medicare Advantage members in plans rated at least 4 Stars, and more than two-thirds of members in plans rated at least 4.5 Stars. In addition, our commitment to outstanding service resulted in our highest-ever member experience score since the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services launched the Quality Bonus Stars Program in 2012.

Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness

CVS Pharmacy® is America's leading pharmacy. Our focus on consumer engagement, colleague experience and operational excellence enabled us to achieve a record retail pharmacy script share in 2024. We also continue to lead the shift to a more sustainable and transparent pharmacy market with the implementation of CVS CostVantage™.

We converted all commercial prescriptions dispensed through CVS Pharmacy to this innovative economic model as of January 1, 2025. CVS CostVantage brings clarity and simplicity to retail pharmacy - the most durable and frequent interaction in the health care journey - and ensures our pharmacies are appropriately compensated for the valuable clinical services they provide.

Health Services

Our Health Services segment consists of three key businesses: CVS Caremark®, Cordavis™ and Health Care Delivery. CVS Caremark drives aﬀordability of prescription drugs. Pharmacy Beneﬁt Managers (PBMs) are the only part of the drug supply chain whose role is to lower drug costs.

In fact, CVS Caremark members have an average out-of-pocket cost of less than $8 for a 30-day prescription. Economists have estimated that PBMs generate net value of over $100 billion per year for the U.S. health care system. Clients who fully transition to our new CVS Caremark TrueCost™ model ensure members see lower costs at the pharmacy counter, including the full pass-through of the rebates we generate from our negotiations with drug manufacturers. In 2025, we saw additional momentum as clients representing more than 75 percent of CVS Caremark commercial lives chose to implement two or more elements of the CVS Caremark TrueCost model.

We continue to transform the biosimilar market and improve access and aﬀordability of costly specialty medications. By establishing co-manufacturing capacity through Cordavis and collaborating with CVS Caremark and CVS Specialty® pharmacy, we successfully converted over 90 percent of eligible HUMIRA® patients to a low-cost biosimilar, delivering almost $1 billion of net savings for our clients. These savings demonstrate the power and potential of our integrated assets.

Our Health Care Delivery businesses achieved another year of solid growth in 2024, supported by integration points across CVS Health®. Signify Health® had a record year of In-Home Health Evaluations, including nearly doubling the number of Aetna® members served.

We continue to accelerate patient growth at Oak Street Health®, increasing the number of individuals enrolled in this best-in-class care model, including the number of Aetna members. We are also bringing together existing Oak Street Health and Signify Health care delivery capabilities for use more broadly across CVS Health to improve quality of care and better manage costs.

Our impact and value

Beyond our business, we take seriously our responsibility to make a positive impact on the people and communities we serve. Our Healthy 2030 approach outlines how we are paving the way for sustainability and working toward best practices in corporate responsibility.

I believe in our mission and strategy because I believe

in my colleagues. We take on the biggest challenges

in health care because we know we can solve them

in ways no one else can. We do our best work when people need us the most, and we show up every day to create a better health care experience.

I want to say thank you to our stockholders for your continued conﬁdence in CVS Health, and I thank my colleagues for giving you every reason to believe in our future.

PART I

Item 1. Business.

Overview

CVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, ""CVS Health,"" the ""Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us""), is a leading health solutions company building a world of health around every consumer it serves and connecting care so that it works for people wherever they are. As of December 31, 2024, we had more than 9,000 retail locations, more than 1,000 walk-in and primary care medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 90 million plan members and expanding specialty pharmacy solutions, and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than 800,000 patients per year. We serve an estimated more than 36 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (""PDP""). We are creating new sources of value through our integrated model allowing us to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs.

The Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other.

Business Strategy

We are building a world of health around every consumer we serve, seeking to make it easier and more affordable to live a healthier life. This means delivering solutions that are more personalized, simpler to use and increasingly digital so consumers can receive care when, where and how they desire. We address holistic health _ physical, emotional, social and economic _ and we are creating new sources of value through our integrated care model which allows us to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs. We believe our consumer-centric strategy will drive sustainable long-term growth and deliver value for all stakeholders.

Health Care Benefits Segment

The Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers, serving an estimated more than 36 million people as of December 31, 2024. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs and Medicaid health care management services. The Health Care Benefits segment's primary customers, its members, primarily access the segment's products and services through employer groups, government-sponsored plans or individually. The Health Care Benefits segment also serves customers who purchase products and services that are ancillary to its health insurance products.

Health Care Benefits Products and Services

The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as ""Insured"" and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk of medical and dental care costs) as ""ASC."" Health Care Benefits segment products and services consist of the following:

• Commercial Medical: The Health Care Benefits segment offers point-of-service (""POS""), preferred provider organization (""PPO""), health maintenance organization (""HMO"") and indemnity benefit (""Indemnity"") plans. Commercial medical products also include health savings accounts (""HSAs"") and consumer-directed health plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account (which may be funded by the plan sponsor and/or the member in the case of HSAs). Principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-site national, mid-sized and small employers, individual insureds and expatriates. The Company offers medical stop loss insurance coverage for certain employers who elect to self-insure their health benefits.

Now, all eyes are on key inflation data, Federal Reserve signals and Big Bank earnings as traders search for footing in a week that could redefine the market’s path forward.

Inflation and Tariffs in Focus

With global markets under intense scrutiny, investors are turning their attention to key economic reports this week, starting with Thursday’s release of the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Friday’s Producer Price Index (PPI), both critical gauges of inflation.

Wells Fargo economists predict that inflation will remain stable in March, continuing the trend of easing pressures observed in recent months. February’s CPI, in particular, surprised many with a sharper-than-expected drop, fueling optimism about moderating price increases.

As these reports loom, attention will also shift to the Federal Reserve’s March meeting minutes, set to be released on Wednesday.

Market participants will look for any hints regarding the central bank’s next moves on interest rates. Additionally, remarks from Fed officials in the coming days are expected to shed further light on the broader economic outlook.

Alongside inflation data, consumer sentiment and credit reports will offer a fuller picture of economic health. On Tuesday, the NFIB small business optimism index will provide insight into the confidence of one of the most vital segments of the U.S. economy.

Big Banks Kick Off Earning Season

The first-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week, with reports from major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon, scheduled for Friday.

JPMorgan Chase, the world’s largest bank by market capitalization, will set the tone for the sector.

Investors will be looking for updates on the bank’s strong performance from the previous quarter, which saw a surprising surge in profits driven by growth in investment banking revenue and net interest income.

On the same day, BlackRock will also report its earnings following a record-breaking quarter for assets under management.

Investors are particularly keen on updates on the firm’s ambitious $30 billion AI infrastructure initiative, which involves major partners like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Elon Musk’s xAI.

Other major earnings this week include Delta Air Lines on Wednesday, CarMax on Thursday and Levi Strauss and Cal-Maine Foods later in the week.

As investors closely monitor these reports, many will be looking for insights into how the broader economy—including the ongoing impacts of tariffs and inflation—is affecting various sectors.

Eyes on Gold and VIX

Gold (XAU/USD) saw modest buying near $2,972 early Monday, halting its pullback from last week’s record high.

Safe-haven demand was driven by global market turmoil following President Trump’s sweeping tariffs and continued buying by China’s central bank, which has now purchased gold for five consecutive months.

Falling Treasury yields—amid expectations the Fed may resume rate cuts—supported gold, while a weaker USD added to the metal’s appeal. However, long-position liquidation to cover broader market losses has capped upside momentum.

At the same time, the Volatility Index (VIX) surged by 50%, reaching 50 and breaching key resistance levels, signaling heightened market stress. The 10-year Treasury yield also fell sharply, dropping below 4.16% and nearing significant support at 3.90%.

The widening divergence between the VIX and Treasury yields highlights deepening concerns about market instability.

Both Gold and VIX will be key indicators to watch closely this week as they could signal further market movements.",https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/key-economic-indicators-markets-rattled-tariffs-us-inflation-big-bank-earnings_cropped.webp,N,,2025-04-07 12:15:30.477542

Chief Commercial Officer Matt Klein is also leaving and will be succeeded by insider Rana Ghosh.

The departures come as the carrier works to move away from its no-frills image and rebrand itself as a premium airline.

An interim office of the CEO, consisting of Chief Financial Officer Fred Cromer, Chief Operating Officer John Bendoraitis and General Counsel Thomas Canfield, will lead the company until a new chief is named.

Christie joined Spirit in 2012 as its finance chief and took the helm in 2019.

He guided the airline through the pandemic disruptions and a challenging period for low-cost carriers grappling with rising costs and a readiness among travelers to pay extra for a more comfortable journey as they pursued experiences.

The Florida-based carrier filed for bankruptcy protection last November, following years of losses and heavy debt, as well as failed merger attempts.

Spirit had been in merger talks with Frontier Group since at least 2022, but ended them in favor of a more attractive offer from rival JetBlue Airways.

Its merger with JetBlue was ultimately scrapped after a U.S. judge blocked it on anti-competition concerns.

Spirit, which has estimated that shift to premium would generate 13% more revenue per passenger, also plans to revamp its loyalty program and pursue alliances with other carriers.

Market Update

The Fed’s interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 have successfully cooled post-pandemic inflation, bringing it closer to the 2% target. Inflationary pressures have eased without tipping the economy into a recession, suggesting a soft landing. This stability, paired with recent rate cuts (0.5% in September 2024 and 0.25% in November 2024), fueled a strong year for the stock market in 2024. The markets surged further after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November, with major indices reaching record highs in the days following the election. Still, questions remain about the direction of economic policy, as potential tariffs and corporate tax changes add uncertainty for 2025.

Gross profit also fell from 28.58 million pounds to 23.06 million pounds, while operating profit lowered to 4.96 million pounds, a decrease on the 31.67 million pounds reported in 2023.
Michael Kors cited “general macroeconomic conditions” as the cause for the turnover decline, particularly in regards to a reduction in customer demand.
This came despite an increase in profit for the financial year, which rose from 39.72 million pounds to 66 million pounds.","The UK subsidiary of US brand Michael Kors, Michael Kors (UK) Limited, has announced plans to shutter five stores in the next fiscal year as macroeconomic conditions continue to impact consumer spending. The news was revealed in the firm’s latest annual report for the year ended 30 March 2024, filed with the UK’s Companies House.

While four stores will be closing permanently–including those in Newcastle, Milton Keyes, Manchester’s New Cathedral Street, and the concession in Harvey Nichols London–Michael Kor’s Regent Street store in London will be shuttering temporarily while “waiting for the relocation to a new near-by premises”.

In light of the plans, the company said that sales for FY25 are expected to decrease by 20 percent for both retail and e-commerce compared to 2024. Prices are also expected to drop in the “foreseeable future”, the report noted however, “in order to better meet consumer demand and counter competitors’ strategies on the market”.

Michael Kors cited “general macroeconomic conditions” as the cause for the turnover decline, particularly in regards to a reduction in customer demand. The company’s gross profit margin also fell in percentage compared to the previous year due to an “increase on markdowns aimed to push gross sales”.

This came despite an increase in profit for the financial year, which rose from 39.72 million pounds to 66 million pounds. This uptick reflected what the company said was the “sustainability” of the brand, where “despite the level of competition and the current challenges in the economic environment affecting the UK retail sector”, the UK subsidiary “continues to be a profitable business”.",https://r.fashionunited.com/r44SsYcn0xX28wMaGy-LAJDKeGFHDfk0XMwC9RtH2xg/resize:fit:1200:630:0/gravity:ce/quality:70/aHR0cHM6Ly9mYXNoaW9udW5pdGVkLmNvbS9pbWcvdXBsb2FkLzIwMjQvMDkvMjMvaW1hZ2UwMDAwMS02ZjlmZmo0ci0yMDI0LTA5LTIzLmpwZWc.jpeg,N,,2025-04-07 08:04:32.477214

JD Sports, Nike, and other retailers might pivot quickly, seeking new sourcing destinations to avoid trade barriers, reflecting larger economic shifts and adaptation needs.","What’s going on here?

JD Sports is facing a 6% share dip, sparking concerns over its heavy reliance on Nike and vulnerability to US tariffs.

What does this mean?

JD Sports Fashion is in a slump, with shares dropping over 18% in the past month. The unveiling of new tariffs by US President Donald Trump anticipated a hit, dragging the FTSE 100 down by 4%. For JD, the US market is crucial, representing nearly 40% of global sales, especially after acquiring the Hibbett chain. However, over-reliance on Nike – making up 45% of sales – ties JD’s fate closely to the sportswear giant. Soaring tariffs on goods sourced from China (54%) and Vietnam (46%) add to the pressure. These tariffs impact both JD’s branded items and those of suppliers like Adidas and On. Panmure Liberum analysts predict this setback might be shared among brands and retailers, possibly reducing sector volumes.

Why should I care?

For markets: Tariff tensions hurt investor confidence.

Investor concerns are valid as tariffs disrupt and weigh down companies with strong US ties like JD Sports. With the US market vital to its strategy and a heavy dependency on Nike, unforeseen tariff developments can sharply influence market sentiments.

The bigger picture: Supply chain strains reshape fashion's future.

More broadly, trade tensions and significant tariffs hint at a shift for global supply strategies across industries. JD Sports, Nike, and other retailers might pivot quickly, seeking new sourcing destinations to avoid trade barriers, reflecting larger economic shifts and adaptation needs.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-v9IgoNwzH2496kzeDQjVYyCT.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=c4f328e434f07e5f05d885fe70b5e0d0,N,,2025-04-07 10:05:50.299975

BROWN, Getty Images",,,,,https://www.thestreet.com/retail/formerly-bankrupt-retail-healthcare-chain-may-go-bankrupt-again,"One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy.
Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.
Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018.
As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023.
Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.","It's been a very tough time to be in the retail business. Thousands of stores nationwide been closed over the past two decades because of e-commerce adoption, and the situation has accelerated since Covid forced more consumers inside and online.

Once formidable major retailers like Sears have been shuttered, and even retail store chains considered essential like pharmacy's have been stung by shifting consumer trends as competition has intensified.

It has gotten even harder to eke out a living as a retailer since inflation skyrocketed in 2022, crimping budgets. Inflation has eased a bit since then, but prices are still climbing and cash-strapped consumers have largely rotated away from discretionary purchases that retailers rely on.

In February, the Consumer Price Index showed inflation had increased to 2.8% from 2.4% last September, raising concern that prices could reignite, something even more in focus following newly instituted tariffs on imports that add more price pressures.

Worse, fears of economic recession are mounting this year as unemployment climbs.

Altogether, the backdrop has created an environment where even the strongest retailers are struggling. Weaker retailers? Well, they're on the ropes.

A retail reckoning forces companies into bankruptcy

Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows retailers to pare expenses and debt, giving them wiggle room necessary for a shot at survival. However, bankruptcy remains a last resort for companies.

Bankruptcy protection means damaged relationships with suppliers, bankers, workers, and customers. As a result, suppliers may cut off retailers, banks may not lend money necessary to operate, and workers and customers may move on to greener pastures.

Nevertheless, sometimes bankruptcy is the only option. Increasingly, that's been true for many companies.

It may be hard to believe today, but Sears ran 700 stores when it filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Bed Bath & Beyond had 1,500 stores in 2018, but fewer than 300 in 2023 when it went bankrupt, and none are open anymore. Christmas Tree Shops operated more than 80 stores before all were closed when it went bankrupt.

The economy has certainly been a driving force behind the retail reckoning, but fierce competition hasn't helped.

Walmart, Target, and Costco Wholesale have all seen significant revenue growth over the past decade as they successfully leverage their size to offer consumers lower prices, and expand into new markets.

Walmart and Costco's revenue have risen to $681 billion and $254 billion in 2024 from $408 billion and $78 billion in 2010, respectively.

One retail industry disrupted by big-box retail and new competition is retail pharmacy. Particularly hard hit has been Rite Aid.

In addition to fending off larger department stores, the national chain counted on by millions for essentials from toothpaste to prescriptions has also lost market share due to upstarts like Mark Cuban's CostPlus Drug Company, a low cost mail order pharmacy, and Hims, a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based telehealth platform.

Rite Aid enters, exits bankruptcy but woes remain

Rite Aid spent a lot of money acquiring rival pharmacies, including Brooks, in a bid to keep pace with Walgreens and CVS Health. The spending accelerated its retail footprint, but also saddled it with a mountain of debt that needed to be refinanced at higher rates when it came due.

The weight of its debt was already taking a toll before Covid struck. It attempted to sell itself to Walgreens in 2015, but the deal was revised after the U.S. government objected for antitrust concerns. Walgreens wound up buying 1,932 Rite Aid stores and three distribution centers for $4.38 billion in 2018. A deal to sell itself to Albertsons was also scuttled in 2018.

Rite Aid continued to try to find a buyer but by 2022, when the Fed hiked interest rates, making debt refinancing more costly, it was in dire straights.

The final blow came in March 2023. The Department of Justice filed a civil suit against Rite Aid alleging pharmacists “repeatedly filled prescriptions for controlled substances with obvious red flags"" and that Rite Aid ""intentionally deleted internal notes about suspicious prescribers.”

Similar suits had previously been settled by Walgreens and CVS Health for $5.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, figures that Rite Aid couldn't match.

As a result, Rite Aid officially filed for Chapter 11 restructuring on October 15, 2023. While in bankruptcy, it cut deals with lenders, closed over 500 stores, roughly a quarter of its locations, and settled the Justice Department's suit for $7.5 million and an unsubordinated, general unsecured claim of $401.8 million.

The company exited bankruptcy in September 2024, saying at the time it ""has successfully completed its financial restructuring and emerged from Chapter 11, marking a new beginning as a stronger company with a rightsized store footprint, more efficient operating model, significantly less debt, and additional financial resources.”

Unfortunately, the restructuring may not have been enough to guarantee Rite Aid's success, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The WSJ said on April 4 that Rite Aid's management is seeking buyers again and contemplating another bankruptcy filing. Reportedly, Rite Aid is exploring its options with law firm Paul Weiss.

There's no telling what might happen to Rite Aid's remaining 1,300 stores if it sells itself or enters bankruptcy protection again. It's certainly possible more stores will close, leaving additional customers in the lurch, searching for a new pharmacy.

One potential option may be to follow in Walgreens footsteps. In March, the nation's second largest retail pharmacy chain agreed to sell itself to private equity player Sycamore Partners in a deal worth about $10 billion.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjEzNDE2MDQzMzk2MjEyMTc1/gettyimages-1130947807.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 22:59:13.344686

(GADC), or McDonald’s Philippines, plans to invest at least ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion this year to open more than 65 stores, with the aim of reaching 1,000 stores in two years.

This comes as GADC Founder and Chairman George T. Yang said they will embark on an accelerated growth path for the quick-service restaurant (QSR) giant after McDonald’s Corp. of the United States (US) granted Yang and his son, GADC President and CEO Kenneth S. Yang, a fresh 20-year franchise for the Philippines.

“This 2025, We will be opening our 800th store,” said the younger Yang. McDonald’s opened 65 stores last year and ended 2024 with a network of 792 stores nationwide.

In a media interview, GADC’s CEO said, “We will continue to build new restaurants all over the Philippines. We grow through our company-owned stores as well as through our franchise restaurants.”

“For this year, most likely, we should grow about the same as what we did last year, which is 65 stores. Hopefully we will surpass it,” said Yang.

Since 65 new stores in a year was an all-time high for the company, he said, “This 2025, we aim to break our record new store openings.”

While expansion will be nationwide, Yang said most of the new stores will be outside the National Capital Region (NCR)—in cities in southern and northern Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

“We see our growth coming from areas outside of NCR that have rapidly been developing. We’re excited to open more stores and bring McDonald’s closer to more Filipinos,” Yang said.

He noted that, “The country is growing and there is progress in these areas so that is where we will be going.”

He said that they will likely maintain the current ratio of 55 percent company-owned stores and 45 percent franchise outlets.

Yang said they spent around ₱3 billion to ₱5 billion for the renovation of older restaurants and construction of new ones, and capital expenditures (capex) this year should at least be equal or higher.

In 2005, McDonald’s Philippines became a 100-percent Filipino-owned company with George and Kenneth Yang as its majority owners and tycoon Andrew Tan’s Alliance Global Group Inc. as its investment partner.

This strategic move paved the way for the company to look towards a digitally led future, underpinned by growing demand for seamless omni-channel customer experience.

The company extended its reach by growing its delivery business through digital initiatives. It was the first QSR to have an online delivery channel in 2009 and the first to launch a delivery app in 2014.

Too Rich for the Middle Class?

The official story points to India’s economic slowdown. There is ongoing inflation, wages are flat, and consumers – especially the urban middle class – are feeling the squeeze. Spending has cooled off after a post-pandemic boom fueled by easy credit and pent-up demand. People are tightening their belts, and fancy lattes are often the first to go.

But there’s a deeper story brewing. Starbucks isn’t just bumping into macroeconomic headwinds; it’s facing a shift in how Indian consumers think about value, brand, and everyday indulgence.

Starbucks is still seen as an upscale brand in big cities – a place to show off, not chill out. In smaller cities, it’s often seen as out of reach. A masala chai at ₹ $320 ($3.70) is a tough sell when the same drink costs a tenth of that at a local stall. Even with localized menu items and smaller cup sizes, Starbucks hasn’t quite cracked the code of cultural fit and pricing perception.

Age-appropriate and Cheaper Choices

Meanwhile, homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave are quietly winning the loyalty of India’s younger, more discerning coffee drinkers. They offer craft brews, Instagram-ready interiors, and a price that doesn’t sting. Starbucks’ joint venture with Tata says it’s still committed to hitting the 1,000-store goal maybe a year later. But the real challenge isn’t timing.

India’s middle class is evolving, not just growing. Brand alone isn’t enough as consumers want quality, authenticity, and value all at once.

Nevertheless, Starbucks isn’t pulling out. But to grow in India, it may need to rethink more than its store count. It might need to rethink its role entirely.

That being said, you can find a dozen eggs for under $5 in most grocery stores. If you join a warehouse club like Costco or Sam’s Club, you might even be able to get a better deal.

It’s easy to understand why people do not like seeing the price of everyday staples go up. In reality, however, most families probably eat no more than a couple of dozen eggs a week.

If they eat the full two dozen, let’s say that their expenses increase by basically five dollars per week. That’s $260 a year.

Admittedly, eggs are not the only staple that has increased in price, which is causing many Americans to feel the pinch of inflation and higher prices.

Spending more at the grocery store each week is death by 1,000 paper cuts, which is a painful way to die.

But if you suffer one giant cut, the reality is you’re just as dead. Americans have some options to buy food produced in this country that won’t be impacted by tariffs.

Certain staples like coffee, well, almost certainly increase, but even there, there are options, at least if all you want is a caffeine fix. When it comes to electronics, there are no options.

You can’t get an iPhone, a laptop, a television, or most appliances that come from US manufacturers. And admittedly, unlike eggs, you can put off upgrading your phone or buying a new television.

At some point, however, whether it’s your washing machine, your refrigerator, your smart phone, or whatever type of computer you might use, something will break. When that happens, you are going to face a reality that’s going to be very painful.

That’s something Best Buy’s CEO is warning consumers and investors about.

Best Buy buys from China and Mexico

Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Sue Barry did not pull any punches when it came to discussing tariffs during the electronics retailer's fourth-quarter earnings call.

""Against this backdrop, I need to pause a moment to address the topic of tariffs. International trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronics supply chain is highly global, technical, and complex. China and Mexico remain the No. 1 and No. 2 sources for products we sell, respectively,"" she shared.

The CEO also made it clear that tariffs would be passed on to the retailer, which would then have to pass them onto consumers.

""While Best Buy only directly imports 2% to 3% of our overall assortment, we expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,"" she shared.

Barry admitted that she does not have all the answers.

""This is because it is a highly dynamic situation, with uncertainty about the duration, timing, amount, and countries involved, in addition to the potential action of others in the industry, as well as the potential reaction of American consumers,"" she said.

Best Buy, American consumers face higher prices

Best Buy does have flexibility on some products and Barry wanted to make it clear that it will be actively looking to offset the increased costs as much as possible.

""I want to stress that our deeply tenured and talented teams are experienced at operating in volatile conditions, and this is also a situation where our partnerships with vendors are extremely valuable. We intend to execute the strategic plan we set for this year while navigating the tariff environment,"" she added.

CFO Matthew Bilunas made it clear, or at least as clear as someone speaking in financial terms could, that consumers will pay more.

""We're assuming in this estimation that a material portion of the costs are passed on to us by the vendors and then either, that's either directly broken out or blended in with the higher COGS (cost of goods sold) or through some level of promotional positioning. Of course, you know, we prefer not to raise prices. But because of the higher COGS, we need to enact some price increases, and that is going to vary based on product category, SKUs, competitive environment, and other factors,"" he shared.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgxMzEzMDc1NDYxMjM1ODE1/best-buy.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 12:11:43.530339

The president himself is determined to impose higher prices on his citizens, even though many Americans have now realized the truth of tariffs and that we will all be responsible for paying for them. Even though equities in the tech, automotive, and other sectors have declined, the former reality TV star’s most recent announcement was concerning from a fashion perspective.

Trump’s tariffs are having a much bigger impact than expected on Nike

Trump’s most recent list includes nations that produce clothing, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which are presumably further down the alphabet than Denmark, the European Union, and Greenland. Besides Nike, huge companies like Adidas and Puma source their supplies from the two nations listed, and Trump’s decision has caused their stock market value to plummet like a driverless Tesla into the Hudson River. Following the announcement of the news, shares of Skechers, Deckers, and Crocs also declined.

On Wednesday, the United States levied reciprocal tariffs of 46% on Vietnamese goods, 49% on Cambodian goods, 34% on Chinese goods, 32% on Indonesian goods, and 36% on Thai goods. Although Nike’s stock is still steady for the time being, analysts believe that the American brand will decline soon because it also depends significantly on imports from the aforementioned countries. Nike itself anticipates a more than 10% decline in revenue in the upcoming quarter, according to CNBC, and their figures are significantly worse than those of analysts.

Finance director Matt Friend anticipates that Nike’s initiatives will have the most impact in the fourth quarter, with revenue and gross margin headwinds projected to moderate. The corporation is also dealing with external challenges such as geopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, variable foreign exchange rates, and tax rules, all of which may influence consumer confidence.

Besides Nike, American Eagle, and Wayfair could also be impacted due to Trump’s tariffs

Brands and retailers have shifted some or all of their production out of China and are now using Vietnam to manufacture everything from couches to sneakers. For many years, businesses wishing to stay out of the crossfire of U.S. trade conflicts with Beijing turned to China’s southern neighbor. They are now unable to avoid President Donald Trump as he broadens his trade war globally. As part of a new round of international tariffs announced Wednesday, Trump declared he would impose a 46% levy on Vietnamese products.

Major companies in the clothing, furniture, and toy industries may soon see cost rises as a result, and some of them may boost prices for customers. On April 9, the Vietnam tariffs go into force. Donald Trump announced a new round of international tariffs on Wednesday, including a 46% duty on Vietnamese imports. This may soon result in cost rises for large companies in the toy, furniture, and clothing industries, some of which may raise prices for customers. On April 9, the tariffs on Vietnam go into force.

Moreover, Mexico overtook China as the largest supplier of commodities to the United States in 2023, after China had been the leading exporter for more than 20 years. Government statistics from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative show that, with $438.9 billion in products sold in 2024, China is now the second-largest supplier to the United States. Vietnam has also grown in popularity as a destination for businesses seeking to diversify their manufacturing sources and lower the risks associated with trade disputes with China.",https://pedirayudas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Nike.jpg,N,,2025-04-06 12:11:47.825213

It is evident that the future of Starbucks cups continues to evolve to meet new market demands.","Starbucks is one of the most well-known and beloved coffee chains in the United States. With thousands of stores across the country, the company has kept enormous popularity over the years. Its success lies in a varied offering of beverages and a service that aims to be quick and efficient.

However, behind every cup they sell, there are small details that often go unnoticed. An example of this is, for instance, the measurement marks that allow baristas to prepare drinks with precision.

This Is the Change That Starbucks Has Already Implemented in the United States

For years, Starbucks cups included black marks on their sides. These lines were not just decorative, as some might think. Their function was very practical: they allowed employees to measure the ingredients of each drink accurately.

Each line on the tall, grande, and venti cups marked a precise amount of liquid. This facilitated the quick and efficient preparation of popular drinks like the iced chai tea latte. Thus, Starbucks baristas didn't need external measuring tools, which optimized the service.

However, recently, Starbucks made an important change: it modified the marks to a more visible design. The new cups feature white and black lines, which improve visibility in both light and dark beverages. Additionally, these cups include raised dots to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals.

This change wasn't the only one. Starbucks implemented opaque paper cups in 14 states in the United States, removing the measurement marks. The company also opted for compostable cups and lids made of the same material, reducing its use of plastic.

The transition has caused divided opinions among customers. While some applaud Starbucks's effort to promote a more sustainable change, others lament the loss of the transparent cups. Customers can no longer see their drink—and what's left of it in the cup—as they did before.

Despite the criticism it has received, Starbucks continues to bet firmly on innovation and continuous improvement. The company keeps seeking a balance between functionality and sustainability. So, although some customers may take time to adapt to the new designs, it is likely that over time they will get used to the modifications.

It is evident that the future of Starbucks cups continues to evolve to meet new market demands. The brand continues to stand out for its ability to adapt and stay at the forefront, establishing itself as a leader in innovation within the sector.",https://edatv.news/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-de-fotos-de-starbucks-con-bandera-estados-unidos-al-lado_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-04-06 09:01:53.922466

In an interview with The Financial Times, Sunil D’Souza, Chief Executive of Tata Consumer Products, said Starbucks opened only ""a little over half"" the 30 stores it had targeted for the December quarter. “We saw traffic dropping,” D’Souza said. “So I told my team, let’s moderate a bit. We’ll continue to grow and we’re still opening outlets, but we’ve slowed it down momentarily.”

Starbucks opened a net 16 stores in the three months through December, bringing the total to 473 across 74 Indian cities — well below the post-pandemic record of 29 store additions in the January-March quarter last year.

India, though traditionally a tea-drinking nation, has seen a boom in speciality cafés in recent years, led by homegrown brands like Blue Tokai and Third Wave Coffee, alongside global entrants such as Tim Hortons, Pret A Manger, and Costa Coffee. The report said this surge in new-age coffee brands, coupled with changing urban preferences, is reshaping how Indians consume beverages outside the home.

In response to growing competition and evolving consumer preferences, Starbucks has been actively tweaking its India playbook. The report said the coffee chain introduced smaller ""Picco"" cup sizes, a milky short masala chai priced at Rs320, and food items like chilli paneer sandwiches — part of its effort to blend international appeal with Indian flavours.

To make its cafés more inviting in smaller cities, the company also moved away from darker, high-end interiors to lighter colours that signal affordability and accessibility.

D’Souza said in the interview that in non-metro markets, many consumers still view the brand as premium. “Often we’ve heard that people are not entering because they see this as... a luxury,” he said.

Despite the slowdown, Tata Consumer remains optimistic about Starbucks’ long-term potential in India. “There’s a long runway — it’s just that in a country like India, you’ve got to have a slightly longer perspective,” D’Souza said. He added that the 1,000-store goal still stands, though the timeline “might go up or down by a year.”

During its third quarter investor call, the company said affordability-focused efforts are gaining traction, even as demand pressures persist. The report said Tata Starbucks clocked 8% year-on-year sales growth in the December quarter, with a 10% sequential rise. Expansion picked up in East India, with new stores in Patna, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Bilaspur, and Gangtok.

To improve local relevance, the company introduced a “classic menu” tailored to Indian taste preferences. Initial trials showed promising repeat purchases, the company noted. It also launched a Diwali 360-campaign with a media reach of over 40 million, and introduced Monsoon Malabar — a reserve small-lot coffee developed exclusively for the Indian market.

Globally too, Starbucks has hit a rough patch. The report noted the company has seen four straight quarters of declining same-store sales, weighed down by slowing footfall in both the US and China — its two largest markets. In China, it has been undercut by faster-growing rivals like Luckin Coffee.",https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2025-04-06%2Fzz6jbkqa%2Fhiroko-nishimura-SiSLeFTr5Cg-unsplash.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,N,,2025-04-06 06:01:14.403466

Summary of the day so far

Here is a summary of the latest developments so far:

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity. “We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post’, but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

Trump’s 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes. The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled. Australia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are also among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff.

The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT). Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week – including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the US in April as it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to spend the weekend speaking to foreign leaders about the tariffs, after calls with the prime ministers of Australia and Italy on Friday in which the leaders agreed that a trade war would be “extremely damaging”.

Downing Street said that Starmer had “been clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest”. A spokesperson said officials will “calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate”.

Ralph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that “action taken by the US government is completely illogical”. He added: “It will damage the United States itself.”

The Italian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a “de-escalation” with the US. “We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. “For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people”, the ministry said.

Nissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.

The president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

“Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,” the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods. Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation. Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”. MoveOn, one of the organisations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labour, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

Some 1,200 demonstrations are planned across the U.S. on Saturday in what organizers expect to be the largest single day of protest against president Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.

Thousands were streaming into downtown Washington as the protests got underway. Organisers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend the rally at the National Mall.

The protests in the U.S. will give Trump opponents an opportunity to demonstrate their displeasure en masse in response to Trump’s raft of executive orders.

Some 150 activist groups have signed up to participate, according to the event’s website. Protests are planned in all 50 states plus Canada and Mexico.

Protesters were lining the busy thoroughfare of Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C., awaiting buses to take them downtown. They were carrying signs with slogans such as “No Kings in the USA” and “Deport Musk.”

Terry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among hundreds who gathered early in front of the stage below the Washington Monument.

She said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump’s policies on “everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education. I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is.”

David Madden, a 75-year old Army veteran and retired trial lawyer, said he flew from Dayton, Ohio, to demonstrate against “the injustice that is dominating this country, the institutions that are being stolen from the American people, the confusion in the courts, the fact that we have a population that I believe is essentially racist.”

Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs are roiling global financial markets, with stocks tumbling across the board from New York to London.

Wall Street suffered its worst week since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis five years ago as investors worldwide balked at the US president’s risky bid to overhaul the global economy with the vast tariffs.

Experts are all but unanimous that the impact on global growth of Wednesday’s extraordinary Rose Garden press conference will be negative – but just how bad remains highly uncertain.

Here are the key stories at a glance:

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the US for a month as it considers how to mitigate the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The 25% tariff imposed by the US on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April.

A JLR spokesperson said: “The USA is an important market for JLR’s luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans.”

JLR, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, is one of Britain’s biggest producers, selling 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually.

Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales and JLR is at the centre of Britain’s car industry, accounting for £1 in every £8 of the country’s exports.

The Sunday Times reported that JLR is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs. Shipping vehicles across the Atlantic takes about 21 days.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in central London as part of global demonstrations against Donald Trump’s administration.

Crowds gathered in Trafalgar Square on Saturday afternoon with banners which read “No to Maga hate” and “Dump Trump”.

The rally is one of hundreds of so-called “hands off” demonstrations around the world – including in cities across the US, Paris and Berlin.

The movement has been organised by more than 150 groups, including civil rights groups and trade unions.

A 25% levy on all foreign cars imported into America came into force on Thursday, and a wider “baseline” 10% tariff on goods imported from around the world kicked in on Saturday morning.

Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron discussed their “concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia” in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs, Starmer’s office said.

The UK’s prime minister spoke to the French president on Saturday, the latest in a series of calls with world leaders following the announcement of the US levies.

Issuing a readout of the call, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister spoke with President Macron following this week’s announcement that the US will impose additional tariffs. They agreed that a trade war was in nobody’s interests but nothing should be off the table and that it was important to keep business updated on developments.

“The prime minister and president also shared their concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia.

“Following discussions between military planners in Ukraine this week, they discussed the good progress that has been made on the Coalition of the Willing.

“The prime minister and president agreed to stay in close contact over the coming weeks.”

Summary of the day so far

Here is a summary of the latest developments so far:

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity. “We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post’, but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

Trump’s 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes. The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled. Australia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are also among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff.

The initial 10% “baseline” tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT). Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week – including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will “pause” shipments to the US in April as it works to “address the new trading terms” of Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to spend the weekend speaking to foreign leaders about the tariffs, after calls with the prime ministers of Australia and Italy on Friday in which the leaders agreed that a trade war would be “extremely damaging”.

Downing Street said that Starmer had “been clear the UK’s response will be guided by the national interest”. A spokesperson said officials will “calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate”.

Ralph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that “action taken by the US government is completely illogical”. He added: “It will damage the United States itself.”

The Italian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a “de-escalation” with the US. “We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,” Giorgetti said.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. “For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.

China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should “stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China’s economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people”, the ministry said.

Nissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.

The president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

The stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China’s DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Donald Trump’s policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signaled little concern about the ongoing nosedive, reports Reuters.

“For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

“If I were to analyse in my old hat, and this is the only time I’m going to talk about it … what’s happening with the market I’d say it’s more a Mag 7 problem, not a Maga problem,” Bessent, who ran a hedge fund until being tapped as treasury secretary by Trump, said.

“Mag 7” refers to the shares of the “Magnificent 7” – a group of seven high-performing tech stocks that had helped drive the market higher before its recent selloff. Maga refers to Trump’s “Make America great again” political slogan.

US stocks have tumbled by about 10% in the two days after Trump announced a new global tariff regime that was more aggressive than analysts and investors had been anticipating.

It is a drop that market analysts and large investors themselves have laid at the feet of Trump’s aggressive push on tariffs, which most economists and the head of the Federal Reserve believe risk stoking inflation and damaging economic growth, reports Reuters.

Stocks did take a hit in late January when Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a free AI assistant that it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent services. It resulted in a record one-day loss of nearly $600bn in value from the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia, one of the “Magnificent 7”. But the market soon found its footing again and by mid-February, the benchmark S&P 500 index had regained a record-high level.

Then stocks turned south again starting in late February after a widely followed survey of consumers showed households growing broadly pessimistic about the economy’s prospects and fearful that Trump’s push for tariffs would drive up inflation, reports Reuters.

A raft of other surveys of businesses and consumers since then have flagged similar concerns, and other data has shown the pace of activity has slowed over the course of the first quarter of 2025. The S&P has lost nearly 14% since 19 February, and nearly $10tn of US stock market value has been erased.

The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has been dismissive of the drop as well.

Trump himself on Friday retweeted a social media post bearing the caption “Trump is Purposely CRASHING The Market” and featuring images of the president pointing at a large downward red arrow and of him signing executive orders at the White House.

Meanwhile, Bessent also told Carlson the administration retains a “strong dollar” policy and dismissed assertions by some analysts that the tariff drive was a deliberate effort to weaken the dollar to make US goods more competitive on global markets.

“No one should listen to anyone in the markets talk about the US dollar other than President Trump or myself,” Bessent said. “We are the only ones that speak for this administration, the United States government on dollar policy.”

“We have a strong-dollar policy and we are putting in all of the necessary ingredients to make sure the dollar is strong over the long run,” he said.

The dollar has shed nearly 6% of its value against major trading partners’ currencies since Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, reports Reuters.

'Hang tough, it won’t be easy': Trump defiant on tariffs

Donald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity.

The comments came as the US president’s widest-ranging tariffs took effect in a move that could trigger retaliation and escalating trade tensions that could upset the global economy.

“We have been the dumb and helpless ‘whipping post,’ but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.

“This is an economic revolution, and we will win,” he added. “Hang tough, it won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic.”

A 10% “baseline” tariff came into place just after midnight, hitting most US imports except goods from Mexico and Canada as Trump invoked emergency economic powers to address perceived problems with the country’s trade deficits.

The trade gaps, said the White House, were driven by an “absence of reciprocity” in relationships and other policies like “exorbitant value-added taxes”.

Come 9 April, about 60 trading partners – including the European Union, Japan and China – are to face even higher rates tailored to each economy.

Already, Trump’s sharp 34%tariff on Chinese goods, to kick in next week, triggered Beijing’s announcement of its own 34% tariff on US products from 10 April.

Beijing also said it would sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and restrict the export of rare-earth elements used in high-end medical and electronics technology.

“China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close,” Trump said in his post. “They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly.”

But other major trading partners held back as they digested the unfolding international standoff amid fears of a recession.

Leading garment producer Bangladesh holds crisis talks on US tariffs

Bangladesh’s interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a “massive blow” to the key industry, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Textile and garment production accounts for about 80% of exports in Bangladesh, and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hard hit in a revolution that toppled the government last year.

Donald Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.

Bangladesh exports $8.4bn of garments annually to the US, according to data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the national trade body. That totals about 20% of Bangladesh’s total ready-made garments exports, reports afp.

“Chief adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus has convened an emergency meeting … to discuss the US tariff issue,” a government statement read, with the meeting to take place late Saturday in the capital, Dhaka. Top experts, advisers and officials will attend, it added.

Bangladesh’s tax authority, the National Board of Revenue, is also expected to meet to review the fallout from the tariffs.

Rakibul Alam Chowdhury, chair of RDM Group, a major manufacturer with an estimated $25m turnover, said on Thursday that the industry would lose trade. “Buyers will go to other cost-competitive markets – this is going to be a massive blow for our industry,” he said.

Several garment factories produce clothing for the US market alone, report AFP. Anwar Hossain, administrator of the BGMEA, has told AFP that the industry was “not ready” for the tariff impact.

Bangladesh, the second-largest producer after China, manufactures garments for global brands – including for US firms such as Gap Inc, Tommy Hilfiger and Levi Strauss.

Anti-Trump protests expected in US today

Kira Lerner

Away from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”.

MoveOn, one of the organizations planning the day of protest they’re calling Hands Off along with dozens of labor, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.

“This is shaping up to be the biggest single-day protest in the last several years of American history,” Ezra Levin, a founder of Indivisible, one of the groups planning the event, said on a recent organizing call.

The largest event is expected to be on the National Mall in Washington DC, where members of Congress, including the Democrats Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, are scheduled to speak to crowds.

China has said “the market has spoken” in rejecting Trump’s tariffs, and called on Washington for “equal-footed consultation” after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.

Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most U.S. trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.

Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the U.S. duty-free.

This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34% on all U.S. goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan told public broadcaster RTHK, however, Hong Kong would not impose separate countermeasures, citing the need for the city to remain “free and open”.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said:

The market has spoken.

Now is the time for the U.S. to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, says he is prepared to dance if it means sidestepping some of the worst of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Last week he sent a letter to India’s president, Droupadi Murmu, urging her to join him in a tango to celebrate 75 years of ­bilateral trade.

Xi said it was “the right choice” for the two countries to be “partners of mutual achievement and realise the ‘Dragon-Elephant Tango’”, which, he added, “fully serves the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples.”

Beijing is on a wide-ranging charm offensive, aimed at redirecting its exports away from the US to other willing destinations as Washington erects trade barriers.

Tariffs on China imposed by the US president amounting to 20% earlier this year were more than doubled last week to 54% and an effective average rate of 65%, raising the cost of Chinese imports to a level that many analysts believe will be uncompetitive.

The response from Beijing was swift. A sell-off on financial markets intensified after China’s finance ministry said it would respond in kind, adding 34% to the tariff on all US goods from 10 April.

Investors worry that a recession in the US cannot be ruled out as the trade war intensifies and companies hunker down, cutting investment and jobs to weather the storm.

John Denton, head of the International Chambers of Commerce, likens the onset of these tariff wars to the oil shock of the 1970s, such is its seismic importance. “The overriding theme is the battle for supremacy between China and the US for global trade dominance,” he said.

Jaguar Land Rover will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month, as it considers how to mitigate the cost of president Donald Trump’s 25% tariff, according to a report in the Times newspaper.

Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters on Saturday.

A pause in shipments would add to fears over the impact from tariffs on the UK’s car industry, which employs 200,000 people directly. The US is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with nearly a 20% share, data from industry body SMMT shows, reports Reuters.

Jaguar Land Rover, one of the UK’s biggest producers by volume, sells 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually. Exports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales.

The US 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April. The previous day, Trump announced tariffs on other goods from countries across the globe, upending world trade.

The Times said that Jaguar Land Rover is thought to have a couple of months’ supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs.

Taiwan president Lai Ching-te met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan’s global competitiveness and safeguard its interests, reports Reuters.

President Donald Trump announced across-the-board import tariffs on Wednesday with much higher duties for dozens of trading partners, including Taiwan, which runs a large trade surplus with the US and is facing a 32% duty on its products. The US tariffs, however, do not apply to semiconductors, a major Taiwanese export.

Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to “the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy”, his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.

Lai “hopes to give industry the greatest support, stabilise the economic situation, ensure Taiwan’s industry’s global competitiveness, and safeguard our country’s national interests and the continued steady progress of our economy”, Kuo said.

Taiwan is home to TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and an important supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment on whether it attended the meeting. TSMC is in its quiet period ahead of first quarter earnings announcement on 17 April.

On Friday, Taiwan’s government announced T$88bn ($2.67bn/£2.07bn) in financial help for companies and industries to deal with the impact of the US tariffs.

Taiwan, which says the tariffs are unreasonable, has said it will discuss them with the US and has not announced any retaliatory tariffs.

US president Donald Trump has long been an advocate of tariffs – once describing them as the most beautiful word in the dictionary – and his promise to impose them was a central plank of his presidential election campaign. In anticipation, Downing Street developed a defensive strategy that revolved around building a strong relationship with Trump’s White House – despite clear political differences – and launching talks to strike an economic deal that would secure tariff exemptions.

Trade talks between the UK and US began soon after Trump’s inauguration, before the prime minister visited Washington in February, with the goal of agreeing a relatively narrow deal focused on advanced technologies. Talks intensified before UK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds’ own visit to meet Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, just over two weeks ago.

UK officials were assured by their US counterparts that they were in a strong position to negotiate a trade deal with Washington. “By then we knew what the faultlines were, and we were broadly there, so we just had some details to thrash out,” an official said.

The two key figures leading the negotiations are Reynolds and Varun Chandra, a corporate strategist turned senior No 10 aide known as the prime minister’s “business whisperer”. Officials have been impressed by how Chandra has navigated the US administration. “He just gets them, and they get him. The talks have been much more corporate in tone than trade negotiations usually are. That’s his world,” one said.

A senior trade department official, Kate Joseph, and Keir Starmer’s economic international affairs adviser, Michael Ellam, have been working behind the scenes at home to get the Whitehall machine ready. Multiple scenarios were drawn up depending on what tariff regime Trump imposed.

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.

This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.97%.

For the most recent quarter, U.S. Bancorp was expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share, but it reported $1.07 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.94%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1 per share, while it actually produced $1.03 per share, a surprise of 3%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For U.S. Bancorp, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

U.S. Bancorp has an Earnings ESP of +1.57% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 16, 2025.

With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Mad Money Twitter - Jim Cramer Twitter - Facebook - Instagram Questions, comments, suggestions for the ""Mad Money"" website?","CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide insight into company expectations for dealing with President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Big banks JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley all report results on Friday, April 11.

The consumer price index report on Thursday will give the latest numbers on inflation.

After President Donald Trump's new tariffs crushed global stocks for a second consecutive day, CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide a first look at how CEOs are dealing with the fallout.

Big bank earnings headline the upcoming week, alongside inflation data. No matter what the numbers reveal, though, Cramer said the direction of the market will depend on Trump's next move. The tariff-driven market rout could end soon if Trump grants relief to trading partners, he said, or it could suddenly get worse as it did on Black Monday in 1987.

""If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I'm not going to be constructive here,"" Cramer said.

Retailer Levi Strauss reports earnings on Monday. Cramer said the jeans manufacturer is vulnerable to the impact of tariffs on countries like Japan and Mexico, and previous poor guidance punished the stock. Apparel company PVH posted positive earnings results this week, though, and Cramer said it's possible Levi Strauss will beat expectations too.

Tuesday brings earnings from drugstore chain Walgreens and Cal-Maine Foods. Walgreens announced in March that it would go private in a roughly $10 billion deal with private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Meanwhile egg producer Cal-Maine could provide some insight on egg prices after they spiked in the winter, Cramer said.

Delta Air Lines announces its quarterly results on Wednesday, and although the airline cut its outlook in March, Cramer said the carrier's earnings will still provide insight into the health of the travel industry. Alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands also reports Wednesday. Tariffs on Mexico could present further headwinds for the company, Cramer said.

Money Report

On Thursday, used-vehicle retailer CarMax posts earnings results. While tariffs on new cars could boost sales for CarMax, Cramer said a potential recession would ultimately limit the stock's appeal.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes the latest consumer price index report on Thursday. Inflation has become sticky, Cramer said, and Trump's tariffs will further raise prices. That will put the Federal Reserve in a tough spot as it decides whether to cut interest rates in May, he said.

Friday unofficially kicks off earnings season as asset manager BlackRock and big banks JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all report their quarterly results. Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.

""Our only real hope is that the president comes up with something that can turn this bear into a bull,"" Cramer said.

Apparel company PVH posted positive earnings results this week, though, and Cramer said it's possible Levi Strauss will beat expectations too.
On Thursday, used-vehicle retailer CarMax posts earnings results.
Friday unofficially kicks off earnings season as asset manager BlackRock and big banks JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all report their quarterly results.
Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.","After President Donald Trump's new tariffs crushed global stocks for a second consecutive day, CNBC's Jim Cramer said next week's earnings reports will provide a first look at how CEOs are dealing with the fallout.

Big bank earnings headline the upcoming week, alongside inflation data. No matter what the numbers reveal, though, Cramer said the direction of the market will depend on Trump's next move. The tariff-driven market rout could end soon if Trump grants relief to trading partners, he said, or it could suddenly get worse as it did on Black Monday in 1987.

""If President Trump stays intransigent and does nothing to ameliorate the damage that I saw these last few days, I'm not going to be constructive here,"" Cramer said.

Retailer Levi Strauss reports earnings on Monday. Cramer said the jeans manufacturer is vulnerable to the impact of tariffs on countries like Japan and Mexico, and previous poor guidance punished the stock. Apparel company PVH posted positive earnings results this week, though, and Cramer said it's possible Levi Strauss will beat expectations too.

Tuesday brings earnings from drugstore chain Walgreens and Cal-Maine Foods . Walgreens announced in March that it would go private in a roughly $10 billion deal with private equity firm Sycamore Partners. Meanwhile egg producer Cal-Maine could provide some insight on egg prices after they spiked in the winter, Cramer said.

Delta Air Lines announces its quarterly results on Wednesday, and although the airline cut its outlook in March, Cramer said the carrier's earnings will still provide insight into the health of the travel industry. Alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands also reports Wednesday. Tariffs on Mexico could present further headwinds for the company, Cramer said.

On Thursday, used-vehicle retailer CarMax posts earnings results. While tariffs on new cars could boost sales for CarMax, Cramer said a potential recession would ultimately limit the stock's appeal.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes the latest consumer price index report on Thursday. Inflation has become sticky, Cramer said, and Trump's tariffs will further raise prices. That will put the Federal Reserve in a tough spot as it decides whether to cut interest rates in May, he said.

Friday unofficially kicks off earnings season as asset manager BlackRock and big banks JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo all report their quarterly results. Even if the banks beat expectations, though, souring economic expectations due to tariffs have already punished their stocks and could continue to do so next week, Cramer said.

The Annual Meeting will be held solely by means of remote communication to allow our stockholders to participate regardless of their geographic location.

Our strategic priorities are accelerating our journey to becoming America's leading and most trusted health care company.

Our priorities

Best-in-class businesses

Strong integrated capabilities

Leading digital strategy and tech-enabled simplicity and efficiency

Disciplined capital stewardship

Message from Our Executive Chair, Our Chief Executive Officer and Our Lead Independent Director

Dear Fellow Stockholders:

Our aspiration is to be the leading and most trusted health care company in America. We believe this is possible because of the businesses we have, the strategy we are executing, and most importantly, our colleagues who serve 185 million people across our country.

Our integrated model allows us to deliver greater access, simpler experiences, lower costs and better outcomes. In short, we are uniquely positioned to provide the things people want the most from health care.

Financial performance

We are confident that the changes made in 2024 have set CVS Health® on a strong path for the future. We took decisive actions to improve the long-term sustainability of our Aetna® business, continued to implement our innovative and transparent pharmacy models, increased our focus on operational excellence and enhanced our leadership team. In 2024, we delivered $372.8 billion in revenue, generated $9.1 billion in operating cash flow and returned nearly $3.4 billion to stockholders.

Maximizing value

Our ongoing commitment to driving innovation and integrating our businesses creates value for patients, members, customers and stockholders. In 2024, we made significant progress with our industry-first pharmacy models, CVS CostVantage™ and CVS Caremark TrueCost™. In addition, Cordavis™ contributed to net client savings of almost $1 billion by redefining the biosimilar drug marketplace. Our integrated teams helped Aetna achieve exceptional Star Ratings, with 88% of our Medicare Advantage members in 4-Star plans or higher.

Technology at the foundation

Technology helps create exceptional experiences for our consumers while simplifying how our colleagues work. We redesigned our CVS Health app in January 2025 to seamlessly connect users to our services and to the care they need - all in one place. Our clinicians can use artificial intelligence to summarize case notes, which frees up their time to engage with patients more deeply. Through the strategic and responsible use of technology, we are streamlining and connecting experiences for the millions of people we serve.

Management updates

Our management team and Board of Directors work together on the advancement of the Company's strategic plan. We proactively engage with stockholders to enhance our understanding and to be responsive to your perspectives and preferences.

We made key leadership team updates in 2024 to drive focused execution of our strategy, including David's appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") and Roger's appointment as Executive Chair of the Board. In addition, Prem Shah was appointed Group President, CVS Health. In this newly created role, Prem is responsible for operational performance and integrated value creation across our CVS Caremark®, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Health Care Delivery businesses. Steve Nelson also joined the leadership team as the newly appointed President of Aetna, bringing deep expertise leading managed care and health care delivery companies. Steve is working closely with David to build on and accelerate the plan to improve performance at Aetna. In addition, Heidi Capozzi was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer leading the human resources, labor relations, compensation and benefits and corporate social responsibility teams.

i

Board changes

We made a number of changes to our Board, including naming Mike Mahoney as Lead Independent Director to help provide dynamic Board leadership while maintaining strong independent oversight. We also enhanced our highly qualified Board with the appointment of four new directors, Leslie Norwalk, Larry Robbins, Guy Sansone and Doug Shulman, further sharpening our ability to achieve our bold ambitions. They bring skills that complement those of other Board members, including significant proficiency in health care, health services and other regulated industries, as well as areas corresponding to the evolution of our business.

We'd like to express our gratitude to J.P. Millon, who is retiring in May after having served on our Board since March 2007. J.P.'s extensive background in the pharmacy benefit management, pharmaceutical and life sciences businesses has been instrumental in the growth of the Company, and we wish him well in his future endeavors. We also acknowledge the many contributions of Nancy-Ann DeParle and Mary Schapiro, who have provided over eleven years and eight years, respectively, of diligent service to the Board and are not standing for re-election this year. Nancy-Ann has chaired our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for the past five years as our Board and management team has been updated, and her experience as the ""health care czar"" under President Obama has made her an invaluable member of the Health Services and Technology Committee since it was formed in 2016. Mary's background as the former Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (""FINRA"") has made her a vital contributor to our Audit Committee, as well as our Investment and Finance Committee during its separate existence in the key years following the Aetna merger. We thank both Nancy-Ann and Mary and wish them the best in the future.

Annual Meeting of Stockholders

We will host our Annual Meeting of Stockholders virtually at 8:00 a.m. ET on May 15, 2025 to allow our stockholders to participate regardless of location. As a stockholder, your vote is important to us and we encourage you to vote at your earliest convenience.

In 2025, we are building momentum across our businesses to drive our strategy forward and meet our financial commitments. Thank you for your investment in CVS Health. Your support is critical as we work to deliver simply better health for all Americans.

Sincerely,

Roger N. Farah

GES reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While net sales increased, earnings decreased from the year-ago period. Sales growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of rag & bone (concluded in April 2024), alongside modest gains in GES’ core operations.

The company is optimistic about growth opportunities across its core Guess brand, the newly launched Guess Jeans line and the acquisition of rag & bone. GES plans to improve overall profitability by sharpening its global direct-to-consumer strategy and streamlining business portfolio. These strategic moves are expected to contribute to a $30 million boost in operating profit by fiscal 2027.

GES’ Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics & Insights

GES posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.48 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41. However, the bottom line declined 26.4% from $2.01 reported in the prior-year period.

Guess?, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Guess?, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Guess?, Inc. Quote

Net revenues were $932.3 million, rising 4.6% year over year and surpassing the consensus mark of $899 million. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, net revenues rose 9%. The strong performance was driven by the rag & bone acquisition and positive momentum in the wholesale businesses across Europe and the Americas, and higher licensing revenues. All operating segments contributed to revenue growth, with the exception of the Asia segment, which saw a decline.

Gross margin contracted to 44.1% from 45.4% reported in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses increased to 32.8% from 29.1% in the prior-year quarter.

Adjusted earnings from operations were $106.5 million, down 18.2% from $130.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 11.4%, down from 14.6% reported in the same quarter last year. This downtick was mainly caused by increased expenses, higher advertising and store-related costs, as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses. These pressures were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation.

Decoding GES’ Segmental Performance

Revenues in the Americas Retail segment rose 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% at cc. However, retail comparable sales, including e-commerce, declined 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% at cc. The operating margin in the segment was 8.9%, down 6.1% year over year. This decline was caused by the adverse effects of negative comparable sales, higher expenses and increased markdowns.

Americas Wholesale revenues soared 63% on a reported basis and 69% at cc. The segment’s operating margin fell to 12.8%, down 15.7% year over year due to the impact of newly acquired businesses and lower product margin.

The Europe segment’s revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 7% at cc. Retail comp sales (including e-commerce) remained relatively flat on a reported basis and increased 5% at cc. The segmental operating margin was 15.4%, down 2.6% year over year, due to higher expenses and the impact of newly acquired businesses. This was partially offset by lower markdowns.

Asia revenues decreased 15% on a reported basis and 11% at cc. Retail comp sales (including e-commerce) dropped 16% and 11% on a reported basis and at cc, respectively. The operating margin in the segment was 1.3%, down 3.5% year over year. This downside was primarily due to lower product margins and reduced revenues.

Licensing revenues increased 18% on a reported basis and at cc. Segmental operating margin was 94.8% compared with 92.7% in the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by lower expenses.

GES’ Financial Health Snapshot & Shareholder-Friendly Moves

The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $187.7 million and long-term debt and finance lease obligations of nearly $150.7 million. Stockholders’ equity was around $505 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended Feb. 1, 2025, was $121.7 million. Free cash flow for the same period amounted to $29.8 million. For fiscal 2026, free cash flow is expected to be $55 million.

GES announced a quarterly dividend of 30 cents per share, payable on May 2, 2025, to its shareholders on record as of April 16.

The company repurchased about 2.6 million shares for $60.3 million during fiscal 2025.

What to Expect From GES in the Future?

For fiscal 2026, Guess? anticipates revenues to grow of 3.9-6.2%.

The adjusted operating margin is expected to be 4.5-5.4%. The GAAP operating margin is likely to be 4.3-5.2%.

Management expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.32-$1.76 in fiscal 2026 compared with the $1.96 recorded in fiscal 2025. On a GAAP basis, EPS is envisioned in the range of $1.03-$1.37 compared with the 77 cents reported in fiscal 2025.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, management expects revenue growth of 5.8-7.5%. On an adjusted basis, Guess? expects to post a loss of 74-65 cents per share. On a GAAP basis, it expects to deliver a loss in the range of 75-66 cents per share.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 29.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 30.5% decline.

The report said this is below the global corporation tax average rate of 21%, and below the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global minimum tax rate of 15% (from which shipping is exempt).
“Following intense industry pressure, the OECD granted shipping companies an exemption from its minimum corporation tax rules, which applies a global minimum corporation tax of 15%.
Four of the world’s largest shipping companies, headquartered in the richest countries, paid just US$5.0Bn in taxes – an all-time low tax rate of only 3%.
The world’s largest shipping company at the time of writing is MSC, a privately held Swiss company that does not publish its accounts.","New figures released from climate change NGO Opportunity Green claim profits on an “extraordinary scale” have been made by leading shipping companies in the years since the pandemic.

The world’s 139 largest shipping companies – accounting for 90% of the world’s fleet – made almost US$340.0Bn in profits from 2019-2023, the last year for which full figures are available. Of this sum, 93% was taken by the top 10 largest companies, the report says.

“The pandemic created an enormous windfall for shipping companies as the easing of lockdown restrictions caused a spike in global demand for freight, pushing prices up to record levels. But freight prices have soared again since 2023, as a result of disruptions to global shipping routes including drought restrictions on the Panama Canal and attacks by the Houthis on ships in the Red Sea. As freight prices have risen, so have shipping company profits,” the report said.

It added, “Yet despite these record earnings, shipping company taxes have remained catastrophically low and many of the world’s biggest shipping companies are failing to pay their fair share of taxes.”

It said the top 10 largest companies paid only US$30.0Bn in tax from 2019-2023, at a tax rate of around 10%. The report said this is below the global corporation tax average rate of 21%, and below the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) global minimum tax rate of 15% (from which shipping is exempt).

“Following intense industry pressure, the OECD granted shipping companies an exemption from its minimum corporation tax rules, which applies a global minimum corporation tax of 15%. The report shows the problem is biggest in the largest and most profitable companies, with nine of the top 10 from high income developed economies and four of those headquartered in wealthy OECD member states. Over 2019-2023, members of the OECD have an average tax rate on shipping companies of around 4%, compared with a rest of the world average of 16%.”

A statement said, “The top three publicly listed European shipping companies, Maersk, CMA CGM and Hapag Lloyd, paid only $4.6Bn in taxes in total over five years, despite making nearly half of all profits globally (US$137.0Bn). Had the top 10 largest shipping companies paid the average rate of tax faced by other companies in their home countries, the additional tax raised would have been US$42.0Bn.”

Economics at Opportunity Green senior director James Meadway said, “This is a shameful set of statistics, and shipping companies must change course, start paying their fair share of taxes and get on board with the true impact their operations are having on the planet. The international shipping sector is a significant contributor to climate change, producing 1Bn tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions each year, but nowhere is this felt more acutely than in the Global South, where frontline countries are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. Four of the world’s largest shipping companies, headquartered in the richest countries, paid just US$5.0Bn in taxes – an all-time low tax rate of only 3%. If these four companies alone were taxed at the same rate as other big corporations where they are headquartered, more than US$38.0Bn extra in taxes would have been raised over those five years.”

Opportunity Green chief executive and founder Aoife O’Leary said, “These figures should act as a stark warning as member states from all over the globe gather at the International Maritime Organization to discuss the possibility of a levy on international shipping emissions. The shipping industry currently produces 1Bn tonnes of GHG emissions each year, and yet it continues to dodge paying fair taxes. It now has the unique chance to put that right by becoming the first industry to introduce a global levy and raise revenues that could be directed to deal with the worst of climate change in climate vulnerable countries.”

The top 10 largest shipping companies are Moller-Maersk, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, China COSCO, Ocean Network Express, Evergreen Marine Corp, Orient Overseas, Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp, Wan Hai Lines and SITC.

A statement said all 10 companies were contacted for their responses to the figures in the report. Of these, Wan Hai Lines, Maersk and Orient Overseas responded to confirm the figures provided about their company are accurate. No replies were received from the remaining top 10 companies. The world’s largest shipping company at the time of writing is MSC, a privately held Swiss company that does not publish its accounts.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/152/Hapag_Lloyd_Berlin_Express_web_Main.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 13:09:03.379623

Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 11, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

Zacks Consensus Estimate

This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.5%.

Revenues are expected to be $4.74 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon?

For The Bank of New York Mellon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.49%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that The Bank of New York Mellon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon would post earnings of $1.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.72, delivering a surprise of +10.26%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

The Bank of New York Mellon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

For fiscal 2025, analysts forecast ELV to post EPS of $34.17, reflecting a 3.4% increase from $33.04 in fiscal 2024. Looking ahead, EPS is projected to grow 14.2% year-over-year to $39.02 in fiscal 2026.

ELV has underperformed the broader markets over the past 52 weeks, with shares down 8.1%, compared to the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 1.9% gain and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLV) marginal dip over the same period.

Medical membership declined 2% to 45.7 million, missing estimates, largely due to Medicaid disenrollment.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI is thought to have increased 0.2%, with core CPI up 0.3%.

The options market points to an implied move of 5% up or down following the Q1 results.","Welcome to Michael Kramer’s pick of the top three market events to look out for in the week beginning Monday 7 April.

The big US banks kick off what is likely to be an interesting corporate earnings season in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs and the heightened sense of economic uncertainty. Trump’s ‘reciprocal’ levies announcement on Wednesday sent the S&P 500 4.8% lower on Thursday, its biggest one-day drop since Covid in 2020.

Also coming up are the March readings of the US consumer price index (CPI) on Thursday and the producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Inflation could rise in the future if the tariff-induced increases in import costs are passed on to US consumers, though it may take time for the full impact of the tariffs to show up in the CPI and PPI data.

In the UK, meanwhile, February GDP data out on Friday could shed light on whether the Bank of England’s recent interest rate cuts are helping to boost growth. Policymakers cut rates in August 2024 (from 5.25% to 5%), in November (to 4.75%) and again in February 2025 (to the current rate of 4.5%).

US March CPI

Thursday 10 April

Analysts estimate that US CPI rose 2.5% in the year to March, easing from 2.8% in February. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have increased 3% year-on-year, down from 3.1% in February. On a monthly basis, headline CPI is thought to have increased 0.2%, with core CPI up 0.3%.

On Friday, PPI is expected to come in at 3%, down from 3.2% in February. Analysts use the CPI and PPI readings to estimate the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the next reading of which is due out later this month.

Trump’s tariffs have changed the outlook for US inflation, which may be set to rise if importers pass on higher costs to consumers. Should the March inflation figures come in higher than expected, the inflation outlook could deteriorate even further. Implementing the tariffs on top of hot inflation data might raise fears of stagflation – a combination of slowing growth and rising inflation. In that scenario, the US dollar might continue to weaken, potentially benefiting the Japanese yen. Having broken below support at ¥147 on Thursday, USD/JPY could be on its way towards the next key support area near ¥142.

UK February GDP

Friday 11 April

After the UK economy unexpectedly shrank 0.1% month-on-month in January, down from a 0.4% increase in December, economists estimate that gross domestic product grew 0.1% in February. With growth tepid, and given that the market turmoil brought on by Trump’s tariffs could run into a second week, the GDP report may not significantly affect the pound.

The pound looks slightly overextended, with GBP/USD having tested resistance near $1.32 on Thursday before slipping back to $1.297. That said, if the pound benefits from further dollar weakness, the pair could strengthen back above $1.30. If GBP/USD clears $1.31, then $1.342 may become the next upside target.

JPMorgan Chase Q1 earnings

Friday 11 April

BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are among the US financial heavyweights kicking off a fresh US earnings season on Friday, but JPMorgan will be the one to watch. Analysts expect the largest US bank by assets to report that first-quarter earnings grew 3.7% year-on-year to $4.60 a share. Revenue is forecast to have increased 3.4% to $43.98bn. Looking ahead to Q2, analysts forecast earnings of $4.57 a share on revenue of $44bn. The options market points to an implied move of 5% up or down following the Q1 results.

The JPMorgan share price closed at $228.69 on Thursday, down 18% from the February high, following a rocky few weeks. The chart below shows the emergence of a possible head-and-shoulders pattern. A break below support at $224 could confirm the pattern. If that support level breaks, the stock might slide to around $205.

Its earnings of $2.04 per share in the previous quarter outpaced the consensus estimate by 2%.
What disappointed investors the most was its underwhelming fiscal 2025 sales guidance.","Headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) researches and develops, manufactures, and sells various products in the healthcare field. Valued at a market cap of $385.1 billion, the company boasts a broad portfolio of drugs covering a wide range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular & metabolism, immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension and infectious diseases and vaccines. It is expected to announce its fiscal Q1 earnings for 2025 before the market opens on Tuesday, Apr. 15.

The company has exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. Its earnings of $2.04 per share in the previous quarter outpaced the consensus estimate by 2%.

For the full year, analysts expect JNJ to report EPS of $10.58, up 6% from $9.98 in fiscal 2024. Its EPS is expected to further grow 4.6% year over year to $11.07 in fiscal 2026.

JNJ has aligned with the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 3.6% gains over the past 52 weeks, although it has outpaced the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLV) marginal decline over the same time frame.

On Apr. 1, JNJ’s shares closed down 7.6% after a Texas bankruptcy judge dismissed the company's latest attempt to settle thousands of lawsuits. The lawsuits allege that J&J's baby powder and other talc-based products caused ovarian cancer. The court ruling was a major setback for the company, contributing to the sharp decline in its stock price.

On Jan. 22, JNJ released its Q4 results. It delivered adjusted EPS of $2.04 and revenue of $22.5 billion, which surpassed Wall Street estimates. Moreover, its revenue improved 5.3% from the year-ago quarter due to a rise in sales across both its reportable segments. Despite these positives, its shares plunged 1.9% on the day of the release. What disappointed investors the most was its underwhelming fiscal 2025 sales guidance. The company expects revenue in the range of $89.2 billion and $90 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimates. Additionally, while its adjusted earnings exceeded expectations, it declined 10.9% compared to the prior-year quarter, further weighing on investor sentiment.

Wall Street analysts are moderately optimistic about JNJ’s stock, with a ""Moderate Buy"" rating overall. Among 22 analysts covering the stock, eight recommend ""Strong Buy,"" two suggest “Moderate Buy,” and 12 advise “Hold.” The mean price target for JNJ is $169.18 which indicates a 5.9% potential upside from the current levels.

In September last year, Starbucks Chief Brian Niccol launched his ""Back to Starbucks"" campaign, which was slated to go into full swing in 2025, to counter declining sales and foot traffic at the renowned chain.

Ultimately, the Seattle-rooted coffee giant has expressed an eagerness to reclaim its reputation as the quintessential ""third place,"" a sanctuary aside from home and the office. Niccol proudly shared, ""I'm happy to say the third place is alive and well. It's as needed as it ever was.""

Perhaps the most notable change has been the menu updates. Last month, Starbucks told USA TODAY that it has revamped and scaled down its menu offerings to ""help reduce wait times, improve quality and consistency, and align with our core identity as a coffee company.""

The company said it's trimming its menu by a whopping 30 percent. The initial phase of these reductions commenced in February. Starbucks clarified that the cuts would affect items that ""aren't commonly purchased, can be complex to make, or are similar to other beverages on the menu."" Choices like the Iced Matcha Lemonade, Java Chip Frappuccino, White Hot Chocolate and Honey Almondmilk Flat White were already cut.

Starbucks also said they are shaking things up with new store designs being trialed in various U.S. spots. ""We're working hard to ensure our coffee houses have the right vibe,"" Niccol said.

The coffee giant has reintroduced condiment bars, started serving drinks in ceramic mugs, and encouraged baristas to personalize cups with Sharpies. It's also broadened its free refill policy, now allowing more patrons to enjoy a second cup on the house than ever before.

Previously, only Starbucks Rewards members could snag a free refill, but that's changed. Now, any customer who orders a hot or iced coffee or tea for dine-in can request a refill during their visit at no extra cost at participating stores.

Earlier in the year, Starbucks revisited its restroom policy, now asking customers to purchase something before using the facilities or lounge in the café.

""Imagine coffee houses that are comfortable and warm with expanded seating options, power outlets, and abundant food displays,"" Niccols envisioned.

He further explained: ""Stores with more separation between the café and mobile order experience, featuring new risers and dedicated pickup shelves in select locations to create an intuitive handoff, and cafes anchored by a redesigned espresso bar that adds a sense of theater to the experience and enhances the connection between our baristas and our customers.""

Niccol stated that the company also aims to deliver ""a high-quality beverage in four minutes or less with a moment of connection.""

In December 2024, Starbucks hinted at working on changes to make in-app and mobile orders more efficient, improving ""transparency and simplicity."" A few months later, Niccol announced that mobile ordering would now be limited to up to 12 items per order to decrease wait times.",https://i2-prod.irishstar.com/incoming/article34980843.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2196750077.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 14:10:33.359744

Starbucks India plans aggressive expansion of its store count despite facing losses since its entry into the market with Tata Group 12 years ago. The company focuses on various store formats and intends to strengthen its presence amid growing competition. Revenue growth has slowed down to 12% in FY24, while losses have tripled.

Starbucks India said it will aggressively expand their store count, despite running in losses. The coffee chain entered India 12 years ago with a joint venture with the Tata Group.

Sushant Dash, CEO, Starbucks India says ""We are focussing on store count expansion. And when you are doing that, it requires investment. And that has an impact on the bottom line.""

As of September 2024, the company has a new global CEO, Brian Niccol who took on the role after Laxman Narasimhan, who held the position since March 2023 and was replaced amid declining sales and stock prices, last September.

The current strategy of the company for India remains the same as it was under Narasimhan’s regime, Dash said. The company intends to continue to focus on arabica coffee, localized menus, store formats and store counts.

The total store count for the brand in India stands at 487. Out of these, 8 stores are drive-throughs. Majority of the drive-through stores for the brand are in Punjab.

Live Events

Dash adds, “India in terms of growth is amongst the top four markets for Starbucks, and we plan on increasing our store presence focusing on various store formats, like we have been doing.”

The coffee retail competition in India has been brewing steadily with UK based Pret A Manger entering India in April 2023, in a franchise agreement with Reliance Brands Limited, with plans to open 100 stores in five years.

Domestic competitor Third Wave Coffee crossed 100 outlets in India as of last year.

Starbucks India’s revenue growth slowed down to 12% in FY24, with revenue from operations at Rs 1,218.1 crore, and its losses increased three times at Rs 80 crore.

As such, the coffee company's share prices fell by over 11% yesterday, dropping to $88 per share.
How Starbucks could weather the storm Indeed, the fear of a recession is one reason that Starbucks share prices sank yesterday, says Danilo Gargiulo, an equity research analyst for Bernstein.
In the 2008 crisis, he explains, Starbucks was one of the brands hardest hit by reduced consumer spending.","Since Brian Niccol took over as the CEO of Starbucks last fall, he has made a slew of moves to start bringing customers back to the company's stores and reverse slumping sales. He has vowed to reduce wait times for service, and he simplified the shop's menu, while encouraging in-store customers to linger over ceramic mugs.

But the top reason customers say they’re going to Starbucks less often is its high prices, according to recent research from Deutsche Bank analysts. And controlling prices may have just gotten a lot more difficult for Niccol.

Yesterday, President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, placing high taxes on imports from dozens of countries and a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports to the U.S. The president hopes his drastic actions will nudge businesses to buy supplies from American producers and make products in the U.S.. For coffee retailers like Starbucks, however, the levies will be impossible to dodge given that less than 1% of coffee consumed in the country is made domestically.

Starbucks imports coffee from more than 30 countries, including Vietnam, which was hit with one of the highest tariffs at 46%.

As such, the coffee company's share prices fell by over 11% yesterday, dropping to $88 per share.

A price freeze promise

Starbucks did not respond to Fortune's request for comment. But the company's former CFO acknowledged in an earnings call earlier this year that higher prices for coffee could impact revenue and profitability for the retail giant and its “already pressured consumer.”

The coffee company has angered customers in recent years by steeply raising prices as inflation rose in the U.S. The chief executive has already assigned himself a challenging task: he plans to invest in stores and employees as part of his turnaround plan, but has also committed to a price freeze through fiscal year 2025. So what now?

“Starbucks is either going to have lower margins and keep the prices where they are, or they'll be forced to raise prices,” says Peter Cohan, associate professor of management practice at Babson College.

If trade wars lead to steeper prices for a wide range of products, or push the U.S. into a recession, some Starbucks customers who currently pick up pricey drinks once or twice a week “may decide that they do not need that as much as they need to pay their rent or pay for health insurance,” Cohan adds. He predicts Starbucks will see fewer store visits, meaning lower sales of coffee, food, and non-coffee based drinks.

The L&H sectors benefitted from higher new business sales and lower policy surrenders, particularly in France and Italy.
The protection and health insurance sectors, in particular, performed well, with AXA reporting a significant turnaround in its UK health insurance business.
While some volatility was experienced due to economic factors like widening sovereign credit spreads, the overall trend in L&H remained positive.
The shift towards shorter-term contracts in the L&H business, particularly for AXA and Zurich, could limit CSM growth.","According to a report from Moody’s, a global credit ratings, research, and risk analysis firm, Europe’s four largest primary insurers—Allianz, AXA, Generali, and Zurich Insurance —have reported record earnings for FY 2024, collectively reaching €28.6 billion, a 15% increase from the previous year.

Moody’s attributes these strong results to solid performances across all key divisions, with property and casualty (P&C) insurance and life and health (L&H) segments driving much of the growth.

The continued success in these sectors highlights the insurers’ robust positions in the market and their ability to navigate challenging economic environments.

The insurers demonstrated significant premium gains across both P&C and L&H sectors, with P&C premiums rising by 9% and L&H premiums increasing by 14%.

Moody’s emphasised that these increases were driven by price hikes and greater exposure, particularly in retail insurance. The L&H sectors benefitted from higher new business sales and lower policy surrenders, particularly in France and Italy. While the insurers exceeded their earnings targets for 2024, Moody’s expects slower profit growth in 2025, influenced by rising geopolitical risks and market uncertainties.

The P&C business was particularly strong in 2024, buoyed by both retail and commercial lines. Premium revenue, particularly in retail insurance, significantly boosted underwriting results, as insurers continued adjusting prices to respond to inflation in claims costs.

Allianz and Zurich were among those reporting improvements in their commercial combined ratios. Despite this, commercial pricing momentum showed some signs of slowing down, especially in certain markets. However, retail P&C lines saw significant improvement across most European regions.

Moody’s noted that the L&H business rebounded in 2024, showing growth after a slower 2023. This was driven by higher releases from the contractual service margin (CSM) and improved technical margins.

The protection and health insurance sectors, in particular, performed well, with AXA reporting a significant turnaround in its UK health insurance business.

While some volatility was experienced due to economic factors like widening sovereign credit spreads, the overall trend in L&H remained positive. New business in the L&H sector grew by an average of 17% across the four companies, with Allianz and Generali seeing particularly strong results—up 20% and 30%, respectively. This growth was fuelled by a diverse mix of protection and savings products tailored to market demands.

According to Moody’s, the insurers reported stable solvency ratios, supported by strong capital generation. However, substantial shareholder returns, including dividends and share buybacks, partly offset these gains.

Despite a solid capital foundation, the insurers remain committed to progressive dividend policies, which may limit financial flexibility in times of economic stress. Moody’s also highlighted that their cautious outlook for capital management in 2025 could be influenced by rising geopolitical tensions and volatile financial markets.

Moody’s also pointed out the value of geographical diversification in strengthening these insurers’ positions. Allianz, AXA, and Generali have established dominant positions in their home markets (Germany, France, and Italy, respectively), while maintaining significant footprints across Europe and other regions.

Zurich, with its focus on P&C and commercial lines, has a strong presence in North America. This geographical spread has helped mitigate risks from natural catastrophes and has been instrumental in diversifying earnings.

While investment returns in 2024 were robust, buoyed by healthy interest rates and stable financial markets, the outlook for investment results in 2025 is more uncertain.

Moody’s indicated that rising geopolitical risks and potential market volatility could impact investment performance. The mixed outlook for investments is an area of concern as insurers must navigate broader market uncertainty, including potential economic slowdowns.

Looking ahead to 2025, Moody’s expects slower profit growth, though P&C performance is expected to continue benefiting from price increases and exposure growth.

However, the momentum in commercial pricing is likely to slow. The shift towards shorter-term contracts in the L&H business, particularly for AXA and Zurich, could limit CSM growth. In contrast, Allianz and Generali, with their focus on long-term life savings, appear better positioned for growth in this area.

Despite these challenges, Moody’s believes that the insurers remain well-positioned for further market share expansion. Their diverse portfolios, strong capital management, and geographical spread provide a solid foundation for the future.",https://www.reinsurancene.ws/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/moodys-logo-new.png,N,,2025-04-04 12:22:13.287636

The 2024 financials, filed with the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGx) on Monday, showed an impressive rise in the bank’s profit after tax which went up by 26.14 percent to close the year at US$514.476 million, up from US$ 407.836 million recorded at the end of the 2023 fiscal year.

The Bank’s gross earnings also grew significantly from US$13,959 billion recorded at the end of the 2023 financial year to US$21,409 billion in the period under consideration, representing a 53.6 percent growth.

Like in the previous years, the banks’ total assets also rose remarkably by 46.8 percent, from US$133,312 trillion in 2023, to close at US$196, 256 trillion in December 2024; signifying a milestone leap for the bank with the largest spread across the continent.

As a result of the impressive performance and in fulfilment of the promise made by the UBA Group Chairman, Tony Elumelu, to shareholders at the last Annual General Meeting, the Bank proposed a final dividend of US$0.0019 for every ordinary share of US$ 0.0032, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024. This brings the total dividend in the year to US$0.0032 The final dividend is subject to the ratification of the shareholders during its upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM).

UBA’s Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Oliver Alawuba, who expressed excitement at the results, stated that the 2024 financial performance demonstrates the bank’s continued focus on driving earnings growth, preserving asset quality, expanding business operations and deepening market share.

“Our continued investment in our highly diversified global network allows UBA to deliver high-quality, consistent earnings. Our businesses have been able to grow product and service income and expand our deposit base, allowing the Group to increase earnings while maintaining strong spreads and margins,” Alawuba highlighted.

According to him, “With total deposit increasing by 42.03 percent from US$11,233.054 billion in 2023 to US$15.946 billion and total assets hitting US$19.626 billion from US$19.819 billion, the just-released results reflect broad-based growth across all core businesses and were achieved despite prevailing macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical uncertainties, and exchange rate volatilities.”

The GMD expressed excitement at the marked improvement recorded in the bank’s core earnings profile, as he explained that the profit is derived from high-quality income streams from funding intermediation, fees, and commissions, thus reflecting strong long-term, sustainable revenue generation capacity.

“Our ex-Nigeria (Rest of Africa & International) operations have expanded significantly over the past five years, now contributing 51.7% of Group revenue, up from 31% in 2019, delivering diversification benefits and further boosting long-term shareholder value. This will continue to grow, as we further explore strategic markets that align with our overall vision. We are currently upgrading our business scope and authorization in France, and considering other viable markets in the short to medium term,” Alawuba noted.

He pointed out the bank’s resolve to invest continuously in technology, data analytics, product innovation, staff training and development, which, according to him, will collectively enhance our customers’ experience.

On his part, UBA’s Executive Director, Finance & Risk Management, Ugo Nwaghodoh, said the bank recorded triple-digit growth in net interest income, resulting in remarkable improvement in net interest margin from 6.83 percent in 2023 to 9.02 percent, while also recording strong double-digit growth in fee and commission income lines of 91.66 percent.

“UBA Group continues to demonstrate strong capital levels, with shareholders’ funds’ growth of 68.4% to US$2.208 billion and a solid capital adequacy ratio of 31.0%., and as we defensibly position the portfolio to navigate prevailing global and regional macroeconomic upheavals, asset quality improved, with NPL ratio moderating to 5.58%, with strong provision coverage at 81%”, Nwaghodoh noted.

This acquisition included all of SABMiller’s Nigerian subsidiaries: Intafact Beverages Limited in Onitsha, International Breweries Plc in Ilesha, and Pabod Breweries Limited in Port Harcourt.
The three breweries were merged into one under the International Breweries label in 2017, with AB InBev being the majority shareholder.","International Breweries has seen its loss after tax extended to the seventh year, as it recorded an N113bn loss in the 2024 financial year.

According to its audited financial report filed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited on Thursday, the brewer saw its loss worsen to N113.61bn from N70.03bn in 2023, marking a 62.25 per cent rise.

International Breweries had been on a losing streak since the 2018 financial year when it recorded a loss of N3.87bn, which grew to N27.79bn in 2019 and dipped to N16.08bn in 2020. The company’s loss slightly rose to N17.66bn in 2021 and higher to N21.63bn in 2022.

However, in the 2024 financial year, the company’s revenue reached a nine-year high of N488.96bn. Compared to the previous year’s revenue of N260.59bn, this was an 87.63 per cent jump year-on-year, indicating strong revenue growth.

Highlighting some of its challenges, the brewer in its annual report said, “While continually delivering strong revenue growth, our inability to source adequate foreign exchange due to market illiquidity impacted profitability, as we incurred significant FX losses on our foreign currency-denominated debt and liabilities.

“To address this, the company successfully raised fresh capital through a rights issue and settled the outstanding loan liability. Going into 2025, the company expects to return to profitability in the absence of any significant non-operating foreign currency exposure.

The company generated positive operating cash flows in the current year, 2024: N148.90bn (2023: N78.60bn) to cover its short-term obligations. The company is strategically positioned for success in the future and continues to have the backing of its ultimate parent company.”

International Breweries opened its N588bn rights issue programme in May 2024. The brewer sought to issue 161,172,395,100 new ordinary shares of two kobo each at an offer price of N3.65 per share. According to the rights issue circular, the terms include six new ordinary shares for every share held by existing shareholders.

It later expanded the offering to allow non-shareholders of the company to participate in its rights issue.

The brewer, which is a part of AB InBev, the largest brewer in the world, said at the time that the net proceeds from the rights issue would be used to settle its outstanding US dollar-denominated loan and provide working capital support.

“We are committed to creating sustainable value for our shareholders while fortifying our position in the Nigerian beverage industry. Together, we will continue to brew success, deliver long-term value for our shareholders, and create a future with more cheers,” said Finance Director of International Breweries David Tomlinson.

Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller, then the world’s second-largest brewer, in 2016.

This acquisition included all of SABMiller’s Nigerian subsidiaries: Intafact Beverages Limited in Onitsha, International Breweries Plc in Ilesha, and Pabod Breweries Limited in Port Harcourt. The three breweries were merged into one under the International Breweries label in 2017, with AB InBev being the majority shareholder.

As of December 2024, AB InBev Nigeria Holdings BV holds 161,580,471,272, equating to 96.1 per cent of the shares of the brewer.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/12015234/International-Breweries-Plc.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 23:00:33.982297

“Forever 21 either failed to recognize those threats or failed to address them when they had bankruptcy protection.
“As consumer awareness about the environmental impact of fast fashion grew, Forever 21 struggled to align its business model with a more sustainable, ethical approach,” Green said via email.
“Their ability to read demand signals in real time and respond with hyper-targeted, constantly changing product assortments has redefined consumers’ expectations of fast fashion,” he said via email.
“But that doesn’t mean traditional fast fashion retailers are out of the game.","Forever 21’s downfall cannot be attributed to a single factor. Yet, the once iconic fast fashion retailer pointedly singled out the rise of the likes of Shein and Temu as a key driver behind its second bankruptcy.

If you ask experts, however, the company’s demise isn’t a story of a sole misstep, but rather a series of interconnected failures, which, while including rising competition, also stemmed from an inability to adapt to the quick changing economic environment, trend cycles, and consumer shopping patterns.

The retailer, which will be closing all 350 of its stores in the US, had faced eerily similar woes during its first bankruptcy in 2019: overexpansion without a well thought-out strategy, an inability to keep up with digital trends, declining product appeal, and overall concerns around sustainability.

But instead of addressing its core problems, modernizing operations, or significantly improving its e-commerce presence like its competitors Zara and H&M, it simply downsized and, well…hoped for the best.

“In the case of Forever 21, the reasons given by management were all known at the time of their first bankruptcy,” Greg Portell, senior partner and global markets lead at Kearney, told Retail Brew via email. “Forever 21 either failed to recognize those threats or failed to address them when they had bankruptcy protection. In the end, any company should expect competition and can benefit from working to anticipate those moves.”

Cue the sequel: Denise Green, director of graduate studies in Cornell University’s fiber science and apparel design program, pointed to the significant struggles the retailer had on the sustainability front—a mounting concern that has put all fast fashion brands under scrutiny.

While retailers like Zara and H&M have focused on increasing awareness around their sustainability efforts, however flawed, Forever 21 seemed to have paid very little heed to its low-cost, disposable model. It doesn’t help that mid-priced brands such as Reformation and Everlane also gained traction at the same time by offering more ethically produced alternatives.

“As consumer awareness about the environmental impact of fast fashion grew, Forever 21 struggled to align its business model with a more sustainable, ethical approach,” Green said via email. “The company’s overexpansion and inefficient supply chain further exacerbated its financial woes.”

Ironically, Shein and Temu have faced even greater scrutiny over their ethics and sustainability practices, yet that hasn’t deterred their loyal customer base from the vast selection of ultra-cheap offerings on both platforms.

“Retailers like Shein and Temu pose a significant threat because of their more agile supply chains, which enable rapid response to consumer trends and their shifting preferences,” Green said. “Competing against them requires a multifaceted approach: investing in technology to equalize supply chain agility, prioritizing sustainability, and enhancing brand loyalty through storytelling and personalization.”

Sam Vise, CEO of Optimum Retailing, an AI-supported retail intelligence platform, offers an alternate point of view. While acknowledging that Shein and Temu pose a real threat to fast fashion brands, he said it’s not because of their “speed or low prices” but because of a unique understanding of their customer.

“Their ability to read demand signals in real time and respond with hyper-targeted, constantly changing product assortments has redefined consumers’ expectations of fast fashion,” he said via email. “But that doesn’t mean traditional fast fashion retailers are out of the game. The key is not to try and outprice Shein or Temu online; it’s to offer something they fundamentally can’t. When done right, brick-and-mortar stores create an emotionally resonant experience that can’t be replicated while scrolling on an app.”

Final word: Vise suggests the “real opportunity” to tackle the threat from the duo lies in combining the strengths of both digital and physical retail.

“The retailers that will thrive are the ones who view their physical footprint as a strategic advantage: a space where online meets offline, and where shoppers can see, feel, try, and immediately take home the products they’ve browsed digitally,” he said. “To stay competitive, traditional fast fashion brands need to reframe their stores not as distribution points, but as experience centers that are flexible, localized, and deeply in tune with the customer.”

If there’s one takeaway from Forever 21’s decline, it’s that survival in retail isn’t about sticking to what worked in the past, it’s about evolving.

The marketplace’s share within that has nearly doubled in just one year. The platform serves as a catalyst for growth for Decathlon, both in Germany and beyond.

Globally, Decathlon achieved a revenue of 16.2 billion euros last year. Adjusted for inflation, this represents a 3.8 percent increase compared to the previous year.

Online revenue

Digital sales are becoming increasingly important for the French sporting goods retailer. Last year, 20 percent of its global revenue came from online sales, including ecommerce, in-store connected orders, and marketplaces – up from 17 percent in 2023. In Germany, however, the online share is significantly higher.

Decathlon sells billions of euros worth of products online

In its reports, Decathlon also emphasizes its focus on the importance of the planet and people. Despite sales growth, the company reduced its CO2 emissions last year. Additionally, it continues to employ more people, now with staff from 87 different nationalities. The proportion of women in the workforce has also increased.

Omnichannel strategy and marketplace

In a separate report on Germany, Decathlon attributes its positive revenue development to “the consistent implementation of its omnichannel strategy, which seamlessly integrates the digital and physical shopping experience”. The company also highlights “the remarkable development of the online marketplace”, which accounted for 20 percent of digital sales last year. For comparison: in 2023, this was 11 percent, and in 2022, just 7 percent.

German marketplace share has tripled since 2022

Given that Decathlon’s German marketplace has not been active for very long, its rapid growth is not surprising. However, platform sales are exceeding expectations. It has become a catalyst for further profitable online growth, much like what has been seen with online marketplaces of MediaMarkt, Zalando and Otto.

Yet Target's shares were not spared in Thursday's stock market bloodbath, falling 12% as it became clear that less China exposure had its limits.","At the Shoptalk retail industry conference last week, Gap Inc CEO Richard Dickson touted the apparel maker's limited exposure to China and the tariffs about to be imposed on imports from there after years of efforts to diversify its supplier base.

""Big credit goes to our supply chains. We've been working on diversifying our manufacturer footprint for quite some time. Less than 10% of our product is coming out of China,"" said Dickson. Now Gap's biggest supplier country is Vietnam, followed by India and Indonesia, all well ahead of China.

Dickson's counterpart at Levi Strauss & Co Michelle Gass echoed the reduced exposure to China at Shoptalk too, saying ""Of what we know today, right now it is fairly minimal.""

In recent years, many U.S. apparel makers have gradually reduced their reliance on China because of rising costs there, the abundance of capacity in Southeast Asia, and the threat of a trade conflict with the U.S. always looming.

But Dickson and Gass' sanguine reactions of course came before the Trump Administration's announcement on Wednesday that it planned to impose punitive tariffs on 60 countries, including across-the-board levies of 46% on imports from Vietnam and 26% from India. Suddenly, Gap Inc and Levi's don't seem inoculated at all from Trump's tariff war with the rest of the world.

Gap Inc shares were down 22% in early trading on Thursday, while Levi's were down 11%. Other apparel-heavy retailers saw big drops like Macy's, down 16%. (Home goods retailers, also very exposed to tariffs on Asian suppliers, similarly got dinged, with Restoration Hardware down 42%.)

When President Trump this winter announced his first salvos in the tariff wars, focused initially on China, Canada and Mexico, many retailers rushed to reassure investors that over time, they had lessened their exposure to China, long known as a maker of cheap items for Western brands. Target's Chief Commercial Officer said in March that Chinese goods now represent 30% of its merchandise, down from 60% in 2017. Yet Target's shares were not spared in Thursday's stock market bloodbath, falling 12% as it became clear that less China exposure had its limits.

Ditto for Nike, which said in its most recent annual report that factories in Vietnam made half of the shoes it sells and more than a quarter of the apparel in Vietnam. The sportswear giant, trying to carry off a turnaround amid waning interest in its wares, saw its shares fall 15%.

Walmart, Best Buy, and other major retailers are already feeling the impact of President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, which are set to take effect April 9. The initial 10% tariff will kick in this Saturday, April 5.

Other retailers, including Dollar General (DG+4.65%), Dollar Tree (DLTR-12.09%), Target (TGT-11.31%), and Best Buy (BBY-17.62%), are also taking a hit. Suffering the most damage thus far is Five Below (FIVE-26.62%), whose shares plummeted over 20%, and Best Buy, which saw a nearly 12% drop. Retailers are bracing for the fallout, with many executives warning that rising costs could push prices higher for consumers.

Retail giants like Walmart, Costco, and Target are reportedly racing to shift the tariff burden onto their Chinese suppliers, a move that could help them absorb some of the financial pressure. However, suppliers operating on razor-thin margins may pass those costs back to U.S. companies, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers on everyday items like fruits, vegetables, electronics, and apparel.

Walmart (WMT-2.91%), Best Buy, and Target have already indicated they may raise prices should tariffs take effect. The National Retail Federation (NRF) recently issued a warning, projecting a slowdown in consumer spending for 2025 if tariffs continue to escalate. Both Gregory Daco, EY’s chief economist, and Sarah Wolfe, Morgan Stanley’s (MS-9.63%) senior economist and strategist, expressed concerns that higher-than-expected tariff could increase everyday costs, putting a strain on household budgets and dampening consumer demand.

New tariffs from the Trump administration, slapping a 10% base rate on imports, are rattling the retail sector, hitting giants like Best Buy and home-furnishing firms hard.

What does this mean?

These tariffs, set to impact imports from China, Japan, and other countries, are creating a tough environment for retailers reliant on imported goods. Best Buy, which focuses on import-driven, big-ticket items, saw its shares dive 15% following the announcement, while Wayfair, RH, Williams-Sonoma, and Arhaus took even bigger hits. RH plans to work with manufacturers to soften the effect on margins after missing fiscal targets. Conversely, Williams-Sonoma stays optimistic, expecting limited macroeconomic effects. Experts suggest consumers might absorb some cost hikes, as vendors are likely to pass some tariff expenses onto retailers.

Why should I care?

The bigger picture: Retail reshuffling on the rise.

While hardline retailers struggle with tariff impacts, those less reliant on imports like Chewy and Petco Health and Wellness, along with auto parts retailers like AutoZone and O'Reilly Automotive, appear more resilient. Their focus on essential items and pricing power could help them weather the changing trade landscape, highlighting a broader market shift towards resilience against import volatility.

For markets: The import-export debate.

The tariffs' introduction has injected uncertainty into market dynamics, affecting investor confidence and share values. Some retailers may try cost-cutting and pricing tactics, but the overall impact on consumer spending and economic sentiment is still up in the air. As markets adjust, analysts continue to evaluate how these tariffs will affect purchasing power and sector growth in the coming months.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-x4W9QLyc66CJ8JgoIJ06tf8D.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=6844e19748ee6c1e03880a9935af03b9,N,,2025-04-03 15:10:11.716457

More promisingly, Amsa is cautiously optimistic about green shoots in demand — particularly in the energy and infrastructure sectors, where state and private projects could revive appetite for long steel products.","ArcelorMittal South Africa (Amsa) this week announced a six-month deferral of the planned wind-down of its Long Steel Business, extending operations until at least 31 August 2025 and preventing the loss of at least 3,500 direct jobs, for now.

The lifeline is not a Band-Aid nor yet a permanent solution, with Amsa stating: “The facility is repayable subject to agreement between the parties and contingent on the financial performance, solvency and liquidity of the Long Steel Business,” in a press release.

This development follows a R1.683-billion facility provided by the Industrial Development Corporation, aimed at sustaining the business while seeking long-term solutions to a proposed business dissolution that would have seen South Africa’s longest-running steel producer close down, with thousands of jobs on the line.

Long steel long in the tooth

The long steel business — Amsa’s division focused on the production of fencing material, rail, rods, and bars — serves as a vital supplier to the construction, mining, and manufacturing sectors, with core operations centred in Newcastle and Vereeniging.

While its products form the literal backbone of infrastructure development, the business has struggled to remain standing, in large part due to the broader infrastructure challenges within the country regarding entities such as the Passenger Rail Association of South Africa (Prasa) and Transnet.

By end 2024 operational losses at the Longs division had doubled to R1.1-billion, and for Amsa overall, headline losses topped R5.1-billion — reflecting an unsustainable combination of sluggish domestic demand, punishing electricity tariffs, inefficient rail logistics, and pressure from smaller, nimbler mini-mill competitors.

The wind-down

In November 2023 Amsa announced its intention to shutter long steel operations by April 2025, citing persistent losses and an absence of favourable policy concessions; the company had signalled that it could no longer absorb the unit’s cash burn.

But in a turn of events on Monday, 31 March 2025, Amsa confirmed that the Industrial Development Corporation had stepped in with a R1.683-billion funding facility, halting the shutdown — at least for now.

The Industrial Development Corporation facility is repayable based on the solvency, liquidity, and financial performance of the Long Steel Business, and buys Amsa six more months to stabilise operations and negotiate longer-term reforms.

Government and stakeholder involvement

The deferral forms part of a broader emergency rescue framework involving government ministries, regulators, and key stakeholders. Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Parks Tau has committed to addressing long-standing structural challenges in the steel sector.

These include a reform of the scrap metal Preferential Pricing System, revisions to the scrap export tax, and the introduction of safeguard tariffs to shield domestic producers from low-cost imports.

To ease pressure on Amsa’s balance sheet, the company has also secured Temporary Employee Relief Scheme funding to offset payroll costs during the deferral window. In response, Amsa has suspended the Section 189(3) retrenchment consultations, offering a temporary reprieve to thousands of workers.

In a joint effort with the Industrial Development Corporation, government representatives have said the deferral period would be used to address “structural problems previously identified by the company”, with the goal of placing the Long Steel Business on a more sustainable footing.

Industrial Development Corporation in to save the day

The Industrial Development Corporation’s support may extend beyond this immediate bailout. The state-owned financier, which already holds a 6.4% stake in Amsa, has signalled its interest in increasing its shareholding. CEO Kobus Verster confirmed that a due diligence process was now under way in a media briefing earlier today: “The Industrial Development Corporation has indicated that they have a desire to look at an increased shareholding, and for that, a due diligence period has been agreed upon.”

Jobs on the line

The decision to keep Amsa’s long steel operations running preserves about 3,500 direct and indirect jobs that would have been lost in the event of a shutdown. But even with this intervention, the sustainability of those jobs hinges on deeper reforms.

South Africa’s steel value chain — critical to sectors such as construction, mining, and automotive manufacturing — relies heavily on long product availability. Any disruption risks ripple effects across the broader economy. The deferral provides breathing room to maintain that supply while systemic fixes are pursued, but should these not be resolved, it’s unclear how similar challenges will be avoided for the Industrial Development Corporation in the future.

The industry’s long-term mettle

Despite the temporary fix, fundamental issues — aging infrastructure, low cost competitiveness, and regulatory burden — require more than financial stopgaps. Without major industrial reform, the Long Steel Business could merely be delaying the inevitable.

Protective tariffs have been inconsistently applied, and regulatory interventions have often come too late to be effective. The scrap Preferential Pricing System, in particular, has been blamed for distorting market prices and advantaging recyclers over primary producers like Amsa.

During the deferral period, Amsa will explore strategic alternatives to turn the business around. These include operational efficiency programmes, modernising production processes, expanding the product range, and deepening supplier and customer collaboration.

Strained Consumer Spending

General Mills, Kraft Heinz and Campbell's have all issued bleak annual forecasts on strained consumer spending, which took a further hit after US President Donald Trump's erratic tariff decisions fanned worries of prices shooting up again.

Digital sales now represent 20 percent of total revenue, including e-commerce, marketplaces and in-store connected orders.

Decathlon said it “reinforced its commitment to empower people to lead healthier, more active lives in 2024.”

“A year after unveiling its new ambition and strategy as well as its global brand identity, Decathlon has undergone a transformative journey, evolving as a multi-specialist sports brand that inspires everyone — from beginners to Olympic and Paralympic athletes — to embrace the power of sport, the company said in a media release.

The company said this transformation is underway, with 200 stores either newly opened or modernized, alongside an optimized brand portfolio to offer greater clarity and better serve its customers.

Decathlon expects, by 2026, to restructure 90 percent of its product offerings.

Rigorous cost-control measures reportedly mitigated the impact of cost inflation, allowing Decathlon to maintain its commercial momentum while ensuring affordable prices. Optimizing operational expenses remains a key priority for 2025 to support long-term growth.

Inc. that ultimately failed to come to fruition.
Kroger and Albertsons agreed in October 2022 to the acquisition and merger.
He pointed out Kroger originally expected the Albertsons acquisition to generate $1 billion a year in synergies.
Acquisition costs typically total 3% to 5% of the transaction value.
“Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons was considered a complex deal from a regulatory standpoint.","Kroger Co. spent more than a billion dollars on the planned $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons Cos. Inc. that ultimately failed to come to fruition.

Downtown Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE: KR), the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets, detailed those expenses in its newly released Form 10-K filed April 1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Kroger officials said the company spent $1.044 billion in merger-related expenses dating back to 2022. The majority of those, $684 million, were incurred in fiscal 2024, which ended Feb. 1, 2025. Those costs followed $316 million in fiscal 2023 and $44 million in 2022.

Kroger and Albertsons agreed in October 2022 to the acquisition and merger. The deal would have combined the nation’s second-largest operator of traditional supermarkets in Albertsons with Kroger. It would have been the largest merger involving U.S. supermarkets in history and combined Kroger’s 2,722 stores with Albertsons’ 2,271 stores to create a national behemoth.

But regulators and state attorneys general opposed the acquisition and merger on antitrust grounds. They believed the combination would be anticompetitive in many markets. The Federal Trade Commission sued in February 2024 to block it and multiple state attorneys general sued to halt the acquisition. All cited antitrust factors.

A federal court judge sided with the FTC in ruling Dec. 10, 2024, to halt the deal and a Washington state court judge issued a similar ruling the same day. Albertsons and Kroger separately called off the transaction the next day.

Albertsons also sued Kroger Dec. 11 for breach of the merger agreement.

Through it all, Kroger spent that $1 billion-plus largely on third-party professional fees and credit facility fees, Kroger officials said in the filing. Those likely consist largely of attorney fees and costs related to Kroger’s issuance of $10.5 billion in debt in August to pay for the acquisition. Kroger later used much of that money to buy back $7.5 billion in stock.

Kroger officials didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Analysts largely said merger-related charges like that, even when they’re for a deal that ultimately didn’t happen, are the price companies pay for doing business.

“These expenses are generally viewed as the cost of doing business and investors tend to look through these one-time costs,” Johnson Investment Counsel Senior Research Analyst Joe Abbott told me.

He pointed out Kroger originally expected the Albertsons acquisition to generate $1 billion a year in synergies.

“In other words, the acquisition-related expenses would have been more than paid for by the long-term value created by the combined entity,” Abbott said.

Kevin Gade, chief operating officer and portfolio manager at downtown-based Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, said Kroger has been able to overcome those costs that ultimately didn’t pay off.

“I would categorize it as a stranded cost that is likely to get no return on that time or money spent unless Kroger pursues Albertsons again imminently,” Gade said. “Kroger has been an excellent investment since the deal was officially called off in December. So while absorbing stranded costs is painful, the market was skeptical on this deal.”

Indeed, Kroger shares have gained 16% since the market closed Dec. 9, the day before the court rulings against the deal were issued. Kroger stock gained 4 cents Wednesday to close April 2 at $67.27.

But James Lewis, portfolio manager and senior equity research analyst at Bartlett Wealth Management, said the costs are higher than those incurred in most deals. Acquisition costs typically total 3% to 5% of the transaction value. Kroger’s costs are at the high end of that range, he said.

“One factor to consider is the complexity of the deal,” Lewis said. “Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons was considered a complex deal from a regulatory standpoint. Regulatory hurdles were high. Deals involving companies in unrelated industries typically have lower acquisition costs since the transaction does not undergo strict regulatory oversight.”

Kroger is certain to incur even more costs. Albertsons is suing it to collect a $600 million termination fee. C&S Wholesale Grocers, which agreed to buy 579 stores that Kroger planned to divest in order to appease regulators, also is suing Kroger to collect a $125 million termination fee.

Whether Kroger ends up paying those fees, settling for lower amounts or wins, it’ll incur further attorney and legal fees in the process.

The Albertsons acquisition's termination also was closely followed by fallout in Kroger’s C-suite. CEO and Chairman Rodney McMullen resigned March 2 following a Kroger board investigation of his personal conduct that, while ""unrelated to the business, was inconsistent with Kroger’s Policy on Business Ethics,” the company said in a news release. No other details have been released. Lead director Ron Sargent was named interim CEO and chairman.

Elsewhere in the 10-K filing, Kroger lists 14 risk factors that could affect its business. All companies list risks to the business. While the list is quite comprehensive and largely reflects similar risks to a year ago, one factor on last year’s list is missing this year: “Our proposed transaction with Albertsons creates incremental business, regulatory and reputational risks.”

Another change among risk factors this year is the presence of tariffs as a concern. Kroger lists tariffs as risks under the fuel, economic conditions and supply chains categories. As it relates to Kroger’s fuel sales, the company noted it can’t predict the cost and availability of fuel and how customers will react, possibly due to tariffs among other factors.

Tariffs also are viewed as creating uncertainty regarding future economic conditions. And tariffs could hurt Kroger’s business by interrupting its product supply, the company said. The word “tariff” didn’t appear among risk factors a year ago.",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12935048/kroger-building-4*1200xx3600-2025-0-188.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 14:07:06.539758

For the third consecutive year, the French sporting goods retailer reported decoupling revenue growth from absolute carbon emissions.","Decathlon Group realised revenue growth in fiscal year 2024. The French sporting goods retailer critically examined its expenditures that year, limiting the impact of cost inflation. Optimising operational costs remains a priority for the coming fiscal year to support long-term growth, according to the filed annual report.

Decathlon operates in 79 countries with 1,817 stores and achieved a 5.2 percent year-over-year revenue increase in 2024 at constant exchange rates. Turnover reached 16.2 billion euros, with 20 percent generated through digital sales, encompassing e-commerce, marketplaces, and in-store orders. The French retailer's net profit amounted to 787 million euros.

One of the highlights of the fiscal year, ending December 31, 2024, was Decathlon's partnership with the Paris Olympic Games. This resulted in the sale of 1.8 million licensed products throughout the year. The collaboration also led to a 10 percent increase in store visits across France during the Olympic Games and a 6.7 percent increase during the Paralympic Games, according to the report.

In 2024, Decathlon also launched Decathlon Pulse, a subsidiary established to explore new frontiers and drive additional long-term growth through strategic investments and partnerships.

Decathlon anticipates continued future growth. Over the next five years, the company plans to expand its store count and production capabilities in India with a 100 million investment euros. The French retailer also sees opportunities in Germany: By 2027, the company aims to invest 100 million euros in the opening of new stores and modernising existing locations.

For the third consecutive year, the French sporting goods retailer reported decoupling revenue growth from absolute carbon emissions.

Visit the Investor site at RH.com to read the complete Shareholder Letter from Chairman & CEO, who communicates more in depth information about the business environment and expectations looking back and moving forward.

OUTLOOK

Based on our current plans and the uncertain macroeconomic environment we are providing the following financial outlook for the full year and first quarter.

Fiscal Year 2025

Revenue Growth of 10% to 13%

Adjusted Operating Margin of 14% to 15%

Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 20% to 21%

First Quarter 2025

Revenue Growth of 12.5% to 13.5% Adjusted Operating Margin of 6.5% to 7.0%

Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 12.5% to 13.0%

The above outlook includes a negative 160 to 200 basis point Operating Margin impact from investments and startup costs to support our international expansion.

Our Product Transformation Plans for 2025 include:

The introduction of our new RH Outdoor Sourcebook, featuring the most dominant assortment of high-quality outdoor furniture in the world arrived in homes early February with eight new furniture collections, an exciting new textiles offering, plus a significantly improved in-stock position to start the season versus a year ago.

The introduction of our new RH Interiors Sourcebook arrived in homes mid-February though early March, featuring 42 new collections across furniture, upholstery, lighting, rugs and textiles, as well as an additional 15 new collections launched on RH.com. While we had planned a higher amount of new collections for this book, due to the rapidly changing economic outlook, we believed it was prudent to delay some of our introductions until later in the year.

The launch of a significant new brand extension in the Fall of 2025 that we believe will meaningfully expand the market size and share of the RH brand. This new brand extension will include a new Sourcebook, a significant website presence and two freestanding Galleries dedicated to the New Concept. Our plan includes integrating RH Couture Upholstery by Dmitriy & Co. and RH Bespoke Furniture by Joseph Jeup into this new brand extension, enabling greater exposure and market reach versus standalone concepts. We will be sharing more details of this exciting new venture during our first quarter earnings call.

As communicated last quarter, we do not expect a negative impact to results related to previously announced increased tariffs on products from China, Canada or Mexico. As it relates to reciprocal and other tariffs that will be announced today, as we’ve done with prior tariffs, we will be working with our manufacturing partners to mitigate the impact to both our margins and costs to our customers.

We believe it is also important to note that we have been manufacturing upholstered furniture in our own North Carolina factory for over ten years, and have recently expanded the facility, doubling our capacity. We are currently projecting that 48% of our upholstered furniture will be produced in the U.S., 21% of our upholstered furniture will be produced in Italy, and 14% of our total business will be produced in the U.S. by the end of this year.

Now let me shift your attention to the expansion of our platform.

PLATFORM EXPANSION

We continue to open the most inspiring and immersive physical experiences in our industry, and some would say the world. Spaces that are a reflection of human design, a study of balance, symmetry and perfect proportions. Spaces that blur the lines between residential and retail, indoors and outdoors, home and hospitality. Spaces with garden courtyards, rooftop restaurants, wine and barista bars. Spaces that activate all of the senses, and spaces that cannot be replicated online.

Our plan to expand the RH brand globally, address new markets locally, and transform our North American Galleries represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.

Our Platform Expansion Plans for 2025 include:

The opening of 7 Design Galleries, 2 Outdoor Galleries, plus 2 New Concept Galleries.

The seven new Design Galleries are: RH Oklahoma City, The Gallery at the Oak and RH Montreal, The Gallery at Royalmount, both opening in the first half of this year. RH Paris, The Gallery on the Champs-Élysées, RH Detroit, The Gallery in Birmingham, RH Manhasset, The Gallery at the Americana, RH San Diego, The Gallery at University Town Center, and RH Palm Desert, The Gallery on El Paseo, are all opening in the second half of this year.

Additionally, we plan to expand our brand presence in Greenwich, Connecticut, by developing a multi-building RH Design Ecosystem inclusive of the existing RH Gallery at the Historic Post Office, a freestanding RH Outdoor Gallery that opened last month, plus a New Concept Gallery in the former Ralph Lauren building on Greenwich Avenue opening in the second half of this year.

We also plan to expand our brand presence in East Hampton this Summer by opening a freestanding RH Outdoor Gallery and are exploring plans to further enhance our Design Ecosystem with a New Concept Gallery in the near future.

As previously communicated, we anticipate an inflection of our business in Europe as we begin to open in the important brand building markets of Paris in 2025, plus London and Milan in 2026, all with dramatic and brand building hospitality experiences. We believe post each opening we will begin to have the scale to support the necessary advertising investments to accelerate our growth in Europe.",http://hfbusiness.com/portals/0/logo_HFB_fb1.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 22:59:25.646722

The country is the largest textile exporter in the world, supplying apparel and footwear companies with tons of inventory.
Companies like Nike increasingly rely on Vietnam and Indonesia, which now face 46% and 32% tariffs.
It’s not just apparel makers that will be affected.
Following Trump’s announcement, which happened minutes after markets closed, share prices for Nike, Lululemon, Gap and other apparel makers tumbled.","President Donald Trump announced baseline tariffs of 10% on all imported goods on Wednesday, as well as higher ones against products imported from Asian countries that will negatively affect apparel makers like Oregon-based Nike and department stores like Seattle-headquartered Nordstrom.

China, which already had a 20% tariff levied on its exports, faces an additional 34% after Trump’s announcement. The country is the largest textile exporter in the world, supplying apparel and footwear companies with tons of inventory.

But other countries have become huge sources. Companies like Nike increasingly rely on Vietnam and Indonesia, which now face 46% and 32% tariffs.

While announcing the “reciprocal” tariff plan, Trump repeated messages from the campaign trail that sweeping tariffs would eventually bring manufacturing and other jobs back to the U.S. Shifting production strategies may not be likely or even wise for retail companies, however, leaving them in an awkward and perhaps painful spot.

“There’s nothing they can do in the short term,” said David Swartz, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar. “And realistically they won’t do anything because nobody knows how long these tariffs will last.”

Companies like Nike and Lululemon have contracts with suppliers in Vietnam and China. Contracts they can’t get out of or get around easily.

It’s not just apparel makers that will be affected. Department stores like Nordstrom are vulnerable to rising costs as well, Swartz said.

Retailers, which have struggled recently, may not weather a trade war as easily as Nike with its cash reserves or Lululemon, which might not see a decrease in demand with higher prices. Even in a strong economy, traditional retailers haven’t generated strong revenue growth.

“Most of what Nordstrom and other retailers sell is imported and that’s not going to change,” Swartz said. “Their biggest hope is that tariffs won’t last long. If they last for two months, the companies will survive. If tariffs last for a couple of years, they’ll get worried.”

Swartz said Nordstrom doesn’t have the pricing power of other retailers, meaning it could also be squeezed by rising costs and lose demand. Nordstrom’s discount Rack stores are popular, but if it has to pass off import costs to customers it could drive business to stores like Marshall’s that buy inventory already in the U.S.

But despite that, Swartz said Nordstrom will be able to get through trade turmoil. It’s about to be taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group through a $6.25 billion deal, which will keep it away from the scrutiny of Wall Street.

Following Trump’s announcement, which happened minutes after markets closed, share prices for Nike, Lululemon, Gap and other apparel makers tumbled.

Yeah, Josh, looking uh, ugly here in the after hours. Walmart stock down over four, uh, 4%. Amazon stock getting slammed, close to 5%. You just lock in on, uh, Walmart, for example. This is a company that gets about 70% of its cost of goods sold, AKA merchandise, from China. Sure, they have a big grocery business, but a lot of the, uh, apparel, sneakers, belts, you name it, they get that stuff from China. And of course, Amazon, uh, relying its marketplace sellers rely on China and the European Union. You heard the reporting there from Jen, European Union going to get slapped with a 20% tariff. China, 34%. That could cause marketplace sellers to raise prices pretty soon. That could also mean a demand pullback, potentially not good holiday shopping seasons for both of those names. But I'm holding up my Air Jordans sneaker here, guys, because before this segment, I'm like, where the hell did this sneaker come from? Guess what? It's made in China. Uh, and that's why you're seeing Nike shares down over 6% on this news. A lot of pressure, uh, on Nike. Now, they have also, uh, diversified. They're not alone, diversifying, uh, into Vietnam. Well, guess what? Vietnam, they get, uh, hit with the tariff of 46%. So all those retail executives that have told me and been very excited about, well, we, we're moving to Vietnam, we're going to try to save costs. Well, no luck. Uh, you were relying on Vietnam, you're going to get taxed a lot more. You're probably going to have to push through price increases. This is a big negative development for the apparel, uh, sneaker, and handbag industry, guys. Again, this Nike shoe and pretty much all of them are made in China.

While credit deterioration is not yet a major concern, there may be macro-driven reserve builds as banks adjust for downside risks, analysts added.

Strong trading revenues could drive upside to their earnings estimates, with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs seen as best positioned to outperform expectations.

JPMorgan

The analysts raised their Q1 earnings per share estimate for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM, ETR:CMC) to $4.71 from $4.58, above the $4.57 consensus, citing strong trading and investment banking revenues.

CEO Jamie Dimon’s commentary on the macroeconomic environment and regulatory landscape will be closely watched.

The bank’s full-year 2025 net interest income (ex-markets) guidance of $90 billion is seen as defensible in the absence of rapid rate cuts.

The analysts believe that the stock’s valuation may not be attractive enough for management to increase buybacks, which are currently assumed at around 100% total payout.

Goldman Sachs

The analysts also raised their Q1 EPS estimate for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS, ETR:GOS) to $12.98 from $12.25, exceeding the $12.52 consensus.

While tougher trading and M&A advisory comparisons against JPMorgan and peers may temper growth, the potential for a headline earnings beat remains, driven by strong markets revenue, Bank of America believes.

Wells Fargo

The analysts downwardly revised their Q1 EPS forecast for Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC, ETR:NWT) to $1.17 from $1.23, versus the $1.24 consensus but noted the stock “remains a top idea for us.”

They attributed this to a conservative fee forecast despite expectations for a trading rebound to approximately $1.4 billion quarter-over-quarter.

Investment banking may benefit from market share gains, but equity gains are expected to drop off significantly after a strong $715 million performance in Q4 2024.

The key issue for Wells Fargo remains the ongoing asset cap imposed by regulators, which continues to limit growth potential. “[Wells Fargo] needs asset-cap removed to clear the decks for both management and the Street to reframe the risk/reward,” analysts wrote.

Citigroup

The analysts raised their Q1 EPS estimate for Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) to $1.86 from $1.83, slightly below the $1.89 consensus.

“While results may not be a catalyst, these could serve as a clearing event into the June stress test results where we expect Citi to see some capital relief,” they wrote.

The pace of buybacks remains a key focus, with analysts assuming $1.5 billion in repurchases for Q2 2025, ramping up to $3 billion per quarter in the second half of the year.

Citigroup’s ability to defend its pre-provision net revenue against a weaker revenue environment will also be closely watched.

Morgan Stanley

For Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), the analysts reduced their Q1 EPS estimate to $2.23 from $2.24, below the $2.29 consensus, which includes approximately $150 million of drag related to severance charges.

“Equities trading strength and lagged impact on wealth from market weakness (more a Q2 event) should combine for a strong Q1 2025,” they believe.

Investors will closely monitor net new asset growth, which has averaged several billion dollars per quarter over the past year, as a key indicator of future acceleration, the analysts added.

This article Levi's Q1 To See EPS Growth, Revenue Dip, And Tariff Edge, Says Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com © 2025 Benzinga.com.","Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey reiterated an Outperform rating on Wednesday on the shares of Levi Strauss & Co (NYSE:LEVI) with an unchanged price forecast of $23.00.

LEVI is set to release its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on April 7 after market close. The analyst expects EPS of $0.28, up from $0.26 last year, aligning with consensus estimates.

Revenue is projected to decline 1.3% year-over-year to $1.537 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $1.542 billion. Growth of 1% is anticipated in the Americas and Other Brands segments, while Europe and Asia are expected to see declines of 2% and 7%, respectively.

Gross margin is estimated to improve by 180 basis points to 60.0%, slightly exceeding the 59.9% consensus. Operating margin is expected to reach 10.4%, up from 9.0% last year, and in line with consensus projections.

For fiscal 2025, the company expects reported revenue to decline by 1%-2% from $6.355 billion in FY24, while organic revenue is projected to grow 3.5%-4.5%.

Levi expects FY25 EPS between $1.20-$1.25, aligning with or slightly below last year’s $1.25, while consensus estimates predict EPS of $1.25 with a 1% revenue decline.

LEVI sees tariffs as a potential competitive advantage. The company sources from over 25 countries, with less than 1% of imports coming from China, down from historical levels of 15%-16% and about 5% from Mexico, said the analyst.

Since most production in China and India is for local markets, the recently imposed 25% tariffs in 2025 are expected to have minimal impact.

LEVI rebounded in fourth-quarter FY24 with strong revenue growth after missing expectations in the second and third-quarter. All regions and channels saw notable sequential improvements, with record gross margins achieved without increased promotions.

Looking ahead, the company’s FY25 guidance remains conservative, with lower-than-expected revenue and EPS forecasts, partly due to FX headwinds. Meanwhile, EBIT margin projections offer upside potential.

Levi’s remains well-positioned long-term, benefiting from a stabilizing U.S. denim market, growing direct-to-consumer sales, and product innovation, noted the analyst.

The company has streamlined operations in FY25 by exiting non-core businesses, including Denizen and European footwear, while preparing to sell Dockers. This shift aims to enhance profitability and reduce revenue volatility.

Price Action: LEVI shares traded higher by 1.89% at $16.69 at last check Wednesday.

Albertsons is set to unveil its full-year earnings forecast, expected to align with Wall Street's expectations, as analyzed by Oppenheimer.

What does this mean?

Projections indicate Albertsons will stick to Oppenheimer's forecast of $2.30 per share for fiscal 2025, closely matching the $2.31 consensus from FactSet. The grocer's strategic plan to save $1.5 billion over three years highlights its focus on customer value and reinvesting in growth, with all first-year savings slated for reinvestment. Challenges such as lower adjusted gross margins from increased pharmacy sales and delivery costs persist, yet Albertsons is determined to hit its fiscal targets. With its traditionally cautious approach to guidance expected to continue, investors are showing increased optimism thanks to strong grocery trends and reduced tariff threats.

Why should I care?

For markets: Banking on the basics.

Investor interest in dedicated grocery retailers like Albertsons is growing, driven by stable grocery sector trends and easing tariff tensions. As Albertsons prepares to report its fourth-quarter results on April 15, there's anticipation of at least $0.41 earnings per share, fueled by 2% identical sales growth led by pharmacy benefits and food inflation.

“Construction spending rebounded in February, following widespread severe weather that may have slowed projects in January,” said Simonson.
""I expect substantial additional spending on highway and rail projects, and possibly broadband internet buildout in poorly connected areas,” Simonson said.
For example, public nonresidential construction spending jumped 6.1% compared to last February.
Meanwhile, private nonresidential spending hasn’t been able to match broader economic metrics.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

Nonresidential construction spending increased 0.3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.26 trillion, the highest level on record, according to an Associated Builders and Contractors analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data released Tuesday.

Spending rose in nine of the 16 nonresidential subcategories, led by a surge in highway and street construction, which accounted for over 40% of the overall monthly gain, said Anirban Basu, ABC chief economist. Private nonresidential spending increased 0.4% during the month, while public spending jumped 0.2%.

Despite the record-setting total, growth remains uneven across project types, as contractors face high interest rates and trade policy uncertainty, said Basu.

Dive Insight:

Although spending may be at an all-time high, recent hiring practices by contractors suggest they expect fewer opportunities in the near term, said Ken Simonson, chief economist at the Associated General Contractors of America. Hiring and job openings both dropped in February, potentially a foreshadowing of a construction slowdown, he said.

“Construction spending rebounded in February, following widespread severe weather that may have slowed projects in January,” said Simonson. “Investment remains positive compared to a year ago but the growth rate for all major categories has cooled, while contractors have trimmed hiring and slashed job openings.”

Simonson also said the record spending number doesn’t necessarily indicate a high water mark.

""I expect substantial additional spending on highway and rail projects, and possibly broadband internet buildout in poorly connected areas,” Simonson said. “There has been rapid growth in water, wastewater, and airport construction, so it is hard to tell if this has peaked yet.”

But despite the new monthly high, the pace of growth tells a different story, said Basu.

For example, public nonresidential construction spending jumped 6.1% compared to last February.

At the forefront of Orchestra BioMed’s efforts is the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, conducted in collaboration with Medtronic (NYSE: MDT). This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of AVIM therapy as a treatment for uncontrolled hypertension in pacemaker patients. By modulating intervals to lower blood pressure and enhance diastolic function, AVIM therapy has the potential to redefine the standard of care for such patients. “We believe this therapy can lead to landmark results and lay the foundation for its use in managing blood pressure and cardiovascular health in high-risk populations,” said David Hochman, Chairman, CEO, and Founder of Orchestra BioMed.

Additionally, the company is advancing its Virtue SAB program. A revised study design for the U.S. coronary pivotal study on in-stent restenosis (ISR) has been submitted to the FDA. This study will compare the Virtue SAB, which delivers extended focal-release sirolimus without a balloon coating, to Boston Scientific’s AGENT drug-coated balloon for ISR treatment. FDA approval of the amended investigational device exemption (IDE) is expected in the second quarter of 2025, with study initiation targeted for the second half of the year.

Addressing Strategic Partnerships

Orchestra BioMed is currently restructuring its partnership with Terumo. To expedite this process, both parties have agreed to enter formal mediation, with a resolution anticipated by the second quarter of 2025. The outcome of these discussions is expected to align with the anticipated launch of the Virtue ISR-US pivotal study later this year.

Leadership Enhancements

The company has reinforced its leadership with new appointments to its board of directors. Christopher Cleary, former Senior Vice President at Medtronic, John Mack, former President of Cardiac Surgery at Medtronic, and David Pacitti, CEO of Avanos Medical, bring deep expertise in the medical device and cardiovascular sectors. Additionally, Mark Pomeranz has joined as Executive Vice President & General Manager, Interventional Therapies. Pomeranz has over two decades of experience in medical device innovation, further bolstering Orchestra BioMed’s senior management team.

Key Financial Highlights

Revenue for 2024 was $2.6 million, a slight decline from $2.8 million in 2023, attributed to reduced recognition of partnership revenues.

R&D Expenses increased to $42.8 million from $33.8 million in 2023, reflecting higher costs tied to the BACKBEAT pivotal study.

Net Loss for the year was $61.0 million, or $1.66 per share, compared to $49.1 million, or $1.48 per share, in 2023. The net loss included $10.6 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents totaled $66.8 million as of December 31, 2024, supported by $15.0 million raised through stock sales and $15.0 million drawn from a credit facility.

Looking Ahead

Orchestra BioMed remains committed to advancing its core programs. Upcoming milestones include securing FDA approval for the IDE for the Virtue SAB pivotal study in the second quarter of 2025 and completing site activations for the BACKBEAT study. The company continues to focus on clinical innovation, operational efficiency, and strategic partnerships to address significant unmet needs in cardiovascular care.

By combining breakthrough technologies with skilled leadership, Orchestra BioMed is well-positioned to drive meaningful advances in cardiovascular therapy. Its commitment to transforming care for patients with hypertension and ISR underscores its role as a leader in medical innovation.",https://i0.wp.com/www.mychesco.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Orchestra-BioMed.jpg?fit=736%2C400&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-02 10:06:10.327095

The high-impact session provided deep insights into the bank’s financial standing and strategic direction, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable growth and stakeholder engagement.

Participants had the opportunity to interact directly with the bank’s board members and executives, gaining a clearer understanding of OmniBSIC Bank’s performance and long-term vision.

Speaking at the event, Managing Director Daniel Asiedu emphasised that the bank’s impressive growth trajectory is the result of deliberate strategy, disciplined execution, and a commitment to sound banking principles.

“This level of performance is not coincidental. It is the outcome of meticulous planning, strategic decision-making, and a relentless focus on delivering value to our customers and shareholders,” he stated.

He highlighted key milestones, including the successful recapitalisation in 2021, the bank’s first profit in 2023, and its impressive financial performance in 2024 with a profit of GHC314 million, doubling the bank’s profit for 2023. The bank’s 2024 results also indicated robust growth in total assets to GHC9.4 billion, driven by a 70% increase in customer deposits to GHC8.2 billion, to end the year very liquid and well capitalised. During the same period, the bank expanded its loan portfolio to GHC1.03 billion from GHC580 million in 2023, a growth of 77%, to support business and economic growth.

Asiedu underscored the bank’s cautious lending approach, balancing sustainable expansion with strong client relationships.

OmniBSIC, Ghana’s fastest-growing bank, remains dedicated to enhancing shareholder value, investing in staff development, and fostering diversity within its workforce. “Our responsibility to shareholders is clear—we are building a bank that is financially strong, operationally efficient, and strategically positioned for long-term growth,” Asiedu affirmed.

Board Chair, Teresa Effie Cooke echoed these sentiments, emphasising the bank’s commitment to exceeding customer and stakeholder expectations. A notable achievement in diversity is the bank’s near 50/50 gender balance, underscoring its dedication to equal opportunity and inclusive leadership. “Diversity strengthens our institution, and we remain committed to fostering an equitable workplace where all employees can thrive,” Cooke stated.

Looking ahead, OmniBSIC Bank is focused on solidifying its position as a key player in Ghana’s financial sector. Its growth strategy includes strengthening its capital base, expanding market share, enhancing product and service offerings, as well as investing in cutting-edge digital solutions, amongst others. “Our trajectory is clear, and our focus remains on sustainable growth, innovation, and delivering superior banking experiences,” Asiedu noted.

By continuously improving operational efficiency and embracing financial technology, OmniBSIC Bank is positioning itself to compete at a higher level, ensuring that customers and stakeholders receive exceptional value in the evolving banking landscape in Ghana.

Headquartered in Accra’s Airport City, OmniBSIC Bank serves its customers through a network of 40 branches across Ghana. The bank also offers a comprehensive suite of products, services, and digital solutions tailored to corporate, SME, and individual needs while actively supporting the communities within which it operates.

To deliver exceptional banking experiences daily, OmniBSIC Bank prioritises investment in technology and employee development. This commitment is reflected in its rigorous staff selection process and comprehensive capacity-building programmes.

OmniBSIC Bank has undergone a comprehensive transformation, showing improvements across all parameters—including financial performance—while achieving numerous successes and receiving multiple recognitions, including the Most Customer-Centric Bank (CIMG, 2022), The Fastest-Growing Corporate Bank in Ghana (Global Banking and Finance Awards, 2023), The Best Bank in Ghana (Ghana Business Awards, 2023), Bank of the year (Ghana Business Standard Awards, 2024), SME Bank of the Year (Ghana Credit Excellence Awards, 2024), Best Ghanaian Owned Emerging Band (Made-In – Ghana Awards, 2024) as well as Best Corporate Bank, Ghana ( Global Banking and Finance Awards, 2024).

Finding a Solution Won’t Be Easy For sportswear brands, moving production out of Vietnam is not a simple solution.

Now, things could get even worse. The United States government is planning to impose new tariffs on products imported from Vietnam. Since Nike produces a huge portion of its shoes and clothes in Vietnam, these new tariffs could mean higher costs for the company.

Nike makes half of its shoes and more than a quarter of its clothes in Vietnam. If the U.S. adds tariffs to these products, Nike will have to decide between raising its prices or absorbing the extra costs. But Nike is already lowering prices on some items to clear out its old inventory. If prices go up too much, fewer people might buy their products, especially since other brands are competing hard for customers.

“If tariffs are extended there, then Nike’s got a problem,” said David Swartz, an analyst.

3 Asian Giants Japan, China and South Korea Unite Against US Tariffs, Pursue Bold Free Trade Pact

Nike isn’t the only company that would be affected. Adidas, another major sportswear company, also relies heavily on Vietnam for production. While Adidas doesn’t make as much in Vietnam as Nike does, it still gets 39% of its shoes and 18% of its clothing from the country. Other brands like Lululemon, Columbia Sportswear, and Amer Sports also depend on Vietnam as a key manufacturing hub.

Why Vietnam Matters to Sportswear Brands

Over the years, Vietnam has become one of the most important places for making sportswear. Many brands have moved their production there to avoid high costs in China. Vietnam is known for producing high-tech running shoes, sportswear, and outdoor gear at competitive prices. But now, with the U.S. government considering tariffs, this advantage could disappear.

Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on footwear from Vietnam is 13.6%, while apparel has an 18.8% tariff, according to Sheng Lu, a professor at the University of Delaware. If these rates go even higher, companies will have to pay much more to bring their products into the U.S. This will affect not just big names like Nike and Adidas but also smaller brands that rely heavily on Vietnam for their products.

Ecuador’s Shocking 27% Tariff Triggers Explosive Trade Clash with Mexico

One of these smaller brands is On, a fast-growing running shoe company. In 2024, On sourced 90% of its shoes and 60% of its apparel from Vietnam. Samuel Wenger, the company’s chief operating officer, acknowledged that tariffs play a role in pricing decisions. “Our premium brand gives us the ability to adapt our pricing thoughtfully,” he said.

Sneaker prices in the U.S. have already gone up by 25% since 2019 due to rising production costs, according to Beth Goldstein, a footwear industry analyst. More price increases could be difficult for shoppers to accept, especially as consumer confidence in the U.S. has dropped to its lowest level in four years.

Finding a Solution Won’t Be Easy

For sportswear brands, moving production out of Vietnam is not a simple solution. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia and Indonesia, also make sportswear, but they might face tariffs too. Plus, production costs in these countries are already rising as more brands look to shift away from Vietnam and China.

Trump’s Tariff War Stalls Chinese Investment in Mexico

Factories in Cambodia, for example, are charging 5% to 10% more than before as they receive more orders from companies looking to diversify their supply chains, said Michael Yee, CEO of apparel sourcing company MGF Sourcing. This means that even if Nike or Adidas moves production elsewhere, they might still face higher costs.

Despite the concerns, some experts believe that Vietnam might not get hit with tariffs as hard as China. The Vietnamese government has taken steps to strengthen its relationship with the U.S., such as agreeing to import more American goods and lowering duties. Johannes Loefstrand, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, noted that Vietnam has been skillful in managing its geopolitical ties with the U.S.

Meanwhile, Wilbur Ross, who served as commerce secretary in the Trump administration, pointed out that the president had generally good ties with Vietnam and had no reason to impose tariffs that would be strongly felt by everyday consumers. “People notice the cost of apparel because they buy it fairly frequently,” Ross said.",https://regtechtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Regtech-Times-2025-04-02T142413.173.png,N,,2025-04-02 08:03:32.695383

As the April 2 tariff date approaches, brands like Nike and Adidas will need to make tough decisions—fast.
For those tracking the fallout, investors can compare Nike, Adidas, Puma, and On stocks side by side using the TipRanks Stocks Comparison tool.","Trump’s looming tariffs on Vietnam could deliver a brutal hit to U.S. sportswear brands—especially Nike (NKE). The company currently manufactures half of its footwear and nearly a third of its apparel in Vietnam, according to Reuters. If these imports get taxed under the new trade measures launching on April 2, Nike could be forced to either eat the added costs or raise prices—neither of which is great news for a brand already battling falling sales.

Vietnam Dependency Puts Nike and Adidas in the Firing Line

Nike isn’t alone. Adidas (ADDYY), which produces 39% of its footwear and 18% of its apparel in Vietnam, also faces a painful squeeze if the tariffs go through. Moreover, the White House is considering broadening its trade retaliation beyond China, and Vietnam—America’s fifth-largest goods supplier—is next in line. That leaves major apparel and footwear brands scrambling to assess impact.

Smaller Brands Like On and Puma Also Get Hit

It’s not just the giants. Puma (PMMAF) and On (ONON) are both heavily exposed to Vietnam and could be hit just as hard—if not harder. Puma’s shares have already slumped 23% this year following weak profit guidance, and the added pressure from tariffs could deepen the blow. For On, a newer player with fast-growing momentum, added costs could threaten its margins before it ever gets a chance to scale properly.

Vietnam Tries to Lessen the Blow

Vietnam, for its part, is trying to patch things up. The country has cut tariffs on certain U.S. products and approved SpaceX’s Starlink service to smooth over trade relations. But exports to the U.S. make up 30% of Vietnam’s GDP, making it especially vulnerable.

The retail sector is already sounding alarms. H&M’s CEO warned that U.S. consumers could end up footing the bill. As the April 2 tariff date approaches, brands like Nike and Adidas will need to make tough decisions—fast.

Ferrexpo, an iron ore company with assets in Ukraine, that is listed on the London Stock Exchange, produced 489.72 thousand tonnes of DR-pellets in 2024, while no such products were produced in 2023. This is stated in the company’s report.

Total pellets output in 2024 increased by 58% y/y to 6.07 million tons.

In Q4 2024, Ferrexpo increased pellets production by 18% q/q to 1.503 million tonnes, incl. 163.55 thousand tons of DR-pellets.

“In the challenging circumstances, it is pleasing to report a strong increase in production for 2024 – our best annual production performance since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. The higher production reflects our ability to access Ukrainian Black Sea ports again and resume exports to customers in MENA and Asia.” – comments Lucio Genovese, Interim Executive Chair of Ferrexpo.

In total, 37 ocean going vessels were loaded in 2024, comprising 32 vessels from Ukraine and five from other ports, compared to just 19 (from Romania) in 2023.

According to Genovese, one of the key achievements of 2024 was setting a new annual record for DR-pellet production.

“These higher quality pellets generate a higher revenue for the business, which is particularly relevant as we continue to experience high input costs. In the fourth quarter, it is also interesting to note that we increased our production of high grade pellets and concentrate, which contributed to lowering our fixed cost base as production levels increased. This is a further example of flexibility, adjusting our production and sales strategies to match evolving market dynamics.” – added Ferrexpo`s Interim Executive Chair.

Meanwhile, low iron ore prices and high raw material costs continue to put pressure on Ferrexpo. Due to ongoing attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, the company is forced to import electricity from the EU at higher tariffs.

As GMK Center reported, at the end of 2023, Ferrexpo reduced the output of pellets by 36% compared to 2022 – to 3.845 million tons.

Dive Brief:

PVH Corp. fourth quarter revenue was down 5% year over year to $2.4 billion, beating the company’s previous guidance of a 6% to 7% decrease, according to a Monday earnings report. Full year revenue dropped 6% to $8.7 billion, in line with the lower end of the company’s guidance.

At the Tommy Hilfiger brand, both Q4 and full year revenue fell 5% year over year. Calvin Klein’s fourth quarter revenue dropped 2%, while the brand’s full year revenue fell 1%.

The company forecasted flat to slightly increased revenue in 2025, but with revenue projected to be flat or down 2% in the first quarter.

Dive Insight:

PVH has been working to boost the value of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger as part of its strategic PVH+ Plan. The company has also made several recent executive changes, including naming a new CEO of Americas in December and appointing Veronica Leoni as creative director of Calvin Klein in May 2024.

Alice Price, apparel analyst at GlobalData, said in emailed comments that the company’s Q4 improvement suggests the PVH+ Plan “is starting to have legs, as it focuses on developing its key growth categories, increasing consumer engagement and improving efficiencies.” However, she added that the company’s 2025 revenue projections show that “its strategy still has a long way to go before delivering a full turnaround.”

At Tommy Hilfiger, international revenue fell 7% in Q4, with North America revenue remaining flat for the quarter. Full-year revenue figures were the same.

Calvin Klein posted a 4% fourth quarter international decrease and a 3% increase in North America for the same period. The brand’s full fiscal revenue dropped 1%, with its international revenue down 2% and its North America revenue down 1%.

Year-over-year revenue at the company’s Heritage Brands dropped 41% in Q4, including a 28% decrease resulting from the sale of its women's intimates business. For the full year, Heritage Brands revenue was down 57% year over year, including a 45% decrease resulting from the sale.

“In a challenging macro, we delivered another year of strong profitability in North America, drove sequential improvements in our wholesale order books in Europe while improving our quality of sales, and we achieved our third consecutive year of growth in Asia Pacific, on a constant currency basis,” CEO Stefan Larsson said in a statement.

Revenue from the company’s owned and operated stores decreased 4% in the fourth quarter, while revenue from the company’s digital commerce business was down 10%. Total Q4 DTC revenue dropped 5%, including a 4% decline from the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. PVH said its North America growth “was more than offset by the continuation of the Company’s planned strategic reduction of sales in Europe.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hmJpZN4x0T-MMNPJug5GeAL5LmXIuuLbJknNo3BYafs/g:nowe:0:272/c:3200:1807/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xOTk5MjMwMTY4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-04-02 08:03:43.908472

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global Greece Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 55.0 in March from 52.6 in February, signaling a significant improvement in operating conditions for Greek manufacturers.

A PMI reading above 50 indicates growth, while below 50 signals contraction.

The March data highlighted a notable uptick in demand, with new orders and export sales rising at the fastest pace in nearly a year, supported by stronger domestic and foreign demand.

That prompted manufacturers to increase their workforce at the sharpest rate since January 2022.

“Growth in the Greek manufacturing sector accelerated at the end of the first quarter, as the pace of expansion reached the strongest for almost a year,” said Sian Jones, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence:

“Improvements in demand conditions supported greater output, new orders, input buying and employment.”

However, inflationary pressures intensified, with input costs rising at the quickest rate since November 2022.

This led to a corresponding increase in selling prices as manufacturers passed on higher costs to customers.

Despite these challenges, manufacturers expressed optimism about future output growth, buoyed by expectations of continued demand strength and increased construction activity.

We believe that for food to be delicious, it first has to be real and made with the highest quality ingredients.
“Our customers deserve real food with real ingredients – and that’s exactly what's on the menu at McDonald’s.","At McDonald’s, we feed nearly 90% of the U.S. population every year. But have you ever wondered what it takes to serve real, delicious, and affordable food to 26 million Americans each day?

Behind every meal are the people making it possible: from the potato growers in Idaho, cattle ranchers in Texas, and bakers in Illinois, to the small business owners who operate restaurants in communities across the country.

We don’t take our role at the heart of American food lightly – and it’s why we’re continuously working to make it even better for the future. How do we do that? It starts with four promises.

1. We put quality first

The millions of Americans who visit us have high expectations—and rightly so. They want quality, delicious food. But too often, good food with real ingredients means compromising on price or convenience.

That’s not how we do things at McDonald’s. We use real ingredients, many of which are grown, raised, and harvested by local farmers and ranchers. From beef, chicken and fish to potatoes and eggs, it is something we’ll never compromise on. And our long-term relationships mean our suppliers can thrive and grow with us.

What’s not in our food is just as important. Our seven classic burgers—from our Big Mac® to the Quarter Pounder® with Cheese—contain no artificial preservatives or flavors, and no added colors from artificial sources (except the pickle).

The result? Delicious food you can feel good about enjoying:

We use 100% pure beef patties, seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper. We have two partners who have supplied our beef since the day we opened our very first restaurants.

Our Chicken McNuggets® are made with 100% white meat, with no artificial preservatives, colors or flavors. And customers love them: we sell about 700 million pounds of McNuggets every year.

All Filet-O-Fish sandwiches in the U.S. are made with 100% wild-caught Alaska Pollock from U.S. waters, the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands right off the coast of Alaska.

We use freshly cracked eggs on our Egg McMuffin® sandwiches—and all the eggs we source in the U.S. are 100% cage-free.

Our Happy Meal products make balanced meals more accessible by offering recommended food group items like apples and low-fat milks.

In 2023, we bought more than $6.4 billion of quality ingredients in the U.S. That includes 714 million pounds of beef, 133 million pounds of cheese, 2.6 billion pounds of potatoes and nearly 2 billion 100% cage-free eggs. Take our famous fries as just one example – our customers enjoy 3.6 billion servings per year in the U.S., which is more than 255 billion individual fries.

2. We listen to our customers

We’ve been obsessed with using real, quality ingredients since the day we opened our very first restaurant. And over the years, we’ve evolved our menu to keep pace with the latest customer preferences. Our menu provides clear and transparent nutrition information to help customers like you make informed choices about the menu items you know and love. And we know what’s not in your food is just as important as what’s in your food.

Our seven classic burgers—from our Big Mac® to the Quarter Pounder® with Cheese—contain no artificial preservatives or flavors, and no added colors from artificial sources (except the pickle).

Food additives such as, Red Dye No. 3, TBHQ, BHT/BHA, Titanium Dioxide and Azodicarbonamide are not on the menu.

3. We do right by our supplier partners and help their businesses grow

Over our 70-year history, we’ve carefully selected farmers and suppliers and built strong and long-term relationships based on a simple, shared mission: to serve safe, quality food every day.

It means we can set high standards together and that they can grow with us and create good jobs across the nation.

We have around 30 suppliers that make up 2/3 of our food and packaging.

Our relationships with suppliers create jobs and growth. In 2023 in Houston, we spent $104M with suppliers and supported 15,200 jobs. And in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, it was $85M and 9,800 jobs.

On any given day in 2023, more than 60,000 food safety audits were conducted at McDonald’s restaurants across the country.

“Our suppliers’ actions reverberate throughout the industry. Their commitment to quality, rigorous standards and ability to innovate impacts not just how the food we source is grown—it has the power to change entire industries.”

– Cesar Piña, Chief Supply Chain Officer, McDonald’s USA

4. We innovate together to strengthen America’s future food system.

From finding new ways to farm that protect the local environment and help strengthen small businesses, to growing potatoes that taste better and grow quicker, to working across the food industry to make cage-free eggs the norm: it’s our partnerships that make it all possible. And we’re excited to help make American food even better for the future.

We believe that for food to be delicious, it first has to be real and made with the highest quality ingredients. And when we do that in close partnership with the suppliers who make it possible, we can serve millions of customers every day while supporting thousands of good jobs and strengthening American food for the future.

“Our customers deserve real food with real ingredients – and that’s exactly what's on the menu at McDonald’s. Because when it comes to our food, we like to keep things simple – it’s all about great taste, great quality, and great value.” - Michael Gonda, SVP, Chief Impact Officer of North America for McDonald's",https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/logo/mcd_corp_social_feed_default.jpg,N,,2025-04-01 20:02:50.663738

As the global revenue of the sportswear company rose by 5.2 per cent to nearly US $ 17.5 billion, the company attributed the robust performance in the international space to the significant increase in online sales. The global sales grew substantially, rising to 20 per cent of total revenue from 17.4 per cent recorded in the previous year.

Grocery stores are set to take a particular hit, and some of your favorites may be more in trouble than you think.
There's something cosy and vaguely nostalgic about Winn-Dixie, the Southeastern grocery chain that operates across five different states.
2025 looks to be an incredibly tough year for the supermarket chain, with its stores closing across the country at warp speed.
Piggly Wiggly has to take the award for the grocery chain with the most charming name.","It's a hard time to be a grocery store. Over the last few years, grocery chains have had to battle a perfect storm of post-pandemic changes in customer behavior, rising prices from the cost of living crisis and the potential for tariffs, and advances in technology which have left physical stores more and more obsolete. This meant that 2024 saw the highest number of grocery stores closing since 2020, with folks turning to ordering groceries online to replace it. ""Not only do they want the best prices, but they also have no patience for stores that are constantly disorganized, out of stock, and that deliver poor customer service,"" says Deborah Weinswig, the CEO of Coresight Research, a firm which led analysis into current and future store closures across the U.S., via Business Wire.

Unfortunately, things are only going to get worse from here. Coresight Research also issued a grave prediction that 2025 is set to see even more closures, with as many as 15,000 stores closing its doors this year. Grocery stores are set to take a particular hit, and some of your favorites may be more in trouble than you think. Giants like Walmart, Kroger, and Albertsons are set to close several stores in 2025, and others are following suit. Let's take a look at some of the major chains set to shut some of their doors.

On the surface, it seems like Walmart is untouchable. The world's largest company by revenue, it has approximately 4,600 stores across the United States of America, with thousands more across the world. However, even a business as mammoth as Walmart hasn't been immune to the economic shocks that have been ravaging retailers across the country, and as a result the normally affordable supermarket has had to raise its prices, with its eggs taking a particular hit.

This may well have left customers going elsewhere for their weekly grocery shopping, and certain stores in Walmart's line-up have suffered the consequences. The retail giant is closing a number of its stores in California throughout 2025, with others in Georgia and Ohio shutting up shop. It's also going through a reconfiguration on a higher level, with its North Carolina office closing, resulting in some job losses. This is part of a broader move by the retailer to bolster its main hubs in California and Arkansas, but it's still not the best look for the company.

If you're worried about Walmart going out of business any time soon, though, we wouldn't be. Over the next few years, Walmart is aiming to build or convert 150 additional stores, and remodel a large chunk of its existing locations. The retailer states that this will see more jobs being created, which is welcome news. Now if they could just do something about those Walmart groceries that are gonna see a price jump, we'd be fine.

There's a lot of change happening when you shop at Albertsons. The massive grocery chain announced in 2022 that it would be acquired by Kroger, which would have allowed both companies to team up and take on their gargantuan competitors like Walmart and Costco more capably. The deal, however, ended up making its way to the courts, where judges disputed the claim that companies like Walmart were direct competitors for Albertsons and Kroger, and flagged concerns that the joining of the two would lead to market domination in certain areas.

As a consequence, the merger was blocked — and Albertsons has had to shoulder the consequences. In an earnings call in January 2025, Albertsons' leaders stated that they would be looking to close some stores over the coming year as part of a streamlining effort. The company had reached the conclusion that its portfolio of stores was outsized in some areas, while also pointing out that it would be looking to open stores elsewhere. Albertsons didn't specify which stores would be closing (and it also pointed out that the closure process could extend to several years), but we wouldn't be too surprised if your local supermarket was a little worried.

Although Kroger has had a tough couple years, with its acquisition of Albertsons being scuppered before it got to the finish line and some food recalls it probably wants to forget, it's still managed to hold onto almost 2,800 stores across the country. Sadly, though, it's looking as though a few of those will be closing pretty soon — and those doors have already started shutting. In late January, Kroger announced the closure of its Belle Meade Plaza store in Nashville. It was one of several businesses that has been affected by redevelopment plans in the area, with retail and residential units planned to be built in its place.

Kroger will also see its Sterling Ridge location close in The Woodlands, Texas, with a planned final operation date of May 6. Although its other stores in the area will stay active, this particular Kroger location has suffered from a change in shopping habits in the immediate area. The way people buy their groceries has quite simply changed, and low foot traffic has rendered this store obsolete. The employees who currently work at the store will go through a reassignment process to hopefully work at other locations.

There's something cosy and vaguely nostalgic about Winn-Dixie, the Southeastern grocery chain that operates across five different states. Perhaps that partly comes from its local feel, and partly from the fact that it's never been a massive chain that has made it to other parts of the country. Unfortunately, that's also made it a threat for the bigger sharks in the supermarket ocean. In 2023, Winn-Dixie was acquired by Aldi, giving the German retailer the ability to make big moves across the Southeastern market and the potential to shut and convert stores at its will. Aldi also acquired Harvey's, another Southeastern favorite that may soon disappear from view completely.

It looks like it's pressing on with its plans pretty quickly. Reports of Winn-Dixie stores closing or being converted are springing up regularly in 2025. Two stores in Columbus and Phenix City have announced their closures in April and May, while others in Fort Lauderdale, Jackson, and Orlando have begun the conversion process into Aldis. In total, roughly 50 Winn-Dixie and Harvey's stores are due to be converted in the next 12 months or so. To be honest, we'd be surprised if any locations still existed at all by the end of the decade.

Someone needs to check on Safeway — we're not sure if it's alright. 2025 looks to be an incredibly tough year for the supermarket chain, with its stores closing across the country at warp speed. In February, Safeway had to shut its Webster Street store in San Francisco, citing customer safety concerns and persistent occurrences of theft. The city itself has been roundly criticized for not thinking of a plan that can cover this store's closure, which has left its residents without any full-service grocery stores in the immediate area. Given that Safeway took its pharmacy with it, many people have been left without easy access to medication.

Elsewhere, Safeway's fortunes aren't looking much better. The retailer is set to close its Rockville Pike, Maryland store in April, although this information was revealed by the employees of the store itself and not a press release. Another store in the Bay Area is due to shut in mid-April, with safety concerns again cited by Safeway as the reason, although it did also mention financial pressures as a driver for ceasing operations. Curiously, all of this has been done without any clear blow to Safeway's overall finances. In Q3 of 2024, it reported higher identical and digital sales, and for all intents and purposes appears to be a healthy company. Perhaps things are a bit more complicated than they appear, though.

Part of the appeal of Shaw's is that it's always been a big fish in a relatively small pond, which has given it a sense of familiarity. The retailer operates its 125 stores exclusively in the New England region, and while it may not have the footprint of Walmart, it has a local feel that's a bit more cosy. Unfortunately, that may not be lasting much longer. Shaw's recently announced that it was closing two of its stores in New England in 2025, and it could be the case that more are to follow.

The Shaw's store closures in Gloucester, Massachusetts and Concord, New Hampshire were announced in mid-March, with employees being relocated to nearby locations. ""Like all retailers, we're constantly evaluating the performance of our stores,"" the retailer said in a statement seen via Boston.com. ""Closing a location is always a tough decision, but we're focused on continuing to provide the products and services our customers value most."" The good news is that there are dozens of locations in both states that are still operating, but it's never a good sign when a supermarket seems to be shutting up shop.

You would think that with the unstoppable march of Amazon taking over all our lives, and the frankly wild amount of money the company makes, its brick-and-mortar grocery concept Amazon Fresh would be able to get an immediate foothold on the market. Well, interestingly, that hasn't quite been the case. In March 2025, the chain announced the closure of two of its stores California and Virginia, with the Virginia branch to close pretty much immediately and the California one to shut at the end of April.

The branches had only been in operation for a couple years before they had to close, which raised question marks about whether Amazon Fresh's pitch of ""frictionless"" technology, where you can just walk out without having to scan anything, was appealing to customers. People have already started dubbing them zombie stores, after all. However, Amazon was very keen to make the point that it was still committed to Amazon Fresh and figuring out exactly what works for customers. Perhaps it was just these few stores that didn't quite hit the mark, and we'd be surprised if it disappears completely any time soon. However, we could be seeing the beginnings of a rare misstep for Amazon.

Piggly Wiggly has to take the award for the grocery chain with the most charming name. However, even that can't save it from having to close its stores. 2025 will see several of its branches closing, and while its presence in the South is still pretty strong, it's made us question how long this iconic brand can last. It all started going awry in January, when the Piggly Wiggly in Lanett, Alabama announced that it was closing. The closure put an end to the long presence that Piggly Wiggly had in the community.

Things got even worse from there on in, with a beloved Piggly Wiggly in Columbia, South Carolina announcing that it was shutting its doors for the final time in March. Nicknamed ""The Social Pig,"" the store was a favorite of locals and university students alike, and was well-known as being a fixture in Columbia. ""Our lease has expired, and being unable to effectuate another that would continue the store as Piggly Wiggly, it is my sad duty to announce that our iconic Pig on Devine — the 'Social Pig' — is closing,"" said operator Darrell Miller in a post on Facebook. ""I submit our sincere thanks to the residents of the surrounding communities and the Greater Columbia area for your steadfast and generous support over the past fifty years. You have blessed us."" The post was flooded with comments in tribute to the store. These places matter, folks.

Dollar General may be a discount store, but it takes its income and profit margins very seriously. The chain, which sells discount groceries as well as a host of other goods, operates thousands of stores around the country, and it's not afraid to make bold moves when some of them aren't working. This was proven in a Q4 2024 investor call, in which Dollar General announced that it had conducted a ""store portfolio optimization review."" This is intense corporate talk for ""we checked how much money our stores were making, and some of them need to go.""

Advertisement

As a result, Dollar General told investors that it was to close 96 of its stores by the start of 2026. It also noted that it was going to convert six of its pOpshelf stores to Dollar General outlets in the same period, and close pOpshelf stores as well. This is a pretty dramatic move from the chain, and could see plenty of folks without a local Dollar General to buy cut-price goods from — which, at a time like this, isn't great news. The store didn't indicate which stores were going to be closed, but we should expect further announcements very soon.",https://www.thedailymeal.com/img/gallery/9-major-grocery-chains-closing-several-locations-in-2025/l-intro-1743527302.jpg,N,,2025-04-01 16:05:43.070972

This is the third time the health care conglomerate's bankruptcy strategy has failed in court.

Facing lawsuits from 60,000 claimants, the settlement would have ended the cases and prevented new ones in the future. In a news release, Johnson & Johnson called the claims ""meritless"" and based on ""junk science."" The company said it will return to the tort system to litigate the claims.

“Today’s decision highlights the broken tort system in the United States. The Company reiterates that none of the talc-related claims against it have merit and attempts to resolve this litigation were aimed at moving past this issue,” said Erik Haas, worldwide vice president of Litigation with Johnson & Johnson. “The decision to litigate every filed case is based on the simple fact that this is a fake claim created by greedy plaintiff lawyers looking for another deep pocket to sue and fueled by litigation-financed attorney advertising.”

Johnson & Johnson claims its products are safe, do not contain asbestos, and do not cause cancer. The company stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the U.S. in 2020, switching to a corn starch product.

The company had previously reached a $700 million settlement with dozens of states that had sued the company. The settlement allowed Johnson & Johnson to deny any wrongdoing.

ID3,Albertsons,2025-04-01 16:36:09+00:00,Grocery Dive,"Kroger's road ahead runs through its past, analysts say - Grocery Dive","Sam Silverstein, Jeff Wells, Catherine Douglas Moran",,,,,https://www.grocerydive.com/news/kroger-ceo-supermarkets-grocery-mcmullen-albertsons-walmart/744098/,"“The golden age of Kroger was before Rodney took over,” said Scott Mushkin, CEO of R5 Capital, referring to Kroger’s approach to the grocery industry under David Dillon, McMullen’s immediate predecessor as Kroger’s CEO.
The company faces lawsuits from Albertsons and C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had agreed to acquire nearly 600 divested stores in connection with the deal.
Albertsons and C&S both allege that Kroger is responsible for the deal’s demise under pressure from regulators.
Albertsons and C&S are also demanding that Kroger pay them termination fees of $600 million and $125 million, respectively.
“We need that from a new leader: to be a little more specific about what the end game is.”","The last time Kroger brought on a new CEO was in January 2014. At that point, the company was riding high in the grocery industry: It was just about to close on its $2.5 billion acquisition of Harris Teeter, the tumult of the COVID-19 pandemic was still years away and Walmart had yet to assume the commanding role it now plays in the U.S. food retail sector.

A lot has changed over the past decade.

As Kroger looks for a successor to Rodney McMullen — who departed abruptly in early March after more than 11 years as the company’s chief executive — the grocer faces much less favorable circumstances that have industry experts wondering whether it can regain its former glory. Some of those conditions, like the enormous reach of competitors like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, are beyond its control, while other challenges are a direct result of decisions Kroger made when McMullen was in charge, according to analysts.

“The golden age of Kroger was before Rodney took over,” said Scott Mushkin, CEO of R5 Capital, referring to Kroger’s approach to the grocery industry under David Dillon, McMullen’s immediate predecessor as Kroger’s CEO. “If you just look at the business … I would say they’re kind of bumping along, kind of hanging on a little bit rather than thriving.”

Kroger’s challenges include recovering from its unsuccessful effort to merge with Albertsons — a transaction McMullen crafted and championed as CEO. The company faces lawsuits from Albertsons and C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had agreed to acquire nearly 600 divested stores in connection with the deal. Albertsons and C&S both allege that Kroger is responsible for the deal’s demise under pressure from regulators.

In its suit, filed in December, Albertsons claims that Kroger damaged the companies’ chances of winning approval for the merger because it was unwilling to develop more robust divestiture plans. Kroger responded with its own allegations, claiming that Albertsons worked secretly with C&S on a “misguided campaign” that led to the disintegration of the deal.

Albertsons and C&S are also demanding that Kroger pay them termination fees of $600 million and $125 million, respectively. Kroger has refused to do so, claiming that Albertsons and C&S forfeited the fees.

Under Dillon, Kroger focused heavily on basic operational details, like the length of checkout lines, customer service and store cleanliness, all of which helped the company maintain its position as a leader in the grocery space, Mushkin said. But more recently, Kroger has been less effective at communicating its value proposition to consumers than rivals like Sprouts Farmers Market and Publix, he added.

“It’s very difficult when you’re multi-banner, multi-regional, with different go-to-market strategies, to define what you are,” said Mushkin. “It's the challenge for whoever takes over Kroger: Why, as a consumer, should I shop you beyond location?”

A key issue for Kroger as it plots its future course is that its prices look more expensive to consumers than other retailers, a contrast that is exacerbated by Kroger’s dependence on promotions while Walmart has an everyday low-pricing model, said Karen Short, managing director and head of consumer and retail research for Melius Research.

“They’ve gotten themselves completely out of whack on pricing relative to their competitors,” Short said. “And I don’t know how you dig yourself out of all of that, because Walmart is increasingly giving you a reason to not go to Kroger.”

One way for Kroger to counter the perception that it charges more than Walmart for groceries would be to sacrifice its earnings for a while in order to invest in bringing down prices, Short said. However, that could prove to be a hard sell to investors given that the company’s operating profit and sales have been under pressure.

While Kroger’s stock price grew at a significantly faster clip than Walmart’s between 2013 and 2015, the trend reversed starting in 2016, with Walmart widening its lead during the past year, according to a research note Short and fellow Melius analyst Jacob Aiken-Phillips issued on March 14. On Tuesday, Short and Aiken-Phillips downgraded their rating of Kroger’s stock to “sell,” citing Walmart’s surging strength in grocery, Kroger’s leadership void and the legal actions brought by Albertsons and C&S as reasons investors should unload their shares.

Short also said Kroger’s search for a replacement for McMullen presents it with a unique opportunity to change course, adding that the company — which is currently under the leadership Ronald Sargent, who is serving as chairman and interim CEO — should look outside for a new leader.

“I think Kroger is rudderless, and they need somebody who is going to bring new blood and new life and new thought,” she said.

Speaking during an earnings call on March 6, Sargent said Kroger intends to consider candidates to replace McMullen from within its ranks and outside the company.

A new leader could likely help Kroger move past issues such as the failed combination with Albertsons and instead focus on reframing its relationship with consumers, said David Halliday, associate teaching professor of strategic management and public policy at the George Washington University School of Business.

“The time to do that is when a new CEO comes in. A new CEO can set a long-term plan, [while] an existing CEO is going to have a harder time making tough decisions like trading off profits for a viable long-term pricing strategy,” Halliday said. “The pricing strategy can't just be selling cheap food … but something that viably connects with customers and gives customers more value than they’re getting now.

Short said Kroger’s efforts in recent years to double down on its data operations and invest in the multibillion-dollar network of automated fulfillment centers it has developed with Ocado are also weighing Kroger down at a time when it needs to find ways to stand out.

Short added that Kroger’s efforts to invest in alternative profit businesses, which include its data analysis and third-party media operations, have distracted attention from weaknesses in its core grocery business. In addition, the Ocado project has cost much more than expected, she said.

As Kroger considers whom to hire to lead it going forward and how it should adjust its strategy, the company would do well to stay grounded in its roots as a supermarket operator, said Doug Munson, head of advisory services business development for retail intelligence provider RetailStat.

Although the pressure to compete head-to-head with major competitors is intense across areas like e-commerce, pricing and non-grocery revenue streams, Kroger should focus more on improving the quality and distinctive value of its core grocery business, Munson said.

Kroger is “not going to beat the Wiincos and the Walmarts on pricing, but the narrative should be, ‘When you come here, this is where you get your staples. This is your fundamental grocery store,’” Munson said.

More immediately, analysts will be looking for Kroger to clarify its vision about where it fits in the grocery landscape, said Michael Infranco, assistant vice president of Retailstat.

“We haven’t had the clearest strategies overall, the top-to-bottom strategy of what they want to be,” Infranco said. “We need that from a new leader: to be a little more specific about what the end game is.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Wp3yUqLaE8aqPwcxryVB1oqDI9JOamVLcgYr1V8GPFA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9IYXJyaXNfVGVldGVyLXN0b3JlX2V4dGVyaW9yLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-04-01 13:10:19.117291

On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce which countries and products he will target with a new round of tariffs aimed at encouraging domestic production and coaxing other nations to buy more U.S. goods.

Vietnam, which runs a $123.5 billion trade surplus with the United States, is a prime target.

Nike is one of several sportswear brands heavily reliant on Vietnam as a production site and higher tariffs would force the company to absorb higher costs or hike its prices at a time when it is already discounting some items to clear inventory.

Nike produced 50% of its footwear and 28% of its apparel in Vietnam in its 2024 financial year, according to its annual report. Rival Adidas is slightly less exposed, relying on Vietnam for 39% of its footwear and 18% of its apparel.

Live Events

The average U.S. tariff rate on footwear from Vietnam is 13.6%, while the rate on apparel is 18.8%, according to calculations based on January trade data made by Sheng Lu, professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.

""If tariffs are extended there, then Nike's got a problem,"" said Morningstar analyst David Swartz. Nike and Adidas are hardly alone. Vietnam has become a hub for high-tech running shoes, sportswear, and outdoor apparel as brands have sought to reduce exposure to China.

Lululemon, Columbia Sportswear and Amer Sports, which owns Salomon and Arc'Teryx, count Vietnam as their top manufacturing country.

But the potential tariffs come at a critical moment for Nike, which has lost market share of late to competitors viewed as fresher and more innovative, like On and Hoka. In a quarterly earnings call last month, Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said Nike's revenue was expected to continue to fall next quarter.

That outlook factored in current tariffs, said Mari Shor, senior equities analyst with Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which holds Nike shares. ""But what if it gets worse?""

INDUSTRY BRACES FOR IMPACT

Some smaller, younger sportswear brands are even more exposed to Vietnam. Fast-growing running brand On in 2024 sourced 90% of its shoes and 60% of its apparel and accessories from the country.

On shoes are already expensive, selling for $130 to $330 a pair, and Samuel Wenger, the brand's chief operating officer, said tariffs were among the factors On considers when deciding on price. ""Our premium brand gives us the ability to adapt our pricing thoughtfully,"" he told Reuters.

Average U.S. prices of sneakers have already risen by 25% since 2019, partly because of rising production costs, said Beth Goldstein, footwear industry analyst at market research firm Circana. While U.S. sales of running shoes have risen 16% to $7.4 billion since 2021, according to Circana's Consumer Tracking Service, U.S. consumer confidence recently hit a four-year low, suggesting more price increases could prove hard to swallow.

Moving production out of Vietnam is no simple matter. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia and Indonesia, could face tariffs too, and production costs are already rising there.

Factories in Cambodia are charging 5% to 10% more as they get more orders from retailers looking to shift production from China or Vietnam, said Michael Yee, CEO at apparel and accessories sourcing company MGF Sourcing in Hong Kong.

Nike, Adidas and Amer Sports declined to comment on questions about Vietnam tariffs. Lululemon and Columbia Sportswear did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. The good news, say experts, is that tariffs on imports from Vietnam - particularly for apparel - are unlikely to be as steep as those in China.

Leaders in Hanoi have taken several steps to stay in Trump's good graces, promising more imports from the U.S., lower duties, and allowing Starlink - the satellite company owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk - to offer its internet services in the country. The Trump Organization, meanwhile, is partnering with Vietnam on potential investments in hotel, real estate and golf course projects possibly worth billions of dollars.

""Vietnam has proven its ability to play the geopolitical game very skillfully,"" said T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Johannes Loefstrand, who runs a Frontier Markets Equity strategy weighted towards Vietnam stocks.

Wilbur Ross, who served as commerce secretary in Trump's first administration, said the president had generally good ties with Vietnam and had no reason to hit it hard with tariffs that would be felt on main street.

""People notice the cost of apparel because they buy it fairly frequently,"" Ross told Reuters.

Earnings calls, loved by some CFOs and dreaded by others, allow finance leaders and their fellow executives to verbalize their organization’s progress. Each month, CFO.com compiles interesting insights shared by CFOs during these calls for The CFO Earnings Dispatch series. These insights include statements about their company, analysis of financial data and answers to analysts’ questions.

For the month of March, we highlight CFO takes on tariff preparation from Lululemon, Nike, Five Below, Volkswagen, Traeger, Costco, Macy’s and Target.

1. Lululemon

Market cap: $33.85 billion

Date of call: March 27

Lululemon CFO Meghan Frank was asked about the impact of tariffs on the company’s business during the retailer’s latest earnings call. The company only sources about 3% of its products from the U.S. but says tariffs minimally impact it. Frank said her team has the flexibility to tweak internal costs or prices should tariffs exceed the impact she forecasted they would have on the business.

“In terms of tariffs, we've got approximately 20 basis points of a headwind embedded in our guidance, which is reflective of current actions on China and Mexico imports,” Frank said. “We’re closely monitoring the environment. We'll continue to look across our cost structure, as well as to pricing, you know, should the environment change. So, [we’re] definitely keeping a close eye on that.”

2. Nike

Market cap: $94 billion

Date of call: March 20

In a tough call, Nike CFO Matthew Friend provided a candid take on company performance. For reasons that have been widely speculated on, the global retailer continues to struggle as competitors grow. The company’s leadership is pushing its “Win Now” strategy and taking steps to reduce reliance on revenues from sneakers into other product lines.

When it comes to tariffs, Friend wasn’t asked about their impact by analysts and only mentioned them in his opening remarks. He said they’ve already been factored into planning and current investor guidance.

“We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. We expect Q4 SG&A dollars to be up low to mid-single digits, including restructuring charges in the prior year,” Friend said. “We will continue to tightly manage expenses while we increase investment to fuel our Win Now priorities, most notably demand creation.”

“We are focused on what we can control. And for Nike at this moment, serving athletes with new product innovation and reigniting brand momentum is what matters most. Our collective experience, as well as the early signals we are seeing with consumers, gives us confidence in the path ahead,” he said.

3. Five Below

Market cap: $4.15 billion

Date of call: March 19

As a large importer of goods from China, Five Below and its CFO, Kristy Chipman, are navigating uncertainty due to tariffs. However, she identified the retailer’s 3% same-store sales growth as a potential offset to tariff-induced costs by Q1 2026, which could improve margins by spreading fixed costs over more revenue. If they achieve this, along with continued improvement in shrinkage, it could help absorb rising costs on Chinese goods, which account for 60% of their total inventory.

“As we get into next year, if the tariffs remain the same and we get through the first quarter, sure. At that 3% comp, which is still our leverage point, we should start to improve [in Q1 2026],” Chipman said. “[One of ]the areas really that we're looking for [is] positive shrink. We're seeing improvement in our shrink rate right now. If we see that again when we count in August, there should be some benefit that we can see that will create leverage both in the back half of this year and into 2026… So, certainly tariffs make it complex right now.”

4. Volkswagen

Market cap: $54.42 billion

Date of call: March 11

Volkswagen, which is facing a range of challenges to its business, had CFO Arno Antlitz avoid going into detail on tariffs and their impacts during the company’s most recent earnings call. While the auto industry is expected to be one of the hardest hit by potential tariffs, Antlitz said it is too early to comment.

“[For our] 2025 guidance, we don't really [want to] guide on the potential impact of tariffs, much too early to say,” said Antlitz. “It's also too early to expect what our competitors will react, whether tariffs will come at all. So, this is really too early.”

5. Traeger

Market cap: $216.88 million

Date of call: March 6

CFO Dominic Blosil gave his final earnings call for Traeger as he is set to leave the grill-maker after more than a decade with the company. As both he and CEO Jeremy Andrus noted, most of the company’s components and accessories are manufactured in the United States, so they are unaffected by tariffs from a supply chain and cost standpoint. Blosil said the company’s domestic sourcing strategy should give their leaders confidence in both the integrity of their balance sheet and forecasts moving forward.

“In Q1, we've been focused on bringing in as much inventory as possible ahead of anticipatory tariffs. The increase in inventory at the end of the year is tied more to the Woodridge launch and the fact that there's continued load-in taking place ahead of peak season, which is just [our] normal seasonal inventory moves within this business as [we] think about launching new innovation, Blosil said. “I think the overarching theme here is inventory levels on our balance sheet and channel continue to be well balanced, and we feel confident in those levels.”

6. Costco

Market cap: $423.03 billion

Date of call: March 6

Costco CFO Gary Millerchip told analysts the company’s supply chain costs were slightly up due to their broader strategy on inventory and supply chain management in light of potential tariffs. The company’s strong margins also factored into this strategy. Millerchip noted that Costco’s core margin improved slightly despite rising supply chain costs. As a result, leadership is implementing a strategy of keeping inventory high to maintain competitive pricing.

“One of the things that was an increased cost during the quarter was higher supply chain costs as we have been continuing to buy more inventory, which we think will be helpful as you think about some of the unpredictability that we've seen in supply chain timing and also with the potential risk around tariffs,” Millerchip said. “And really, when we looked at the overall results for the quarter and saw that the core margin overall was going to be up slightly, we have that ability to be able to invest and ensure that we're continuing to take care of the members. So, we were quite deliberate on that this quarter.”

7. Macy’s

Market cap: $3.56 billion

Date of call: March 6

As the legacy retailer moves past accounting issues and widespread store closures, Macy’s CFO Adrian Mitchell — who will be replaced by Capri Holdings’ Thomas J. Edwards in June — spoke about inflationary pressures driven by tariffs. While CEO Tony Spring told analysts there are no pending impacts from tariffs yet, Mitchell said they are reinforcing the company’s focus on controlling internal variables.

“You know, there's a lot of changes that we're seeing day to day happening with tariffs,” said Mitchell. “We recognize the inflationary pressure. And obviously, there were some unexpected factors in the early part of the quarter with the fires and cold weather that impacted results for the business. But for the first quarter, you know, we expect that pressure to continue, and we're really focused on what we can control. The good news is that the investments that we're making in the customer experience are working, and what we're doing now is scaling those initiatives to a larger portion of our business.”

8. Target

Market cap: $47.79 billion

Date of call: March 4

Target CFO Jim Lee said he is taking a multifaceted approach to navigating tariff uncertainty. While he acknowledged the company’s historical experience sourcing at scale in volatile markets, he is also maintaining a “larger than normal” balance sheet to manage risk. Additionally, Target will no longer offer quarterly guidance to allow more flexibility if tariff-related changes arise.

""We plan to make some extra flexibility in the near term to help us navigate uncertainty regarding tariffs,” said Lee. “With a sourcing organization that's decades old, our team has a lot of experience in navigating this type of volatility. They're monitoring the situation carefully, and we expect to successfully navigate through any changes, just like we have in the past.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hq0XQ-H016hJznJlxigg981WaD09BBHTJLcQARzSuRk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy01NDcxNjc0NTBfMi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-04-01 16:05:48.209358

They were the last achieved under outgoing CEO Martin and, in an unusual move, they were released internationally before being published in France.

The fact that recorded the same revenue in France in 2024 as in 2023, €4.73 billion, might have something to do with this time lag. Especially since, as a partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Decathlon benefited from huge media exposure last year in France, and invested heavily to be visible before and during the summer. However, selling approximately 1.8 million licensed products wasn’t enough to offset the twin impact of rising inflation and the gloomy consumption outlook in France.

Decathlon’s physical stores were the most affected, since the retailer has reported a 5.78% growth in online sales, which now account for 17.5% of its business in France. These figures are sure to raise the alarm with union representatives in the country, where Decathlon is part of a retail sector that is highly concerned about shrinking store fleets.

The Decathlon group, which has over 23,000 employees in France, seems to be aware of this element, and highlighted the fact that in 2024 it increased its store fleet by three, and now operates 320 stores across its various retail concepts, having invested €160 million in upgrading its stores.

International growth

However, stagnating sales in France, Decathlon’s main market, went hand in hand with a significant increase in the group's business outside France. At constant exchange rates, Decathlon's overall revenue increased by 5.2% to €16.2 billion. The previous year, growth was 4.4%, but the 2024 fiscal year included the Olympic Games and the men’s European Football Championship, two events which are usually major growth drivers for the industry.

Howard Schultz and Starbucks stick together like glue, but his journey with the company has been far from a straight line. Schultz has stepped away and returned to the company three times over the years aiming to reshape Starbucks into a global powerhouse. His leadership, vision, and strategic decisions have defined not just Starbucks but also modern coffee culture.

The First Build: Creating the Starbucks Brand

In 1981, Howard Schultz visited a small coffee shop in Seattle called Starbucks, which at the time sold coffee beans rather than the brewed drink we know for today. Schultz was inspired by the coffee culture observed in Italy, visioning Starbucks as a ""third place"" between work and home where people could gather and enjoy high-quality espresso beverages.

After joining Starbucks as Director of Retail Operations and Marketing in 1982, Schultz left in 1985 to start his own coffee company, Il Giornale, which mirrored the Italian espresso bar experience. Two years later, he acquired Starbucks, merged it with Il Giornale, and began expanding aggressively. Under his leadership, Starbucks introduced handcrafted espresso beverages, pioneered customer-centric service, and launched an iconic brand experience. By the late 1990s, Starbucks had expanded across the U.S. and entered international markets, becoming a household name.

The Second Build: Rescuing Starbucks from Decline

In 2000, Schultz stepped down as CEO, transitioning to Chairman, and Starbucks continued expanding. However, by the mid-2000s, rapid growth had led to a decline in quality, loss of brand identity, and financial struggles. Competitors like McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts had entered the premium coffee space, and customer experience was deteriorating.

In 2008, Schultz returned as CEO to fix the struggling company. His first move was to refocus on quality and authenticity. He closed 7,100 stores for a day of barista retraining, removed inefficient automatic espresso machines, and revamped the company’s digital presence. Schultz also introduced the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, mobile ordering, and a renewed emphasis on social responsibility. His turnaround efforts revitalized Starbucks, and by the early 2010s, the company was once again thriving.

What's your go to Starbucks order?

The Third Build: A New Era and the Future of Starbucks

Schultz successfully revived Starbucks but decided to step down once again in 2017, handing the role to Kevin Johnson. If we couldn't see how much Schultz couldn't let go of the business, in 2022 he returned amid Starbucks' wave of challenges, including unionization efforts, economic shifts, and post-pandemic consumer changes.

His third tenure focused on addressing employee concerns, navigating the labor movement within Starbucks, and reinforcing the company’s commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainability. He also accelerated Starbucks' expansion into digital and drive-thru services, positioning the company for the future.

Conclusion

Digital transactions accounted for a fifth of Decathlon's total revenue, encompassing online sales, marketplace operations and digitally enabled in-store purchases.

The retailer was responsible for designing and producing the official attire for 45,000 volunteers at the Summer Olympics. It sold 1.8 million licensed products during the year.

Decathlon also recorded a notable surge in store traffic, increasing 10% in France during the Olympics and 6.7% during the Paralympics.

For three consecutive years, the retailer has managed to grow its revenue while simultaneously reducing its carbon emissions, achieving a 13% reduction since 2021.

Almost half (48.5%) of items sold in its stores in 2024 were developed using eco-friendly design principles.

Decathlon also facilitated the sale of 1.35 million pre-owned products and conducted repairs on 3 million items through its extensive network of repair workshops.

The retailer reduced its single-use plastic packaging usage by more than 53.29% during the year, slashing the figure from 2,646 tonnes down to just 1,236t.

Decathlon has also solidified its dominance in rental services, capturing half of the market share in both Italy and Spain.

In August 2024, it committed €100m ($111m) over the coming five years in India to bolster its retail presence and enhance manufacturing capabilities.

A similar investment strategy is being deployed in Germany, where Decathlon plans to allocate up to €100m by 2027 to inaugurate new stores and refurbish existing ones.

Portfolio Updates

Rimba Raya Stream: On April 26, 2024, the Company announced that it was informed that PT Rimba Raya Conservation (""PT Rimba”), the local concession holder for the Rimba Raya project, had its Forest Utilization Business License (the ""Concession License”) revoked by the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the ""MOEF”). PT Rimba challenged the MOEF’s revocation of the Concession License, and in July 2024, the State Administrative Court of Jakarta (the ""Court of Jakarta”) reached a decision on PT Rimba’s claim and declared that the revocation by the MOEF of the Concession License is void. The MOEF appealed the decision of the Court of Jakarta and in September 2024, the State Administrative High Court of Jakarta (the ""High Court of Jakarta”) upheld the Court of Jakarta’s decision declaring that the revocation by the MOEF of the Concession License is void. The MOEF submitted an appeal of the decision of the High Court of Jakarta and as such, the decision of the High Court of Jakarta upholding that the revocation by the MOEF of the Concession License is void does not yet have permanent legal force. While the appeal process is underway, the interlocutory decision issued by the Court of Jakarta on May 16, 2024, requiring the MOEF to suspend the implementation of its decree in respect of the revocation of the Concession License, will remain in place.

In October 2024, InfiniteEARTH Limited and its Indonesian subsidiary PT InfiniteEARTH Nusantara, the project operators of the Rimba Raya project (collectively ""InfiniteEARTH”) delivered a notice of intent to abandon the project (the ""RR Notice of Abandonment”). Pursuant to the RR Notice of Abandonment, InfiniteEARTH claims that a Regulation entitled Regulation of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry Number 7 Year of 2023 issued on June 14, 2023 by the Indonesian Government (""Regulation No. 7 2023”), prohibits the issuance and transfer of carbon rights from PT Rimba to InfiniteEARTH. InfiniteEARTH claims that as a result of Regulation No. 7 2023, it has been unable to economically develop or continue to operate the Rimba Raya project and that this is a force majeure event under the Rimba Raya Stream. The Company has notified InfiniteEARTH that it rejects the assertion that Regulation No. 7 2023 is an event of force majeure and has commenced an arbitration seeking, among other things, an order that the RR Notice of Abandonment is invalid or void.

In October 2024, the Company commenced an arbitration administered by the International Centre of Dispute Resolution against InfiniteEARTH in accordance with the Rimba Raya Stream; and against the shareholders of InfiniteEARTH Limited in accordance with the Strategic Alliance Agreement (the ""SAA""). The arbitration has since been bifurcated into two arbitration proceedings, dealing with (i) the Rimba Raya Stream; and (ii) the SAA.

In October 2024, the Company also issued a Notice of Action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice seeking declaratory relief against the principals of InfiniteEARTH Limited and their related entities, seeking to enforce its rights in relation to guarantees and non-competition agreements related to the Rimba Raya Stream and the SAA. Some of the defendants have counterclaimed. The dispute between the Company and InfiniteEARTH arises out of acts and omissions that the Company alleges are improper and in breach of the Rimba Raya Stream, the SAA and related agreements. Management of the Company believes that delivering the Notice of Arbitration and issuing the Notice of Action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice were important steps in preserving the Company’s legal and contractual rights.

As a result of the uncertainty of the duration and outcome of the appeal process in respect of the Concession License and the ongoing legal dispute between the Company, InfiniteEARTH and the founders of InfiniteEARTH, the Company has reclassified the status of the Rimba Raya Stream to ""Expired"". As at December 31, 2024, the Company has determined the fair value of the Rimba Raya Stream to be $nil.

Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream: In the third quarter of 2024, Fundación MarVivo Mexico, A.C. and MarVivo Corporation (collectively, ""MarVivo”) delivered a notice of intent to abandon the project (the ""MarVivo Notice of Abandonment”). Pursuant to the MarVivo Notice of Abandonment, MarVivo claims that the failure to transfer the concession rights from the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (""SEMARNAT”), Mexico’s environment ministry, to the jurisdiction of Mexico’s National Commission for Protected Natural Areas (""CONANP”), constitutes an event of force majeure and that it is no longer economical to develop or continue to operate the project. The Company’s position is that the attempt to abandon the project constitutes a breach of the terms of the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream. The Company has notified MarVivo that it rejects the assertion that the failure to transfer the concession rights constitutes an event of force majeure and that if MarVivo abandons the project or takes steps to wind-down, this will amount to a breach of the terms of the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream. As a result of the MarVivo Notice of Abandonment and the assertions of MarVivo, the Company has determined the fair value of the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream to be $nil as at December 31, 2024. The Company reserves all rights with respect to the agreements between the parties and intends to strictly enforce its legal and contractual rights under the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream.

Sustainable Community Stream: In the third quarter of 2024, the Company exercised its contractual rights to terminate the Sustainable Community Stream as a result of, among other things, the failure of the project operator, Will Solutions Inc., to meet its milestone related to the registration of its Ontario project and its failure to develop and implement the project in accordance with the project plan (including continued delays in project development activities and lower-than-expected project enrollments). As a result of the Sustainable Community Stream being terminated, the fair value of the Sustainable Community Stream was determined to be $nil as at December 31, 2024. The Company intends to strictly enforce its legal and contractual rights under the Sustainable Community Stream.

Cerrado Biome Stream: At the time of project registration, the project planned to expand the project to 80,000 hectares by incorporating more land parcels, and to generate approximately 13 million carbon credits over a 30-year project life. Enrollment of additional land parcels has been slower than anticipated, primarily due to declining demand and lower pricing for REDD+ carbon credits. As a result, the expected revenue from carbon credit sales has decreased, reducing the financial incentive for landholders to transition from agricultural production to REDD+ project enrollment. Currently, the project consists of two land parcels covering approximately 11,000 hectares, expected to generate 1.2 million carbon credits over 30 years; however, the actual number of carbon credits issued will depend on the project’s ability to attract additional landholders. Revenue shortfalls have been driven by delays in the Verra verification process and price volatility for credits issued by REDD+ projects.

Waverly Biochar Stream and Royalty: Following the accelerated payment of the final milestone payments in the second quarter of 2024, the project reached mechanical completion and first biochar production in the third quarter of 2024. However, additional technical challenges prevented continuous operation of the facility and have continued to delay full production capacity. The project is currently focused on securing additional funding to support commissioning, the initial facility audit, and the first output audit with Puro.earth. Verification was anticipated in the third quarter of 2025, with first issuance of carbon credits to follow immediately thereafter, but is now expected to be delayed.

In 2023, the Company announced an agreement to provide Microsoft Corporation with carbon credits from the Waverly Biochar Stream of up to 10,000 carbon credits per year. Under this agreement, the Company is committed to delivering a minimum quantity of credits on specified future dates. If the Company is unable to fulfill this commitment, Microsoft Corporation may request that credits be sourced from an alternative project of their choosing.

Community Carbon Stream: In 2024, the projects under the Community Carbon Stream issued over 1,600,000 carbon credits from the Mozambique cookstove project, the Uganda cookstove project, the Tanzania cookstove project, and the Uganda household safe water project. Additionally, the Community Carbon Stream generated $1.1 million in cash settlements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

On May 8, 2024, the Company amended the terms of the Community Carbon Stream resulting in, among other things, revising the Company's economic interest to provide for a tiered streaming structure which is adjusted as certain return on invested capital thresholds are achieved, and adjusting the portfolio composition and milestone payments to focus on the five strongest projects, three cookstove projects in Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda and two water purification projects in Malawi and Uganda.

Following the May 2024 amendment, the Company anticipates that the project's actual emission reductions will be materially lower than previously expected due to methodological changes and declining prices, which have reduced forecasted creditable unit deployments. Concerns over emissions reduction overestimation, additionality, and verification challenges have raised questions about cookstove credit quality, prompting methodological revisions as the market adapts to evolving buyer expectations. While these changes aim to enhance credibility, they have also reduced demand and driven down prices.

Nalgonda Rice Farming Stream: In December 2024, the Company delivered a notice to Core CarbonX Pte. Ltd. and its services provider, Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited that an event of default occurred and is continuing due to the failure of the project to reach development completion prior to June 30, 2024. While no further action has been taken at this time, the Company reserves all rights under its agreements.

The project was registered with Verra on February 10, 2025, using the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism Methodology AMS-III.AU: Methane emission reduction by adjusted water management practice in rice cultivation in the VCS program (""AMS-III.AU”). Registration and first validation of the project was delayed when Verra temporarily inactivated AMS-III.AU as part of a broader review of validation and verification quality and began developing a revised rice-specific methodology to replace AMS-III.AU. During this review, Verra determined that certain projects identified as having quality issues with validations and/or verifications would remain on hold, but Core CarbonX’s projects, including the Nalgonda Rice Farming project, were approved for registration under AMS-III.AU.

Verra released the new VCS Methodology VM0051 (Improved Management in Rice Production Systems v1.0) on February 27, 2025, which the project plans to transition to for the second monitoring period. However, the project has already applied the guidelines required under the VCS Methodology VM0051. At this time, it is not known how the transition to the new methodology will impact the project, if at all.

As of December 31, 2024, approximately 32,000 landholders were enrolled in the project, covering 36,548 hectares of farmland. Enrollment remains ongoing, with a target of expanding to approximately 62,000 hectares. However, progress has been slower than expected due to registration delays, which have also postponed farmer compensation and, in turn, affected enrollment. The project was registered with Verra on February 10, 2025.

Enfield Biochar Stream: In April 2024, Standard Biocarbon Corporation (""Standard Biocarbon”) achieved its first biochar production. However, technical challenges have delayed the commissioning process. Standard Biocarbon is working with PYREG GmbH, the engineer and builder of the PYREG Machines, to resolve these issues as it scales toward full operating capacity. The project continues to collect operational data required for a facility audit and official registration with the Puro.earth carbon credit standard. Currently, the project is on care and maintenance while seeking additional funding to support commissioning, the initial facility audit, and the first output audit.

Azuero Reforestation Stream: On May 21, 2024, the Company, Microsoft Corporation and Rubicon Carbon Capital LLC (""Rubicon”) entered into a carbon credit streaming agreement, as amended on November 23, 2024 (the ""Azuero Reforestation Stream”) with Azuero Reforestation Colectiva, S.A. (""ARC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ponterra Ltd. (""Ponterra”), for a reforestation project located on Azuero Province, Los Santos Province, Republic of Panama. Under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream, ARC will deliver 13.5% of the carbon credits created by the project to the Company. Additionally, Microsoft Corporation has entered into an offtake agreement to purchase 100% of the Company’s carbon credits delivered under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream through to 2040. Carbon Streaming will also act as the sole marketer of ARC’s carbon credits not already committed to the co-investors under the Azuero Reforestation Stream.

Under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream, Carbon Streaming, alongside Rubicon and Microsoft Corporation, will fund 100% of project costs over seven years. The Company agreed to make an upfront deposit of up to $7.1 million with $0.3 million paid on closing, and additional milestone payments made as the project achieves planting and sapling survival milestones, and will receive 13.5% of total credits, which is expected to be approximately 438,000 carbon credits through 2052.

Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream: In January 2025, the Company received a Notice of Adverse Impact from Mast Reforestation SPV I, LLC (""Mast”) and the parent company of Mast, Droneseed Co. d/b/a Mast Reforestation under the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream pursuant to which, among other things, Mast advised the Company that the Sheep Creek project has experienced significantly higher than expected mortality rates and that the surviving seedlings had exhibited slower than expected growth rates. As a result, Mast indicated to the Company that it no longer expects to deliver the Company the agreed-upon 286,229 carbon removal credits, referred to as forecast mitigation units (""FMUs”) under the Climate Action Reserve’s Climate Forward program under the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream, as Mast no longer considers the existing Sheep Creek project plan and budget to be viable. The Company has formally responded to the Notice of Adverse Impact and requested that Mast respond to the Company’s significant concerns regarding, among other things, the timing of the delivery of the Notice of Adverse Impact, and the characterization of the cause of the adverse impact. The Company is continuing to evaluate all legal avenues available under the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream. As a result, the Company no longer anticipates generating cash flow from the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream and has determined its fair value to be $nil as of December 31, 2024.

Feather River Reforestation Stream: In 2024, carbon credit market demand has generally shifted towards lower risk carbon credits. FMUs, which are designed to facilitate forward financing, inherently carry higher risk, leading to supply that has exceeded demand. FMU issuance is expected in 2025. However, given the uncertainties surrounding FMU sales, the Company has determined the fair value of the Feather River Reforestation Stream to be $nil as of December 31, 2024.

Baccala Ranch Reforestation Stream: In March 2025, Mast delivered the Company a notice of termination of the Baccala Ranch Reforestation Stream and the Baccala Ranch project, thereby confirming it will forego any plantings. The Company had not advanced any funds for the Baccala project and the closing of the Baccala Ranch Reforestation Stream remained subject to customary closing conditions.

Amazon Portfolio Royalty: Following a corporate reorganization, Future Carbon assigned its interests in the Yellow Ipe, ABC Norte and Gairova projects (collectively the ""Ecologica Portfolio”) to Ecological Assessoria Ltda. and its affiliates (collectively ""Ecologica”), and retained the Rio Madeira Project, (the ""Future Carbon Portfolio”). To reflect this restructuring, the Original Amazon Royalty was replaced on April 17, 2024, by two new royalty agreements: one between the Company and Future Carbon for the Future Carbon Portfolio (the ""FC Amazon Royalty”), and another between the Company and Ecologica on the Ecologica Portfolio (the ""Ecologica Amazon Royalty”). Each agreement carried a purchase price of $1.5 million, maintaining the original $3.0 million investment. No additional funds were advanced by the Company as part of Future Carbon’s reorganization.

Bonobo Peace Forest Royalty: The royalty agreement was originally intended to convert into a stream agreement upon successful validation and verification of the project. However, due to political instability in the DRC, weakened market sentiment for REDD+ projects, and a significant decline in demand for REDD+ carbon credits, Carbon Streaming decided to halt further investment. The Company currently has no plans to proceed with a stream agreement.

The project has been seeking additional investment to support a renewed technical effort for registration under the new Verra VM0048 methodology. Given the material uncertainty surrounding fundraising for REDD+ project development, the early-stage nature of the project’s technical development, and persistent weakness in demand for REDD+ carbon credits, the Company has determined the fair value of the Bonobo Peace Forest Royalty to be $nil as at December 31, 2024.

Strategy

Carbon Streaming is currently focused on maximizing value from the existing portfolio of investments and pursuing all options to achieve that goal. During 2024, the Company has undergone changes to the Board and management, including the termination of certain consulting contracts, which reduced ongoing cash expenditure and streamlined decision-making. The Company continues to focus on its previously announced evaluation of strategic alternatives with a focus on maximizing value for all shareholders. These alternatives could include acquisitions, divestments, corporate transactions, financings, other strategic partnership opportunities or continuing to operate as a public company.

The Company’s carbon credit streaming agreements are structured to retain a portion of the cash flows from carbon credit sales, with stream-specific retention varying. Project partners typically receive the balance through ongoing delivery payments under the terms of each agreement. Cash flows are subject to fluctuations based on realized carbon credit prices and agreement terms. As the Company continues to evaluate its strategic direction, it remains focused on optimizing portfolio economics and managing exposure to market volatility.

Outlook

Carbon Streaming continues to reposition itself for success and for maximizing shareholder value amid ongoing challenges. In May 2024, as part of its ongoing corporate restructuring first initiated in 2023, the Company announced changes to its senior management and Board after constructive discussions with certain shareholders. The Company continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for the business and remains focused on cash flow optimization through the reduction of operating expenses and a reassessment of its existing streams and royalties. Building on the previous measures implemented by the Company to reduce ongoing operating expenses, further steps have been taken in recent months, including significantly reducing employee headcount, renegotiating and amending vendor agreements to lower costs, eliminating cash-settled director’s fees to the Board and terminating certain consulting contracts. As the Company’s broader strategy continues to evolve, these recent steps are expected to result in significant reductions to annualized ongoing operating expenses when compared to 2024.

While the Company aims to increase cash flow generation through the sale of carbon credits from several streaming agreements over the next year, there remains ongoing uncertainty regarding the evolving nature of carbon markets, including potential registry delays, project-specific issues, and methodology-related risks, in addition to impacts the industry may face as a result of general economic, political and regulatory conditions. In 2024, the Company has recognized a decrease in the fair values of the Rimba Raya Stream, the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream, the Sustainable Community Stream, and the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream to $nil as a result of the failure of the respective projects to meet their obligations under the stream agreements and ongoing legal disputes. The Company is actively pursuing all available legal remedies to protect its investments and enforce its contractual rights. Given the multiple ongoing litigation matters, the outcomes remain uncertain and could materially impact the Company’s financial position and strategic direction. Please refer to the ""Legal Proceedings” section of the Company’s most recently filed MD&A for further information.

Given the evolving nature of carbon markets and ongoing legal considerations, Carbon Streaming is focussed on maximizing value from the existing portfolio of investments and pursuing all options to achieve that goal.

For a comprehensive discussion of the risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could impact the Company’s strategy and outlook, including without limitation, changes in demand for carbon credits and Indonesian developments described herein, investors are urged to review the section of the Company’s most recently filed AIF entitled ""Risk Factors” a copy of which is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

Non-IFRS Accounting Standards Measures

Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Loss Per Share

The term ""adjusted net loss” in this news release is not a standardized financial measure under the IFRS Accounting Standards and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used. These non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance, cash flows and financial position as prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards. Management believes that these non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures, together with performance measures and measures prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards, provide useful information to investors and shareholders in assessing the Company’s liquidity and overall performance.

Adjusted net loss is calculated as net and comprehensive loss and adjusted for the revaluation of carbon credit streaming and royalty agreements, the revaluation of warrant liabilities, the impairment loss on early deposit interest receivable, the revaluation of derivative liabilities, the revaluation of the convertible note, the impairment loss on investment in associate, the gain on dissolution of associate, and the corporate restructuring which the Company views as having a significant non-cash or non-continuing impact on the Company’s net and comprehensive loss calculation and per share amounts. Adjusted net loss is used by the Company to monitor its results from operations for the period.

The following table reconciles net and comprehensive (loss) income to adjusted net loss:

ID1,AB InBev,2025-04-01 07:15:46+00:00,Jersey Evening Post,Travis Perkins says construction recovery 'uncertain' as sales slide - Jersey Evening Post,Newsdesk,,,,,https://jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/uknews/2025/04/01/travis-perkins-says-construction-recovery-uncertain-as-sales-slide/,"Travis Perkins has revealed a slump in sales as weaker pricing and waning demand impacted its builders’ merchants business.
The London-listed company also revealed that profits slumped by almost a quarter during a “challenging” year due to continued weakness in the UK construction market.
Travis Perkins said the pace and rate of a recovery in the construction market is still “uncertain and will likely need further cuts to interest rates and an uplift to consumer confidence levels to stimulate a meaningful increase in demand”.
This was particularly driven by a 6.2% fall in revenues from its merchanting arm, linked to “depressed levels of UK construction activity”.
Geoff Drabble, chair of Travis Perkins, said: “Whilst uncertainty remains regarding the strength and timing of a recovery in UK construction activity, with more resources re-deployed into customer-facing roles, the group is now better placed to benefit from returning demand.","Travis Perkins has revealed a slump in sales as weaker pricing and waning demand impacted its builders’ merchants business.

The London-listed company also revealed that profits slumped by almost a quarter during a “challenging” year due to continued weakness in the UK construction market.

Travis Perkins said the pace and rate of a recovery in the construction market is still “uncertain and will likely need further cuts to interest rates and an uplift to consumer confidence levels to stimulate a meaningful increase in demand”.

It said pricing has stabilised in the merchanting operation but that sales volumes have continued to decline into the new financial year.

However, it pointed towards growth in its Toolstation business, which was buoyed by new stores.

It came as the group reported that revenues for the firm fell 4.7% to £4.61 billion in 2024 after it was impacted by price deflation and weaker trading volumes.

This was particularly driven by a 6.2% fall in revenues from its merchanting arm, linked to “depressed levels of UK construction activity”.

Meanwhile, its Toolstation business saw revenues improve by 2.5% for the year after it opened 17 new stores.

The group saw adjusted operating profits fall by 23.2% to £152 million for the year.

The company is currently searching for a new chief executive after it announced last month that Pete Redfern would leave due to ill health, six months into the role.

Geoff Drabble, chair of Travis Perkins, said: “Whilst uncertainty remains regarding the strength and timing of a recovery in UK construction activity, with more resources re-deployed into customer-facing roles, the group is now better placed to benefit from returning demand.

“This will be supported by disciplined capital allocation, focused on upgrading and protecting our core competitive advantages, and a clear customer-focused strategy owned by the leaders of the business.

“I am confident that this approach will provide attractive returns for shareholders over the medium-term.”",https://i0.wp.com/jerseyeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.34751942-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1440&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-01 03:59:31.788940
